The readers may recall that the concession tax was renewed in 2006 to help pay the costs of reducing taxes on local school property across the state, but did not bring the expected funds. However, \"The issue is not to limit business to some kind of villain,\" said Ogden, R-Brian, April 5. \"They've already paid most taxes. The question is, in my view, a tax system that is uniform, equitable and minimal.\" The readers who monitored Ogden's comment in the American Austin-State Man story asked us to check whether businesses \"pay most taxes.\" In response to our inquiry, Ogden referred to the way in which the tax system in Texas was regulated. Because the State does not have a personal income tax, Ogden said, most of the revenue from government and local taxes comes from taxes imposed on both businesses and individuals. Because business \"is the largest economic entity in the state,\" he said, it makes sense that it pays the most. We referred Ogden to a biennial report of the Government Comptroller &apos; s Office on tax burdens in Texas. The last version, published in February, forecasts the amount of sales and use taxes paid by businesses and individual consumers, concession taxes, gasoline taxes, car sales taxes, cigarette taxes, oil production taxes and school property taxes in 2013. According to the report, two taxes - the right of concession and oil production - were initially paid entirely by commercial companies. The third tax, cigarette tax, is paid entirely by consumers. The remaining four taxes are shared by consumers and businesses. The largest producers of expected revenue are taxes on school property ($11.3 billion expected to be paid by businesses in 2013 and $10.7 billion by consumers) and government taxes on sales ($9.8 billion expected to be paid by businesses and $12.1 billion by consumers). In order to obtain a total amount of dollar taxes for each category - consumers and businesses - we have collected the estimated burden imposed by each of the taxes analysed in the report. The results were close: $28.2 billion for business and $27.5 billion for consumers. Two previous reports of the Controller have calculated a slightly larger tax burden on businesses, compared to individuals, but they differ from the present report because they contain a natural gas tax but do not include taxes on cigarettes and oil production. The 2009 report, which is expected to reach 2011, estimated $30.1 billion for business and $28.4 billion for consumers. The 2007 report, which is projected for 2009, estimated $25.9 billion for business against $25.2 billion for consumers. After that, we referred to the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a business group, about the Ogden Statement. Dale Kramer, his boss, said by e-mail that the Controller's report was not considered \"the complete kindness of taxation in the state.\" We have been told by R. J. Disylva, spokesman for the Office of the Controller, that the six government taxes contained in the Agency &apos; s 2011 report - excluding school property taxes, which are collected locally - account for 86 per cent of government tax revenues in 2010. Taxes on property paid to local governments such as cities and districts are also excluded. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 On 26 January 2021, Kramer suggested that we consider what he called the most comprehensive view of business taxes, a study of the State Tax Board, a Washington-based business association representing business companies. Bill Hammond, President of the Texas Business Association, also referred to the report. The study conducted by the Economics and Statistics Unit of Ernst and Young Consulting estimates the taxes paid by businesses to state and local governments in each state in fiscal year 2008. These include: property taxes, government and local sales taxes paid by businesses on the purchase of production materials and equipment, corporate income taxes and concessions, unemployment insurance taxes, and business and company licence taxes. The study estimates that companies in Texas paid 61.2 per cent of government and local taxes. This compares with a national share of 44.1 per cent. We asked how the study was conducted. Andrew Phillips, author, told us that researchers had drawn data from several sources, including the United States Census Office, the International Tax Service and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. From another perspective on Ernest Weung's report, we moved to Matt Gardner, Executive Director of the Institute of Taxes and Economic Policy, a research branch for citizens in Washington for tax justice, which calls for fair taxation of middle- and low-income families. Gardner pointed out that Ernest Wyong &apos; s report might have overestimated the share of total property taxes paid by businesses. According to his own estimates, based on data available for 2008 from the Census Bureau, the owners of homes in Texas had paid about 45 per cent of the real estate tax in that year. Gardner said that if businesses were to pay the rest, their share would be 55 per cent, not 62 per cent of real estate taxes reported by Ernest Wyong. However, Gardner did not play much with Ogden's statement. He said, \"Maybe it's okay to emphasize that most Texas taxes are initially on non-individuals.\" Gardner and Hammond, chairman of TAB, echoed the view of Ogden that Texas businesses bear a higher than average initial tax burden because the State is one of the minority who does not have an income tax on individuals. However, the idea inherent in distinguishing between taxes on individuals and businesses is that the latter can shift their burdens to customers, employees, tenants and others. The Controller's report states: \"It should be recognized that any tax imposed directly on a company\" will eventually be passed on to consumers either through higher prices, to employees through lower wages, or to business owners and shareholders through low profits. Businesses can also pay some of their tax burdens outside the State. The amount of tax transition that occurs depends on the market in which the company operates and on other complex factors. \"The only thing that can be said for sure is that no one really knows how taxes are transferred (especially property and business taxes), according to the Controller's report. Tom Nobig, author of Ernest and Young's report, told us that \"all economists will say that the burden of taxes is not on them; it is on people.\" He referred to a national study conducted in January 2010 in which he and other researchers, using the 2005 tax data, estimated where State taxes and local trade taxes would eventually fall. The study concluded that in Texas, employers ended up keeping the bag as opposed to 4 per cent of those taxes. The rest were converted into higher consumer prices (2 per cent), lower wages (45 per cent) and persons living outside Texas (49 per cent). For Gardner, this \"final incident\" is more important than whether businesses or individuals initially pay taxes. The result: The analyses we found mainly support Ogden's claim that businesses pay \"most\" taxes in Texas, although the margin varies from a small 51 per cent (according to the State Comptroller) to 61 per cent (Earnest Wyong). However, analysts also agree that businesses - other than individuals - can eliminate their tax burden by different means. We appreciate what Ogden said most of the time.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13092"}
