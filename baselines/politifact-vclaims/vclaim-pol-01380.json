In February 2017, for example, a Twitter user tapped the image for some early-morning inspiration. \"Do sharks complain about it being Monday?\" he tweeted. \"No, they are up early, biting stuff, chasing food, being scary, reminding everyone they\u2019re a shark.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shark has shown up on Pinterest and blogs.
