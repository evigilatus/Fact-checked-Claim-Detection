No. Sensenbrenner off the mark.", "text": "On Dec. 18, 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives took a step it has only taken twice before in the history of the nation: impeaching the president.\u00a0\nThe impeachment grew out of a whistleblower complaint filed Aug. 12, 2019 that described a July 25 phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to look into activities in Ukraine by Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\u00a0\nThe complaint surfaced publicly in late September, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked for a formal impeachment inquiry just days later.\u00a0\nBut U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican who has represented a suburban Milwaukee district in Congress since 1979, claimed that more than 100 Democrats took an earlier vote to impeach.\nOn Dec. 11, 2019, Sensenbrenner tweeted an image that read: \"104 House Democrats voted for impeachment before the Ukraine call took place.\" He captioned it #ShamImpeachment.\u00a0\nMany Republicans \u2014 and Trump himself \u2014 have argued Democrats made up their minds long ago on whether to impeach the president. But Sensenbrenner\u2019s claim puts an entirely new framework on it, saying many had already voted for impeachment.\u00a0\nIs he correct? Let\u2019s unpack his argument.\nEarly impeachment talk\u00a0\nThe first proposed article of impeachment related to Trump was introduced by U.S. Reps. Brad Sherman, D-California, and Al Green, D-Texas, on July 12, 2017.\u00a0\nIt focused on Trump\u2019s firing of FBI director James Comey, who was overseeing an examination looking into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\u00a0\nThe measure never moved further than its introduction, but the tide turned when Democrats took over the House after the 2018 midterm elections.\u00a0\nSherman reintroduced the bill Jan. 3, 2019 \u2014 the day the new Congress was sworn in.\u00a0\nIt was the same day freshman Rep. Rashida Talib, D-Michigan, made headlines when she declared \u2014 at a party hosted by the liberal group MoveOn \u2014 that \"we\u2019re going to impeach the motherf*****.\"\u00a0\nGreen would bring a similar measure back several more times, but Democrats \u2014 including Pelosi \u2014 generally resisted calls to launch an impeachment inquiry.\u00a0\nThe impeachment votes that never were\nWhen asked to provide backup for Sensenbrenner\u2019s claim, his communications director Christopher Krepich pointed to three roll call votes in the House as evidence.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first, which took place Dec. 6, 2017, was on a motion to table a measure from Green calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment for \"high misdemeanors.\" The motion passed 364-58, with four voting \"present\" and six not voting, meaning any debate on the bill was suspended.\u00a0\nThe second vote, on Jan. 19, 2018, was nearly identical: A bill from Green to impeach Trump was tabled again.\nThe third vote took place just days before the Ukraine call, on July 17, 2019. Yet again, Green\u2019s bill was tabled, this time by a 332-95 vote, with one voting \"present\" and four not voting.\nIndeed, tallying the \"no\" votes from each of those roll calls and excluding those who either left or lost their seats in the 2018 midterm elections, that number comes to 103 Democrats. So, numerically, Sensenbrenner is basically right.\nBut his characterization is, well, basically wrong.\u00a0\nHis spokesman, Krepich, argued a \"no\" vote on postponing the bills equals a vote to proceed on impeachment.\u00a0\nExperts we consulted told us voting against a motion to table isn\u2019t actually a vote in favor of a resolution.\n\"In voting to oppose tabling a measure, that is literally an expression of support for continuing consideration of a measure,\" said Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, in an email. \"It is not technically a direct vote on the substance of the resolution.\"\nThat is, there never was a vote on the merits of any of Green\u2019s measures.\n\u00a0\nFrank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri, said it\u2019s more likely the votes against tabling the measures were a way of signalling support for an inquiry \u2014 not a vote \"for impeachment.\"\nTo be sure, all of the Democrats cited by Sensenbrenner ultimately voted for both articles of impeachment, which now move to the U.S. Senate for trial.\u00a0\nIlya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, said the fact that prior to the Ukraine call Democrats were thinking about impeachment doesn\u2019t have any bearing on the validity of the current impeachment.\u00a0\n\"People who supported impeaching him for his previous wrongdoing are not somehow debarred from doing so in the present case,\" Somin wrote in an email.\u00a0\nOur rating\u00a0\nSensenbrenner said \"104 House Democrats voted for impeachment before the Ukraine call took place.\"\u00a0\nHis point was that some Democrats had previously made up their minds on whether Trump\u2019s conduct in prior affairs, such as Comey\u2019s firing, were grounds for impeachment.\u00a0\nBut reality gets in the way of the rhetoric. The votes were on motions to table, not the merits of the measures. There was no actual vote on impeachment until the one that ultimately passed.\nThe definition of Mostly False is the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nThat fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16722"}
