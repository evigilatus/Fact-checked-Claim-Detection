In an interview with CNN, Reid said that George W. Bush, the Republican, was a much better president than Trump. \"There's no doubt in my mind that George Bush will be Babe Ruth in this league that he's in with Donald Trump,\" said Reid, and added, \"Donald Trump will not form the team.\" Trump fired on Twitter on February 25: \"Ex-Senator Harry Reed (he was fired) working hard to set a good course in his failed career. He led through lies and deception, only to be replaced by another camel, Crane Chuck Schommer. Some things never change!\" Former Senator Harry Reed (he's been fired) is working hard to set a good course in his failed career. He led through lies and deception, only to be replaced by another camel, Crane Chuck Schommer. Some things never change - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) on February 25, 2019 is entitled to his opinion in the term of Reid, which included 12 years as a democratic leader in the Senate (eight as the leader of the majority) and 30 years as a prosecutor. But he was wrong when he said Red was fired. (The White House did not respond to a query) Reid announced that he would not ask for another period in March 2015 when he was 75. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, he released a farewell video in which he mentioned the consequences of an almost blinding exercise in one eye. Reid pledged to serve his term in the Senate as well as his term as a democratic leader, which at that time meant the leader of the minority. He kept his promises, leaving the Senate in January 2017. This means that neither voters in Nevada nor members of his group forced him out of his seat or his leadership position. \"There's no way to describe Reed's departure as 'throwing out',\" said Stephen S. Smith, a politician at the University of Washington in St. Louis. John Ralston, a long-time journalist from Nevada, was one of many observers who called for Trump to confirm about Reid. Ralston wrote on Twitter, \"Whatever you think of Prince Harry: 1. He wasn't fired. 2. Human rights and fundamental freedoms. 12 - 17 5 He may be the most influential senator in the history of NV. 3 - Why don't you at least be creative and thank him for the nuclear option?\" The last point refers to the decision of Red Judge to abolish judicial appointments to lower courts, which was subsequently extended by Republicans to include Supreme Court nominations. Whatever you think of Prince Harry: 1. He wasn't fired. 2. Human rights and fundamental freedoms. 12 - 17 5 He may be the most influential senator in the history of NV. 3 - Why don't you at least be creative and thank him for the nuclear option? https://t.co/3Xb3Pq1Paq - John Ralston (@RalstonReports) 25 February 2019. However, Red refused to run for another term, at a time when his health - in the mid-1970s - had become a source of concern. Reid ended up retiring on schedule in January 2017, having completed his term in the Senate and as a democratic leader. We value the pants statement on the fire.
