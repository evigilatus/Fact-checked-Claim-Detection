At the time Hannity spoke, Travis County had no countywide elected Republicans while its Texas House delegation consisted of five Democrats and one Republican. In 2012, President Barack Obama carried 60 percent of the county\u2019s vote to Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s 36 percent.\nWe focused on Hannity\u2019s larger point \u2014 that the rest of Texas is conservative.\nIn Hannity\u2019s favor: No Democrat has won statewide since 1994 (when Democrats won five of 10 statewide non-judicial races). Also, no Democratic presidential nominee has captured the state since Jimmy Carter edged Gerald Ford by 129,019 votes in 1976 (a November so long ago that Donald Trump was only 30 and and Hillary Clinton had just turned 29).\nStatewide in 2012, Romney beat Obama by more than 1 million votes, carrying 57 percent to Obama\u2019s 41 percent, leaving Texas pretty darned red, per this Politico map:\n\u00a0\n\nSOURCE: \"Election Special, 2012 Texas Presidential Results,\" Politico, last updated Nov. 19, 2012\nBut contrary to Hannity\u2019s statement, Austin wasn\u2019t the only blue dot on the 2012 map. Obama won much of the traditionally stalwart-Democratic border region including El Paso County plus the urban counties of Bexar (home to San Antonio); Dallas; Harris (home to Democrat-dominant Houston); and Jefferson (home to union-strong Beaumont).\nTwo years later, Republican Greg Abbott trounced Democrat Wendy Davis for governor, doing well nearly everywhere outside the Mexico border region. Politico\u2019s map (below) shows that beyond border counties, Davis outpolled Abbott only in Travis and Dallas counties.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOURCE: \"2014 Texas Governor Election Results,\" Politico, update Dec. 17, 2014 (accessed Aug. 25, 2016)\nOtherwise, meantime, Democrats show some local strengths--and not only in Austin or near Mexico.\nAs of August 2016, when Hannity spoke, Dallas County\u2019s judge (the county\u2019s top executive position) was Democrat Clay Jenkins while five other countywide officeholders, including Sheriff Lupe Valdez, were Democrats, per the county\u2019s Democratic Party. District Attorney Susan Hawk was the sole Republican in a countywide elected post.\nIn contrast, neighboring Tarrant County, home to Fort Worth, remained a Republican stronghold; by our count, per a county Republican Party list, Republicans held all six countywide elected posts. Also, the state\u2019s most-populous county, Harris, had just one Democrat in a major countywide post--Vince Ryan, the county attorney. Ryan won re-election in 2012 along with another Democrat, Sheriff Adrian Garcia. Garcia resigned in 2015 to bid for mayor and he was replaced with a Republican, Ron Hickman, who seeks re-election in November 2016.\nBexar County, meantime, had a longtime Democratic leader as county judge, Nelson Wolff, as well as Democrats Albert Uresti, the tax assessor-collector, and Nicholas \"Nico\" LaHood, the county\u2019s criminal district attorney. Then again, voters also had in place a Republican sheriff, Susan Pamerleau, seeking a second term in 2016; a Republican county clerk, Gerard \"Gerry\" Rickhoff, who\u2019d held the office for more than two decades; and a Republican district clerk, Donna Kay McKinney.\nWe also asked the state parties to assess Hannity\u2019s claim, which by email Mike Joyce of the Republican Party of Texas called \"fair.\"\nManny Garcia of the Texas Democratic Party noted Democratic gains in some parts of the state and pointed out that when Texas voters participating in a June 2016 University of Texas poll were asked to place themselves on a seven-point scale running from extremely liberal to extremely conservative, 39 percent chose \"in the middle.\" Otherwise, 18 percent self-identified as liberal, 44 percent as conservative.\nOur ruling\nHannity said: \"All of Texas is conservative except a little bit of Austin.\"\nIf Hannity had solely singled out the state's many rural and suburban counties, he'd have a point. However, the state\u2019s border counties and biggest cities (not just Austin) lean Democratic while the UT poll showed the majority of all voters self-identify as something other than conservative.\nWe find this \"all\" claim False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.
