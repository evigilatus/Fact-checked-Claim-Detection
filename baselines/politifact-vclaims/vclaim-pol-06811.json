That would have been a problematic claim, since the final figures for growth in gross domestic product in 2014 aren\u2019t in yet. However, when we asked the White House press office for clarification, they responded that the president was making two separate claims -- first, that the economy is growing, and second, that the United\u00a0States\u00a0is\u00a0creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.\nThe first of those claims is clearly true -- except for one quarter of negative growth in the first quarter of 2014, the economy has been expanding -- but we weren\u2019t sure about the second part. So we decided to take a closer look at Obama\u2019s claim that the economy is \"creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.\"\nLooking at job growth over the course of the calendar year\nWe looked at total nonfarm employment from December of one year to December of the next, using official figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

We looked at the gain in employment between the low point in jobs and the high point (or, for the current period, the most recent month). As this chart shows, these periods of expansion were quite consistent while they lasted.\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of the three job expansions:\n\n\n\n\n\nTime period\n\n\nTotal jobs created\n\n\nJobs created per month\n\n\n\n\nMay 1991 - Feb. 2001\n\n\n24.5 million\n\n\n207,847\n\n\n\n\nAug. 2003 - Jan. 2008\n\n\n8.2 million\n\n\n152,167\n\n\n\n\nFeb. 2010 - Dec. 2014\n\n\n10.7 million\n\n\n181,220\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows that the current jobs recovery, while more robust and longer than the one from 2003-08, pales in comparison to the one that lasted from 1991-2001. Indeed, it pales in two different ways: The current job expansion has created 13 percent fewer jobs every month on average than the one in the 1990s, and it has so far lasted only half as long. The earlier expansion lasted for almost a full decade.\nOur ruling\nObama said the economy is \"creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.\" The current jobs recovery isn\u2019t perfect, but Obama is correct that it\u2019s the fastest since 1999.
