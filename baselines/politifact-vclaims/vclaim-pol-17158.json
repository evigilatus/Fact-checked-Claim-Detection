(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nWe reached out to the Postal Service about the claim.\u00a0\nSpokesperson David Partenheimer said: \"It is advisable to send money via a personal or certified check or money order, as these are traceable and a stop payment can be put on a check that doesn\u2019t arrive at its destination.\"\u00a0\nThe Postal Service doesn\u2019t prohibit sending cash in the mail, he said, and people can insure the money sent through the mail: up to $15 for cash unless it\u2019s registered mail, which requires a signature upon delivery. Cash sent via registered mail can be insured up to $50,000.\n\"If you are sending a significant amount of cash, you need to verify with your local Post Office what is considered valid proof of value before mailing the item,\" Partenheimer said. \"You should also verify that it is packaged securely enough to protect a high value item from being harmed during regular mail processing.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

It suggests that means voting by mail isn\u2019t secure.\nThe Postal Service recommends sending money using a check or money order, but it doesn\u2019t advise customers to never send cash in the mail, and the agency offers insurance coverage for cash mailings.\u00a0\nThe Postal Service also says that voting by mail is a secure way to vote.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17158"}
