A recent Facebook post claims the photo on a holiday card from U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff shows the man whose complaint spurred the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump grinning alongside the California Democrat and his family.\u00a0\n\"News ABC doesn\u2019t tell you,\" one poster wrote. \"The \u2018Whistle Blower\u2019 is dating Adam Schiff\u2019s daughter, yet he doesn\u2019t know who he is. Look at their family Christmas card. The \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 is featured proudly. You can\u2019t make this stupidity up...!\"\nBut, oh boy, you can.\u00a0\nThe Dec. 11 post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

(Also, for the record, PolitiFact cannot confirm that person is the whistleblower.)\nAlexa Schiff\u2019s boyfriend isn\u2019t the first person to be confused with the CIA officer. We\u2019ve already debunked multiple posts that claim photos of George Soros\u2019 son, Alexander, is the alleged whistleblower. Another claim, that a photo of \"Obama\u2019s White House staff\" shows the whistleblower, is also wrong.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16683"}
