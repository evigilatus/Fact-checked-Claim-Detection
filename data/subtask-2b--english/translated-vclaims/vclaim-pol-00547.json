The article states: \"Six diseases eradicated belong to refugees and illegal immigrants,\" with the alleged diseases eradicated as follows: tuberculosis, measles, pertussis, mumps, scarlet fever and bubonic plague. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There are several things wrong with this allegation. To understand, we must first discuss the meaning of the term \"elimination\" when it comes to infectious diseases. The disease is eradicated when it is eradicated worldwide. To date, only one human disease has been eradicated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization (WHO): smallpox. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the elimination of smallpox in 1980 following a global immunization campaign, and according to the CDC, no cases of smallpox have been reported naturally since 1977. (A second disease, the Rink plague, has also been eradicated, but the rink plague is spreading only among animals and not among humans.) When the incidence of a disease falls to zero in a given geographical location, such as a country or continent - rather than the world at large - viral scientists refer to the disease as \"disinfection\" rather than \"infect.\" Therefore, the disease can be eradicated in a part of the world before it is completely eradicated. Moreover, when Facebook speaks of tuberculosis and scarlet fever as having been eliminated, it is important to understand that only infectious diseases for which measures are already in place can be eradicated (for example, there is currently no scarlet fever vaccine). Even then, experts say that controlling some is much more difficult than controlling others. The Gateway Pundit on 20 January 2021 states in an article that \"the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledges its blatantly exaggerated tests of individuals testing positively for COVID.\" By Noah Y. Kim, 22 January 2021, tuberculosis is already contagious and has a vaccine, but because the pathogen requires only 10 or less organisms (hundreds or thousands), it is slow to grow, and it may take several months to appear in a laboratory test. So not only has tuberculosis not been eliminated as the prosecution says, but it is in fact very difficult to eradicate it. Third, of the six diseases listed in this problematic Facebook article, only one - measles - is on the CDC's list of current outbreaks. Measles have never been eradicated, but the \"demobilization\" of the United States was announced in 2000. However, the recent resurgence of the disease has attracted many headlines. Bird scientists at the current US CDC, which includes the largest number of cases since 1992, are attributed to travellers (not necessarily immigrants) and those who refuse vaccination: \"The United States experienced 17 outbreaks in 2018. In most cases, three cases were contributed in New York State, New York City and New Jersey, respectively. Cases in those states occurred primarily among uninhabited persons in Orthodox Jewish communities. These outbreaks were associated with travellers who returned measles from Israel, where there was a large-scale outbreak. 82 people brought measles to the United States from other countries in 2018. This is the largest number of cases imported since measles was eradicated from the United States in 2000. &quot; Amy Rowland, a World Health Division spokesman for the Centre for Disease Control, also told Politifact immigrants and refugees not to blame outbreaks. \"No, neither immigrants nor refugees cause these outbreaks,\" said Roland. \"It relates to travel and to persons who are not under-infested or vaccinated. It has nothing to do with illegal immigrants.\" Our article on viral social media claims that six eradicated diseases belong to \"refugees and illegal immigrants.\" First, world health leaders have declared the elimination of one human disease only ever, not six. There is no evidence to support the suggestion that undocumented refugees and migrants bear responsibility for any disease to which they return. We're assessing this infectious teacher is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00547"}
