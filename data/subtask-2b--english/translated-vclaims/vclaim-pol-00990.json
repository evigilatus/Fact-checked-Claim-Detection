Cabito tweeted, \"Prior to the success of federal, state and local efforts, preliminary statistics show that opium overdose deaths declined by 8.5% in West Virginia. Great news!\" Thanks to the success of federal, state and local efforts, preliminary statistics show that opium overdose deaths declined by 8.5% in western Virginia. Great news! https://t.co/uICcVlU7vZ - Chile Moore Cabito (@Sen Capito) 22 January 2019. Are these statistics correct? The Cabito office did not respond to several inquiries, but we were able to find data that addressed the question. Her tweet links her to an American article today about recent opiate data published on the same day as the tweet. This article is accompanied by a related article summarizing the data collected by individual countries by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to this collapse, the number of overdose deaths predicted by West Virginia for 12 months decreased from 1,047 in 2017 to 958 in 2018. That's a 8.5 percent drop, as Capito said. However, we should note some warnings. First, different pieces of CDC data actually show a stronger decline in West Virginia. State-wide preliminary data on overdose deaths over 12 months show a 18.7 per cent decrease in reported deaths between July 2017 and July 2018, and a 32 per cent decrease in projected deaths over the same period. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. By Warren Fisk: January 20, 2021, the second decline of 8.5 percent refers to overdose deaths from all medicines, not \"opedic overdose death,\" as Capito said. The report does not detail the data on opioid deaths by state. However, other data show patterns of different drugs, which help to complicate Capito's optimism. A report by the Centre for Disease Control detailing the annual figures for 2016 and 2017 found that in West Virginia, there was a reduction of approximately 13 per cent between those two years in overdose deaths of opiates. However, during the same period of time, deaths from all opioids, including heroin and methadone, increased by more than 14 per cent, and deaths from synthetic opioids other than methadone increased by more than 42 per cent. In other words, the reduction in deaths from prescription opioids masks the rapid rise in deaths from all opioids and synthetic opioids during that period. \"The epidemic of overdoses of opiates continues to worsen and evolve owing to the continuing increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids,\" the Committee for Disease Control, according to an article published on 28 December 2018 in the Herald Register of Beckley, W. Va. The Governor, Cabito, wrote on Twitter, \"through successful efforts at the federal, state and local levels, preliminary statistics indicate that deaths from overdoses of opiates decreased by 8.5 per cent in West Virginia.\" This figure appears in an article on the United States of America today summarizing the data of the CDC, and other data on the CDC show more severe declines. This is the good news. However, Cabito miscalculated the figure as an overdose of opiates in particular, rather than an overdose of all drugs. In addition, a more detailed analysis shows that while deaths from overdoses of prescription opiates have decreased, deaths from overdoses of synthetic opiates are rising. This suggests a more complex view of the State &apos; s overall overdose problem. We evaluate the statement half right.
