He argued before the court on Texas\u2019 behalf in a past job as the state\u2019s solicitor general.\nIn the interview, Cruz told Steve Inskeep, who hosts NPR\u2019s Morning Edition program, that the court\u2019s ruling imposed \"elitist radical views,\" short-circuiting the ability of each state to define marriage.\nInskeep asked if Cruz would encourage officials who disagree with the ruling to ignore or defy it. State officials \"cannot ignore a direct judicial order,\" Cruz said. \"The parties to a case cannot ignore a direct judicial order. But it does not mean that those who are not parties to case are bound by a judicial order.\"\nINSKEEP: \"Did I understand you to say just now that as you read the law, as you read our system, this decision is not binding on the entire country, only to the specific states that were named in the suit.\"\nCRUZ: \"Article III of the Constitution gives the court the authority to resolve cases and controversies. Those cases and controversies, when they're resolved, when you're facing a judicial order, the parties to that suit are bound (by) it. Those who are not parties to the suit are not bound by it. Now, in subsequent litigation, other courts will follow the precedence of the court, but a judicial order only binds those to whom it is directed, those who are parties to the suit. That's the way our litigation system works.\" (See fuller excerpts of this part of the interview here.)\nWe alerted Cruz\u2019s campaign to this fact check and didn\u2019t hear back.\nLegal experts\nSeparately, several legal experts told us the idea that states not party to the marriage cases weren\u2019t bound by the court\u2019s ruling may have technical merit, but that\u2019s all.\nRichard Fallon, a Harvard specialist in constitutional law, said by email that under the doctrine of precedent, \"any official who failed to issue gay marriage licenses would be sueable for failure to do so, and any court in which the suit was filed would be obliged to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s gay marriage ruling. \u00a0In the long run, non-compliance thus amounts at most to a delaying tactic. \u00a0And there are lots of complicated questions about whether officials should regard themselves as obliged to do what they know a court would order them to do if they were sued \u2014 even if they are not technically bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. \u00a0But on Senator Cruz\u2019s technical point, he is probably correct, if you understand it as being only a very limited, technical point about a delaying tactic.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, Lynn Wardle, a law professor at Brigham Young University who has advocated that the Constitution leaves it to legislators to stipulate who may marry, called Cruz\u2019s statement \"precisely correct.\" Entities not party to a suit are not bound by the resulting judicial order, Wardle said by email, adding: \"That\u2019s the way our litigation system works.\"\nOnly parties before the court are bound by its judgment and orders, Randy Barnett, a professor of legal theory at the Georgetown University Law Center, said by email, but all other courts are bound to follow the court (which Cruz hinted at). So, Barnett wrote, \"it is futile for states who are not parties to resist. More importantly, when a ruling is clear, ignoring the Supreme Court's decisions until a court directly orders them to obey undermines the rule of law. Bad people say \u2018we won't obey the law until you make us.\u2019 Unless they are engaged in justified civil disobedience \u2014 in which case they are liable to be punished \u2014 good people follow the law before they are directly commanded.\"\nIf nonparties to the suits don\u2019t go along with the ruling, he said, \"they are postponing the inevitable and flouting the rule of law that was announced by the Court.\"\nStephen Vladeck, an American University law professor, called Cruz\u2019s statement \"literally true, but deeply misleading. Technically, the only parties that are bound by a ruling by the Supreme Court are the parties to that litigation \u2014 and so, in the context of the marriage cases, the small subset of states whose bans on gay marriage were before the Court.\n\"But the way our system works,\" Vladeck emailed, \"every state and federal court is ultimately subject to the supervision of the Supreme Court at least where federal law is concerned. That\u2019s why those courts generally apply the Constitution as it has been interpreted by the Justices in Washington; if they don\u2019t, they\u2019re likely to be reversed.\" Asked if Wardle had a point saying Cruz was precisely correct, Vladeck said that read is misleading in that states still have to go along with such a ruling, absent a good-faith reason not to.\nIn the \"immediate aftermath of a decision like this one, when there is no reason to think the Supreme Court would answer the question any differently were a different state a party to the suit,\" Vladeck said, \"it\u2019s unreasonable for a state official or state court to decline to follow that ruling. They\u2019re not literally bound to do so (and, thus, can\u2019t be held in contempt for failing to do so), but they are practically bound by dint of the Supreme Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction.\"\nBy phone, Susan Sommer, the lead lawyer for Lambda Legal in the suits that reached the Supreme Court, suggested that \"only in the very most technical and hair-splitting way could it be said that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling is not immediately and directly binding on every state government and government official in the country.\" Sommer said she knows of no legitimate school of thought that could say the ruling doesn\u2019t apply to all the states. \"It\u2019s sort-of Law School 101,\" Sommer said.\nWe also heard back from SCOTUS Blog reporter Lyle Denniston, who\u2019s covered the Supreme Court for more than 50 years.\nThe Constitution\u2019s Article III, Denniston said by email, limits the authority of federal courts to actual cases or controversies, so the outcome is between the actual litigants, as Cruz said.\nThen again, he said, \"the Supreme Court since 1803 (Marbury v. Madison) has claimed the authority to \u2018say what the law is\u2019 constitutionally, and its conclusions on what the Constitution means in a given case are made binding across the land, as a result of the reinforcement of its authority by the Supremacy Clause of Article VI\" of the Constitution.\nDenniston further said: \"The Supreme Court, in the 1958 decision in Cooper v. Aaron (the Little Rock high school integration case), said explicitly that the combination of the Marbury decision and Article VI made the Supreme Court's decisions binding on the states. That decision, by the way, is the only\" one \"in history where each of the nine Justices explicitly signed the opinion to give it more force.\" Article VI says the Constitution shall be the \"supreme Law of the Land\" with judges bound to it along with legislators and executive and judicial officers, state and federal.\nOur ruling\nCruz said states not directly involved in the gay marriage lawsuits that reached the Supreme Court \"are not bound\" by the court\u2019s ruling.\nHe has a thread of a point in that only four states were directly involved in the case. But that\u2019s an incomplete answer to the question of whether states could ignore the court\u2019s ruling. Other courts would be bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent, making the ruling applicable throughout the nation. That\u2019s a fact that Cruz alluded to only after being pressed by the interviewer for clarification of his earlier misleading statement.\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06128"}
