U.S. producers were doubly hit since numerous studies showed the U.S. companies primarily paid for the U.S. tariffs.\nThe toll on farmers was heavy enough the federal government created the Market Facilitation Program, which paid out more than $14 billion to farmers in 2018 and 2019 to mitigate the impact of the trade wars.\nFarm bankruptcies rose\nAmid this environment, farm bankruptcies did rise in 2019 \u2014 the point where you\u2019d expect to see a spike given the trade battles occurring at the time.\nThat year, 595 family farmers filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcies nationwide, up from 498 filings a year earlier, Reuters and others reported. Chapter 12 is a bankruptcy code created during the 1980s farm crisis to allow family farmers and small fishing operations to keep operating while they work out plans to repay lenders.\nWisconsin led the nation with 57 bankruptcy filings, 16 more than any other state.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut experts say you can\u2019t draw a dark line between the trade wars and the rise in bankruptcies.\nThough the jump from 2018 to 2019 was the largest in recent years, bankruptcies have been rising for a while.\nAfter Chapter 12 bankruptcies dropped from 723 in 2010 to 361 in 2014, the number has steadily grown since.\n\nFarm bankruptcies did drop slightly in the first half of 2020 \u2014 the total of 284 was down 10 from the same period in 2019 \u2014 but that was \"due in large part\" to government payments made to farmers as part of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.\nRELATED: Dems exaggerate in slamming Trump farm bailouts as \"handout for large agricultural companies\"\nIn addition, trade wars are far from the only factor at play for farmers in Wisconsin and nationwide.\nReuters described it this way:\nThe increase in (2019 bankruptcies) had been somewhat expected, bankruptcy experts and agricultural economists said, as farmers face trade battles, ever-mounting farm debt, prolonged low commodity prices, volatile weather patterns and a fatal pig disease that has decimated China\u2019s herd.\nJohn Newton, chief economist at the Farm Bureau, cited many of the same factors in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\"The farm bankruptcies are a function of not only retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agriculture by China, but also years of low commodity prices created by a global economic slowdown and large supplies of grains, oilseeds and livestock products internationally and recent natural disasters,\" Newton said in an email. \"I don\u2019t think you can lay the blame of higher farm bankruptcies on the retaliatory tariffs alone.\"\nOur ruling\nSpeaking in Manitowoc, Biden said Trump started a trade war that \"led to a surge in farm bankruptcies.\"\nThe trade wars have indeed hit farmers hard. And bankruptcies rose at the height of the trade wars, increasing more than they had in the four prior years.\nBut this claim oversimplifies by listing the trade wars alone as being responsible for that increase.\nWe define Half True as a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
