Well, the elections were held 7 months ago and he won, but no celebrity kept the promise,\" the post said. (The presidential election was held more than seven months ago, Nov. 8, 2016).\nThe article speculated on Cher\u2019s relocation, even though the headline presented a more affirmative claim.\n\"However, singer Cher may be the first to move to Canada because of the President. As Trump announced he wants to change the Obamacare, she took it to Twitter to express her anger,\" the post said.\nSeveral celebrities did say they would leave the United States, including to Canada, if Trump was elected. On her part, Cher joked she would move to another planet, Jupiter.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reply to a Twitter user, Cher wrote on June 16, 2015, the day Trump announced his candidacy: \"IF HE WERE TO BE ELECTED,IM MOVING TO JUPITER \ud83d\ude16\"\nWe reached out to the singer via social media for comment but did not get a response. Cher\u2019s website lists a series of upcoming performances in Las Vegas and Washington for the rest of the year. And while her Twitter feed features a series of tweets criticizing Trump and his policies, a search of the word \"Canada\" in her tweets did not yield any message saying she had moved up north.\nCher also attended the Women\u2019s March on Washington on Jan. 21. \"I want to let people know that I'm here for them and I believe in this movement,\" Cher told the Los Angeles Times.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that conservativearmy88.com\u2019s website does not have any information identifying who runs it, its mission, where it\u2019s based or other information that credible news organizations publish on their website.
