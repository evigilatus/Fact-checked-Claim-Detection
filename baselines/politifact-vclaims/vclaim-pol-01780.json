Joe Crowley in a New York primary race, has some ideas on how to finance programs that she supports, such as Medicare for All.\nIn a recent interview with the Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah, she said Congress should cut frivolous defense spending to pay for a wider social safety net.\n\"Just last year we gave the military a $700 billion dollar budget increase, which they didn\u2019t even ask for,\" Ocasio-Cortez said July 26. \"They were like, we don\u2019t want another fighter jet! Don\u2019t give us another nuclear bomb. They didn\u2019t even ask for it. And we gave it to them.\"\nDid the military get a $700 billion dollar raise \u2014 that they didn\u2019t even ask for?\nFirst off, Ocasio-Cortez fudged the figures, which her campaign acknowledged in an email.\nCongress gave the military a $61 billion increase from fiscal year 2017 to 2018. The total military budget for 2018 was $700 billion. That includes the Department of Defense and elements of other agencies, chiefly Energy Department programs pertaining to nuclear weapons.\nFor 2018, that\u2019s more money than President Donald Trump\u2019s budget requested (roughly $668 billion). The 2019 spending level, $716 billion, is exactly what Trump requested.\nThrough its Office of Management and Budget, the White House negotiates with the Defense Department to determine a budget. But settling at a lower number doesn\u2019t mean military leaders don\u2019t want more money, said Susanna Blume, senior fellow of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the budget, each military branch (Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force) submits an annual list to Congress of items they want but were not able to include in the annual budget request for perceived lack of budgetary wiggle room.\nThat wish list would have pushed the budget request to\u00a0$700 billion in 2018.\nWhen Defense Secretary James Mattis testified before the House Armed Services Committee on Feb. 6, 2018, he echoed that request. (The fiscal year 2018 budget became law March 23.)\n\"Failure to modernize our military risks leaving us with a force that could dominate the last war but be irrelevant to tomorrow's security,\" Mattis said. \"We need Congress to lift the defense spending caps and support the budget for our military of $700 billion for this fiscal year and $716 billion for next fiscal year.\"\nObama usually requested more money than Congress granted (unlike Trump, whose proposed 2018 budget was upped by Congress). But Blume said it\u2019s not unusual for things to shake out in this way, either.\nOur ruling\nOcasio-Cortez\u00a0said, \"Just last year we gave the military a $700 billion dollar budget increase, which they didn\u2019t even ask for.\"\nThat\u2019s the total defense budget for 2018, which marks an increase in $61 billion from 2017. (Her campaign acknowledged this point.) It is more than\u00a0the Defense Department settled in negotiations for Trump\u2019s budget request ($668 billion), but exactly what they requested in their annual wishlist to Congress.\nWe rate this statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-08-01 15:54:28 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Just last year we gave the military a $700 billion budget increase, which they didn\u2019t even ask for.\"    Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Candidate for U.S. Congress from New York https://www.cc.com/video-clips/jzbxb9/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-alexandria-ocasio-cortez---bringing-moral-courage-to-american-politics---extended-interview   In an interview on \"The Daily Show\" Thursday, July 26, 2018 2018-07-26    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01780"}
