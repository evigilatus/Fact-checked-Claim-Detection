The cemetery doesn't close the gates until it arrives every night. His name is Captain. He sleeps at his master's grave every night. \"Simper Faye!\" The article contains an American code and the word \"I hope to have only one share.\" I have received more than 25,000 times, and it has been referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That's because it's not everything it looks like in the mail. There was a dog named Capitan sleeping on his owner's grave, according to the Argentine newspaper Lavuz del Inner, but the dog was not the picture. In 2012, the newspaper stated that Villa Carlos Paz, an idiot named Capitan, who was described as having a German shepherd, disappeared after the death of his owner, Miguel Guzm\u00e1n, in March 2006. They thought that the dog died until the widow of Guzman and his son went to the cemetery about 15 blocks away and found Kapitan there. The dog did not follow them, but stayed in the cemetery, according to Laface. On the following Sunday, the dog walked home with them \"but then returned to the cemetery,\" quoted to win from the Guzm\u00e1n widow. The captain sometimes visited the house but \"returned to the cemetery,\" quotes the son of Guzm\u00e1n as saying. The Facebook newspaper published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman on January 12, 2021, stated that she confirmed the story with Hector Bakega, the mayor of Villa Carlos Paz. The cemetery staff saw Cabitan enter the cemetery for the first time in January 2007. A video with the news story shows the captain to be black with tan marks. \"Every day, at 6:00 p.m., he goes and lies in front of that grave,\" Capitan was walking with me in the cemetery every day. But when that time comes he goes to the bottom, where his master's grave is.\" In February 2018, more than a decade after Miguel Guzman died, Cabitan also died, according to La Paz. He lived in the cemetery among other stray dogs, but he spent nights in his master's grave, as the newspaper says. In August, Carlos Paz presented for the first time a dog memorial in the cemetery. We don't know the origins of the picture presented in Facebook, but it appeared on sites like Reddit, where it was shared in 2017 under the title: \"She must have been a good person. Dogs are something else.\" After being posted on Imgur.com a few days later, a user commented: \"FYI, this is from the Facebook article that made it clear that the dog moved from spot to spot, without preserving any specific tombstone company.\" This Facebook article seems to confuse truth with fiction. It is said that a dog named Cabitan was sleeping at the tomb of his deceased owner every night. But it was a mixture of the black German shepherd - not very similar to the yellow lab photographed in the picture - and apparently spent most of his time in the cemetery, not in reaching the cemetery gates every night. All of this happened in Argentina, not in the United States. So while the United States Navy emblem of Simper V or \"always faithful\" may apply, the \"American code\" does not apply.
