It's hard to say.", "text": "If there is one case bringing together Republicans and Democrats, it is the Rupocal case. The automatic calls that flooded the voters &apos; phones prompt Congress to take action. During the summer, H.R. passed through the House of Representatives. 3375, Law on Cessation of Bad Seizures, by vote of 429-3. This Act amends the Communications Act 1934 to clarify laws prohibiting automated calls, and establishes technology to prevent future calls. In a news release issued on 9 August, the United States Republic of America supported Vicky Hartzler, from R-Harrisonville, this law, claiming that \"the Rubokal is preying on the most vulnerable among us, including the elderly. \"Statistics indicate that Americans have been subjected to 29.3 illegal appeals so far this year, representing an increase of 64 percent since 2016,\" by Hartzler. The spokesman for Anna Sweek said that the Hartzler statement contained a typographical error. She meant to say 29.3 billion roubles is illegal. This is so crazy. Sweek noted that a news release of 24 July included the word &quot; billion &quot;. But there are other wrinkles: How many are truly illegal? Any telephone call containing a registered message instead of a live person is automatically deemed to be a communication according to the Federal Trade Commission. If the recipient of the call does not agree to receive it, the appeal shall be considered illegal. So contacting robots reminds you of the doctor's appointment is probably okay; a person who promises you wealth from a foreign prince may not be. Devin Nunes reported on January 10, 2021 in an interview on \"The Republicans have no means of communication\" after the Barler tech companies were cut off. \u2022 On January 13, 2012, we decided to take a closer look at the issue of contact with Robolis and see if the Hartzler Statement, which contains $29.3 billion, was to be implemented pending. In her newsletter, Hartzler used numbers from the Robocal blockage application called Youmail, which was cited in the H.R. report. 3375. But there's a big difference between Hartzler's and Dimell's numbers, and that's the use of the word \"illegal.\" The Executive Director of Yumille (Alex Kiliki) said that the application tracked the calls made by 10 million users and used their area codes to cross-check data for the entire country and specific states. The application then supplements the data to an automatic phone indicator. However, this application does not distinguish between illegal and legal robotics. In fact, your mail data are 29.3 billion calls from January to the end of July. The mail gives four categories of calls: alerts, payment notes, frauds and telemarketing. So, you can guess that frauds are illegal. But Hartzler's claim didn't break it. Other databases indicate that automated calls are a problem, but the figures vary among government agencies. According to the report of the House of Representatives, the Federal Communications Commission received 232,000 complaints concerning automatic communication in 2018. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported 4.1 million complaints relating to Robokl in 2018. Comparison of daily data and federal data are not exactly apple apples. You track all automated calls received by users of their applications, while the Fair Competition Commission and the Fair Trade Commission collect only complaints. These reports can give some sense of problem, but exclude persons who do not file complaints or use anti-telephone applications. Our verdict, Hartzler, stated that the Robocal targets the elderly, and that the Americans have been exposed to 29.3 illegal people this year. When asked, her Office amended the statement to 29.3 billion. She said these were illegal calls. Some may be, but not all of them. Because of this major difference, we assess this claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00140"}
