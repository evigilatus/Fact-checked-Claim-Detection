Fred Risser says Senate President Michael Ellis broke Senate rules by cutting him off during debate over a photo ID bill", "text": "Wisconsin\u2019s state Senate has probably generated more headlines in the past four months than any time in state history.\n\nDemocratic senators skipping town for weeks, warrants issued for their arrest, recall elections for up to nine senators and the disintegration of decorum for even routine business. And this is in the Legislature\u2019s more formal, \"deliberative\" body.\n\nTake, for instance, the May 19, 2011 vote on a bill to require voters to present photo ID at the polls. Long-sought by Republicans, bitterly fought by Democrats, the measure was certain to stir an emotional debate.\n\nAnd it did.\n\nThe vote ended with a shouting match about the rules of the Senate between the state\u2019s two most veteran lawmakers: Sen. Fred Risser, D-Madison, vs. Sen. Michael Ellis, R-Neenah. Between the two of them, they have a more than 90 years experience in the Capitol.\n\nBut only one of the two -- Ellis -- held the gavel.\n\nAnd that meant the upper hand.\n\nIn the heat of the debate, Risser became angry when Ellis, the Senate president, started a roll call vote while Risser was speaking on the Senate floor.\n\n\"You\u2019re not following the rules, Mister President,\" Risser yelled.\n\nEllis shouted back: \"Read the book!\"\n\nHe hammered the gavel and the roll call vote was taken, over shouts of foul play from Democrats. The bill passed 19-5 and was signed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nBut what of Risser\u2019s claim that Ellis violated the Senate rules? Let\u2019s open up that book Ellis was talking about.\n\nSenate rules govern \"such things as committee activities, bill introductions, order and conduct in debate,\" according the Senate chief clerk\u2019s website. But they are not permanent. Senators meet at the beginning of the two-year legislative session and set the rules for their body. What\u2019s more, the rules allow some things, such as terms of the debate, to be set along the way.\n\n\"The rules are extremely important to preserve the decorum and the dignity of the Senate,\" said former Senate President Alan Lasee, R-De Pere, who retired last year after 36 years in the Legislature.\n\n\"It\u2019s the difference between anarchy and order,\" said former Sen. Mordecai Lee, D-Milwaukee, now a professor of governmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.\n\nOn May 17, 2011, the Senate opened 13 hours of debate on the bill -- largely Democrats speaking against the bill. It ended in the early morning of May 18. The next day, May 19, the measure was up for a final vote. On that morning, Republicans changed the rules for that single bill, about an hour before debate began. They voted to end debate after one hour. Senators were aware of that rule change before the debate began.\n\nThe Senate convened and Democrats took turns speaking against the bill, with the clock running and being carefully watched by Republicans. Shortly before the hour was up, Risser was recognized and took the floor. He was reminded by Sen. Neal Kedzie, R-Elkhorn -- who was temporarily serving in the chair -- that he had four minutes left.\n\nRisser gave a meandering talk, discussing a change of address issue with his own driver\u2019s license and appeared to be killing time. With 15 seconds to go Ellis, back in the chair, gave the warning: Time is almost up.\n\nAt the stroke of 11, Ellis ordered the roll call be taken, even though Risser was still speaking.\n\n\"You\u2019re out of order. Take your seat,\" Ellis told Risser. \"Continue the roll call.\"\n\nAfter the vote, Risser declared in a news conference: \"Never in the 55 years that I have served have I seen the type of procedure, or lack of procedure, that has been followed in this house.\"\n\n\"In the middle of someone\u2019s talk, they decided to shut me off,\" he said.\n\nSo, that\u2019s what happened. Now lets get back to the rules.\n\nDebate has been limited only two other times in recent Senate history. It last happened in 2003 on the state budget and 1995 on welfare reform, according to Senate officials. Republicans were in charge both times -- but both parties agreed to limit debate.\n\n\"It\u2019s incredibly unusual to amend the rules for one day,\" Lee said.\n\nHe also said it\u2019s rare that a senator is cut off when he is speaking from the floor.\n\n\"He did have the floor legally,\" Lee said. \"I think what Mike (Ellis) did was unusual and arguably wrong.\"\n\nBut the fact something is unusual does not necessarily mean any rules were broken.\n\n\"He knows the rules,\" said Lasee of Risser. \"Everything I learned about being Senate president, I learned from Fred.\"\n\nIn an interview, Risser backed away from his claim that Ellis violated the Senate rules.\n\nRather, he said, \u00a0Ellis violated a less-precise set of rules -- the rules of common decency.\n\nSaid Risser: \"I can\u2019t remember any time when there was an arbitrary time limit to stop discussion and to stop a person from discussing.\"\n\nBut that\u2019s not what Risser claimed at the time -- and Emily Post was not available for a consult on manners.\n\nIndeed, if she were, there would be plenty more to look at:\n\nRisser said Ellis also broke the rules by ignoring a motion to adjourn shouted out by Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-Middleton. Under the Senate rules, that motion takes precedence over all others. There was one problem with that tactic: Ellis never \"recognized\" Erpenbach to give him the floor and the motion was not formally made.\n\n\"You had nine guys yelling at me and no one got recognized. How do you recognize nine guys?\" Ellis said.\n\nHe had his own list of violations committed by the Democrats: shouting during a roll call, refusing to vote and leaving the Senate floor during a vote.\n\nFor his part, Ellis said it was no accident that Risser, the longest-serving lawmaker in the nation, was speaking when the hour was up: \"They wanted the 40-year veteran in the chair -- me -- versus the 50-year veteran. How dare you cut him off?\"\n\nWhat\u2019s the bottom line?\n\nRisser\u2019s claim that Ellis broke the rules made for some drama after the voter ID bill passed, but the vote result itself was a foregone conclusion. When he was asked later, Risser pointed to the unwritten rules of common decency.\n\nBut his claim focused on the written rules of the Senate, which allow for the parameters of debate to be set by a majority vote. It\u2019s rare, but permissible. And that\u2019s what happened here.\n\nWe rate Risser\u2019s claim False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12985"}
