Susan Collins lobs false \u2018defund police\u2019 attack on Sara Gideon", "text": "Some top Republicans who have alleged that top Democrats want to defund the police have fared poorly on our Truth-O-Meter.\nWe rated False President Donald Trump\u2019s claim that Joe Biden wanted to defund the police. And an attack by U.S. Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., against her Democratic challenger, Mark Kelly, caught Pants on Fire.\nNow comes a more targeted attack in another pivotal Nov. 3 race, the Senate contest in Maine pitting Republican Sen. Susan Collins against Democrat Sara Gideon.\u00a0\nCollins alleges in an ad that Gideon \"voted to defund\" the police in the Maine town of Freeport \"and gave the money to a nonprofit she helped run.\"\nBoth parts of this defund claim fail, too:\n\n\nCollins cherry-picked a Gideon vote for consolidating Freeport\u2019s police dispatch services with a neighboring town\u2019s, resulting in savings to Freeport.\n\n\nGideon didn\u2019t give money to the nonprofit for which she served as a board member. Unrelated to the dispatch issue, she joined in a town council vote to forgive part of a loan to the nonprofit.\n\n\nA tossup race\nCollins has been a senator since 1997. Gideon has served in Maine\u2019s state House since 2013 and as its speaker since 2016. She served as a Freeport Town Council member from 2009 to 2013.\u00a0\nMany news accounts say the race is one that could determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats.\nThe Cook Political Report has rated the race a tossup. It is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.\nWhat is \"defunding the police\"?\nPolice departments generally allocate most of their budgets to salaries, and what\u2019s left over is used for equipment, training and community-oriented programs.\nIn the movement to defund police, some activists want to eliminate police departments entirely, while others want to reexamine the functions of police departments and redirect some of their funding to other community services. But the Collins ad misused the term \"defund\" to describe a budget move that\u2019s not related to that movement at all.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA vote to save money on policing isn\u2019t necessarily defunding the police. Gideon has stated \u2014 at a debate, in a clip used by the ad itself \u2014 that, like Biden, she does not support defunding the police.\nPolice funding\nGideon was part of a 5-2 majority on the Freeport Town Council that voted in May 2010 to fully consolidate police dispatch services with another town, Brunswick, saving an estimated $73,750 in Freeport\u2019s 2011 budget.\u00a0\nBrunswick was already handling the dispatch for Freeport\u2019s 911 calls; the 2010 vote added non-emergency dispatch. The vote didn\u2019t change the number of police officers on the streets.\nGideon\u2019s campaign cited minutes showing Gideon voted for annual town budgets that raised police funding. The 2013 town budget provided $192,000 more in police funding \u2014 totaling the general police, special enforcement and police dispatch accounts \u2014 than the 2010 budget, which was in place when she took office. The point being: Freeport police budgets increased \u2014 not decreased \u2014 while Gideon was a member of the town council.\nThe nonprofit\nTo back the second part of the claim in the ad, Collins\u2019 campaign charges that Gideon, \"after taking funding from the police department,\" voted four months later to provide about $70,000 in aid to Freeport Community Services, a nonprofit for which she was a board member.\nGideon helped with projects\u00a0but was not involved in the day-to-day operations, which were managed by an executive director, a Gideon campaign spokeswoman said.\nGideon, who noted at the meeting that she was on the board, joined with the majority of the town council in September 2010 in a 4-0 vote, with one abstention. The vote was to forgive part of a loan that had been given to Freeport Community Services. The meeting minutes indicate that in approving the vote, the town would forgive $65,000 in debt if the nonprofit raised $65,000.\nThe aid to the nonprofit was unrelated to the discussion of police budgets.\nOur ruling\nSen. Collins says in an ad that Gideon \"voted to defund\" the police in Freeport, Maine, \"and gave the money to a nonprofit she helped run.\"\nGideon voted to consolidate Freeport dispatch services with another town, saving money. But she actually voted for higher police budgets as a town council member. So the Collins ad misuses the term \"defund\" to describe moves that are unrelated to the \"defund police\" movement.\u00a0\nThe claim that Gideon gave the money to a nonprofit she helped run is even more spurious. Her vote to aid a nonprofit she served on the board of involved a forgiven loan and was unrelated to the police. The proposal passed the council 4-0.\nWe rate Collins\u2019 statement False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19018"}
