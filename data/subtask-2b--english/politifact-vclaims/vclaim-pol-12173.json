Gordon Gee says OSU\u2019s athletic compliance department is a model for others to follow", "text": "Wearing a bow tie instead of shoulder pads, Ohio State University President E. Gordon Gee was nonetheless playing defense for the scarlet and gray on Oct 4. A day earlier, OSU Athletics Director Gene Smith sat three football players against Nebraska for accepting too much money for too little work at summer jobs.\n\nIt was the latest NCAA infraction in a string for Ohio State dating back to December 2010 that had now encompassed summer jobs, cash handed out a charity event and the infamous tattoos-for-trinkets scandal. In all, 12 scholarship football players had been punished for infractions, former head coach Jim Tressel had been fired and a long-time program booster had been exiled.\n\nAfter his annual talk to faculty members, Gee told the Columbus Dispatch that the school\u2019s athletics compliance office \u2014 the folks in charge of discovering, reporting and preventing NCAA violations \u2014 was a model for other schools to follow.\n\n\"We are the poster child for compliance, and whenever we discover possible infractions we resolve and report it to the NCAA no matter how minor the violations,\" Gee said. \"That\u2019s what we have done here.\"\n\nPolitiFact Ohio normally sticks to checking the statements of Ohio\u2019s leading political figures, but it\u2019s not much of a stretch to view Gee as a political figure of sorts. (Gov. John Kasich has referred to him as Ohio\u2019s greatest politician.)\n\nSo we decided to buckle up our helmet and dig into whether Ohio State\u2019s compliance office really is the \"poster child\" for universities across the country.\n\nFirst, we reached out to OSU spokesman Jim Lynch to see what he could provide to back up the notion that OSU really has the finest athletics compliance department in the nation. Lynch pointed out that the NCAA had not found major violations in any of the cases and has told OSU officials it does not see a lack of institutional control. (That\u2019s NCAA-speak for a systematic problem.)\n\nLynch referred PolitiFact to OSU\u2019s official responses to the charges, which stress that Ohio State\u2019s compliance office has at all times faithfully reported violations once they were discovered.\n\nLynch further suggested that we speak with Chuck Smrt, a former NCAA enforcement staff official whom Ohio State has hired as part of a consulting team to help with its NCAA troubles. Although Smrt is being paid by Ohio State and far from an unbiased source, we decided to hear him out as a well-regarded national expert in the field.\n\nSmrt, a principal with the Compliance Group, said he thinks OSU\u2019s compliance program is one of the tops in the country. \"I don\u2019t think I could ever say that any one school is the best, but I think OSU is in the top five in the country,\" Smrt said.\n\nSmrt said he hasn\u2019t looked at all aspects of OSU\u2019s athletic compliance, but the portions he\u2019s reviewed left him with the impression that OSU has a top-notch compliance department. Smrt also said there were areas he had found where Ohio State could improve its compliance \u00a0department but declined to say what they were.\n\nOther experts in athletics compliance were less glowing, but did give OSU\u2019s office good marks. Rick Allen, a former compliance officer for two decades with Illinois and Oklahoma State who sometimes consults on compliance issues with universities, said Ohio State\u2019s department does have a good reputation.\n\n\"I\u2019ve long had respect for their compliance office, but whether I\u2019d go so far as to call it a model compliance department, I\u2019d hesitate to do that because I think there are a lot of good ones across the country,\" Allen said.\n\nAllen said that a high number of violations may show a lack of rules education. \"If you\u2019re a school that is reporting a lot of violations, you may have good monitoring procedures, but maybe you need to beef up your rules education a little bit,\" he said.\n\nIn fact, OSU Athletics Director Smith blamed inadequate rules education for contributing to the suspensions of six players for selling awards for discounts on tattoos. \"We were not as explicit with our student-athlete education as we should have been in the 2007-08 and 2008-09 academic years regarding the sale of apparel, awards and gifts issued by the athletics department,\" Smith is quoted as saying in a Dec. 23, 2010 release from the NCAA.\n\nDave Ridpath, an Ohio University professor who worked in the athletics compliance offices for Marshall University and Weber State, said Gee\u2019s comment is an overstatement made for public relations reasons. \"I\u2019m not going to say he\u2019s completely off his rocker, but it\u2019s a statement he should probably never make,\" said Ridpath.\n\nRidpath said Ohio State has a \"strong\" compliance department, but said it\u2019s \"an impossible situation\" for schools with highly profitable football teams to have a model compliance department. \u00a0\"Any school that is at a major level, I don\u2019t think any of them could say they have a model compliance department,\" Ridpath said. \"At schools operating on an Ohio State or SEC level, the most important thing at those schools is winning games, player-eligibility and revenue generation, so compliance is never something pushed to the forefront.\"\n\nBeyond the opinions of experts, we reviewed internal audits of the compliance department dating back to 2006 and done in accordance with NCAA rules. Those records show that each year, OSU\u2019s internal auditors found multiple practices in the compliance department that needed improvement. In fact, some of the weaknesses identified by internal auditors were in the same areas where NCAA infractions were later committed by OSU players.\n\nFor example, a November 2010 audit found that OSU wasn\u2019t keeping an inventory of awards given to players. The selling of awards by players was the central issue in the tattoos-for-trinkets scandal.\n\nWhile there is no evidence that the compliance department knew of any violations by the players, the same cannot be said for Ohio State\u2019s most famous employee: Tressel. In March 2011, Ohio State discovered three email strings from a local attorney to Tressel from April and June 2010 informing the coach about players selling awards for discounts on tattoos from a tattoo parlor owner being investigated on federal drug charges. Although he knew that would have made the players ineligible, Tressel never reported what he had learned in the emails to OSU officials. Ohio State has said that is why they fired the popular coach.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2007 audit found that the compliance department wasn\u2019t keeping earning statements of any athletes from part-time jobs and that only 40 percent of the time were employers filling out monitoring paperwork on what jobs athletes were doing. In early October, the overpayment of athletes for part-time jobs was what caused three players to miss the Nebraska game.\n\nTwo of the audits also cite continuing problems with athletes not properly registering the cars they were driving with the compliance office \u2014 first in 2006 and again in 2010.\n\nAmid the ongoing issues, the university is considering taking compliance away from the athletics department and creating a university-wide compliance department to better improve compliance, according to news reports. \u00a0\"We believe we have very sound processes and protocols. Many of them have been validated by third parties as being at or near the best in class,\" OSU Trustee Robert Schottenstein told The Lantern, Ohio State\u2019s student newspaper, for a story. \"Still, as I said, we believe we can get better.\"\n\nSo what\u2019s our score here?\n\nWe haven\u2019t found any experts \u2014 including one employed by OSU as a consultant \u2014 who describe the university as a poster child for compliance. The experts we interviewed think the compliance department is fairly strong, but not a model for other schools to follow.\n\nOhio State itself has acknowledged it didn\u2019t properly educate football players several years ago on whether they could sell the awards they were given. And internal audits of athletic compliance departments in recent years show weaknesses cropping up each year, including several areas that have blown up into public infractions for football players during the past year. Additionally, OSU trustees are considering moving the compliance department outside of athletics to improve the program.\n\nIn fairness, Gee\u2019s statement was focused on reporting and resolving violations, not necessarily preventing them, even though that\u2019s also the compliance department\u2019s job. And there is no evidence that the compliance office has failed to properly report infractions to the NCAA or cover up anything that has come to light. The NCAA has said it doesn\u2019t see anything that points to a systematic problem in athletics in the recent infractions.\n\nHowever, the actions of Coach Tressel, a prominent figure with major responsibility in the athletics department, constitute a critical failure in reporting violations -- a failure that cost him his job.\n\nSo OSU isn\u2019t exactly \"the poster child for compliance,\" but we\u2019ll give Gee some points for accuracy in describing the university\u2019s commitment to reporting violations. We\u2019ll have to throw a flag for hyperbole, though, and rate the statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHank Aaron\u2019s death was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y.
