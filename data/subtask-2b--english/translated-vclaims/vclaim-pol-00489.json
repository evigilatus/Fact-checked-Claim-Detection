He said, \"If you go to every hospital in this country and ask them one question: \"How would it have been for you last year if each of your bills had been paid at the rate of medical care?\" Each hospital director said that they would close.\" This is a difference in an industry-to-industry discussion point. Hospitals say that medical care for all means substantial reductions in income for them. On the other hand, they argue that this will lead many to closure. However, Delaney &apos; s claim -- which has received a great deal of online and post-discussion news coverage -- has attracted our attention. Are you gonna close the \"everyone\" hospital? Did someone actually ask \"every hospital in the country\"? We decided to dig in. Delaney's employees told us that his point came from three sources. First, the fact that medical care pays hospitals an average of 87 cents per dollar of cost. Second, a federal report indicates that \"more than two thirds of hospitals lose money on inpatient medical care services.\" Third: Delaney, his crew said, \"He was asking this question in the rural hospitals he visited during the campaign.\" The experts with whom we spoke offered a different approach, especially since his evidence is not strong enough to support his claim. In addition, they told us that the potential impact of universal medical care on hospitals would be much more precise - and it is not at all clear that \"each hospital\" will be closed, and while some will do worse, some may be better. The different hospitals, the different effects \"it really depends on which hospitals you're talking about,\" said Gerard Anderson, Professor of Health Policy at Johns Hopkins University and an expert in hospital pricing. Hospitals that treat a large number of uninsured patients - people who can be said to receive coverage under the universal medical care approach - are likely to increase their revenues under the new system because they will no longer face the financial pressure of unimpaired care. However, hospitals that treat many privately insured patients, with which insurance prices are often negotiated in a favourable manner, will experience a decline in income. Economists are quick to point out that the latter scenario is not necessarily bad. It is well known that American spending on health care is higher than in other developed countries. Research indicates that hospitals, especially those with a significant impact or market power, are among the main drivers of these high costs because they are able to negotiate much higher prices with insurance companies. Will hospitals that have received a financial blow under the system of medical care for all be immediately closed? It's hard to say again. But this dramatic transformation is not possible, as researchers at the hospital have said. First, as Robert Berenson noted, many hospitals that rely on private insurance can cut off other places first, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute. \"They have high proportions of employees, generous salaries, they engage in capital expansion and they have billions of reserves of'retained income',' \"Berenson. \"Reserves alone will prevent bankruptcy for some time\" In addition, hospitals will not operate in a vacuum under the new system. Costs and incentives will also change across the health industry. Then what about those rural hospitals mentioned by Delaney's employees? There is no doubt that in recent years these hospitals have faced serious financial difficulties. All over the country, more than 100 have been closed since 2010, according to data from the University of North Carolina Cecil J. Chips Health Services Research Centre. (In fact, the expansion of health insurance through the Affordable Care Act is one of the few policy reforms that have alleviated some financial pressures. \"We are now focused on keeping rural hospitals open and dealing with low life expectancy,\" said Alan Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of the National Rural Health Assembly. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2012, but collision analysis is difficult. On the one hand, Morgan said that rural hospitals often operate with tighter budgets - a reduction in government payments without private cash could exacerbate the challenge. On the other hand, the rise in bad debts among rural hospitals, which often treat high levels of uninsured patients, means that expanding coverage can be welcomed, especially if Congress pays rural hospitals at a separate and enhanced rate. \"We're not at a stage where there's details we don't know yet,\" said Morgan. However, even under medical care for all, Anderson noted special government programs and labels designed specifically to keep rural hospitals floating will start operating. Although some might currently be working on limited income, such programmes would continue to exist for qualified persons. Each hospital has a unique financial situation, said Linda Bloomberg, a health policy colleague at the Urban Institute. Therefore, she said, imagine how rural hospitals as a whole could require complex models, analyses and forecasts. \"The difference cannot be underestimated here. She's huge. Medical care against medical care for all Delaney also ignores another point. The bill for medical care for all sponsored by Democratic candidate Sin Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) does not actually say that hospitals will pay for medical care. It is quite possible - and indeed likely - for hospitals with large margins of private revenue to earn less under a single payment system. But, again, Delaney seems to be oversimplifying the situation. The current bill on medical care for all in Congress mandates the Federal Government to establish a timetable for the payment of hospitals and doctors. Politically, Anderson claimed that the odds were \"a total drop\" that the Government would decide to pay all hospitals current medical care rates for all services, although it would set a lower price than many special plans now pay. How does this work in practice? There is one example in Delaney's backyard: Maryland has a so-called \"payment rate determination,\" where the state determines what hospitals can charge for some services. The approach taken by Maryland, which was first implemented in 1977 and is still being modified, ultimately helped to reduce the growth of expenditure on individual hospitals. In particular, this price fixing was not a death blow to state hospitals. However, major analysts (and depending on the change) observed that Delaney was getting something real and important. Medical care for all will represent an earthquake change for hospitals. The determination of how to pay will be complex and must be carefully done. \"It's not easy -- it's not a wave of hand to fix this,\" said Bloomberg. However, a one-time government plan is likely to pay less than the special plans. Economists argue that policy makers are serious about reducing health-care costs. But this means that the transition requires a \"long transition period\" to prevent a major disruption in how hospitals work, and how people get care, as Berenson said. \"Many hospitals are overpaid - to a large extent - but require time and a structured approach to 10 per cent access to medical care or care,\" said Berenson. Our judgment said Delaney: \"If you go to every hospital in this country and ask them one question: \"How was it for you last year if each of your bills was paid at the rate of medical care?\" Each hospital director said that they would close. But Delaney didn't go to every hospital in the country, so he can't say what he would call \"every hospital manager.\" No researcher did this. It also lacks evidence to substantiate its claim. Medical care pays no less than special plans, but it is not clear at all that under medical care every hospital will pay the medical care rate. It is also unclear that hospitals will be affected in the same way. Some may close their doors, but some may see their margins improve. This statement is inaccurate and lacks the evidence to support it. We assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00489"}
