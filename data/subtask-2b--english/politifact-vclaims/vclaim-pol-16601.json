He says he's made 91 trips to 35 countries in the past five years.\n\n\nOn a whirlwind tour of the United Kingdom recently, he met with Prime Minister Gordon Brown and schmoozed Ronald Reagan's old friend Margaret Thatcher. In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II gave him an honorary knighthood for his leadership after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n\nHe must have been feeling particularly well-loved when he bragged to reporters in London that he was one of the \"four or five\" most famous Americans in the world.\n\n\nReporters were quick to ask: Who else is on the list?\n\n\n\"Bill Clinton \u2026 Hillary,\" Rudy began, before aides (wisely?) pulled him away.\n\n\nHe might want to add those two guys from his own party: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.\n\n\nWe know Giuliani is from New York, and if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. But still \u2026 top five? In the world?\n\n\nWe turned to the world of scientific polling. Polling the globe is a daunting proposition. But representatives of both the Gallup World Poll and the Pew Global Attitudes Project said they have never queried the world on who among us Americans is best known.\n\n\nWe asked Giuliani's campaign staff, but they didn't offer anything to back up the claim.\n\n\nOpinionmakers across the Web guffawed at the notion that Giuliani ranks so high and were willing to offer other ideas. The New York\n\nDaily News\n\nsuggested Brangelina, Madonna and Oprah Winfrey, among others. Wonkette, a political gossip blog, offered suggestions from George Washington to Michael Jackson. Chris Reed, a\n\nSan Diego Union-Tribune\n\nblogger, said Colin Powell, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise and slew of other celebs are more famous. (Fair warning: Reed calls his blog \"America's Finest Blog.\")\n\n\nWe here at PolitiFact finally turned to an unscientific \u2014 but world-famous \u2014 measure of celebrity: Google hits.\n\n\nHere's what we found:\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"George W. Bush\": 36.4-million hits\n\n\n\"Oprah\": 21.9-million hits\n\n\n\"Tom Cruise\": 10.1-million hits\n\n\n\"Angelina Jolie\": 9.9-million hits\n\n\n\"Brad Pitt\": 7.2-million hits\n\n\n\"Hillary Clinton\": 5.8-million hits\n\n\n\"Bill Clinton\": 5.8-million hits\n\n\n\"Dick Cheney\": 2.5-million hits\n\n\n\"Arnold Schwarzenegger\": 2.3-million hits\n\n\n\"Rudy Giuliani\": 2.1-million hits.\n\n\nThat puts Giuliani at No. 10. And we didn't even include Madonna, because we couldn't figure out how to weed out the religious and artwork references.\n\n\nFor all of the above reasons, we rate this claim \"pants on fire.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16601"}
