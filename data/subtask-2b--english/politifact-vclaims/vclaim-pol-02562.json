The fake news account cites an alleged story in the Washington Times Herald that said Sasha Obama called police after she drove into Lake Hope about 32 miles outside of Washington. (We found no such Lake Hope in the D.C. area; there is one in Ohio.)\n\"Officers noted a \u2018strong smell of marijuana\u2019 in the crashed vehicle, but no drugs were found as the wreckage was searched,\" the phony article stated.\nThe fake news article linked to the website of the Washington Times Herald, an actual newspaper in Washington, Ind. But that website, which focuses on local news in Indiana, had no such story about Sasha crashing her car. (There was also a newspaper called The Washington Times-Herald that covered the capital city, but that was sold to the Washington Post in 1954.)\nThe headline that Sasha Obama crashed her car into a lake is fake news. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/01a43935-0913-473c-94ab-52706183751a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02562"}
