And unsettling.\nA young woman and a male coworker, who appear to be about the same age, are examining their paychecks when the woman discovers she makes only 78 percent as much on payday as her cubicle mate.\n\"That\u2019s so weird because we have the same job,\" the woman says. \"That\u2019s not fair.\"\nIn protest, the woman then proceeds to do only 78 percent of her job, much to the dismay of her male co-workers and bewildered bosses. The comedic attack on the gender wage-gap struck a nerve. As of this week, it had 9.7 million views, thanks to social media sites.\nIt was released on the site BuzzFeed in conjunction with Equal Pay Day (April 14th ) and entitled \"One Woman Discovers the Wage Gap.\"\nPolitiFact couldn\u2019t resist. We\u2019ve been here before. But it \u2018s worth another visit based on the viral dissemination of the video.\nThe bottom line is this. There is a gender wage-gap. But it is not 22 percent for men and women of the same age performing the same job. That is an urban myth perpetuated by politicians and advocacy groups misreading Census data compiled on cumulative earnings by men and women.\nPolitiFact has given you the nuts and bolts about gender wage-gap statistics \u00a0in past fact-checks. You can read the two most important works in this area here and here.\nBasically, there is a wage gap. That is a fact. But it tends to diminish when you compare women and men in the exact same jobs who have the same levels of experience and education.\nThe video implies the woman and her better-paid cubicle-mate are otherwise equals. Their cubicles are at least identical and the co-workers appear to be about the same age.\nWe reached out to the folks at BuzzFeed. They shared word from the video\u2019s producer, Chantel Houston, that a research team had looked at information from the White House and four other sources before deciding to go with the 78 percent statistic.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis included a 2014 report in the liberal groupThink Progress, which cited 2013 data from the U.S. Census Bureau showing that the average woman working full-time and year-round was making 78 percent of what a man with similar employment. The report said that was a slight but not statistically different increase from 77 percent in 2012, and not far off the wages in 2007.\nThe double-digit gender pay-gap relying on U.S. Census Bureau data has been widely reported. That data has shown women\u2019s total wages were about 23 percent lower than the total amount of men's wages. But that large discrepancy was due in part to the fact that men generally work more hours.\nThe Census Bureau did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Other data -- including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as data comparing the same jobs -- yield much smaller wage gaps.\nBuzzFeed actually looked at some sources that got it right, but then produced a misleading video.\nFor example, BuzzFeed reviewed a CNN Money report from last October, which said that 78 percent stat was \"an aggregate of all men and women in the workplace\" that doesn't take into account important variables like education level, total hours worked, type of work and job tenure.\nA wage gap does exist, the show\u2019s audience heard. But CNN Money talked about a study from the American Association of University Women that controlled for college major, occupation, age, geographical region, hours worked and more, and found there was still a 7 percent wage gap between male and female college grads a year after graduation.\nIn addition, the video\u2019s researchers said they reviewed a recent report from the Pew Research Center, which says women have to work about 60 extra days, or about three months, to earn what men did by the end of the previous year, based on the White house estimate that full-time working women earn 77 percent of what their male counterparts earn.\nBut for young women, the wage gap is even smaller \u2013 at 93 percent \u2013 meaning they caught up to their same-aged male counterparts by roughly the last week in January of this year, the Pew Research Center estimates. Some studies put the real gender-based wage gap at half that. And some studies show that highly educated single women in urban areas actually make more than their male counterparts.\nOur ruling.\nThe BuzzFeed video takes a legitimate statistic and illustrates it in a way that makes it sound much more dramatic than it actually is.\nThe 78 percent \u00a0figure is real, but for culmulative wages. \u00a0It does not factor in occupations held, hours worked or length of tenure. And, unlike the video, the Census data never attempted \u00a0to compare equal pay for equal work.\nUsing this statistic to illustrate the gender pay-gap is misleading.\nWe rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06494"}
