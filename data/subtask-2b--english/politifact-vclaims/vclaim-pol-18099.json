Roger Roth hits the mark: Tax burden at a 50-year low", "text": "Is Wisconsin\u2019s tax burden at a 50-year low?\nThat was the claim made by state Sen. Roger Roth, R-Appleton, when he gave the GOP response to Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 2020 State of the State speech.\nIn the Jan. 22, 2020, speech, Roth touted Republican-backed investments in the state\u2019s infrastructure, worker training and childhood education. The results, he said, are economic growth, low unemployment, higher wages and frozen college tuition without raising taxes.\u00a0\n\"The average resident\u2019s tax burden is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while incomes continue to grow,\" he said.\nIs he right?\nThe source\nWhen asked for backup, Roth\u2019s office pointed us to the Wisconsin Policy Forum\u2019s January 2020 report, \"Tax Burden Falls Again.\" The report is an annual review of state and local taxes relative to state residents\u2019 income. The Wisconsin Policy Forum is a nonpartisan research organization.\nThe tax burden is the total share of taxes compared to income. The Wisconsin Policy Forum compiles all the state and local taxes in Wisconsin, using a variety of reports, such as the state\u2019s Annual Fiscal Report, and information from state agencies.\nState and local tax revenue is compared relative to cumulative personal income of all income reported in Wisconsin. Those income numbers are from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nThe forum\u2019s report shows Wisconsin's tax burden for 2019 was the lowest since at least 1970, which is as far back as the organization has data.\n\nState and local taxes, combined, took up 10.3% of residents\u2019 income in 2019, down slightly from 10.4% in 2018. The state has established a new tax burden low each year since 2015.\nJason Stein, research director at the Wisconsin Policy Forum, noted that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean everyone is paying 10.3% of their income. Incomes and taxes vary region to region and person to person.\nNoah Williams, a professor of economics and director of the Center for Research on the Wisconsin Economy, echoed that point and said the policy forum\u2019s approach is a reasonable one to use.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report shows overall tax burden has consistently trended down over the last 50 years, from an average of 14% in the 1970s to 11% across the 2010s.\nBehind the numbers\nThe drop is not entirely the result of reduced tax collections.\nIndeed, according to the forum, state and local tax revenues increased by 4.5% in fiscal year 2019 \u2014 the most since 2011.\u00a0\nSo what\u2019s going on?\nWell, income has increased faster than average tax collections. Income has been on an upward trend since 2009. The policy forum found income grew by 5.1% in calendar year 2018, the most recent year available at the time of its report.\nBecause income growth outpaced the increase in tax collection, the tax burden decreased.\nWhile taxes are determined by state and local governments, many other economic factors help drive income levels, Stein said.\n\"If the economy\u2019s doing really well, it\u2019s not purely a function of what\u2019s happening at the state level,\" Stein said. \"If it was doing really poorly, it wouldn\u2019t be purely a function of what\u2019s happening at the state level either.\"\nOur ruling\nRoth claimed \"the average (Wisconsin) resident\u2019s tax burden is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while incomes continue to grow.\"\u00a0\nThe numbers check out.\nWhile tax collections are up, incomes have been growing at a faster rate than taxes. Thus, the tax burden continues to edge down.\nWe rate his claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18099"}
