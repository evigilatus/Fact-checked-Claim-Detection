Shortly after Trump used an early television footage to defend public support for his promise of a signing campaign, Mark Walker, R-N.C., jumped into the mix with a tweet of the President's support. \"The debate about securing our borders cannot be measured by party punches,\" said Walker, who represents the sixth congressional circle in North Carolina. \"It must be measured in the human losses caused by border violations: *1/3 immigrant women subjected to sexual abuse * 7/10 migrant women victims of violence * 20,000 migrant children who were smuggled illegally last month.\" The debate about securing our borders cannot be measured by partisan strikes. The human losses caused by border penetration must be measured: 1/3 migrant women subjected to sexual abuse - 7/10 migrants who were victims of violence - 20,000 children were smuggled illegally last month - the Republic, Mark Walker (@Rep MarkWalkker) 9 January 2019, spokesman for Walker Jack Minor, said that the first two statistics came from M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res, a non-profit international organization providing medical care in conflict and poverty settings. The third issue had been presented to the members of the Council by Internal Security Minister Kirsten Nielsen during a briefing in January. Similar numbers have been raising eyebrows all over the country for weeks, so we decided to put Walker's statement to Treaty-O-Meter. \"7/10 immigrants are victims of violence.\" These figures were withdrawn from the report of M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res 2017, which describes in detail the conditions faced by migrants fleeing violence in the northern triangle of Central America, which includes El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, for the United States. However, that report focused on a very different situation than what was described by Walker's tweet. Sophie Delaounay, Executive Director of M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res, said that the purpose of the report was to highlight the humanitarian crisis in Central America and the resulting forced displacement - not the situation within the United States or on the American border with Mexico. The report was based on medical data and a survey conducted in 2015 of 467 migrants who were receiving random treatment in clinics in Mexico with the support of M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res. According to the results of the survey, 68.3 per cent of immigrants and refugees entering Mexico from the northern triangle said that they had been subjected to violence while transiting Mexico to the United States, and 31.4 per cent of women said that they had been sexually abused. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" \u2022 On February 1, 2021, Walker pointed out that these figures were \"the human loss caused by the pores\" - and that they were somehow the result of current immigration policies and could be repaired by a boundary wall. However, they do not actually refer to the situation on the U.S. border at all. In fact, the figures show the harm suffered by migrants while travelling through Mexico. \"Migrants from Central America are highly vulnerable to violence, both in their countries of origin and along the way to the United States,\" said Delaney. \"It is regrettable that our statements - which illustrate the risks that migrants face while travelling to the United States - are being used by the United States Government to try to justify immigration policies that endanger the lives of these people themselves.\" It's clear that Walker didn't pull the numbers out of the air, but his claim is misleading. \"20,000 children were illegally smuggled last month.\" Mouther said that this figure came from Minister of National Security Kirstjen Nielsen, who presented this figure to members of the House of Representatives during a briefing in January, referring to the December statements. The fact-finding examiners of the Washington Post and Factcheck.org examined the same allegation after Trump made him a focal point for the address of his Oval Office at peak time on 8 January. The spokesman for the Ministry of National Security told Kate Waldman Poletti Fuckett 19.313 minors to try to cross the border illegally in December, either with one of the parents or alone. A total of 22,110 minors, including others who had arrived at legal ports of entry, appeared at the border without documentation that month. It is not accurate, however, to describe either of the two figures as the number of children being \"run\" into the country, which are often linked by Tramp supporters to drug cartels, \"quiot\" or other bad actors. While some 20,000 minors stopped trying to enter the United States illegally, the number of children smuggled into the border may have been much lower. This is because border officials examine false claims of paternity or guardianship. Between April and September 2018, Customs and Border Patrols separated 170 family units suspected of smuggling after it was found that the child had no connection with his father or guardian, according to the Washington Post. However, as Vak\u010dek.org noted, 170 is a very small proportion of the more than 60,000 family units arrested during that time period. It is therefore very impossible to suggest, as Walker did, that every minor arrested at the border was brought there by a smuggler. In our tweet of 9 January, Walker said \"forgotten borders\" that resulted in one third of migrant women being sexually abused, 70 per cent of migrants suffering violence, and the illegal smuggling of 20,000 migrant children across the border in December. Although Walker obtained the first two figures directly from M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res' report, his suggestion that violence had occurred because of the existing border conditions was highly misleading. The statistics came from a survey which asked Central American immigrants receiving medical treatment in Mexico about their experience in travelling through Mexico. The head of the group behind the report also said that violence in their countries of origin was one of the factors that had led them to leave. The third statistics cited by Walker were also misleading, as he confused 19,313 minors arrested at the border last month with far fewer minors who would have been arrested while travelling with smugglers. Overall, Walker's claim contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong.
