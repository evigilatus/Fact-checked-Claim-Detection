(Here are some others that we have fact-checked.)\nThis one involves Fast & Furious star Paul Walker, who died in 2013 after the car he was riding in crashed at a speed of more than 100 mph and burst into flames. Both Walker and the driver, Roger Rodas, were pronounced dead at the scene\nThe Facebook post displays a black-and-white image of Walker and says:\u00a0\n\"Nov 30th 2013, his car hit a tree and caught fire. The video however, looks more like an explosion. He was set to come forward exposing the Clinton Foundations crimes against children in Haiti. He discovered this through his charity work.\"\nIt also shares a link to this one-minute YouTube video that appears to show footage of the crash from beyond a set of trees.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nOutside of vague, unsourced posts, we couldn\u2019t find any credible details that claim Walker had evidence of wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation.\nThe article mentions Walker\u2019s charity work. The only connection between Walker and the Clinton Foundation is that both were involved in relief efforts in Haiti. The rest is speculation.\nWalker founded the nonprofit Reach Out Worldwide after he organized a relief team to respond to the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti. Reach Out\u2019s website says that, while on the trip, Walker saw a need for skilled personnel in post-disaster situations and created the charity, which helps bring first responders to disaster areas.\u00a0\nThere is also no evidence that the car was tampered with. The Los Angeles coroner's office report found that the Porsche Carrera GT was traveling near 100 mph at the time it impacted a power pole and several trees. Investigators determined that the cause of the fatal collision was \"unsafe speed for the roadway conditions.\"\nWalker\u2019s daughter, Meadow, did file a wrongful death lawsuit against Porsche, claiming that the carmaker took production shortcuts that prevented her father from surviving the crash. The two parties resolved the lawsuit in 2017 and kept the terms of the settlement confidential.\nAs for this claim, it rates Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17369"}
