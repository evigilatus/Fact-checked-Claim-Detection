At some point in her speech, Harris addressed the state of the economy. Harris said, \"Let's tell the truth about our economy.\" \"Our economy today does not work for workers. The cost of living is rising, but salaries are not keeping pace.\" (Monitored around 1:21 p.m.) Is Harris' assertion of wages accurate? In general, no. Wages have not risen over the past 40 years - or over the past five years - but they have also not fallen behind inflation. When we called the Harris campaign, they presented articles and news studies that they said supported their position. However, most of this evidence of salary arrears was for certain segments of the time and did not reflect the general trend. Average wages, adjusted for inflation, have risen both in the recent past and in the longer term. For economists, the primary statistics for measuring wages are the average regular weekly real income of full-time wage and salary workers aged 16 years and over. \"real\" is the economic word for \"inflation rate.\" The following chart shows how this measure of wages has increased and declined every three months since 1979: it is important to note that average wage growth has not been strong over the entire four decades - workers have seen a 6 per cent increase above inflation. The 2008 financial crisis has had a significant impact on Americans &apos; sense of economic security. It is wrong to say, however, that wages did not exceed inflation. The increase has been particularly evident since 2014, as when wages eventually began to escalate again after the losses of the major recession. Between the second quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2018, inflation-adjusted wages rose by approximately 8 per cent, as the data show. Economists said that wage gains exceeded inflation for low-income and higher-income workers. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 On 20 January 2021, another measure - the average weekly earnings of private and unsupervised workers, adjusted for inflation - shows that wages are also rising in the short and long term. It is also consistent with annual increases after 2014 in average household income, a different statistical measure. Overall, different data sources agree that \"paychecks match inflation,\" said Jade Kolko, the chief economist of the job site in fact.com. The stagnation of wages among low-income men is appropriate for one sub-group of the labour force and Harris' description: male workers in the lower half of the income spectrum. They represent more than a quarter of the workforce. There is a tool created by the Liberal Economic Policy Institute that allows users to divide federal wage data and return them in different ways. At the suggestion of the economist, the Brookings Institution, Gary Bertles, considered the real hourly wages of working men at or below the average. The following graph shows wages in percentages 10, 20, 30, 40 and medium. This graph shows that low-income male workers have seen their inflation-adjusted wages decline since 1973. Any real wage gains in 2018, which are not yet available, are unlikely to be large enough to eliminate the decline since 1973, as Bertellis said. However, even these workers have seen their wages rise above inflation since at least 2014, following sharp declines from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. Bertiles said that this wage stagnation among low-income men was more than balanced by the gains made among low-income working women, which was why average wages were generally rising. Bertellis said: \"A long-term view, C. Harris, is a valid allegation for important sectors of the working population.\" \"But, for wage earners more generally, the claim is wrong. Workers with higher wages and lower earnings have seen real-time earnings since 1979 and since 2000 and since 2014.\" Our judgment, Harris, said, \"The cost of living is rising, but salaries are not keeping up.\" Overall, wages have not risen significantly, but have risen faster than inflation since 1979, particularly since 2014. A sub-group of workers - men at the lower end of the wage range - has seen their wages fail to keep pace with inflation since 1973. However, Harris used general terms in her speech. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong. The editor's note: We have heard from several readers who do not agree with this assessment or have questions about it. We addressed their questions in a follow-up story published on February 7, 2019. ........................................................................................................................", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01078"}
