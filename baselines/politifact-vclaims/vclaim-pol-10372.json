He said: \"I want to talk about the fact that the Paul Ryan plan helps save Medicare when the Democrat plan lets Medicare end. There\u2019s a lot of misnomers out there. He wants to charge that we\u2019re raising Social Security age to 70. Under the current structure, that happens sometime at the beginning of the next century.\"\n\nIn an interview \u00a0with The Daily News Journal of Murfreesboro, DesJarlais said that \"as far as this charge that I voted to raise the retirement age to 70, there\u2019s a process where the retirement is pushed back by one month every two years, so by the time the retirement age hits 70, it\u2019ll be sometime around the turn of the century.\"\n\nWe can understand why a candidate treads carefully on Social Security. But there is no disputing this: On March 29, 2012, as the House was considering a series of Republican-sponsored budget reduction plans, DesJarlais voted for two separate GOP plans that would have major impacts on Social Security -- one which would have raised the eligibility age to 70 by 2048, or 52 years before the \"turn of the century.\" Neither of the bills became law: The one that raised the retirement age to 70 in 2048 failed to pass the House and the other won House approval but never passed in the Democrat-controlled Senate.\n\nThe first was a budget-reduction plan submitted by the Republican Study Committee, which calls itself \"a group of House Republicans organized for the purpose of advancing a conservative social and economic agenda.\" All of Tennessee\u2019s Republican House members except Rep. John Duncan Jr. of Knoxville are RSC members and all of them except Duncan voted for the RSC plan.\n\nThe RSC\u2019s website describes its budget plan in full, including its proposal for \"slowly increasing (Social Security\u2019s) retirement age to 70 years\u2026. For those born in 1978, the full-retirement age would remain at 70 years old.\"\n\nBy our calculator, 1978 plus 70 is 2048 \u2013 more than five decades before the turn of the next century.\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s analysis says: \"Starting in 2023, the RSC budget proposes to increase the Social Security full retirement age by two months every year until it reaches age 70 in the year 2047.\n\nThe RSC plan\u2019s failure cleared the way later that day for House approval of a separate plan by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, now the GOP vice presidential candidate. The Ryan plan did not list specific changes for Social Security but required Social Security trustees to submit a stabilization plan to the President and for the President to submit a plan to Congress. DesJarlais also voted for that plan.\n\nIn defending the accuracy of his statements, DesJarlais and his staff in essence contend that the Democrats have been attacking him for voting for the Ryan bill \u2013 which on March 29 did not contain a detailed provision for raising Social Security\u2019s retirement age \u2013 and that that was what he was responding to with his \"turn of the century\" claim. His office pointed to an earlier, 2010 version of Ryan\u2019s plan called \"Road Map to America\u2019s Future\" that did include a detailed provision saying the Social Security. That plan says that \"retirement age will gradually increase until it reaches 70 in the next century.\" An important note on that, however -- DesJarlais was not in Congress in 2010. He did not vote on that plan.\n\nDesJarlais\u2019 statement on the matter says: \"My statement regarding the time frame for raising social security is completely accurate when talking about Ryan\u2019s budgetary roadmap, which has been the only budget that has been discussed and what I believed was being referred to.\"\n\nA review of Stewart\u2019s website, including a web video, and media releases shows he has been talking about both the RSC plan and \u00a0the Ryan budget plan. But a press release issued by Stewart\u2019s campaign that says DesJarlais\u2019 \"turn of the century\" claim \"may be the falsity of the century\" specifically refers to his vote for the RSC plan.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTo defend himself against charges that he voted to raise the Social Security age to 70, the freshman congressman points to his support for Congressman Paul Ryan\u2019s 2010 budgetary road map where the retirement age doesn\u2019t hit 70 until the next century.\n\nBut DesJarlais was not even in Congress in 2010, and the only vote he ever made on a plan that included a target date for raising the age to 70 came earlier this year.That plan called for raising Social Security age to 70 by 2047 or 2048 -- 52 years before the century turns.\n\nFor that bit of misdirection, we give the congressman a ruling of Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChain email\n\n\nstated on January 21, 2010 in a chain e-mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of Congress passed a pay raise for themselves of $10,000 over two years even as they voted not to raise Social Security benefits for 2010 and 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 22, 2010", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10372"}
