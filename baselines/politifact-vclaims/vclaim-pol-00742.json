Kamala Harris\u00a0often describes the economic hardships faced by American families.\nShe cites statistics on the cost of housing, college, healthcare and how, if elected president, her policies would lessen the burden.\nHarris took the same approach while speaking on the Pod Save America podcast this week, where she made this claim about economic instability:\n\"It's clear in our country right now, almost half of American families are a $400 unexpected expense away from complete upheaval.\"\nWe\u2019ve seen similar versions of this claim before and wanted to know whether Harris\u2019 statement was accurate.\nWe set out on a fact check.\nOur research\nIn January, PolitiFact rated Mostly True a similar claim by Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. He claimed in a \"60 Minutes\" interview that \"Over 40 percent of the American people don't have $400 in the bank.\"\nSchultz had relied on a May 2018 Federal Reserve report on the well-being of U.S. Households in 2017. It found that \"Four in 10 adults, if faced with an unexpected expense of $400, would either not be able to cover it or would cover it by selling something or borrowing money.\"\nThose findings generally support Harris\u2019 contention of \"almost half of American families\" facing hardship with a $400 cost. A Harris campaign spokeswoman said the senator relied on the Fed report.\nBut we took a deeper look at the survey to examine her contention this would really lead to \"complete upheaval\" for almost half of American families.\u00a0\nWhat did the survey ask? \nHere\u2019s the survey question that led to the finding that 40 percent of adults couldn\u2019t immediately pay for a $400 unforeseen cost.\n\"EF3. Suppose that you have an emergency expense that costs $400. Based on your current financial situation, how would you pay for this expense? If you would use more than one method to cover this expense, please select all that apply.\na. Put it on my credit card and pay it off in full at the next statement\nb.

And 29 percent said they \"would not be able to pay the expense right now.\" Respondents were able to select multiple answers.\nSOURCE:\u00a0U.S. Federal Reserve,\u00a0Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2017, May 2018\nExperts weigh in \nDaniel Schneider, a UC Berkeley sociology professor whose research specialties include economic instability, reviewed Harris\u2019 statement, along with the survey and its findings.\n\"I think it is an open question about how those other options \u2026 map with \u2018complete upheaval\u2019. Is putting something on your credit card to pay off over time \u2018complete upheaval\u2019? Maybe,\" he wrote in an email. \"One could certainly imagine that facing an expense shock and having to resort to (those options) would be stressful.\"\nThe \"overall idea\" behind Harris\u2019 statement is accurate, Abdur Chowdhury, an economics professor emeritus at Marquette University told us in an email.\nChowdhury added, however, that the percentage of people who face a hardship due to a $400 unanticipated cost \"may be lower today. The survey, from which the figure was quoted, was conducted a few years ago.\"\n\"With the low unemployment rate and increases in wage rate, fewer people are in that 'close to bankruptcy' category,\" the professor added.\nA spokeswoman for the Harris campaign provided a written statement:\n\"Millions of hard-working Americans can't cover an unexpected $400 expense. They are a medical bill, a car repair, or a rent increase away from having to make painful choices like turning to a neighbor hat in hand to ask for a loan, putting themselves in spiraling credit card debt, selling their car, or heading to a pawn shop with their wedding ring. To presume any of these things would not upend someone's daily life is out of touch.\"\nOur rating\nSen. Kamala Harris recently claimed: \"It's clear in our country right now, almost half of American families are a $400 unexpected expense away from complete upheaval.\"\nThe portion of Harris\u2019 statement about \"almost half\" of families is on the right track. A 2018 Federal Reserve report found 40 percent of adults surveyed could not easily pay for an unforeseen $400 cost.\nBut the report doesn\u2019t describe \"complete upheaval\" for that group. Instead, it found many would place that expense on a credit card and pay it off over time, borrow money from a friend or family or sell a possession.\nThose represent very real hardships for families. But to characterize them as leading to \"complete upheaval\" is not supported by the facts and takes the survey results out-of-context.\nWe rated Harris\u2019 claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2019-04-19 18:31:13 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  \"It's clear in our country right now, almost half of American families are a $400 unexpected expense away from complete upheaval.\"    Kamala Harris U.S. Senator https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roZ6dHDxIno&t=1329s    Wednesday, April 17, 2019 2019-04-17    Read More  info    \nRELATED: \nKamala Harris calls her LIFT plan \u2018the most significant middle-class tax cut in generations.\u2019 Is it?\nKamala Harris gets it mostly right on America\u2019s rapid growth of student loan debt\nAre paychecks failing to keep up with inflation?\nDoes teacher pay fall short of the living wage in 30 states, as Kamala Harris said?", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00742"}
