Here's what the ad claims, like a picture of President Trump standing next to Davos appearing on the screen and then zooming in on Davos. Tuck is supported by Donald Trump's educational advisor and financed by the same billionaire behind Betsy Davis. An announcement by the Tony Thurmond campaign both Tak and Davos supports rented schools. At the same time, Thurmond is a strong advocate of public schools.
