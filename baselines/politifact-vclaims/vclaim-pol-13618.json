We have 25 percent of our school buildings that are underutilized. At some point... the community is going to need to decide whether we continue to invest in under-enrolled schools or whether we need to save those dollars to invest in teachers and programs.\"\n\nOne in four schools--underused?\n\nWe left a message for Mitchell, then asked the school district for elaboration.\n\nJoe Silva, assistant director for planning services, provided a spreadsheet listing each of the district\u2019s 100-plus schools and whether each one is operating at, under or over the student capacity for which it was designed.\n\nSilva said the district has historically considered a campus under-enrolled if its school buildings, not counting portables, are at 75 percent capacity or less. He said the citizens task force set an under-capacity threshold of 85 percent.\n\nBy the 85-percent threshold, 34 schools -- 31 percent -- are under-enrolled. By the usual district threshold, 22 schools -- 20 percent -- are under-filled. The calculations count both students who live in a school\u2019s attendance zone and those attending via transfers.\n\nAccording to the spreadsheet, the district\u2019s least-crowded school is Pearce Middle School, at 31 percent of capacity. The school normally serves more students; sixth grade wasn\u2019t offered this year. Also least-crowded, according to the spreadsheet, are Becker Elementary, at 40 percent, and Blackshear Elementary, at 41 percent.\n\nSilva said that four of Becker\u2019s permanent classrooms serve students shifted temporarily from their home schools to the disciplinary Alternative Center for Elementary Students. Those students aren\u2019t counted in Becker\u2019s enrollment calculation, he said, because the district can place the program at any location. Mary Saul, ACES\u2019 director, told us that up to 36 students in the program occupy permanent classrooms at Becker.\n\nSilva initially told us that the district would describe under-enrolled schools as under capacity, not underutilized. That is, he said, many schools not filled with students still use their available space to offer add-on programs for students, families and the community. Also, he said, the district\u2019s central administration places administrative and other staff in space available in the schools.\n\nHe passed along campus survey results indicating that in 2009-10, 29 of the district\u2019s 2,425 elementary classrooms, 1 percent, were used by principals for \"discretionary\" purposes, with others used for instruction, student and parental support or by district administrative staff.\n\n\"Very few campuses are underutilized,\" Silva said. \"But many are under capacity.\"\n\nBumfuzzled? So were we, until Mitchell told us she\u2019d said \"underutilized\" after seeing the term in a presentation to the school board.\n\nThe 15-page presentation, \"Facility Master Plan, Board Update,\" was shown to the board Jan. 10. It includes a page titled \"Current Facility Inefficiencies\" with this subhead: \"Utilization (Permanent Capacity/Enrollment).\" The page says the target utilization for the district is 85 percent to 105 percent; 27 schools -- or 25 percent -- are below the bottom target figure and 55 schools are above it. Silva later told us the results differ from the breakdown he gave us because the presentation used 2009-10 enrollment totals and ours had more recent enrollment totals.\n\nSo, 25 percent or so of the schools are below target capacity for students, but that\u2019s not to say most of their space isn\u2019t being used.\n\nIn fact, a key consultant on the master plan, Carolyn Staskiewicz, president of Ohio-based DeJong-Richter, told us in an interview that \"utilization\" -- a term reflecting the students enrolled in a school divided by the school\u2019s capacity--could give the erroneous impression that the schools aren\u2019t fully used.\n\nAt her suggestion, we poked into the term--underutilization--by contacting the Arizona-based Council on Educational Facility Planners International. Spokeswoman Barbara Worth pointed us to Ron Fanning, chairman of the board of Ohio-based Fanning/Howey Associates, Inc., among the nation\u2019s largest school architecture firms. Fanning agreed with Staskiewicz\u2019s definition of utilization, but said it\u2019s not the only factor to weigh in judging a school\u2019s value: \"You really have to look at each individual building\" on its merits, \"what it can hold, based on the programs being taught at that school... You can\u2019t do a broad-brush statement.\"\n\nStefan Pharis, who has a child at Barton Hills Elementary, told us the facilities task force has yet to take into account a comprehensive state measure of schools\u2019 efficiency. According to online posts by the state comptroller\u2019s office, the Financial Allocation Study for Texas (FAST), as ordered by the 2009 Legislature, reflects how districts and campuses spend their money -- and how the spending translates into student achievement.\n\n\"There\u2019s an implication when you say (a school is) underutilized, that somehow they\u2019re wasteful in terms of spending,\" Pharis said. According to the comptroller, he said, \"Some of these schools... excel academically and they do it at a cost-effective price.\"\n\nOur take: Mitchell\u2019s statement accurately echoes the consultant-endorsed characterization of under-enrolled schools as being below their \"target\" utilization. However, \"underutilized\" is potentially misleading when applied to schools that may in fact be fully used, and could be targeted for closure as a result of that label. This is critical, missing context. We rate the statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13618"}
