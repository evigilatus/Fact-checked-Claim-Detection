There is the question of replacing the outgoing Attorney General, Eric Holder, and, even more urgent, the authorization or rejection of America's attacks on the Islamic State Group in Syria and Iraq, where air strikes continue. But both stop until the legislators return on November 12th. Their last official working day was 19 September. The absence of Congress was particularly disturbing to the host of Laura Ingerham in a conservative radio programme as the United States army returned to war in the Middle East. Ingraham focused on the constitutional role of Congress in declaring war. \"We must have a civilian permit, a civilian command permit for this war, otherwise we will be in real trouble down the road,\" said Engerham. Just moments ago, she said, \"The Congress closed as soon as Congress in the history of the pre-election election.\" We thought we would check whether taking a long break in September and October would be a status quo for the records, as Ingerham emphasized. It's not true, but before we get to the details, we need to clarify a few words. When we talk about a congressional meeting, we mean the period that starts in January and ends generally in December. According to the Congressional Research Service, \"the meeting begins when the room meets and ends when it is adjourned. On the contrary, the holiday does not end a session, but only temporarily suspends it.\" Legislators and guides often refer to the suspension of work as a postponement. Now, technically, Congress is on vacation. The Congressional Research Service has recognized that the informal use of words is not always consistent with their official meaning. The House of Representatives has a schedule for each session of Congress dating back to 1789. In order to verify the claim of Ingraham, we need to return only to 1960. That year, Congress concluded its session this year and adjourned its session on 1 September. This was a complete delay (not just a vacation) which came 18 days before the end of this extended year. For the record, 1960 was the year when Republican Richard Nixon confronted the Democratic Party of John Kennedy. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2012, it was interesting that September 1 was not early in time. In 1959, Congress was raised to 15 September. In 1958, Congress postponed 24 August. In 1956, it was July 27. We note that the last two years on that list were election years. So Ingraham is wrong, but we have to note similar allegations of sound on Sunday, which are true. In the Fox News Sunday, John Paraso said, \"This is the first move to Congress in more than 50 years.\" On the face of the nation CBS, Virginia Democratic Sin. Tim Kane called it \"the second holiday before mid-term since 1960.\" Each senator is right (if she excuses the use of Paraso to postpone rather than stop working). For Paraso, \"over 50 years,\" he brings us back to any year until 1963, or 51 years ago. The record shows that since 1963, Congress has often taken short breaks in September, giving legislators several weeks in October for an election campaign in election years and even closing books for the year in October. However, there was no interruption from mid-September to mid-November. Kane's claim now exists. Our verdict (Ingraham) said that Congress had been postponed earlier this year than ever before in \"the history of Congress before the election.\" Technically, Congress is on vacation and has not been postponed. However, if we fail to do so, the record shows that in 1960, Congress adjourned and closed its session on 1 September - more than two weeks before the current Congress took its vacation. We're assessing the allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07239"}
