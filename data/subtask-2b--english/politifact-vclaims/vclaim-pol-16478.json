Hillary Clinton recently trotted out quotes from Sen. Barack Obama's kindergarten teacher to prove that he's been aiming for the White House longer than he admits. Seriously.\n\n\nThe conflict between the top Democrats running for president began when Obama said this: \"I have not been planning to run for president for however number of years some of the other candidates have been planning for.\"\n\n\nThe Clinton campaign responded with a thoroughly researched news release that culled details from Obama's life that had been reported in feature articles about him.\n\n\n\"Senator Obama's relatives and friends say he has been talking about running for president for at least the last 15 years,\" the Clinton news release said. \"So who's not telling the truth, them or him?\"\n\n\nThe evidence:\n\n\n\u2022 Former classmates who said that when he was at Harvard Law School, Obama was \"thinking about politics.\"\n\n\n\u2022 A brother-in-law saying Obama told him in the early 1990s that he was interested in a run for president.\n\n\n\u2022 An essay Obama wrote in third grade called, \"I want to be a president.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

That kind of sentiment would have been absurdly presumptuous at that point.\"\n\n\nNow, Obama spent some of his early years in Indonesia, including kindergarten and third grade. We started to track down those teachers living on the other side of the world, but then we realized this goose chase wasn't worth the effort.
