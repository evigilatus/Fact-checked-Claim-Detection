Bill Nelson is a down-home farmer in denim overalls, wielding a pitchfork and tending to six animated cows.\n\nThe point of the political attack: Nelson is using a farm facade to get out of paying his fair share of property taxes.\n\n\"After 40 years in politics, Bill Nelson has learned how to milk the system. He leased land that he owned for six cows, taking advantage of an agricultural tax loophole to dodge $43,000 in taxes just last year,\" says the ad\u00a0from American Crossroads, the conservative super PAC founded by Karl Rove. \"Then he sold the land for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million.\"\n\nThe ad\u2019s kicker: \"Tax breaks and big profits for him, higher taxes for the rest of us.\"\n\nThis claim echoes past criticism from Nelson\u2019s Republican challenger, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV.\n\nThe attacks stem from a February 2012 Tampa Bay Times\u00a0story that scrutinized Nelson\u2019s qualifications for a \"greenbelt\" property assessment, a designation that spares him from paying higher property taxes on his family\u2019s 55-acre pasture along the Indian River in Brevard County. Thanks to the \"greenbelt\" designation, Nelson\u2019s land is taxed at a much lower agricultural rate.\n\nWe wanted to examine the group\u2019s claim that Nelson used six cows and a loophole to \"dodge\" $43,000 in his 2011 taxes. Whether he \"sold the land for home development\" is the subject of another check.\n\nNelson said the Crossroads ad is very misleading.\n\n\"Of course, they don\u2019t tell you that that has been a cow pasture for 60 years,\" Nelson said in an interview. \"That was my 4-H club project that started in the early \u201950s and has been ever since.\"\n\nWhen the Times story broke, Mack\u2019s campaign rushed to create a singalong cartoon ad called \"Udder hypocrisy.\" Before an animated barn, a hokey Nelson figure and six cows sang, \"Bill Nelson\u2019s farm\u2019s the place to be / Just six cows and hypocrisy / Milking taxpayers like you and me / This is typical liberal hypocrisy.\"\n\n\u2018An agricultural tax loophole\u2019\n\nThe greenbelt law was enacted in 1959 as a financial incentive for farmers to keep their land instead of selling to developers who wanted it for highways, shopping malls and homes.\n\n\"It costs a lot to farm,\" said Adam Basford, the Florida Farm Bureau Federation director of legislative affairs. \"And a lot of times people could see a higher use in that land for development.\"\n\nFarmers are fond of the greenbelt law. Critics, though, say the law is too generous and too vague. The decision to tax land on the lower agricultural rate is determined by county property appraisers, who must weigh if the land is used \"primarily for bona fide agricultural purposes.\" The lack of specifics in Florida law invites oft-documented abuse.\n\nA 2005 investigative series by the Miami Herald\u00a0chronicled several instances of property owners growing modest plants or paying ranchers to keep cows on their land to garner agricultural tax breaks on land they obviously intended to develop.\n\nThe classification also creates money gaps for counties that must be made up by other taxpayers or is lost. In 2011, nearly 248,886 properties were classified as agriculture on tax rolls, according to the Florida Department of Revenue. Even though the market value for those properties was $58 billion, the assessed value was just $5 billion.\n\nThe total lost tax revenues for local governments was about $969 million in 2011.\n\nNelson on the farm\n\nNelson\u2019s camp says his situation is different than the abuses chronicled by the Miami Herald.\n\nHe gets a greenbelt designation for his Brevard County pasture because he leases the land to small-time cattle owners. The current lessee, cattleman Jeff Darby, has a herd of about six cows and leases the land free of charge, though he is required to keep up with maintenance.\n\nThe land has been in Nelson\u2019s family since 1924. It\u2019s been a cattle pasture since 1960, including when Nelson raised and sold a herd of cattle to pay for his education at Yale University.\n\nNelson has said he is not abusing the designation because he is preserving the land and keeping it in his family. He used to live in a home attached to the property but sold it when he moved to Tallahassee to serve as Florida\u2019s treasurer and insurance commissioner.\n\nStill, the savings is considerable. Without the designation, he would have paid 13 times the amount of taxes that he did in 2011.\n\nIn 2011, the market value of Nelson\u2019s property was $2.76 million. Nelson got the lower agricultural value of $210,870 in 2011. Instead of paying $48,380 in property taxes, he paid nearly $3,696.66, according to tax records, a difference of more than $44,000.\n\nThe Brevard County property appraiser\u2019s office has tried to remove Nelson\u2019s greenbelt designation in the past, but Nelson fought to keep it and won in court. (An inspector in 1999 went to his property and found no cows; Nelson argued they escaped via a hole in the fence.)\n\nContrary to the ad\u2019s suggestion, Nelson is not shirking his tax responsibility, a spokesman said, nor is he covertly planning to develop or resell his land.\n\n\"You are not dodging taxes when you pay all the taxes that are owned on the property,\" said Dan McLaughlin, his spokesman.\n\nThose who scoff at the size of the herd grazing there now should know it\u2019s on par with most cattle businesses in Florida, McLaughlin said. About one-third of Florida farms, or 7,165, are comprised of fewer than nine cattle or calves, according to 2007 federal data.\n\nOne expert told the Times that Nelson is making an effort to \"maintain some aspect of what\u2019s a heritage family site in agriculture.\"\n\n\"I think that would be something that the state would encourage,\" Stan Geberer, who works for Fishkin & Associations, a Florida economic consulting firm, told the Times.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe ad\u2019s claims and figures about Nelson\u2019s tax bill and Brevard County property are rooted in a report from the Tampa Bay Times. It\u2019s accurate to say that Nelson was shielded from paying about $43,000 in property taxes because of his land has a greenbelt designation.\n\nThe group emphasizes that Nelson is leasing the land, though the Times story is clear he does not charge for the Melbourne farmer to graze cows there.\n\nWe think American Crossroads is stretching the truth by claiming Nelson is \"dodging\" his taxes. That\u2019s a derogatory phrase commonly used for someone who doesn\u2019t pay what they owe. That\u2019s not the case here, though people may disagree with Nelson paying the lower agricultural rate based on the presence of six cows on a vast pasture.\n\nWe rate this claim Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 24, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoybeans dropped 70 cents and corn 50 cents per bushel in two days, causing farmers to lose big money, \u201cthanks to Biden\u2019s executive orders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10207"}
