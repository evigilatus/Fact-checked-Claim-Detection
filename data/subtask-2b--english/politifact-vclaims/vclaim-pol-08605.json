The sequence starts by Christie downplaying on each show claims of a presidential run in 2016 and instead focusing on his being New Jersey\u2019s governor.\nTo illustrate that point, the clips then lead into Christie saying the state has gained \"143,000 new\u00a0 private-sector jobs.\"\nChristie\u2019s number is generally accurate, but the methodology used to measure the jobs gains isn\u2019t exactly ideal, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nFirst, the numbers.\nChristie\u2019s timeframe for measuring jobs was February 2010 -- his first full month in office -- to August 2013, the most recent month for which preliminary employment data is available.\nNew Jersey had 3,192,000 private-sector jobs in February 2010, BLS data shows. By August 2013 that figure was 3,334,400. The difference? 142,400 jobs.\nSo Christie rounded up a bit when he cited a gain of 143,000 jobs, but his number is generally solid.\nThose numbers also match employment data on the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development website.\nNext, the methodology.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe timeframe cited by Christie isn\u2019t even. Experts have told PolitiFact New Jersey on numerous occasions that the best way to evaluate employment trends is to measure seasonally adjusted, year-over-year data.\nSeasonally adjusted data is best for review because it takes into account jobs that result from seasonal hiring patterns.\nSo when looking at annual data, we often review December over December to get the most accurate picture of employment for that 12-month period.\nBut in Christie\u2019s case, we\u2019re evaluating February 2010 over preliminary data for August 2013.\nJoseph Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, agreed that it\u2019s best to review seasonally adjusted data within the context of a year. He reviewed the BLS numbers from August 2012 to August 2013 and then looked at how New Jersey\u2019s job growth compares with neighboring states.\nSeneca\u2019s analysis found that nearly half the state\u2019s private-sector job growth came during the year that he reviewed: 60,300 private-sector jobs. In addition, New Jersey\u2019s job growth rate of 1.8 percent exceeded that of New York and Connecticut, both with 1.3 percent growth, and Pennsylvania, which had a growth rate of 0.9 percent.\n\"The latest year-over-year data indicate that New Jersey is right in the middle of the pack in terms of the rate of private-sector job growth,\" Seneca said in an e-mail, adding that much of the growth has been in education, health services, leisure and hospitality, trade, transportation and utilities.\nOur ruling\nA recent segment on The Colbert Report shows Christie emphasizing his work as governor by saying New Jersey has gained \"143,000 new private-sector jobs.\"\nBLS data and an analysis by a Rutgers economics professor back up Christie\u2019s figure, which is rounded up a bit from the actual figure of 142,400 new private-sector jobs created.\nThe governor\u2019s overall point is that private-sector employment in New Jersey is increasing, and he\u2019s right.\nWe rate the statement True.
