Facebook users flagged the article as being potentially fake, as part of the social media platform\u2019s efforts to curb fake news.\nThe story is pure fiction.\nTheMiamiGazette.com calls itself \"an entertainment and satire web publication\" in its Disclaimer section. The disclaimer also stated, \"All news articles contained within The Miami Gazette are fictional and presumably satirical news.\"\nThis disclaimer is buried, appearing only in a special page in the footer part of the website. Someone surfing the Miami Gazette will hardly notice the caution about the website being fictional, and the article adopts the style of news websites to give the impression of real news.\nIn its Contact Us page TheMiamiGazette.com provides only an email address with a Gmail account. The website\u2019s domain was registered as private and does not contain additional contact information about the owners.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article was supposedly written by Anthony Brooks, who has a profile on TheMiamiGazette.com. But there is neither a photo nor contact information for Anthony Brooks.\nIn addition to providing real-sounding names of the suspects, the article was illustrated with images of a cluttered basement captioned with \"courtesy of Vernal Heights Police Department\" and cited \"Vernal Heights Chief of Police Gregory Moore.\"\nThe supposed picture of Vernal Heights Police Chief Gregory Moore traces back to the free photo download website, Pixabay.com.\nPixabay also was used for the photo of the \"\u2018tool wall\u2019 that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims\" \u00a0as it states in the fake article.\nA photo used in the article that purportedly showed \"a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals\"\u00a0traced back to 41 different results.\nAs for the suspects, we had difficulty tracking down who the men truly were, although one of them was a Georgia man named Markey Caldwell, who was arrested in 2014 for criminal trespassing.\nThere is no place in Florida with the name Vernal Heights at all, and no reports of cannibals caught eating flesh to cure diabetes and depression.\nThat would be big news, if true. In 2012 there was a real story of \"Miami Zombie\" with elements of cannibalism.\nAs for this post, it\u2019s Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-06-20 19:25:24 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Cannibals arrested in Florida claim eating human flesh cures diabetes and depression\"    TheMiamiGazette.com website   in an Internet post Tuesday, May 30, 2017 2017-05-30    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03191"}
