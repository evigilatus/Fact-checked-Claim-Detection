David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this is an easy one to tackle: The claim all charges have been dropped is simply false.\nThe confusion may stem from an announcement earlier on Oct. 13, 2020, in which prosecutors in Lake County, Ill., said they had found no basis to charge Rittenhouse under Illinois laws.\u00a0\nMore specifically, an article posted that day on JSOnline.com, the website of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, noted the Illinois authorities said they had determined the AR-15 rifle in question had been purchased, stored and used in Wisconsin, and that Rittenhouse never possessed it in Illinois.\nThus, he would not face gun-related charges there.\nBut Rittenhouse still faces Wisconsin charges of first-degree intentional homicide in the killing of two protesters and attempted intentional homicide in the wounding of a third. He also faces a misdemeanor charge of underage firearm possession.\u00a0\nThose charges are on hold while Rittenhouse\u2019s lawyers fight his extradition to Wisconsin.\nBut they have not been dropped, or otherwise magically gone away.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said:\u00a0 \"All charges dropped for Kyle Rittenhouse.\"\u00a0\nThat is flatly and plainly wrong. The shootings happened in Wisconsin, not Illinois. The Wisconsin charges remain. Rittenhouse was never charged in Illinois, so when authorities said they found no basis to issue gun-possession charges, it didn\u2019t change anything.\nWe rate the claim False", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18700"}
