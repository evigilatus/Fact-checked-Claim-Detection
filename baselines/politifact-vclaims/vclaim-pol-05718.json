Marco Rubio.\"", "truth_label": "half-true", "date": "stated on November 10, 2015 in a campaign ad:", "title": "Democrats, Clinton campaign afraid of Rubio, new super PAC says", "text": "A Republican millionaire with an apparent fondness for '90s rap has thrown his support behind U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign.\nCalifornia winery owner John Jordan\u2019s new super PAC released a one-minute commercial before the Nov. 10, 2015, GOP primary debate. The political action committee is cheekily named Baby Got PAC, a reference to the 1992 Sir Mix-a-Lot magnum opus Baby Got Back.\nIn the ad, reportedly written by Jordan, a narrator explains the PAC is pulling for Rubio over the rest of the Republicans because the Floridian is the one that Democrats fear most in the general election.\n\"It\u2019s a tough choice. So you know who we asked? Hillary Clinton and the Democrats,\" the ad said while flashing three lines as proof of their point. \"For once, they told the truth. They admitted there\u2019s one candidate who scares Hillary Clinton, and that\u2019s Sen. Marco Rubio.\"\nCue Sir Mix-a Lot: Now, we like checking campaign statements, and we cannot lie! But is this a charge Democrats just can\u2019t deny? (Sorry, we just had to get that out of the way.)\nWe should note we didn\u2019t find any instance of Hillary Clinton saying she was afraid of Rubio or any other candidate, and her campaign did not return our requests for comment. That\u2019s important to keep in mind, since the ad mentions her by name.\nSaying \"there\u2019s one candidate who scares Hillary Clinton\" implies her campaign is unconcerned with the rest of the GOP field, which likely is not the case. A November 2015 story from the Daily Beast included Democratic donors and strategists saying Clinton\u2019s campaign was until recently more occupied with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and is now focusing on Rubio as Bush fades.\nFlorida-based Republican media consultant Rick Wilson produced the ad and confirmed with PolitiFact Florida where each of the three lines featured in the commercial came from. Let\u2019s take them one at a time:\n\"A Hillary Clinton match-up with Marco Rubio is a scary thought for Democrats.\" \u2014 the New York Times: On May 22, 2015, the New York Times published an article about Democratic strategists discussing Rubio, who announced his candidacy in April. The commercial\u2019s quote is the headline word for word.\nEvery source in the story at least acknowledged Rubio was a candidate worth addressing, while some said he would be a tough opponent. That\u2019s not to say Rubio is the only candidate they are worried about, which the ad comes close to implying, but the article highlighted his strengths in contrast to Hillary Clinton. For example, the New York Times piece said Clinton is working harder on winning the Hispanic vote.\nThe story included comments from 2008 Hillary Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle; Democratic strategist Christopher Lehane; former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and his millionaire donor John Morgan; former Florida House Democratic leader Dan Gelber and more.\nCrist, who lost a Senate race to Rubio in 2010, called Rubio\u2019s story of a blue-collar upbringing \"compelling,\" while Gelber said Rubio could make \"young women swoon, old women pass out, and toilets flush themselves.\"\nThe New York Times also interviewed Steve Schale, formerly Barack Obama\u2019s Florida campaign director, who had written a blog post about the state\u2019s Hispanic voters the same month the paper published its story.\nIn that blog post, Schale wrote:\n\"Marco Rubio scares me. I\u2019ve been pretty consistent on this one. If you are a Democrat, he should be the one you don\u2019t want to face, because I do think, if he is the nominee, he is the one who could significantly change the Hispanic math in Florida and the Latino math out west. Why? I truly believe he will benefit from the same identity politics that galvanized African American voters behind Obama.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

The headline on the column was \"Why Rubio scares the Democrats.\"\nNow, we must note Schale didn\u2019t say this to Roberts, as the PAC ad claims, and Schale told us he hadn\u2019t spoken to her. She only quoted him and linked to his post. Roberts pointed to Rubio\u2019s personality, storytelling ability and defense of his Hispanic heritage as strengths.\n\"Rubio is the best storyteller in the Republican field. The tales he tells \u2014 of his father the bartender and his mother the hotel maid \u2014 send a powerful message: I know what your lives are like. I'm just like you,\" Roberts wrote.\nThat jibed with what Schale thought, and still does.\n\"I definitely did say I'm scared of Marco, and I still think he's our party's biggest threat,\" Schale told PolitiFact Florida.\nKeep in mind, however, that Schale worked for the Draft Biden 2016 super PAC to convince Vice President Joe Biden to run for president. He thinks Rubio is a threat not just to Hillary Clinton, but to any Democratic hopeful.\n\"I believe he is their strongest candidate,\" he said.\n\"Bill Clinton believes Marco Rubio is Hillary\u2019s biggest threat.\" \u2014 Fox News: The ad is referring to author Ed Klein\u2019s Oct. 14, 2015, appearance on Fox & Friends. After the first Democratic primary debate, Fox interviewed Klein, who wrote the book Unlikeable: The Problem With Hillary.\nDuring the segment, Klein described an anonymously sourced story from the book, in which Bill Clinton allegedly said Rubio was his wife\u2019s greatest challenger because of Rubio\u2019s age and appeal to Hispanic voters. (Fox News\u2019 online headline was \"Author: Bill Clinton Believes This GOP Contender Is Hillary's Biggest Threat.\")\nKlein\u2019s description of the incident in his book quotes Bill Clinton thusly: \"He\u2019s young, Hispanic, and a good speaker. He\u2019d pose a generational challenge (to Hillary, who will turn 69 in 2016) and a challenge for the Hispanic vote, which we need to win\u2026. We\u2019ve got to destroy him before he gets off the ground.\"\nThe author previously had written very critical books about the Clintons and the Obamas, and has faced criticism from both liberal and conservative camps over thin sourcing and sensational allegations. Bill Clinton\u2019s office told us it questioned Klein\u2019s credibility, and therefore the claim. A Clinton spokesman called Klein\u2019s version of events an \"alternate reality.\"\nBaby Got PAC is putting a lot of faith in one anonymously sourced anecdote for its ad. The story also doesn\u2019t constitute asking either Hillary or Bill Clinton directly whether they feel Rubio is a threat. But Klein insists the former president made the comment.\n\"I stand by the quote, which was related to me by a very reliable source who was in the room and heard Bill Clinton talk about Rubio,\" Klein told PolitiFact Florida.\nOur ruling\nBaby Got PAC\u2019s ad said Democrats \"admitted there\u2019s one candidate who scares Hillary Clinton, and that\u2019s Sen. Marco Rubio.\"\nThere\u2019s no actual statement from Hillary Clinton saying as much, so that part of the commercial is a stretch. The commercial does share some sources that quote Democratic politicians and operatives, and leans heavily on former Obama campaign director Schale, who wrote a blog post expressing some anxiety about Rubio. Schale, it\u2019s worth noting, favored Biden over Hillary Clinton initially. Baby Got PAC further puts a lot of faith in an anecdote involving Bill Clinton that is largely unsubstantiated.\nWith those caveats, it\u2019s still clear Rubio\u2019s campaign is a concern to strategists on the left.
