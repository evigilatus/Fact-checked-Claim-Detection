It\u2019s true that surgeons wear masks, but they are different masks and different circumstances and not usually worn all day.\"\nAs he reads in a matter-of-fact tone, big red capital letters frame the video: \"They want to kill 6 billion of us. Here\u2019s how they will do it.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe man in the Facebook video was described by The Bangkok Post, a Thailand-based news outlet as a doctor, prolific author, and former newspaper columnist \"who has built a career on being anti-establishment,\" and is now \"peddling played-out COVID-19 conspiracy theories.\"\nThis\u00a0video includes several unfounded and wrong claims, but this fact-check will focus on the claim about masks having a deadly effect.\nBottom line: Public health experts say masks are effective in reducing the spread of the coronavirus, and while some people may experience some discomfort wearing them, masks are generally safe to use. (The American Lung Association has suggestions on how to get used to wearing a mask.)\nWhat\u2019s known about mask usage\nFor months, people around the world have been using masks to prevent getting or spreading the coronavirus. We found no credible reports of people dying as a result of wearing a mask. Reuters in October debunked a false claim that three children in Germany died from wearing face masks. PolitiFact has also fact-checked a lot of misinformation about masks.\nNo, masks do not shut down or weaken the immune system. No, masks will not reduce blood oxygen levels.\n\"As a pulmonologist \u2014 a doctor who specializes in the respiratory system \u2014 I can assure you that behind that mask, your breathing is fine. You\u2019re getting all the oxygen you need, and your carbon dioxide levels aren\u2019t rising,\" Jonathan Parsons, a pulmonologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and director of the Ohio State Asthma Center, wrote in an August blog post.\nParsons wrote that people who experience anxiety or claustrophobia when wearing a mask can try to calm themselves by taking long, slow breaths.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Masks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher at Harvard\u2019s School of Public Health, told PolitiFact in May that, \"on the margins we could probably find extreme cases where someone, somewhere with some condition has had an issue with a mask, but that's not the average.\"\nTsai said there was no data suggesting that it was harmful to wear a standard surgical or cloth mask under normal situations.\nN95 masks (ones that create a tight seal) are considered to be the most effective in protecting the wearer from airborne particles, and are commonly used by health care workers. Because of a shortage of those masks, public health officials recommended that the general public instead use other types of masks, like cloth masks, and reserve the N95s for health care workers who are routinely exposed to patients with COVID-19.\nWhat about people with underlying medical conditions?\nThe American Lung Association says that people with chronic lung diseases may be asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 and should wear cloth face masks in public areas.\nThere is some evidence that prolonged use of N-95 masks in patients with preexisting lung disease could cause some build-up of carbon dioxide levels in the body, the association said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters earlier this year that the level of carbon dioxide likely to build up in a mask \"is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it\" and that it is \"unlikely to cause hypercapnia,\" a condition that develops when there is too much carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.\nThe CDC also says that most people with underlying medical conditions can and should wear masks. People with respiratory conditions who remain concerned about wearing a mask safely should talk with their healthcare provider, the CDC said.\nThe CDC does not recommend masks for children under 2 years old or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.\nOur ruling\nA video in a Facebook post claimed, \"Masks will kill quite a few people, it\u2019s well known that they reduce blood oxygen levels and those with respiratory and cardiac disorders will die.\"\nWe found no credible reports of people dying because they used masks to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Public health experts say it is not true that masks reduce blood oxygen levels. The CDC says that people with underlying medical conditions should still wear masks.\nThe post is not factual. We rate it False.\u00a0\nRELATED: There\u2019s no evidence that wearing standard masks is harmful to your health", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17228"}
