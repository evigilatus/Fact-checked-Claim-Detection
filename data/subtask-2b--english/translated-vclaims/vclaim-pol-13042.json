At first, the woman is happy, enjoying the viewing. But then a man speeds up and goes beyond warning signs and rushes towards a slope. When it reaches the edge, it filters on the wheelchair, and the woman falls heavily on the edge. The man walks quietly away. The Declaration does not contain any dialogue, and therefore its point of view appears through a series of imposed statements: \"In 1965, Americans made medical care in law. Today, medical care provides health insurance to 46 million Americans. More than half of Americans live in medical care on less than $28,000 a year. Now, the Republicans want to privatize medical care. Is America beautiful without medical attention?\" We have decided to verify two claims in this declaration. The first, which we will look at in a different item, is whether Ryan's plan is \"to allocate medical care.\" The other, which we will investigate here, is whether Ryan's budget proposal will leave the country \"without medical care.\" First, we will present a summary of Ryan &apos; s plan, which was approved by the House of Representatives in a vote close to the party and which recently prompted some Republicans to oppose it, amid fears that voters would not be comfortable with its approach. The Ryan plan would significantly reduce federal spending in the name of fiscal discipline. One of its main features is the radical restructuring of medical care, the Government-run health insurance programme for those aged 65 and over. Currently, the Medical Care Institution pays doctors and hospitals specific fees to the beneficiaries of the care they receive. The beneficiaries of medical care pay premiums for certain types of coverage, and younger workers contribute salary taxes. The Ryan Plan leaves medical care, as is the case for persons aged 55 and over. However, in 2022, new beneficiaries will be insured by private insurance companies instead of the Federal Government, although they will receive \"preliminary support\" - financial assistance from the Government to purchase insurance. People who need more health care will get more money. The proposal requires private insurers to accept all applicants and impose the same rate on persons of the same age. The plans will comply with the standards established by the United States Office of Personnel Management, which administers the federal staff health benefits programme. The plan gradually raises the age of entitlement to medical care to 67 years and provides less support for high-income people. We have already considered this question, with regard to the announcement, run by the Committee for the Democratic Congress Campaign, of the arm of the Democrat campaign in the House of Representatives. In part, the announcement claimed that by passing the proposal in the House of Representatives, the Republicans voted \"to end medical care.\" In conjunction with other cases of mutilation, this formula obtained the classification of \"pants on fire.\" We concluded that while Ryan's plan represented a radical change in medical care, it was not proposed to \"end\" medical care. Coverage for older persons will continue under the proposal, and the programme budget will increase each year, although it is not expected to be commensurate with the increase in medical costs. The Government continues to play a crucial role in guiding the programme and setting standards. Many Democrats criticized our rule, arguing that Ryan's proposal would fundamentally change the program - abolish its status as a government system, one payment - that the plan would end medical care. As Erica Payne, founder and president of the draft agenda, said, \"It is true that a rose by any other name will smell sweet, a rose without petals is just a barbed stick.\" But we disagree, because changing the program significantly isn't like ending it. When we called Payne to see her opinion, she said that Paulette Fuckett had mistakenly deduced the use of the ad for \"without medical attention.\" For Payne, the question raises a broader philosophical question rather than making a statement about Ryan's plan. Payne said: \"He seeks to broaden the debate on this specific issue by raising the issue of national philosophy.\" \"Is America beautiful without medical care?\" is a question that all Americans must discuss. In these difficult budgetary times, it is important to study what we value more, and any of those things we value are indeed crucial to our national pride, and indeed to our identity. The legislator who thinks our country is \"beautiful\" without medical care is likely to be more likely to support the shredding of the program into a shadow than before. We understand her argument, but we believe that there are reasonable sights -- especially seeing an old lady thrown off a cliff -- Because we found other problems in the DCCC Declaration that we did not find in the announcement of the draft agenda, we do not specifically give this claim a classification of the pants of fire. But the idea that Paul Ryan's budget proposal would leave the country \"without medical care\" deserves a false rating. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13042"}
