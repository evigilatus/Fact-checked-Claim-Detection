Health officials and media outlets debunked that one, and we rated it False.\nNow comes a supposed remedy that\u2019s a bit more complex: Drinking lots of water and gargling. That\u2019s the recommendation from a viral image of a mannequin-like head and neck with these words:\n\"Corona virus before it reaches the lungs it remains in the throat for four days and at this time the person begins to cough and have throat pains. If he drinks water a lot and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
