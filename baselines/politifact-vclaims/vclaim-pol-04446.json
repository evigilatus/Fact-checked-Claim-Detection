She pointed out that medical cannabis can not only be smoked, but be packaged as ointments, oils, pills and skin patches.\nIt sounded peculiar to us to say that medical marijuana can\u2019t get you high, regardless of the chemical content. We checked with some experts to clear the air.\nDoctor\u2019s orders\nFlorida voters will decide in November 2016 whether to allow medical marijuana in the state. The proposed constitutional amendment would allow patients with cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis \"or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated\" to obtain cannabis with a doctor\u2019s recommendation.\nWhat the system would truly look like is still anyone\u2019s guess, because the amendment leaves most of the details up to the state Legislature and state health department. Patients would get a state-registered ID card that would allow them to get their marijuana, but the how, when and where of it wouldn\u2019t be decided until the amendment passes. \u00a0\nAlso unknown is just what kind of \"medical-grade marijuana\" will be available. Amendment 2 doesn\u2019t place restrictions on what forms of cannabis the state could allow, including cannabis in its smokable form.\nTo understand the types of marijuana or marijuana products we\u2019re talking about, we need a quick chemistry lesson.\nCannabis contains roughly 500 compounds, 70 of which are psychoactive. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive ingredient in the marijuana plant.\nThe level of THC in a plant varies based on the strain, the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption.\nAlso present is a substance called cannabidiol, known as CBD, which is an antioxidant and has properties that are thought to protect the brain. It\u2019s also not psychoactive like THC. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida\u2019s 2014 law approved low-THC cannabis oil or vapor products containing CBD for patients with muscle spasms, cancer, epilepsy and terminal illnesses. Fifteen other states have similar laws. Even the National Institute on Drug Abuse says CBD may prove useful in treating epilepsy as well as inflammation and mental illnesses or addictions.\nProducts like cannabis oil are made from strains of marijuana already bred to be high in CBD and low in THC, although THC still is a part of the equation. Research shows that compound is what brings CBD into the brain.\nNow for how this applies to McCray\u2019s statement.\nUnited for Care spokeswoman Bianca Garza said McCray meant to dispel the notion that medical marijuana patients obtain their medicine for the sole purpose of feeling its well-known euphoric effects.\n\"The point being made in the statement is that doctors and patients will decide on a care plan that will enable them to become more normal,\" Garza said in an email. \"In other words, they'll decide on a dosage appropriate for their debilitating condition to feel less pain, to have fewer seizures and spasms, etc. It will be decided by a Florida licensed physician and will not lead to patients being \u2018high.\u2019 \"\nEssentially, their argument is one of semantics: Medical marijuana patients won\u2019t be getting stoned, they\u2019ll be using medication under the supervision of a doctor as a form of treatment. That precludes the idea that patients will just be taking marijuana as a recreational drug, although Garza conceded that \"like any medicine, there\u2019s the possibility for abuse.\"\nUnited for Care\u2019s point of view still doesn\u2019t mean some forms of medical marijuana aren\u2019t capable of getting patients baked. Marijuana still has physiological effects, whether it\u2019s doctor-approved or not.\nDr. David Casarett, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and author of the book Stoned: A Doctor's Case for Medical Marijuana, said that low-THC strains or oils that have only CBD don\u2019t produce the same buzzed feeling as a joint. But higher-THC marijuana still \"will most certainly get you high,\" he said.\n\"Just calling something \u2018medical grade\u2019 won't prevent you from getting high,\" Casarett said. \"It's like alcohol. Laboratory grade ethanol will get you just as drunk as home-brewed moonshine with the same alcohol content.\"\nOur ruling\nA representative of United for Care said, \"Medical-grade marijuana alone\u00a0will not get that patient \u2018high,\u2019 no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant.\"\nThe group said McKay is referring to the controlled conditions under which medical marijuana would be monitored by doctors for use by patients. But her word choice could easily lead to misunderstanding.\nWhile there are non-euphoric strains of cannabis that are already being used as treatments for some conditions, it\u2019s not accurate to say that no form of medical marijuana will get you high. High-THC medical cannabis will still produce the same intoxicating effects as the street form of the drug will.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/38a55377-6e3a-4cc5-89b5-fcee3048db74", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04446"}
