For a long time, Trump has been whining about the US trade deficit with China, promising as a candidate to use import taxes to rearrange trade arrangements along what is believed to be more reciprocal lines. \"Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China,\" said Trump on March 23rd, said a press conference. \"We can't let that happen.\" The trade balance of a country is simply the difference between the value of its imports and exports, and a trade deficit occurs when imports exceed exports. This can be measured in terms of both goods and services. We took a closer look at Trump's numbers. It turns out he's too far from the target. United States-China merchandise trade The deficit in 1990 was $10.4 billion. It rose to $83.8 billion in 2000 and to $273 billion in 2010, according to the United States International Trade Commission. In 2017, the value of Chinese goods imported into the United States ($505 billion) exceeded US merchandise exports to China ($130 billion) by some $375 billion. The Americans have collected billions of purchases of everything from Chinese-made communications and computer equipment to kitchen and shoe equipment. Based on trade in goods, the Trump 500 billion figure is less than $125 billion. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 U.S.-China trade in services when I was a worker in goods and services, which economists say painted the most complete picture, claiming it was even further. According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the United States had already achieved a surplus in trade in services with China in 2017, amounting to about $38.5 billion. When you combined this surplus into the overall trade balance of the two countries, the United States recorded a deficit of approximately $336 billion with China last year - meaning that Trump's figure fell by about $164 billion. Trump may have mixed the Chinese deficit with the US total trade deficit of $566 billion in 2017, according to UNOPS. But Trump can also use $500 billion as usual. We assessed this claim mostly as false when he said it in 2015. Our Governor Trump said, \"Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China.\" In 2017, the value of Chinese goods imported into the United States exceeded US merchandise exports to China by some $375 billion. During the same period, the United States has already achieved a $38.5 billion surplus in trade in services with China. Overall, in terms of both goods and services, the United States trade deficit with China in 2017 was about $336 billion, which means that Trump has fallen by about $164 billion. We're assessing this mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02257"}
