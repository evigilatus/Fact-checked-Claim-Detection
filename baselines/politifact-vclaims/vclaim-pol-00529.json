The caption says, \"When covering President Trump\u2019s trip to England, why is it that every news channel is showing the same footage of Trump protesters but not one will show the Thousands who showed up in support? Well here is a photo of what English Trump Supporters look like.\"\nThe photo was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nNope, the people in that photo were not there for Donald Trump (who wasn\u2019t even in the country yet anyway).\nThe parade pictured actually took place on June 2, a day before Trump arrived in the UK, and was a celebration of Liverpool Football Club\u2019s 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the 2019 Champions League final in Madrid. The BBC reported that police estimated more than 750,000 fans turned out to the victory parade.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liverpool Echo published an article on the miscaptioned photo.\nThe photo wasn\u2019t even snapped in London, where the president stayed during his 3-day visit. It took place in Liverpool, naturally, which is located more than 200 miles north of the country\u2019s capital. The team\u2019s predominant color is red\u00a0and did not represent the red apparel that some of the president\u2019s supporters wear.\nThe claim comes as several outlets reported that tens of thousands of people gathered in the streets of London to protest Trump\u2019s visit. There were reportedly pockets of Trump supporters in those crowds, too, but this photo being captioned as \"thousands of English Trump supporters\" is incorrect.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!\nCorrection, June 18, 2019: An earlier version of this story included a mistaken attribution for a story on the miscaptioned photo. The Liverpool Echo published the article. This correction does not change the rating.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00529"}
