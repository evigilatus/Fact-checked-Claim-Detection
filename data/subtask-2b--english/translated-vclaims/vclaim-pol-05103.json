Is that right? We looked at the most frequent series of congressional riches -- an annual study by the Capitol Hill Roll Call. We found that Saunders' net value puts it at the bottom of one fifth of the 100-member room. This list shows Sanders and the other 18 senators, whose net value was lower than in calendar year 2014. Negative value means greater liabilities than assets. :: Senate net rank Senator 82 Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. 160,000, 83 Mike Lee, R-Utah 120,000, Kristin Gillibrand, D-NY. 120,000, 85 Lindsay Graham, R-S.C. 90,000, 86 John Thun, R-S.D. $87,000, James Lanford, R-Okla $88,000, Jeff Flack, R-Aries $50,000, Tammy Baldwin, D-Weiss - $80,000, Corey Gardner, R-Colo. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 11 January, 2021 - $110,000, 91 Christopher Murphy, D-Conn. - $140,000 92 Marco Rubio, R-Fla. - $160,000 Jack Reed, D-R.I. - $170,000 94 John Cornen, R-Texas - $230,000 95 Mark Kirk, R-Ill. - $260,000 96 Patrick Leh, D-Vt. - $350,000 Roger Wicker, R-Miss. Brian Chatz, D-Hawai, Debbie Stabino, D-Mich, D-Mich, $590,000, Martin Heinrich, D-N-M, $720,000, we must note some warnings. The Roll Call survey is based on Congressional financial disclosure forms, which provide only wide ranges of income to the public from different categories. To determine the measure used in its ranking - the lower net value - Roll used the reported total minimum value of the assets of legislators less the reported total minimum value of their liabilities. So the real amount could be higher. In addition, the Act exempts various types of acquisitions from disclosure, including the value of the main residence, the value of personal property not held for investment purposes and the value of retirement accounts. (The Centre for Responsive Policy contains a summary of what should be included in these forms here. These factors led Roll Cal to warn in his survey that \"the detection forms are at best incomplete.\" In fact, the data are sufficiently vague so that the differences between the net value of senators gathered around Sanders are about to be non-discriminatory. In fact, 10 other senators exceed the above 18th list with a net value of less than $400,000 - Tom Cotton, Ark., Sherwood Brown, De Ohio; Robert Men\u00e9ndez, D.N.J.; Barbara Mikulski, D. :: Johnny Ernest, R-Iowa; Bob Casey, D-PA; Corey Booker, D-N.J.; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; Mike Enzie, R-Wyo. Although Charles Schommer, D-N.Y., who said Sanders was quite right that at the lower end of the room's schedule: according to Roll Cal's calculations, the average number of senators was $1.1 million, or almost seven times the net value of Sanders. Our rule, Sanders, said, \"I am still one of the poorest senators in the United States.\" It is important to remember that financial disclosure forms produce very vague values that cannot be 100% certain in terms of the ranking of each senator in net terms. In a net value of at least $160,000, we do not say that Sanders is poor. However, reliable accounts using financial disclosure forms have put Sanders as the 19 lowest net value in the Senate. We're mostly evaluating the statement right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8f91756-1e20-48c6-9d55-44f4d3c615b1", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05103"}
