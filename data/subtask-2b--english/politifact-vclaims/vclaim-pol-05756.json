Martin O\u2019Malley suggested at the First in the South Democratic Presidential forum.\n\"When President Obama was running for re-election, I was glad to step up and work very hard for him, while Sen. Sanders was trying to find someone to primary him,\" O\u2019Malley said on Nov. 6, adding that he\u2019s \"a lifelong Democrat\" unlike Sanders, a former independent, and Hillary Clinton, a former Republican.\nThat\u2019s \"categorically false,\" Sanders said on ABC\u2019s This Week two days later: \"Somebody asked me years ago, do you think there should be a primary opponent to Barack Obama? And I don't know exactly the words that I -- I'm not sure -- what's wrong with a primary situation?\"\nSo who\u2019s right?\nThe Sanders campaign didn\u2019t get back to us, but O\u2019Malley\u2019s spokesperson sent us several examples of Sanders saying a primary challenge wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea.\nWe also searched Google, Nexis and CQ for comments Sanders made on the topic of a primary challenge. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\u2022 March 16, 2011 WNYC: \"If a progressive Democrat wants to run, I think it would enliven the debate, raise some issues, and people have a right to do that. I've been asked whether I am going to do that. I'm not. I don't know who is, but in a democracy, it's not a bad idea to have different voices out there.\"\n\u2022 July 22, 2011 Thom Hartmann Radio Program: \"I think one of the reasons that the president has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him, and I think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda as opposed to what Obama is doing. \u2026 At this point, I have not (encouraged anyone), but I am now giving thought to it. There are a lot of smart, honest, progressive people who I think can be good presidents.\"\n\u2022 Aug. 12, 2011 C-SPAN: \"If you\u2019re asking me, do I think at the end of the day that Barack Obama is going to be the Democratic nominee for president in 2012? I do. But do I believe that it is a good idea for our democracy, and for the Democratic Party \u2014 and I speak, by the way, as an independent \u2014 that people start asking the president some hard questions about why he said one thing during his previous campaign and then is doing another thing today on Social Security, on Medicare? I think it is important that that discussion take place.\"\n\u2022 Nov. 13, 2011 Politico: Sanders refused to say whether he would back the president in 2012, but said he hopes \"the president never forgets who elected him to the White House. It was not Wall Street, although they contributed. It was not the big money interests. It was working families, lower-income people and the middle class.\" He also urged Obama to \"stop reaching negotiated agreements with Republicans that are extremely weak and disadvantageous to ordinary people. ... I certainly hope and expect to be supporting the president, but it\u2019s a little bit early in the process.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s clear that Sanders was suggesting a primary challenge to move Obama to the left, experts said, but not exactly the way O\u2019Malley phrased it.\n\"I'm not sure if he was actually actively \u2018trying to find someone,\u2019 but it is clear that he thought it would be a good idea if someone did decide to challenge him,\" said Jennifer Mercieca, a historian of American political discourse at Texas A&M University. (Sanders\u2019 comments sparked a rumbling in the media as well as the question of whether that someone would be Hillary Clinton.)\nKathleen Kendall, a communications professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in presidential campaign rhetoric, noted that Sanders was expressing strong dissatisfaction with Obama\u2019s policies -- a point that didn\u2019t go unnoticed by the White House.\nFour anonymous senior officials for Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign told BuzzFeed that Sanders was \"either attacking the president from the left or doing little to get him elected.\"\n\"Every indication we had was that he was considering a primary challenge,\" one unnamed official said in the BuzzFeed story.\nSanders eventually endorsed Obama over Mitt Romney, telling CNN in May 2012, \"I think Obama is by far the preferable candidate. Is Obama doing everything I want? Absolutely not, and among other things, he has not been as strong as he should standing up to Wall Street.\"\nOur ruling\nO\u2019Malley said, \"When President Obama was running for re-election \u2026 Sen. Sanders was trying to find someone to primary him.\"\nAs a sitting senator, Sanders' comments at a minimum were provocative: He didn't\u00a0think it was a bad idea for a candidate to run against Obama in the primary. He spoke positively of such a scenario several times. When Sanders endorsed Obama, Sanders said it was because Obama was preferable to Romney.\u00a0That doesn\u2019t mean Sanders was actively searching for a candidate to actually run against Obama.\nWe rate O\u2019Malley\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05756"}
