No.", "text": "President Donald Trump has repeatedly stressed that his administration has achieved transparency at the championship level. He did so in a tweet on 18 August 2018, focusing on the White House's cooperation with Special Adviser Robert Mueller: \"I have allowed the White House Chancellor Don McGann, and all other members of the White House staff, to cooperate fully with the Special Adviser. In addition, we have readily submitted more than 1 million pages of documents. More transparent in history. No collusion, no obstruction. \"Stalking witches\" More recently, during an exchange of views on 20 May with journalists at the White House Park, Trump said: \"There has never been such an open and transparent administration before. Then four days later, Trump reaffirmed the point in another exchange in the park with the White House journalists: \"I was the most transparent president - I - in history.\" Trump specifically mentioned the supply of 500 witnesses, the testimony of his lawyer, 2,500 subpoenas and 1.4 million pages of documents to Mueller. But is running this guy up to noisy? He does not consider his relations with the Mueller Group, his refusal to release his tax returns, or his unwillingness to cooperate with the summonses issued by Congress. In fact, many of the experts we called said that they laughed out loud when they first heard Trump say this allegation. These included Jeffrey A. Angel, Founding Director of the Presidential History Centre at the Southern Methodist University. \"This may not be more serious\" than Trump's questionable allegations, \"but it's the most ridiculous,\" said Angel. \"Not as if Trump is the only president with a problematic record of transparency, but he has expanded the scope and scope\" of those problems. (President Barack Obama, for example, made 35 promises to improve transparency, and we appreciated 12 of those broken promises. The White House did not respond to this article, but White House spokesman Stephen Groves made a statement to Pol\u00edtico. \"The president was completely transparent during Mueller's investigation,\" said the statement. \"All staff required by the White House have been made available for interviews, tens of thousands of documents have been submitted, and questions have been answered about the ridiculous allegations of delusion. The White House and the Department will continue to cooperate with legitimate oversight in Congress while protecting the rights and privileges of the executive branch. Besides, the president and his staff deal with the press and answer their questions almost every day.\" However, our view of the record of transparency in Trump management suggests that the current administration has been less transparent - not more transparent - than the other Presidents recently. The White House in Trump was partly, but not entirely, cooperative with the investigation. More than 1.4 million papers have been transferred, and some 20 administrators have not been prevented from testifying to Muller. But in other ways, the White House cooperation was not enough. As we have stated, Mueller and his team have sought more than a year to speak in person to the President, but they have ultimately refused. Finally, the Special Counsel agreed to accept Trump's written answers to the questions, but his answers were \"insufficiently,\" as Mueller said, and included dozens of cases in which Trump claimed that he did not remember the information requested. M\u00f8ller also noted that Trump refused to answer questions about obstruction of justice, or questions about events during the presidential transitional period. In addition, Mueller documented cases in which Trump attempted to obstruct the investigation or direct his staff to do so, including shooting Muller. \"The President's efforts to influence the investigation were often unsuccessful,\" according to Muller's report, \"but this is largely because the people who surrounded the President refused to follow orders or respond to his requests.\" While officials of the Trump campaign witnessed in the past before Congressional commissions of inquiry, the White House prevented officials - and even former officials - from testifying or submitting documents to Congress since the Muller report. These include the former White House lawyer Don McGann, former White House contact manager Hope Hicks, and Annie Donaldson, a senior assistant in McGanne. Trump also filed an action to block summonses for his work records by the Council of Representatives &apos; Oversight and Reform Committee and to suspend two banks with which he was working - the German Bank and First Capital - from cooperating with the summonses issued by Congress. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, fighting over congressional orders was no longer new. President Bill Clinton confirmed an executive privilege during the investigation of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, as President Barack Obama confirmed during the investigation of the \"fast and anger\" programme, in which federal agents allowed the sale of weapons and their bringing to Mexico so that they could trace the weapons. But the experts say Trump is on his way to meet or exceed the opposition by President Richard Nixon during Watergate when he became uncooperative with habeas corpus in Congress. \"Trump resisted censorship to a greater extent than usual, with a total refusal to cooperate, rather than to give and give,\" said Eric Schickler, from the University of California-Berkeley, a political scientist and co-author of the book \"President's Inquiry: Congressional Examinations on Presidential Power.\" So far, she hasn't broken any previous Trump tax returns to Nixon from presidential candidates who have released a copy of their tax returns, usually for several years. Home Democrats have demanded that the IRS release his revenues, but Treasury Secretary Steve Menoshin has refused to do so. The dispute is expected to go to the Tribunal. The press briefings stopped Trump regularly to ask questions from journalists in the White House garden or while travelling from event to event. His assistants, too. However, regular, institutional and lengthy briefings by his departments have slowed to almost zero. On June 2, 2019, the Washington Post reported that the last time press secretary Sarah Hackabe Sanders attended a regular briefing \"was 83 days ago, a record period for not briefing the press. The previous record (43 days) was established in March, which broke the January index. It's not just the White House. The Post reported that 31 May 2019 had seen one year since the last press briefing in the Pentagon, which had been held at least weekly for years. Access to government information reflected a practice that began under Obama when visiting records were made public at the White House. After a lawsuit, the White House in Trump agreed to a settlement in which part of those logs would be released. At the same time, some White House employees were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements, even trainees, according to the daily monster. More generally, Associated Press released an analysis in March 2018 which showed that \"the federal government has imposed censorship or withheld or said that it cannot find records sought by citizens, journalists and others in the past year more than ever before. In November 2018, the FOIA project issued data showing that the FIOA proceedings reached a record level in fiscal year 2018. (The Federation Act is a 1967 law that grants the public the right to seek access to records from federal agencies. \"I can't think of an area where President Trump was more transparent\" than Obama, as John Wonderlich, CEO of Sunrise Foundation for Transparency, said. Feeding Trump Twitter even if one region may be considered more transparent -- feeding Trump Twitter -- actually undermines scrutiny and openness. The Trump Tweets already provide a report on the flow of awareness about what's going on in his mind -- the kinds of visions that usually emerge after the President leaves office and issues memoirs or writes memoirs, as Lori L. Rice, a political scientist at the University of South Illinois - Edwardsville, said. But the downside is that Trump tweetes often contain errors, contradictory information, or unclear arguments -- and unlike giving and receiving press conferences, tweetings cannot be examined immediately by journalists. Twitter allows Trump to claim, without immediate reaction, that American consumers will not pay for tariffs (miscellaneous) or that former presidents always get high degrees of approval when the economy was strong (fire pants). The Trump tweet was \"a form of communication between the government and the public that circumvents the free press,\" as was said by Jennifer Gregill, an assistant professor at the Institute of Science at Syracuse University. :: Newhouse Public Communication School. Our Governor Trump said, \"There has never been, before, an administration that was very open and transparent.\" Trump cited his cooperation with the Mueller investigation, but Muller himself found several major shortcomings in the White House efforts in Trump. Furthermore, the Trump Administration has compiled a record of aggressive opposition to congressional summonses, its long-standing refusal to participate in its tax returns, its proximity to the completion of press briefings, and a greater number of cases requiring information from the Department under the initiative.
