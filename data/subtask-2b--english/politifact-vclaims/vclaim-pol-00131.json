The Facebook post does not include any sources, and we did not find corresponding news stories or government data to support it.\u00a0\nICE does not track deportations based on race or ethnicity. The agency has statistics on where people are sent, but that alone doesn\u2019t indicate someone\u2019s race.\u00a0\nPew Research Center estimated that in 2017 there were 9.75 million unauthorized people ages 18 and older.

The story identifies the deported man, John Cunningham, as a white immigrant. In addition to Cunningham, another man from Ireland who lived in the United States illegally and a representative from Boston's Irish International Immigrant Center, \"all acknowledged that, as white men, they can fly under the radar of those who associate unauthorized immigrants with Mexico and Central America,\" the PRI story said.\nA year before ICE arrested Cunningham, he told PRI: \"Most people think undocumented and they think people who come across the southern border. They\u2019re not thinking about the Irish guy who lives right next to them. They don\u2019t see that part of it, but we have to live with that every day.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPR in January 2018 also reported that a then-19-year-old man from Ireland, Dylan O\u2019Riordan, had been detained by ICE and was scheduled to be deported. \"O'Riordan didn't necessarily think being white would save him from deportation orders.

ICE told NPR that O\u2019Riordan overstayed the terms of his admission.\nIn fiscal year 2018, ICE deported close to 260,000 people.
