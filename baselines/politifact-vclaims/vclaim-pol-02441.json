Right now, it isn\u2019t,\" Evans said on her campaign website. \"Georgia is 40th in income inequality, 40th in high school graduation, and has the lowest minimum wage in the country.\"\nWe wondered if Georgia in fact has the lowest minimum wage in the nation.\nIt does, but it\u2019s not alone (tied with Wyoming), and most of hourly wage employees are paid above the state\u2019s minimum wage: at least $7.25, which is also the federal minimum wage.\nGeorgia\u2019s minimum wage and how it compares to the rest of the nation\nGeorgia\u2019s state law sets the minimum wage at $5.15 per hour, but the federal Fair Labor Standards Act still applies, meaning most employees are covered under the\u00a0federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.\nWyoming, which equally has a $5.15 minimum wage, also says that when the federal minimum wage is higher than the state\u2019s, the federal minimum wage applies to most workers.\n\"Like Georgia, Wyoming also has a $5.15 minimum wage, the lowest in the country. And while, thankfully, many Georgians are protected by a federal wage floor, many Georgians are not,\" said Adam Ney, research director for the Evans campaign. \"The fact remains that Georgia has the lowest minimum wage in the country and that we must increase it because everybody deserves a fair day\u2019s pay for a hard day\u2019s work.\"\nWho doesn\u2019t get the federal minimum wage? There are exemptions in the law for certain farm workers, seasonal workers, health aides, and workers who receive tips.\nIn 2016, Georgia had about 2.3 million workers paid hourly rates, and 51,000 of them (or 2.2 percent) were paid below the federal minimum wage, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn estimated 90,000, or 3.9 percent, were paid at or below the federal minimum wage.\nOverall, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina had the highest percentages of hourly paid workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage, at or about 5 percent, BLS said.\nGeorgia is one of seven states that have either a lower state minimum wage than the federal standard, or no state minimum wage at all, said Wesley Tharpe, research director at the left-leaning think tank Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.\n\"In practice, the vast majority of workers in every state are subject to the federal requirement of $7.25 an hour,\" Tharpe said.\nTipped workers, including servers, are also paid a lower hourly rate in most states including Georgia, Tharpe said. \"Some evidence suggests their tips don\u2019t always sum to get them about the required $7.25 federal rate,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nEvans said Georgia \"has the lowest minimum wage in the country.\"\nGeorgia\u2019s minimum wage of $5.15 per hour is the lowest in the nation, but Wyoming also has the same minimum wage.\nAlso, most of Georgia\u2019s workers paid hourly rates earn the federal minimum of $7.25.\nEvans\u2019 statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
