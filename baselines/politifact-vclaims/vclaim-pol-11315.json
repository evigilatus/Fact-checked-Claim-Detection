When opponents attack, declare, \"That\u2019s not what our budget does!\" Meanwhile, fill in missing details in the other guy\u2019s budget with the least flattering interpretation you can calculate.\n\nRepeat.\n\nPresident Barack Obama filled in some details of the GOP budget resolution passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in a speech to a meeting of news executiveson April 3, 2012 \u2014 using his own assumptions.\n\n\"This new House Republican budget ... proposes massive new cuts in annual domestic spending \u2014 exactly the area where we\u2019ve already cut the most. And I want to actually go through what it would mean for our country if these cuts were to be spread out evenly. So bear with me. I want to go through this \u2014 because I don\u2019t think people fully appreciate the nature of this budget. \u00a0\n\n\"The year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each.\"\n\nHe went on, listing nearly a dozen specific ways the plan from House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan would cut programs \u2014 again, assuming cuts were evenly spread. Then he clarified that Republicans \"don\u2019t specify exactly the cuts they would make.\"\n\nStill, he doubles down on his list: \"This is not conjecture. I am not exaggerating. These are facts. And these are just the cuts that would happen the year after next.\"\n\nWe thought we would start by asking: Is that true? If cuts were spread evenly, would nearly 10 million college students see their aid cut by more than $1,000 each?\n\nThe Pell Grant program\n\nWe asked the White House to explain Obama\u2019s math. We talked to the House Budget Committee, looked through the budget documents and reached out to other budget experts.\n\nThe House Budget Committee says such a claim about college aid cuts is simply false. More on that in a minute.\n\nObama\u2019s claim relies on funding in the Ryan plan for federal Pell Grants. The program provides the largest source of grant funding for needy college students, with more than 9.7 million students expected to get grants worth up to $5,635 in 2013, according to the Education Department.\n\nIt goes without saying that\u2019s the only way some students might afford to go to college. But the costs of the program have been soaring, with discretionary costs more than doubling since 2008, according to the Education Department \u2014 mostly because there are more eligible students.\n\nHouse Republicans accompanied the budget with a report that spells out ways to rein in the Pell program. For example, keeping the Pell maximum grant award in 2013 at this year's level of $5,550. The House Budget Committee says it would stay at that level for the full 10 years of the budget, key to the argument that Obama\u2019s claim is false, though that's not clear in the report.\n\nBut there\u2019s disagreement between the House Budget Committee and the White House Office of Management and Budget over how seriously to take House recommendations that aren\u2019t in the actual budget resolution.\n\nIn the absence of direction from the budget resolution, OMB says it\u2019s justified in applying the Republican budget\u2019s cuts to nondefense discretionary spending across the board, leading to Obama\u2019s statement that \"if these cuts were to be spread out evenly \u2026 the year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each.\"\n\nThe Ryan plan\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about what a budget resolution actually is \u2014 merely a guidance document for policymakers.\n\n\"Even in places where it makes assumed cuts to get to its budget numbers, it doesn't actually have the ability to force them to happen,\" said Steve Ellis, vice president for Taxpayers for Common Sense. House committees propose legislation to do that.\n\nStill, the budget passed by the House on March 29, 2012, provides an outline. What does it say about Pell Grant funding?\n\nNothing.\n\nBut the accompanying House Budget Committee report on the budget resolution offers a series of \"illustrative options\" to achieve its savings, saying, \"The committees of jurisdiction will make final policy determinations.\"\n\nThe suggestions include requiring that students attend school at least half-time and changing the maximum income limit to be eligible. (It doesn\u2019t actually specify what that new limit might be. Jason Delisle, an education budget expert at the New America Foundation, has made some guesses.)\n\nAmong those suggestions: \"To get program costs back to a sustainable level, the budget recommends a maximum award of $5,550.\" It says the award would be fully funded through discretionary, rather than mandatory, spending. (That means an even bigger funding crunch in a shrinking pool of discretionary dollars.)\n\nMoira Mack, spokeswoman for the OMB, points out that recommendation isn\u2019t included in the actual budget resolution passed by the House \u2014 which does include policy statements on big issues such as Medicare and Social Security. Meanwhile, she says, the report isn\u2019t clear about whether the maximum applies just to the coming year or to the entire 10-year-window covered by the budget. (The language just before the \"illustrative options\" is specific to fiscal year 2013.)\n\nSo the OMB calculates that the Ryan budget keeps the maximum grant at $5,550 in 2013 only. In 2014, the budget\u2019s 14.3 percent cut in nondefense discretionary spending from the year before \u2014 applied evenly to the Pell program \u2014 would push the maximum award amount down to to $4,595 and leave some students with nothing at all, with an average cut of more than $1,000 per student.\n\n(The president\u2019s budget doesn\u2019t clarify how it cuts spending in order to increase the maximum award \u2014 but compared with Ryan\u2019s plan, there\u2019s more funding available for nondefense discretionary spending, such as Pell grants.)\n\nBudget experts at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities made a calculation similar to Obama's.\n\n\"The $1,000 was in the range of what we estimate would happen if you eliminated the\nmandatory funding and made a few other policy changes but did not significantly reduce the number of people who are eligible,\" said James Horney, vice president for federal fiscal policy.\n\nIt\u2019s just as possible that lawmakers could reduce eligibility, rather than cut the maximum award \u2014\u00a0leading to a different sort of statistic. Say, \"Millions of students would lose access to the Pell Grant program.\"\n\nOr lawmakers could choose to protect both eligibility and the $5,550, leading to bigger cuts in other programs.\n\nSo is Obama\u2019s math fair?\n\nEllis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, says it\u2019s tricky to say. \"Averaging cuts isn't an accurate way to describe what a budget does,\" he said. \"That said, the budget is not that prescriptive, so saying it wouldn't lead to something being cut is hard to argue as well.\"\n\nBut that\u2019s precisely what the House Budget Office argues.\n\n\"Our budget ensures that we maintain the current maximum Pell award,\" said Gerrit Lansing, press secretary for the House Budget Committee, sustaining the 2012 award amount in the Ryan plan for 10 years. \"... Yet again, the president has made assumptions about our budget that can't be sourced to our budget. The president is arguing: 'While Ryan doesn't assume X, let's just say he does so that I can get my talking point to work.'\"\n\nWilliam McBride, an economist at the business-backed Tax Foundation, echoes that idea, saying, \"As far as I know, there is no clear basis for the president\u2019s claim. There is nothing in the Ryan budget that would suggest that. The burden of proof is with the president.\"\n\nRoberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, says there simply isn\u2019t enough detail in the Ryan plan to say how it might affect people when it\u2019s all in place. And in that case, estimating cuts across the board is reasonable.\n\nDelisle, the education funding expert at the New America Foundation, developed his own set of assumptions to evaluate the Ryan plan\u2019s effect on Pell funding.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

He included such a detail about Pell Grants, saying \"the year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each.\"\n\nTo his credit, Obama clarified that Republicans didn\u2019t specify those cuts themselves and that they might apply cuts in ways other than the president assumed. But he hurts himself when he engages in a detailed analysis based on his own assumptions and then declares, \"This is not conjecture.\"\n\nBudget experts tell us that applying cuts evenly in the absence of other information is fair, assuming he\u2019s clear about what he\u2019s doing. But Obama's figure was based on the assumption that savings would be achieved by, among other things, reducing the maximum grant level in 2013 and beyond. The problem is, House Republicans say that their report expresses a preference to maintain a maximum award of $5,550. But that preference isn\u2019t in the budget resolution passed by the House.\n\nThe president's statement is accurate using his set of assumptions, but his assumptions ignore a preference that House Republicans say was reflected in the report accompanying the Ryan budget \u2014 that Pell grant maximums not be reduced beyond 2013. And, if other means were used to reduce spending on Pell Grants, such as lowering income eligibility, the impact could be different.
