But Trump claimed that the FBI actually found his campaign aide had not lied to agents.\n\"General Flynn, he was a man who had an incredible record in the military, you see what happened to him,\" Trump told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. \"The FBI said he wasn't lying, as I understand it, and if the Mueller group said he was lying, and you know what he has gone through, and what so many others have gone through.\"\nIn the waning days of his presidency, Barack Obama on Dec. 29, 2016, responded to Russia\u2019s interference in the election by expelling 35 Russian diplomats and issuing new sanctions.\nFollowing Obama\u2019s move against Russia, Flynn spoke to Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The special counsel established that Flynn asked Kislyak to \"refrain from escalating the situation.\" Kislyak later said that Russia \"had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of his request.\"\nThe next day, Putin announced that he would not retaliate against the Obama administration\u2019s sanctions \u2014 a move that Trump praised later that day on Twitter:\n\"Great move on delay (by V. Putin),\" Trump tweeted. \"I always knew he was very smart!\"\nThe following month, Flynn, who was at this point Trump\u2019s national security adviser, spoke to the FBI agents. That\u2019s when, according to the special counsel, Flynn falsely said he never discussed the Obama administration\u2019s Russia sanctions with Kislyak.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut apparently Flynn didn\u2019t appear flustered or nervous when he lied to the FBI. A partially redacted FBI memo \u2014 known as a 302 \u2014 states that the FBI agents said Flynn \"did not give any indicators of deception.\" During Michael Flynn\u2019s sentencing phase, the special counsel reiterated the agents\u2019 impression.\nThis seems to be the basis for Trump\u2019s claim. But Trump\u2019s selective reading gives a false impression itself.\nLawyers for the special counsel\u2019s office said Flynn\u2019s seemingly guileless demeanor did not change the fact that he was lying \u2014 which Flynn himself admitted.\n\"Those misimpressions do not change the fact \u2014 as the defendant has admitted in sworn testimony to this District Court \u2014 that he was indeed lying, and knowingly made false statements to FBI agents in a national security investigation,\" they wrote.\nIn addition to lying about discussions he had with Kislyak about the Obama sanctions, Flynn also admitted to lying to FBI agents when he falsely told them he had not discussed having Russia help delay or defeat a vote on a United Nations Security Council resolution. \u00a0\nOur ruling\nTrump said of his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, \"The FBI said he wasn't lying.\"\nTrump is taking FBI agents\u2019 impressions completely out of context. The agents who interviewed Flynn about his contacts with the Russian ambassador before Trump became president said he did not appear to be lying \u2014 meaning, he didn\u2019t seem nervous or exhibit the usual traits of deception.\nThat\u2019s quite different from their factual conclusion: Flynn lied to them. Flynn pled guilty to intentionally making false statements and is awaiting sentencing.\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00833"}
