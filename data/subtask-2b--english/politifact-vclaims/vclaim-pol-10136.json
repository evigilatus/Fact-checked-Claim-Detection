Is it any wonder?\" says a TV ad\u00a0from Mack\u2019s incumbent rival, Sen. Bill Nelson. \"In Congress, Mack is protecting Chevron oil from a multibillion dollar lawsuit over pollution of rivers and rain forests.\"\n\nNelson repeated the charge during the first and only debate between the candidates on Oct. 17, 2012. Mack, he said, \"has filed a resolution to void a court judgment for $18 million for the Chevron Corp., which by the way is one of his largest contributors.\"\n\nThe Chevron claim gave us pause. It\u2019s been two years since BP\u2019s well exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. Is Mack really protecting an oil company accused of polluting a rain forest?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to this story than Nelson lets on -- about five decades\u2019 worth.\n\nOil in the Jungle\n\nThe origins of the ordeal are rooted in the 1960s, when Texaco launched oil drilling operations in undeveloped land in northeast Ecuador. Texaco worked in partnership with Ecuador\u2019s national petroleum company, Petroecuador, with Texaco drilling the wells and digging pits for sludge-like oil runoff.\n\nTexaco wrapped up its operations in the early 1990s. It paid the government $40 million to clean up about 40 percent of the oil pits, and the government granted Texaco a release from future litigation.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of indigenous Ecuadorians -- calling themselves afectados, or \"the affected ones\" -- sued Texaco for rampant environmental neglect, blaming incidents of cancer, miscarriages and other health problems on oil pollution from the company's operations. A team of New York trial lawyers led a class-action suit originally filed in 1993 in U.S. court, but the case moved to Ecuador at Chevron\u2019s urging.\n\nWe have studied the complicated case and included links to detailed reports about it. Ultimately, Ecuadorian judges have ordered Chevron -- which bought Texaco in 2001 and inherited the suit -- to pay a whopping $19 billion award.\n\nChevron has not paid the tab and says it doesn\u2019t intend to, arguing the company did not get a fair trial in Ecuador and should not be held responsible anyway, because of the mid \u201990s agreement Texaco reached with Ecuador about future litigation.\n\nNeither side is willing to bend, spawning international arbitration and dozens of court filings in Ecuador, the United States and even Canada and Brazil. Chevron is pursuing an extortion and racketeering case against the plaintiff\u2019s lead attorney.\n\nMack\u2019s involvement\n\nSo where does Connie Mack, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, fit in with this mammoth environmental case?\n\nIn September 2012, Mack earned an eyebrow-raising headline from the Tampa Tribune: \"Mack pushes legislation that aids political backers.\"\n\nThe Tribune story connected a resolution Mack introduced\u00a0about revoking Ecuador\u2019s trade privileges with Chevron\u2019s hefty political donations to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The chamber has made attacking Nelson over the airwaves one of its biggest priorities this year. (Corporations cannot donate directly to candidates, and we did not find that any employees of Chevron donated money to Mack this campaign cycle.)\n\nMack\u2019s resolution lists the Chevron case as one of many reasons the U.S. should not renew a trade agreement with Ecuador next year. Other reasons include press censorship and intimidation, a politicized judicial system, a growing relationship with Iran, an uptick in Ecuadorians seeking asylum in the U.S., and a problem as a transit hub for illegal narcotics.\n\nMack had harsh words for President Rafael Correa.\n\n\"Preferences from the United States, including trade benefits, should not be utilized to bolster anti-democratic leaders,\" Mack said in a news release. \"I hope that Congress recognizes the truth about Rafael Correa and declines the renewal of the U.S. trade preference program until democratic standards of freedom and security are restored in Ecuador.\"\n\nThe exact wording of the Chevron segment: Whereas Ecuador has not complied with the interim award issued by an international arbitration tribunal convened under Article 6 of the United States-Ecuador BIT, which enjoins Ecuador `whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to take all measures necessary to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within or without Ecuador' of the $18,200,000,000 judgment by Ecuadoran courts against the Chevron Corporation.\n\nMack\u2019s resolution, co-sponsored by 31 House members, has not been heard in committee. Even if it were to pass, it would merely state the \"disinclination\" of Mack and the co-sponsors to renew the U.S.\u2019s trade agreement with Ecuador; it would not by itself strip away Ecuador\u2019s trade privileges.\n\nNelson\u2019s campaign threw us a slew of press clips about the Chevron case, including the Tribune story and a 2009 POLITICO story\u00a0about Chevron\u2019s lobbying efforts of Congress and the office of U.S. Trade Representative to strip Ecuador\u2019s trade preferences.\n\n\"The plaintiffs contend that Chevron botched the cleanup, but if the court were to recognize the agreement, it could essentially end the suit,\" POLITICO reported.\n\nFour Senate Democrats, not including Nelson, wrote the trade representative\u00a0in 2009 and urged him not to intervene in the case. Then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2006\u00a0asked the previous trade representative not to use trade agreements as leverage.\n\nChevron spokesman Kent Robertson said the company did not ask Mack to include the language and does not see how it would protect Chevron. He said the case \"boils down to the issue of contracts\" between two private parties.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate to make the connection that\u2019s being made right now,\" he said.\n\nWe asked the Mack campaign why he listed Chevron as a reason for no longer supporting the trade agreement, and if he was trying to shield Chevron. A spokesman did not address those questions, writing instead that Mack \"feels strongly about protecting the freedom, security and prosperity of the U.S. at home and abroad.\"\n\n\"Ecuador currently benefits from one-way trade preferences from the U.S. as part of a program that incentivizes Ecuador to work productively with the United States,\" Mack spokesman David James wrote in an email. \"Under Ecuador\u2019s current President, Rafael Correa, that cooperation has dropped off. This is a timely matter given that these trade preferences expire next year and are currently under review.\"\n\nIs Mack protecting Chevron?\n\nIt\u2019s clear Mack\u2019s resolution is meant to protect Chevron\u2019s interests, said Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin.\n\n\"His new bill would inject Congress to try to strip Ecuador of its trade rights with the U.S. if the country doesn't void the judgment,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nWe found a couple of experts who agree, including Judith Kimerling, a City University of New York-Queens College environmental policy professor who authored the 1991 book Amazon Crude, which is widely credited with inspiring the lawsuit. She represents a group of Huaorani people from Ecuador in a lawsuit against the Amazon Defense Front\u00a0and plaintiff\u2019s lawyers over how the award would be distributed.\n\nAsking lawmakers to withhold trade practices is part of a multipronged approach to avoid the judgment, she said, adding she can\u2019t know for sure why Mack would include the Chevron in his resolution.\n\n\"Mack\u2019s resolution in and of itself will not achieve that purpose, but it's part of a strategy to pressure Ecuador to intervene on the case on its side,\" she said. \"They probably would have preferred for Mack to have sponsored a law that would do more.\"\n\nOther experts empathized with Chevron\u2019s argument that it did not get a fair trial in Ecuador, and that it overlooks that Petroecuador has been in control of drilling operations for the past 20 years.\n\n\"A lot of us familiar with Latin America don\u2019t lend any credence to this award,\" said Ed Glab, director of the Global Energy Security Forum at Florida International University and a former longtime employee of Exxon. \"Ecuador is not a place where you can put your faith in the law.\"\n\nIt would not be unusual for Chevron to request a business-friendly lawmaker to support its cause, he said, but that doesn\u2019t mean Mack\u2019s effort will do anything.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know that the U.S. government can or would be willing to step in,\" Glab said. \"I don\u2019t know if (Mack) has the power to \u2018protect\u2019 Chevron.\"\n\nAs Mack\u2019s spokesman pointed out, the resolution contains a timeliness factor.\n\nThe trade preferences program that Ecuador currently enjoys is an updated version of a Reagan-era policy the U.S. established with four Andean nations to \"adopt business-friendly intellectual property, investor, tax and other policies that U.S. companies favored and draw countries away from left-wing influences,\" said Lori Wallach, director of Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group.\n\nEvery few years, Congress must reauthorize the law that designates the trade preferences, the qualification conditions and which countries are eligible for special duty-free access to the U.S. market. The next deadline for Congress is July 31, 2013.\n\nMack could have chosen a couple dozen other investor claims against Ecuador to include in his resolution, she said, but it\u2019s telling that he singled out the Chevron case.\n\n\"He\u2019s shilling for Chevron but has not yet delivered on actually cutting off Ecuador\u2019s trade preferences,\" she said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nNelson\u2019s TV ad hits Mack for \"protecting Chevron oil from a multibillion dollar lawsuit over pollution of rivers and rain forests.\"\n\nMack\u2019s act of protection is a yet-to-be-heard congressional resolution listing the Chevron case as one of many reasons to withhold trade preferences with Ecuador. Resolutions are symbolic gestures, so it would take a law for Congress to take real action on Ecuadorian trade practices.\n\nThe Chevron case is also particularly complicated. Chevron says it did not get a fair trial in Ecuador and should not be held responsible anyway.\n\nStill, the resolution seems designed to exert political pressure on the country in Chevron\u2019s favor.\n\nWe rate Nelson\u2019s claim Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10136"}
