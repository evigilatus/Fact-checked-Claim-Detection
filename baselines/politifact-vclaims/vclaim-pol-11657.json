Those in charge of enforcing the law counter that it helps prevent voter fraud.\n\n\"I can attest that every year we investigate and penalize hundreds of people guilty of election and voter fraud,\" Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp wrote The Washington Post in June.\n\nHe\u2019s made similar statements in the The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Some PolitiFact Georgia readers have asked us to fact-check such statements.\n\nIn June, PolitiFact Georgia checked out a claim by Kemp that the elections board had handed out about $275,000 in fines for violations of Georgia\u2019s absentee ballot law. The number of cases since 2007, by our count, was 59.\n\nCould the state really have investigated and handed out fines in so many more cases each year?\n\nMatt Carrothers, a spokesman for the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s Office, sent us numbers outlining how many cases the State Elections Board reviewed in 2009, 2010 and 2011, along with the number of investigations Kemp\u2019s office has opened.\n\nThe annual totals:\n\n-- 208 in 2009\n-- 234 in 2010\n-- 205 in 2011\n\nSome of the investigations consist of multiple people, so the actual number of people investigated could be higher, Carrothers said.\n\n\"The numbers that we based that original statement on are not only factual, but the base line,\" he said. \"The real numbers are higher.\"\n\nA detailed breakdown of each investigation wasn\u2019t available, but the cases reviewed by the State Elections Board are on its website. The board reviewed 102 cases this year, as Carrothers said. The 2010 total we calculated of people who had cases before the board was about the same as what Carrothers told us. Some 2009 board public orders were not on the state\u2019s website.\n\nFrom the information we\u2019ve seen and what Kemp\u2019s office shared with us, it appears Kemp\u2019s office has investigated and penalized at least 200 people each of the past three years. That does qualify as \"hundreds\" as Kemp says.\n\nOur rating: True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11657"}
