His luxury vacation to Greece made him look uncommitted and out of touch, they complained. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe former U.S. House speaker told a wall of TV news cameras that he was there to talk about economic policy; he would not take questions about his campaign.\n\nBut he did address its turmoil, albeit briefly. \"Campaigns go up and down,\" Gingrich said, and he offered a tidbit of political history. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"On the day of the New Hampshire primary in 1980, the top 13 people of Ronald Reagan\u2019s staff quit,\" Gingrich said.\n\nDid they?\n\nTo test Gingrich\u2019s claim, we turned to some experts on our nation\u2019s 40th president, as well as books that chronicle Reagan\u2019s successful 1980 campaign.\n\nYes, there was a mass exodus from the Reagan campaign. It began about 2 p.m. Feb. 26, 1980, the day he won the New Hampshire primary by a landslide.\n\nReagan\u2019s campaign manager at the time was John Sears. Some critics blamed Sears for losing the Iowa caucuses. Others thought he was too moderate, or that he was spending too much campaign money. Reagan resented that the press saw him as Sears\u2019 puppet.\n\nReagan decided to clean house. On the afternoon of the New Hampshire primary, he met with Sears, press secretary Jim Lake, and national political director Charlie Black in his hotel suite at the Holiday Inn.\n\nReagan told Sears he planned to make some changes and handed him a piece of paper. It was a press release announcing Sears had resigned from the campaign to return to his law practice.\n\nSears got the hint. He, Black and Lake left the campaign.\n\nThat evening, as the Reagans celebrated their blowout victory, staffers loyal to the three departing aides packed up.\n\nCraig Shirley\u2019s \"Rendezvous With Destiny: Ronald Reagan and the Campaign That Changed America\" contains the most detailed account we could find of the departures. (Shirley, who has worked for prominent Republican politicians, is writing a book on Gingrich\u2019s early years.)\n\nTop assistants for Sears and Lake quit, the book said. Black\u2019s assistant assumed she was fired and left with them. Twelve additional members of the Reagan campaign resigned in protest.\n\nAfterward, Reagan\u2019s new campaign manager William Casey, future head of the Central Intelligence Agency, fired about half of the campaign\u2019s 275 or so staffers.\n\nThings get fuzzy from here.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely accurate to say these staffers \"quit,\" as Gingrich said. Reagan told The Washington Post that he \"wouldn\u2019t call it a firing,\" but Sears held a news conference and said he was fired and not offered another job. It\u2019s fair to say that at the very least, Sears was pushed out.\n\nConfirming the number of Reagan\u2019s staffers who left is also a bit complicated.\n\nShirley\u2019s account mentions 18 of them. \u00a0A Washington Post account published the day after the firings said that \"by nightfall, a total of seven campaign aides had joined the exodus.\" That same day, The New York Times said \"other high-ranking campaign aides . . . were expected to resign soon.\"\n\nGil Troy, author of \"Morning in America,\" a study of Reagan\u2019s presidency, told PolitiFact Georgia in an email that \"it is very plausible they [the resignations] reached thirteen that first day -- and almost tenfold within days.\"\n\nHere\u2019s another hitch. Sears, Lake and Black were clearly among Reagan\u2019s top aides, but whether those who left were \"the top 13 people of Ronald Reagan\u2019s staff\" is debatable. Reagan\u2019s \"top people\" included Sears\u2019 replacement Casey and others who replaced them.\n\nIn conclusion, Gingrich\u2019s reference to the Reagan campaign isn\u2019t perfect.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely correct to say Reagan\u2019s top three staffers quit. Sears said they were fired, and at the very least, they were pressured to leave. Gingrich\u2019s count of 13 Reagan staffers is debatable, as is his description of them as \"the top\" aides. \u00a0\n\nBut Gingrich\u2019s main point stands. There was a mass departure from the Reagan campaign. It began on the day of the 1980 New Hampshire primary. It included Reagan\u2019s campaign manager Sears and other key members of the operation.\n\nWe therefore rate Gingrich\u2019s claim Mostly True.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden \u201chas issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 27, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12835"}
