The Democratic Party of Oregon followed up with a press release saying that Dudley was caught on camera agreeing with a person who thinks the wage is too high.\n\nIn Kitzhaber\u2019s jaunty 30-second spot, the announcer describes Dudley as a wealth strategist who wants to give huge tax breaks to the rich. Then, it cuts to a clip of Dudley at a Sept. 9 , 201o, event at Intel in Hillsboro. The text of his words appear on screen: \"Restaurants will say ... it doesn\u2019t make sense that our waitresses are getting tips ... plus the highest minimum wage in the country.\" However, the audio does not have him saying the part about \"restaurants will say.\"\n\nThe commercial then cuts again to Dudley saying, at the same event, \"... having the highest minimum wage in the country negatively impacts the state.\"\n\nBoth camps have been urging PolitiFact Oregon to rule on the question of what Dudley said about the minimum wage. So we will.\n\nSome background: Oregon has the second highest minimum wage in the country, after Washington state. And the hourly rate is set to increase another 10 cents, to $8.50 an hour, on Jan. 1. \u00a0Oregon is one of 10 states where the wage is adjusted every year, pegged to inflation. (Last year, the minimum was not increased because inflation was flat.) \u00a0The ballot measure ensuring such increases was approved by voters in 2002.\n\nThe restaurant association and the farm bureau, which support Dudley, have long complained bitterly about Oregon\u2019s minimum wage. \u00a0The restaurant lobby in Oregon and elsewhere has pushed for short-term training wages to pay first-time workers.\n\nDudley said later at the Intel exchange that he would like to look into a training wage program to get young workers job experience without burdening employers. \u00a0Democrats say that\u2019s further evidence that Dudley wants to lower Oregon\u2019s minimum wage. Dudley\u2019s camp says that\u2019s not necessarily true since they could set up a system where the state makes up the difference between the minimum wage and a training wage.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a fuller transcript of the exchange Dudley had with the questioner. (And by the way, the Democratic Party of Oregon released the video and has been shopping it around to showcase Dudley\u2019s uber-rich leanings.)\n\u00a0\n\nQuestioner: \"My question comes back to labor and labor costs. I\u2019ve noticed that our state tends to have a very high minimum wage and I think that\u2019s difficult for our businesses but I think it, it also attracts people from other states to come to our state and take our jobs away from our kids and, and those that might need them. \u00a0I think it attracts the wrong end of the labor pool to \u00a0our \u00a0state, and they tend to stay here and ... I\u2019m concerned about that, I\u2019m interested to know what your - if you share that philosophy and if you have any idea what you would do about that or if you want to address that issue.\"\u2028 \u2028\n\n\nDudley at first says, \" I agree with you on that issue.\" He then goes on to say, \"having the highest minimum wage in the country negatively impacts the state,\" and \"you talk to restaurants, restaurants will say, listen, we\u2019ve got less employees than we would otherwise because of this and it doesn\u2019t make sense ...\" He goes on to mention restaurant kitchen workers who don\u2019t get tips and says \"there\u2019s so many negative issues with it that I think need to be addressed.\"\n\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say his 72-second response was unscripted and a bit rambling. But it is clear that he agreed with the questioner that Oregon\u2019s high minimum wage causes problems for the business community.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDudley spokesman Jake Suski said his boss \"was agreeing that there is some economic theory supporting the question.\" As for the part about whether wait staff earn too much, Suski says Dudley was \"explaining what restaurants have told him, not offering his own opinion.\" Suski said Dudley does not want to lower Oregon\u2019s minimum wage and he does not think servers earn too much.\n\nDudley\u2019s comments at Intel have dogged him on the campaign trail. The issue came up in a Sept. 28 meeting with The Oregonian\u2019s Editorial Board, where he said he wanted to look at the minimum wage in light of high unemployment among young people. \u00a0\n\nIn the only debate between the two candidates on Sept. 30, Kitzhaber indicated that Dudley was more concerned about waitresses and their tips than sound fiscal policy. Dudley responded forcefully: \"I\u2019ve never said I wanted to reduce the minimum wage and I\u2019m not. End of story. Not reducing the minimum wage. End of story.\"\n\nDudley\u2019s current, clearer message leaves the distinct impression that, at least when it comes to what he said about waitresses and tips, he probably wishes he could eat his words.\n\nBut is Kitzhaber right? Does Dudley, in his heart of hearts, think Oregon\u2019s minimum wage is too high, too low or just right?\n\nPolitiFact Oregon put the question to the Dudley camp. It took a couple of tries, but we might have an answer.\n\n\"That's not the issue, he has clearly said he won't lower it and that the voters have decided on this issue,\" Suski said in an initial e-mail. Then he wrote in a second e-mail: \u00a0\"He doesn't believe that the minimum wage is too high and he's clearly not in favor of lowering it...\"\n\nSo if he thinks the minimum wage is not too high, why not say that to the person who asked the question?\n\nSuski responded: \"He just acknowledged the economic theory around it and said he's not making an issue of it. \u00a0What he wants to address is youth unemployment and getting young people opportunities in the workforce, which is why he's been talking about a credit for employers to hire young workers.\"\n\nIf we had a Duck-O-Meter, PolitiFact Oregon would rate this a Full Duck. Dudley said he \"agrees\" with the questioner on the issue, but now his campaign says he was merely acknowledging a theory.\n\nBut if Dudley is ducking, Kitzhaber is stretching. Oregon Democrats and Kitzhaber go too far in claiming that Dudley thinks waitresses make too much money and that he wants to lower the minimum wage. Nevertheless, any reasonable person watching the original exchange would believe that Dudley agrees the minimum wage is too high or, at the least, problematic -- despite what his camp says now. We rate the claim Half True.\n\n\u00a0\n\nComment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14225"}
