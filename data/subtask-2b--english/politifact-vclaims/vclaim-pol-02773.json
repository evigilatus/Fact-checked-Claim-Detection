Facebook users reported the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site's efforts to curb fake news.\nThe post was only five (grammatically improper) sentences long, and featured a photo that turned up first in a Google image search of the city\u2019s East Central High School:\n\"Tulsa school East Central High School closes down after fire set on purpose. Tulsa firefighters say that someone broke in the school threw the east wing door. The say the fire was set from inside the building on the first floor. The school will remain closed until Further notice.The Students will be attending Nathan Hale High School.\"\nBut there was no fire and East Central High School is not closed, nor will Nathan Hale High School be getting an influx of displaced students. The post is fake, as are all the stories featured on React365.com.\nThe website allows people to create \"prank\" stories, in which users write a few sentences and post a photo to trick people.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stories have the same effect as any fake news article \u2014 they trick readers into thinking they are real. Out of context, anyone can be fooled, even with the minimal warning posted at the bottom of the page that reads, \"This website is an entertainment website, news are created by users. These are humourous news, fantasy, fictional, that should not be seriously taken or as a source of information.\"\nReact365.com is one of a number of URLs owned by a man named Nicolas Gouriou, who runs a company in Binic, France, called Mediavibes.\nWhen we tried to contact Mediavibes via email, they only replied that they do not comment to the press.\nReaders should be wary of any story from React365.com or similar sites. The posts appear to always carry the current date, and feature a share counter that reflects the current date. When we saw the story on Oct. 23, the counter said the story was from that day and had been shared more than 22,000 times, but there\u2019s no way to tell if that\u2019s accurate.\nThe Tulsa School of Arts and Sciences charter high school was ravaged by an accidental fire shortly after opening in 2012, forcing students into the former Sequoyah Elementary School building. The fire had started in the ceiling where a ventilation pipe was being installed above a chemistry laboratory.\nThis blaze, however, was entirely fictional.
