And in fact, if you go back, you can see Wayne LaPierre, who runs the NRA, testifying before Congress in favor of background checks 15 or 20 years ago.\"\nRelated: \"Do majority of NRA members support background checks for guns?\"\nBloomberg made almost the exact same claim about LaPierre\u2019s testimony in 2013. Former President Barack Obama did, too.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s still accurate.\nWe wanted to revisit the history in light of the NRA\u2019s typically staunch resistance to gun control efforts and the Washington Post\u2019s recent report that LaPierre called Trump to warn against pushing for background checks.\u00a0\nOn May 27, 1999, a month after the Columbine High School shooting, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime.\nLaPierre, also the chief executive at that time, listed a number of gun-related actions and laws the group believed would be \"reasonable.\" Mandatory background checks for guns at gun shows was one.\n\"We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show,\" he said. \"No loopholes anywhere for anyone.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
