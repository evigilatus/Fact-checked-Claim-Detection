Right now, American oil production is the highest that it\u2019s been in eight years. That\u2019s right \u2013 eight years. Not only that \u2013 last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years.\"\n\nThis passage includes a number of claims, but here we\u2019ll focus on the one that \"right now, American oil production is the highest that it\u2019s been in eight years.\"\n\nWe looked at a similar claim on\u00a0March 15, 2011, and rated it Mostly True. But we will update our assessment based on new data.\n\nWe turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government\u2019s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said \"oil production,\" we will only look at crude oil extracted from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products.\n\nHere are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003:\n\n2003: 2,073,453,000\n2004: 1,983,302,000\n2005: 1,890,106,000\n2006: 1,862,259,000\n2007: 1,848,450,000\n2008: 1,811,817,000\n2009: 1,956,596,000\n2010: 1,998,137,000\n\nThe full-year data is available only through 2010, but 10 months of data from 2011 have been made public. Through the end of October 2011, production totaled 1,713,038,000 barrels. If that pace continues, the year-end total should be around 2,055,646,000 barrels -- higher than any year since 2003. That\u2019s eight years ago, just as Obama said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last time we looked at this question in March 2011, we noted that production levels actually have been quite\u00a0stable over the period in question. The estimated level for 2011 is only about 13 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic. In addition, levels of production were typically higher from the 1950s to the 1990s.\n\nHowever, one caveat we mentioned in our last analysis -- that the Energy Information Administration projected that production totals were poised to fall over the subsequent two years -- no longer appears to be accurate.\n\nThe most recent \"Short-Term Energy Outlook,\" published on Jan. 12, 2012, forecast increases in total crude oil\u00a0production in 2012 and 2013, thanks to increases in onshore production in the Lower 48, which overshadow declines in production in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe last issue is whether Obama and his administration claimed credit for this achievement and whether they\u00a0deserve it.\n\nThe government does play a role in shaping oil production, but many other factors, including private-sector business imperatives and the domestic and international energy market, are factors as well.\n\nWe think Obama\u2019s phrasing suggests that he thinks the administration\u2019s policies have played a role, saying, for instance, that \"over the last three years, we\u2019ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration.\" But we also\u00a0think he does so cautiously.\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama was correct when he said that \"right now, American oil production is the highest that it\u2019s been in eight years.\" We think he may have overstated his administration\u2019s role in achieving that, but not wildly so.
