During his remarks, Husted touched on the issue of the shrinking window for early voting and absentee ballot requests contained in his plan.\n\nHusted said under his plan \"it still will be one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America,\" according to a report from Gongwer News Service, a Statehouse-based paid information service.\n\nGiven the criticism of Husted\u2019s plan, Politifact Ohio decided to check into Husted\u2019s statement.\n\nThere are two forms of early voting in Ohio: in-person early voting and absentee ballot voting.\n\nFor information on in-person early voting and absentee voting across all 50 states, we turned to the National Association of Secretary of States.\n\nOnly 33 states plus the District of Columbia offer in-person early voting. Further research revealed that two of those states \u2014 Georgia and North Dakota \u2014 only do so on a county-by-county basis so we threw those two states out for the purposes of this analysis.\n\nAmong the 31 remaining states (and the District of Columbia), Ohio ranks either sixth or seventh for time available to vote in-person, depending on how you rank Wisconsin\u2019s 30-day period compared to Ohio\u2019s.\n\nThat\u2019s because while Ohio\u2019s early voting window is 35 days long, it excludes certain weekend days so really there are only between 27 and 31 days when early voting can actually occur. And, it can vary from county to county, depending on their policies concerning weekend hours.\n\nHamilton County, for example, was open for in-person early voting all five Saturdays in October 2010 while Pike County allowed it only on the last Saturday in October thus the range of four days across Ohio counties.\n\nHusted\u2019s proposal would open up a 16-day in person voting window, however, his proposal has specific guidelines for all counties to follow regarding weekend hours. His plan would allow in-person voting locations be open only one Saturday. They would be closed on all Sundays and in-person voting would halt the Friday before Election Day. That means there would be 11 possible days for early voting under Husted\u2019s plan.\n\nUnder Husted\u2019s proposal, Ohio would drop to have the 21st biggest window for in-person voting among the 31 early voting states plus the District of Columbia, according to the NASS data. Put another way, only 11 states that allow early voting statewide would have shorter periods than Ohio to vote early in-person.\n\nHusted\u2019s communications director, Maggie Ostrowski, said that Ohio\u2019s top elections officer was trying to make the point that even with a condensed window Ohio \"will provide more opportunities than many other states.\"\n\nIn large part that\u2019s because Ohio has a \"no-fault\" law \u2014 a provision in Ohio law which allows voters to request an absentee ballot without having to cite any reason. States with longer windows may have fewer voters able to take advantage of it if they don\u2019t have a \"no-fault\" policy in place, she said.\n\n\"Longer time frame is one way to look at it, but we have more opportunities for more people,\" Ostrowski said. \"They may have longer windows, but you have to have an excuse to vote. They aren\u2019t no-fault. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to compare Ohio to states that don\u2019t have no-fault voting.\"\n\nWhile it may be a fair point about comparing no-fault voting states with those without easy access to absentee ballots, we return to Husted\u2019s words which were that Ohio would still have \"one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America.\"\n\nHis statement doesn\u2019t offer any qualifier about no-fault voting, and uses the phrase \"time frame\" which clearly means span of days.\n\nOstrowski also noted that many states are changing their early voting period, and said it\u2019s not a totally fair to compare what Ohio would look like in the future to what other states look like today. We checked with the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) and there are 16 states actively considering adding or changing their in-person early voting periods, according to a legislation tracker on the NCSL website. And some state legislatures have as many as 10 competing bills pending, making it impossible to determine where Ohio would stack up relative to other states in the future.\n\nSo while it\u2019s possible that Ohio could move a great deal up or down the scale depending on what happens in more than a dozen other states regarding in-person early voting, Husted\u2019s remarks on April 7 weren\u2019t made in the context of what could possibly happen in other states in the future and where Ohio could rank in the future.\n\nNext we looked at how the time frame for Ohio\u2019s absentee voting would stack up against other states if his plan became law.\n\nBecause NASS doesn\u2019t track when the absentee ballot request window begins in all 50 states, we turned to information collected by a non-partisan academic research center at Reed College known as the Early Voting Information Center. \u00a0\n\nThree states -- Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Utah are toss outs, as as they appear to have no starting points in their windows for requesting absentee ballots.\n\nOf the remaining 47 states and the District of Columbia, Ohio\u2019s current absentee ballot window of 33 days would rank roughly in the middle, \u00a026th among the eligible states, according to the Early Voting Information Center.\n\nIf Husted\u2019s plan were adopted, the absentee ballot request window would shrink to 21 days, which would make Ohio 39th among the eligible states. That means there would be only be eight states with a shorter time frame for absentee ballot requests if Husted\u2019s plan became law\u2014excluding the trio of toss-out states.\n\nSo how does Husted fare on the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nHe said if his plan were put in place, the voting window \"will be one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America.\" But Husted isn\u2019t even close. Ohio would rank 21st among 34 states that offer early in-person voting and 39th among 47 states that offer absentee voting.\n\nHis assertion is so wrong, it\u2019s ridiculous. And as the top elections officer in the state of Ohio, he has a responsibility to get it right.\n\nFor that kind of statement, PolitiFact Ohio \"aggressively\" strikes a match to his well-tailored trousers. We rate Husted\u2019s claim Pants On Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13167"}
