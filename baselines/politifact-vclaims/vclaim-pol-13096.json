But the line still gets repeated, most recently by likely presidential candidate Mitt Romney.\n\nDuring a speech in Ann Arbor, Mich., on May 12, 2011, Romney sought to explain how the health care plan he signed as governor of Massachusetts was different than the law signed by President \u00a0Barack Obama.\n\nThe Massachusetts plan -- passed with bipartisan support in the Legislature in 2006 -- shares many features with the Obama plan, so it poses a political problem for Romney.\n\nIn the speech, Romney sought to draw distinctions between the Massachusetts plan and Obama\u2019s. He said, \"When I ask people what they dislike most about the president\u2019s plan, what I typically hear is they say, \u2018Obamacare represents a government takeover of health care, and I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 And I think they\u2019re right.\"\n\nHe made the same point in an accompanying PowerPoint slide, which called \"Obamacare\" \"a government takeover of health care,\" as opposed to \"Mass-Care,\" which he said was designed to \"help people get and keep their health insurance.\"\n\nWe have examined the government takeover claim in detail in our previous coverage, but since the line is being used by a likely 2012 presidential candidate, it's worth revisiting why we found it flatly incorrect.\n\n\"Government takeover\" conjures a European approach in which the government owns the hospitals and the doctors are public employees. But the law Congress passed, parts of which have already gone into effect, relies largely on the free market. Critics of the law are correct that it significantly increases government regulation of health insurers. But it is, at its heart, a system that relies on private companies:\n\n\u2022 Employers continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies.\n\n\u2022 Contrary to the claim, more people will get private health coverage. The law sets up \"exchanges\" where private insurers will compete to provide coverage to people who don't have it.\n\n\u2022 The government will not seize control of hospitals or nationalize doctors.\n\n\u2022 The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers.\n\n\u2022 The law gives tax credits to people who have difficulty affording insurance, so they can buy their coverage from private providers on the exchange. But here too, the approach relies on a free market with regulations, not socialized medicine.\n\nCritics of our conclusion have said the significant increase in government regulation -- which, among other things, requires that adults have health insurance -- justifies the use of the term.\n\nIn an editorial \u00a0responding to our Lie of the Year choice, the Wall Street Journal wrote that \"at the heart of ObamaCare is a vast expansion of federal control over how U.S. health care is financed, and thus delivered. The regulations that PolitiFact waves off are designed to convert insurers into government contractors in the business of fulfilling political demands, with enormous implications for the future of U.S. medicine. All citizens will be required to pay into this system, regardless of their individual needs or preferences. Sounds like a government takeover to us.\"\n\nMichael Cannon, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, went so far as to announce that he was boycotting PolitiFact because of problems he had with both the \"government takeover\" article and the previous year\u2019s Lie of the Year -- former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin\u2019s argument that the Obama health care bill included \"death panels.\"\n\nWhen we asked Romney\u2019s camp to explain their use of the term \"government takeover,\" spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom said, \"It seems pretty obvious that under Obamacare, the federal government takes on a vastly expanded role in health care. Whether you call it a \u2018takeover\u2019 or a \u2018power grab,\u2019 the effect is the same -- it shifts power and responsibility from the states to Washington and suffocates the nation under a massive, byzantine bureaucracy fueled by a half trillion dollars in higher taxes.\"\n\nBut we find flimsy evidence for such a strong claim. The government's expanded role in health falls far short of being a government takeover. As we said in our Lie of the Year announcement, \u00a0analogies about strict government regulation provide some helpful illustrations. The Federal Aviation Administration imposes detailed rules on airlines. State laws require drivers to have car insurance. Regulators tell electric utilities what they can charge. Yet that heavy regulation is not described as a government takeover.\n\nThere's no question that \"government takeover\" has been a successful talking point. A poll in March 2010 found that a majority of the American people believed it was true. But the facts simply don't support it. The health care law continues to depend on private health insurance and private-sector physicians. So Romney earns the same rating as others who have made the false claim: Pants on Fire!\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
