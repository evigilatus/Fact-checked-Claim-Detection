He failed to note that individuals who come to the United States through the lottery program must be vetted by the United States and also must meet certain education and work criteria.\nThe White House did not respond to our request for comment on the record.\nHere are the facts.\nApplicants must meet education or work experience criteria\nThe visa lottery program was established in 1990 to diversify the United States\u2019 immigrant population. The lottery began in 1995 and selects applicants from countries with low immigration levels during the previous five years. Diversity visas are currently capped at 50,000 per fiscal year.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that entries chosen in the lottery do not automatically get a visa, they only become eligible to apply for it.\nApplicants must meet education or work experience requirements, according to the U.S. State Department and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 At least a high school education or its equivalent, defined as successful completion of a 12-year course of formal elementary and secondary education; or\n\u2022 Two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience to perform.\nPotential immigrants must undergo vetting by U.S. government\nVisa lottery applicants can include a spouse and children in their application.

As part of this screening process, information that might suggest an individual is a potential threat is shared with all appropriate U.S. government agencies,\" a State Department official previously told us.\n\"National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications,\" the agency added.\nOur ruling\nTrump said the visa lottery program \"randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people.\"\nWhile lottery applicants are randomly selected, they must meet education and work experience requirements.
