Republicans used popular dissatisfaction with the law to make significant congressional gains in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, but the pattern has shifted in 2018, after unsuccessful Republican efforts to repeal the law.\nThe Wesleyan Media Project recently found that health care was the most common subject of Democratic congressional campaign ads, the New York Times reported.\nBut in a rally in Rochester, Minn., on Oct. 4, President Donald Trump sought to flip this narrative on its head. He argued that it\u2019s actually the Republicans who are the champions of pre-existing condition protections, and Democrats who are trying to kill them.\n\"We will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions,\" Trump said around the 34:00 mark. \"We\u2019re going to take care of them. Some of the Democrats have been talking about ending pre-existing conditions. And some people have -- you know what I say? We'll get a little more money from China. It'll be just fine. It'll be just fine. We'll be just fine.\"\nWe have previously written that a pending lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act by Republican attorneys general would, if successful, end protections for pre-existing conditions. (Such protections could be reinstated by new legislation if the courts do strike down the law, but health policy experts say the mechanics of achieving this result in a way different from the Affordable Care Act would be tricky; the decades-long fight to protect patients with pre-existing conditions does not provide much optimism for a quick legislative fix.)\nFor its part, the Trump administration has decided not defend the law against the attorney generals\u2019 suit, effectively siding with those who want to overturn the law.\nThe second part of Trump\u2019s assertion, however, was new to us. Is he right that \"some of the Democrats have been talking about ending pre-existing conditions\"?\nWe found zero evidence of this.\nFor starters, Trump\u2019s assertion is illogical given the Democrats\u2019 role in passing the law and Democratic efforts to hammer Republican candidates over pre-existing condition protections on the campaign trail. Here are examples from Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Ohio Democratic candidate for governor Richard Cordray.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrew Hammill, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said there is no such chatter among Democratic officeholders or candidates.\nWe also asked independent health-policy experts whether they had heard any Democratic messages \u2014 or even whispers \u2014\u00a0about getting rid of pre-existing condition protections. They said they had not.\n\"I find President Trump\u2019s comments surprising,\" said Christine Eibner, a health policy specialist at the Rand Corp.\n\"I can\u2019t think of any,\" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush.\n\"No \u2014 how bad can this (rhetoric) get?\" asked John Holahan, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute.\n\"Unbelievable,\" said Linda Blumberg, who also studies health policy at the Urban Institute. \"No.\"\nThe White House did not reply to an inquiry seeking examples. Neither did the office of the Senate majority leader or the House speaker.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Some of the Democrats have been talking about ending (coverage for) pre-existing conditions.\"\nWe can\u2019t find any examples of what Trump claimed Democrats were saying. A Democratic proposal to end pre-existing conditions would run 100 percent counter to Democrats\u2019 own history with the Affordable Care Act and would undercut one of the Democrats\u2019 most powerful messages on the campaign trail this year.\nWe rate the statement Pants on Fire.\nUPDATE: Shortly after publication, we lengthened the excerpt of Trump's remarks, so readers could read his complete thought.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01514"}
