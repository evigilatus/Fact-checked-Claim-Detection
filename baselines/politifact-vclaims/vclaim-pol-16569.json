The legislation President Bush vetoed on Oct. 3, 2007 would add another $35 billion to the pot between the years 2008 and 2012. Families making 200 percent of the federal poverty line would be eligibile, and in some cases states could go beyond that to reach families with even higher incomes. Biden is using the statistic that most Democrats are using about the number of children who would become eligible under the SCHIP expansion. And, it's an estimate with solid backing, the Congressional Budget Office, the non-partisan research arm of Congress that calculates the cost of legislation.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16569"}
