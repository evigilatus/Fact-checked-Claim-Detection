McMurray seeks to cancel the seat of Republican Chris Collins in the 27th Congressional District in New York. While he criticizes Collins' vote on the bill, McMurray tells the public that New Yorkers send more money to Washington than they return to the benefits. \"Did you know that the state of New York pays more than ever to return,\" said McMurray during a discussion at the College of St. Joseph's College in Tonawaanda. \"We are a donor country, while others are donors.\" Is McMurray right? Several analyses in recent years have reached similar conclusions. Overall, high-income states send more money to Washington than low-income states. States that consume more federally-taxed products, such as alcohol and gasoline, also send more money to Washington. At the same time, states with more federal workers and contracts, such as Maryland and Virginia, or states with higher health-care costs and poverty rates, receive more federal spending. There are other motives for how much federal money the states receive. Florida, with many retirees, receives social security payments more than other states. The State Comptroller Thomas Dinapoli issued a balance-of-payments report between New Yorkers and the Federal Government in October. Dinapoli, the elected democracy whose office reports on state finances, concluded that for every dollar New York sent to the federal government in Federal Fiscal Year 2017, it received only 90 cents of benefits. The average return for all states was $1.19 per dollar they sent to Washington, D.C., as Dinapoli said. The most recent findings of Dinapoli are consistent with those found in the analyses carried out in the previous two years. In 2013, the state received 91 cents for every dollar it sent to Washington, and in 2016 it received 84 cents for every dollar it sent. In fiscal year 2017, New York sent $24.1 billion in tax payments to Washington more than it had received, as Dinapoli had been found. New York sent approximately $250 billion to the Federal Government, while federal funds spent in New York totalled $225.7 billion. The high per capita payment in New York to Washington compared to other states is paid for their higher-than-average contributions to corporate taxes, individual income taxes and social insurance taxes, such as social security and unemployment, found by the Controller. At the same time, New York per capita is lower than in other states when it comes to federal workers &apos; wages and defence expenditures, but more than in other states for medical aid. Colin Schmidt mentioned on January 14, 2021 at a press conference \"We have scientific data, from all different levels, but especially from high school sports levels, from many different states that show that it's safe to play what New York thinks of high-risk sports.\" New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut were worse than New York when it came to paid federal taxes and benefits. New Mexico enjoys the most favourable balance of federal taxes and receives benefits. The Rockefeller Institute of Government, a non-partisan think tank for public policy in Albany, prepared an analysis during the debate on President Trump &apos; s draft tax code. \"The negative balance of payments in New York has been the largest in any state to date, almost equivalent to New Jersey's combined deficit of rank two and Illinois of rank three, according to Rockefeller's analysis of fiscal year 2015 published in September 2017. On a per capita basis, New York had the third worst balance of payments. More than a decade ago, an analysis from the Tax Corporation, a non-profit think tank, found that in 2005 New York received 79 cents for every dollar it sent to Washington. Does it have to matter? In the progressive tax system, where richer people pay more taxes, it is not surprising that some states pay more to the federal government than they receive, as analysts have said. \"Because one of the aims of the federal system is to redistribute, it is not surprising that some states 'give' much more than they' get, whereas the opposite is true for other states, according to an analysis carried out by the Rockefeller State Institute affiliated with the University of New York. In 2006, an economist from the Tax Corporation, who raises about one third of its business support, wrote that a careful consideration of whether the state receives the same amount as it pays is not \"a very civilian view of the federal government. It is assumed that citizens pay federal taxes to provide joint defence and support other national programmes that benefit the nation as a whole.\" Our rule, McMurray, said New Yorkers send more money to the federal government than the federal government they send to New York. Whether it is a good idea or not, each state receives from the federal government what its residents and businesses have paid to Washington, based on the latest available data and analysis, the McMurray statement is accurate. We value his claim right.
