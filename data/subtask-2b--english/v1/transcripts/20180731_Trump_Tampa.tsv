0357	Donald Trump	They want to open our borders.
0358	Donald Trump	They want to let crime, tremendous crime into our country.
0359	Donald Trump	We can't do it.
0360	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0361	Donald Trump	Republicans want strong borders and no crime Democrats want open borders, which equals massive crime.
0362	Donald Trump	And on top of that, the Democrats  Nancy Pelosi, the whole group, Maxine  Maxine.

0367	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0368	Donald Trump	People that keep us safe.
0369	Donald Trump	Their new platform, what they want to do  the Democrat Party, they want to abolish ICE.
0370	Donald Trump	So in other words, they want to let MS13 rule our country.
0371	Donald Trump	That's not going to happen.
0372	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0373	Donald Trump	Every day, the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities and towns from savage gangs like MS13 that are occupying our country like another nation would.
0374	Donald Trump	We want maximum border security and respect for our heroes, ICE, Border Patrol and law enforcement.
0375	Donald Trump	And we're going to have tremendous border security that will include the wall  that will include the wall.
0376	Donald Trump	Now a lot of people don't know it but we've already started the wall.
0377	Donald Trump	We got $1.6 billion and we've started large portions of the wall, but we're going to need  even the way we negotiate, we're going to need more and we're going to get more and we may have to do some pretty drastic things, but we're going to get it.
0378	Donald Trump	Because the Democrats  the Democrats are not voting for what we want to do and they're not voting and allowing our values to take place in our country.

0384	Donald Trump	Yeah, what about all of those people that are waiting in line for 7, 8, 9, 10 years trying to get into our country, they don't have the right to vote.
0385	Donald Trump	We believe that only American citizens should vote in American elections  Which is why the time has come for voter ID like everything else, voter ID.
0386	Donald Trump	You know, if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card, you need ID.
0387	Donald Trump	You go out and you want to buy anything, you need ID and you need your picture.
0388	Donald Trump	In this country, the only time you don't need it in many cases is when you want to vote for a president, when you want to vote for a senator, when you want to vote for a governor or a congressman, it's crazy, it's crazy.
0389	SYSTEM	[Booing]

0392	Donald Trump	Everyone is happy to say Merry Christmas, right?
0393	Donald Trump	Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas.
0394	Donald Trump	That was under siege.
0395	Donald Trump	You have these big department stores they say, "Happy Holidays."
0396	Donald Trump	I say, "Where is the Merry Christmas?"
0397	Donald Trump	Now they're all putting up Merry Christmas again and that's because  only because of our campaign.
0398	Donald Trump	And by the way, the evangelicals and Paula White, Pastor Paula White, the evangelicals have been so amazing to us.
0399	Donald Trump	They came out and they voted 84 percent and doubled and tripled the numbers that ever voted in an election before.
0400	Donald Trump	We love the evangelical Christians.
0401	Donald Trump	If you want safety, if you want borders, if you want to have a country, then you need to go out and vote Republican.
0402	Donald Trump	And very importantly, you need to go out and vote for Ron DeSantis for governor of Florida.
0403	Donald Trump	The lobbyists and special interests fighting against my administration, many of them are globalist.

0407	Donald Trump	They're the geniuses who came up with our terrible trade deals one after another, how about NAFTA, remember when they signed NAFTA?
0408	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0409	Donald Trump	Remember they signed NAFTA and everybody just moved their companies down to Mexico and these people were saying, "Isn't that a wonderful thing?"
0410	Donald Trump	No, it's not a wonderful thing and those companies are now moving back.
0411	Donald Trump	These are the people who lost trillions of dollars overseas and who gave us our horrible immigration laws.
0412	Donald Trump	These laws are the worst.
0413	Donald Trump	I am for America first and the American worker.
0414	Donald Trump	We want to be a puppet for no one any longer.
0415	Donald Trump	We're not going to be a puppet any longer.
0416	Donald Trump	My only special interest is you, the citizens of the United States.
0417	Donald Trump	I've had a great career.
0418	Donald Trump	I've got a lot of fun, even in Florida, I've had a great career, I've had a lot of fun.
0419	Donald Trump	I've done great.
0420	Donald Trump	I've done really well, beyond anything I could've ever expected.
0421	Donald Trump	And then I ran for president with no experience and I won.
0422	Donald Trump	Isn't that  But you actually won.
0423	Donald Trump	You know, I told the story the other day, I was probably in Washington in my entire life 17 times.
0424	Donald Trump	True, 17 times.
0425	Donald Trump	I don't think I ever stayed overnight.
0426	Donald Trump	You know what I'm getting at, right?
0427	Donald Trump	And we have a great cabinet now, a couple of little changes.
0428	Donald Trump	But we have a great cabinet.
0429	Donald Trump	We have  Mike Pompeo, our Secretary of State.
0430	Donald Trump	So many great people.
0431	Donald Trump	And we're really getting  we have just incredible people.
0432	Donald Trump	But I made some choices that I wouldn't have made.
0433	Donald Trump	But I'm riding down Pennsylvania Avenue.
0434	Donald Trump	Again, I've only been here about 17 times.
0435	Donald Trump	And probably seven of those times was to check out the hotel I'm building on Pennsylvania Avenue and then I hop on the plane and I go back.
0436	Donald Trump	So I've been there 17 times, never stayed there at night.
0437	Donald Trump	I don't believe.
0438	Donald Trump	And then I'm riding down in this beautiful car, picked up at the airport by Secret Service, holding the hand of our great first lady.
0439	Donald Trump	And I look at her and I say, "Honey, guess what, I'm president of the United States!"
0440	Donald Trump	President of the United States.
0441	Donald Trump	And I didn't know anybody in Washington, but now I know everybody in Washington.
0442	Donald Trump	I know the good ones.
0443	Donald Trump	I know the bad ones.
0444	Donald Trump	I know the wonderful people and I know the scum.
0445	Donald Trump	And America now is winning again like they haven't won before.
0446	Donald Trump	We passed the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history, biggest cuts in history.
0447	Donald Trump	More than 100 utilities have slashed rates for consumers including right here from Duke Energy and Tampa Electric.
0448	Donald Trump	Your rates have gone down.
0449	Donald Trump	Over $300 billion poured back into the United States in the first quarter, and we expect to be taking back because of our new tax cut and reform plan that passed bigger than anything ever in our country.
0450	Donald Trump	We expect to be taking back from overseas over $4 trillion.
0451	Donald Trump	That's a lot of money  could never have come back before.
0452	Donald Trump	And if our opponent had won and the Democrats had won, they would've put more regulations on.
0453	Donald Trump	They would've raised your taxes.
0454	Donald Trump	They would've opened your borders, gotten rid of law enforcement.
0455	Donald Trump	They would not have helped your military.
0456	Donald Trump	And you know what?
0457	Donald Trump	Our country would be going to hell.
0458	Donald Trump	And instead of going up, the market would be half of what it was if we're lucky, because frankly the tax cuts were incredible to what we've done.
0459	Donald Trump	But maybe even more important are the cuts in these horrible regulations that didn't allow anybody to do anything, jobkilling regulations.
0460	Donald Trump	We've gotten rid of more regulations than any president in the history of the United States.
0461	Donald Trump	And that's done in less than two years.
0462	Donald Trump	I withdrew the United States from the unfair onesided very, very expensive jobkilling Paris Climate Accord.
0463	Donald Trump	We repealed the core of Obamacare.
0464	Donald Trump	The individual mandate is gone.
0465	Donald Trump	You know, the individual mandate.
0466	Donald Trump	That's a beauty.
0467	Donald Trump	Only the past administration could have come up with this.
0468	Donald Trump	That's where you pay a lot of money for the privilege of not paying in order to have poor health care.
0469	Donald Trump	Other than that, it's a wonderful thing.
0470	Donald Trump	So you pay all this money for the privilege of not having to pay and the health care is no good to start off with.
0471	Donald Trump	And we're doing great on health care.
0472	Donald Trump	We're allowing Americans to buy better health care for less money through association health plans, including across state lines, bidding, you're getting tremendous competition.
0473	Donald Trump	We passed the biggest VA reform in half a century, Veteran's Choice.
0474	Donald Trump	If our veterans can't get the care they need from the VA, they will have the right to go see a private doctor.
0475	Donald Trump	We'll pay for the doctor.
0476	Donald Trump	And frankly, we'll save a lot of money.
0477	Donald Trump	We'll help a lot of vets.
0478	Donald Trump	Everybody said they've been trying to get it for 45 years, everybody said you can't get it.
0479	Donald Trump	Think of it.
0480	Donald Trump	Think of it.
0481	Donald Trump	Veterans Choice, they have to stand  our great people.
0482	Donald Trump	These are our great people.
0483	Donald Trump	Who's a veteran in this audience?
0484	Donald Trump	Do you like Trump?
0485	Donald Trump	Do you like the job we're doing?
0486	Donald Trump	Now, think of it, 45 years, everybody said you'll never get it passed.
0487	Donald Trump	And I used to say before I really was wellversed on the veteran situation in health care, I used to say all the time, "Why don't they just let the folks go to a doctor?"
0488	Donald Trump	They'd wait in line for 7 days, 9 days, 14 days, 21 days.
0489	Donald Trump	Some of them started off with a very modest problem.
0490	Donald Trump	They end up being terminal because they can't see a doctor.
0491	Donald Trump	I said, "Why don't they just let them go see a local private doctor, pay the bill and take care of it?"
0492	Donald Trump	It will be a lot less expensive.
0493	Donald Trump	And it's turned out to be something that the veterans love.
0494	Donald Trump	And it's passed.
0495	Donald Trump	It's passed.
0496	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get it passed for 38 years.
0497	Donald Trump	The other one is 45, and that's VA accountability.
0498	Donald Trump	If somebody treated our veterans badly, if they stole, if they was  if they were  you know this, if they were sadistic, if they were really bad to our vets, all right?
0499	Donald Trump	Really, really bad, we couldn't do anything about it.
0500	Donald Trump	They could steal.
0501	Donald Trump	They could rob.
0502	Donald Trump	They could be abusive.
0503	Donald Trump	You couldn't say, "You're fired."
0504	Donald Trump	Now you can say, "You're fired."
0505	Donald Trump	Made a big difference.
0506	Donald Trump	That was another one they said you'll never get it done between civil service and unions.
0507	Donald Trump	We love them both.
0508	Donald Trump	But between civil service and unions they said, "You'll never get it done.
0509	Donald Trump	You'll never get it approved."
0510	Donald Trump	And by the way, we had virtually no help, very little from Democrats.
0511	Donald Trump	Very little.
0512	Donald Trump	Not because it's not right, but because they don't want to give Trump any victory.
0513	Donald Trump	They'll do everything that's wrong.
0514	Donald Trump	Look at Judge Kavanaugh.
0515	Donald Trump	This is a great, great highly respected man.
0516	Donald Trump	And the good news is the Republicans, I believe, are close to a hundred percent, which is what we need.
0517	Donald Trump	But so far, the Democrats haven't given us any votes, and that's because they will do anything they can to not help the Trump agenda, even though they know it's wrong.
0518	SYSTEM	[Booing]
0519	Donald Trump	And Brett Kavanaugh, highest education, best grades, best tests, best everything.
0520	Donald Trump	They thought 15 years ago he was going to be a Supreme Court judge.
0521	Donald Trump	Look at Justice Gorsuch, how good is he?
0522	Donald Trump	How good is he?
0523	Donald Trump	So we're getting them through.
0524	Donald Trump	But it's not easy because they really are.
0525	Donald Trump	You know, their term that they use is, "resist."
0526	Donald Trump	It's actually resist and obstruct.
0527	Donald Trump	Whatever they can do to resist and obstruct.
0528	Donald Trump	And frankly, they're lousy politicians.
0529	Donald Trump	They have horrible policy.
0530	Donald Trump	The one thing they're good at, they stick together and they obstruct.
0531	Donald Trump	And it's unfortunate.
0532	Donald Trump	You know, we have almost 400 people trying to get into government, many of whom have left their jobs and the Democrats are holding them up with maximum delay.
0533	Donald Trump	They're holding them up, not allowing these great people to serve their country.
0534	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace.
0535	Donald Trump	That's Chuck Schumer, and it's a disgrace.
0536	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace.
0537	Donald Trump	But we'll get that Supreme Court judge, and that's the big one.
0538	Donald Trump	That's the big one.
0539	Donald Trump	Really important for those who love our military, we have secured a record $700 billion for our military with another $716 billion next year all approved.
0540	Donald Trump	And this is great news for the incredible patriots at MacDill Air Force Base, the proud home of the Sixth Air Mobility Wing U.S. Central Command and Special Operations Command.
0541	Donald Trump	Come on!
0542	Donald Trump	We're adding nearly 30,000 new soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and we have secured the largest pay raise for our great warriors in a decade.
0543	Donald Trump	I've also directed the Pentagon to begin the process of creating the sixth branch of our military, the space force  building the space force.
0544	Donald Trump	And we're doing well in North Korea, although I happen to think that we're doing so well with China that China maybe is getting in our way.
0545	Donald Trump	But we're going to figure that one out before you can even think about it.
0546	Donald Trump	But we're doing well in North Korea.
0547	Donald Trump	We have our  as you know, we have our hostages back.
0548	Donald Trump	There's been no nuclear testing.
0549	Donald Trump	There's been no missiles or rockets flying beautifully over Japan.
0550	Donald Trump	I think our relationship is very good with Chairman Kim, and we'll all see how it all works out.
0551	Donald Trump	But there's nothing like talking, and we'll see how it is.
0552	Donald Trump	You remember when I first took office?
0553	Donald Trump	It really looked like big trouble.
0554	Donald Trump	In the past administration, they thought that was by far their biggest problem.
0555	Donald Trump	So I think it's going to work out very well.
0556	Donald Trump	But a lot of good things are happening.
0557	Donald Trump	No tests.
0558	Donald Trump	No rockets flying.
0559	Donald Trump	But we'll see what happens.
0560	Donald Trump	And our Vice President, Mike Pence, is going to Hawaii to bring back the remains and to greet the families of our great heroes who gave their lives in Korea.
0561	Donald Trump	Our fallen warriors are finally coming home to lay at rest in American soil.

0563	Donald Trump	I also withdrew the United States from the horrible onesided, $150 billion was paid  $1.8 billion in cash.
0564	Donald Trump	The Iran nuclear deal, it's a horror show.
0565	Donald Trump	I hope it works out well with Iran, they're having a lot of difficulty right now.
0566	Donald Trump	I hope it works out well.
0567	Donald Trump	And I have a feeling they'll be talking to us pretty soon.
0568	Donald Trump	And maybe not and that's okay too.
0569	Donald Trump	In December, I recognized Israel's true capital, Jerusalem.
0570	Donald Trump	And in about five months we opened already the American embassy in Jerusalem.
0571	Donald Trump	And people had that scheduled for anywhere from five to ten years and you all know the story.
0572	Donald Trump	We took an existing building.
0573	Donald Trump	We played around with it.
0574	Donald Trump	We renovated it.
0575	Donald Trump	We fixed it up.
0576	Donald Trump	We use Jerusalem stone, one of the finest stones actually in the world, Jerusalem stone.
0577	Donald Trump	So, instead of spending 1 billion and the papers were right in front of me  sir, would you please approve this?
0578	Donald Trump	What is it?
0579	Donald Trump	This is for the embassy in Israel, American, sir.
0580	Donald Trump	I said, "How much?"
0581	Donald Trump	$1 billion, Sir.
0582	Donald Trump	1 billion!
0583	Donald Trump	I immediately called our great ambassador to Israel, David Friedman  very successful man, great lawyer, one of the most successful lawyers in the country before he decided to do what he's doing.
0584	Donald Trump	I said, "David, they want us to pay a billion dollars for the embassy.
0585	Donald Trump	I don't want to pay a billion dollars."
0586	Donald Trump	I said, "Study it  do you have any buildings that we own?"
0587	Donald Trump	We own so much we don't even know what the hell we own.
0588	Donald Trump	Find some building in a great location.
0589	Donald Trump	Call me back.
0590	Donald Trump	Called me back two days later.
0591	Donald Trump	He said, "Mr. President, Sir, we own the best site in Jerusalem.
0592	Donald Trump	It's big.
0593	Donald Trump	It's beautiful and it's got a building on it.
0594	Donald Trump	I can take that building and renovate it.
0595	Donald Trump	I can do it for $140,000."
0596	Donald Trump	I said, "David, how good is the site?"
0597	Donald Trump	We could never buy a better site.
0598	Donald Trump	They were willing to spend tens of millions for a site.
0599	Donald Trump	They wanted to buy a site which was so bad.
0600	Donald Trump	It was totally inferior to what we already had.
0601	Donald Trump	Don't forget, we get there first, right?
0602	Donald Trump	You know, we have good sites.
0603	Donald Trump	And I said, "David, do me a favor, don't make it $140,000.
0604	Donald Trump	Sounds too cheap.
0605	Donald Trump	Make it like 400,000.
0606	Donald Trump	That's okay too, David."
0607	Donald Trump	So we saved almost a billion dollars.
0608	Donald Trump	I could tell you these stories all day long, airplane purchases.
0609	Donald Trump	I could tell you all day long.
0610	Donald Trump	And we started working  and for $400,000, we actually have a very beautiful American Embassy in Jerusalem  really beautiful.
0611	Donald Trump	Now, that's one I guarantee no other president is doing.

0620	Donald Trump	And some of the generals have said they've never seen anything like it in the world  they've never seen.
0621	Donald Trump	Because I want that $700 billion properly spent.
0622	Donald Trump	If we can buy twice the number of aircraft or have a lot of money left over that's what we want.
