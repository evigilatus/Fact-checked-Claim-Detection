Cory Booker said President Donald Trump has made it harder for the federal government to go after domestic terrorist groups.\n\"For Donald Trump to cut funding \u2014 to cut funding from the Justice Department to investigate, I mean, he talks about terrorism all the time, but to cut funding to investigate these domestic terrorist groups, these white supremacist groups, is making us less safe,\" Booker said during a March 27 CNN town hall in Orangeburg, S.C.\nWhen we asked Booker\u2019s campaign for evidence that Trump cut funding for the Justice Department to investigate terrorism, his campaign largely cited cuts to a separate agency \u2014\u00a0the Department of Homeland Security. And the cuts that Booker cited were grants that experts told us were for the prevention of terrorism, not the investigation of terrorism.\nThe FBI, under the umbrella of the Justice Department, is the main entity that investigates terrorism. We found no evidence that Trump has cut back investigative funds for the FBI.\nTrump administration retooled Obama-era grant program\nWhen we asked about Booker\u2019s statement, his team pointed us to cuts to the Countering Violent Extremism grant program. CVE was launched under Obama to work with community leaders to deter U.S. residents from joining violent extremists groups.\nIn the final days of Obama\u2019s tenure, the Homeland Security announced 31 groups would be awarded a total of $10 million in grants. (The Justice Department \u00a0was part of a CVE task force, but it was Homeland Security that awarded the grants.)\nOnce Trump took office, his administration froze the grants. Then, in June 2017, the Homeland Security released a list of 26 grant recipients.\nSome of the awardees named under Obama had dropped out, citing fears of anti-Muslim bias under the new president.\nOffers to other awardees had been rescinded. Two that drew attention: Life After Hate and University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. Although both organizations proposed countering messages of extremists or jihadists, they also mentioned expertise in some specific areas. Life After Hate was founded by former neo-Nazis and skinheads while UNC said it had expertise in far right extremism and white supremacy.\nHomeland Security spokespersons said at the time that the applicants were rejected because they didn\u2019t meet new criteria like working with law enforcement. They were not, they said, rejected for their interest in countering white supremacist thought.\nIndeed, our review of the accepted projects showed that these grant applicants were strongly centered around working with Muslims, immigrants or refugees; white supremacists were scarcely mentioned.\nTrump faced criticism that the Countering Violent Extremism program was now too focused on Muslims. But the Obama administration faced the same critique, including from the liberal Brennan Center.\n\"The picture is more nuanced than, \u2018The Obama administration was going after white supremacists and the Trump administration stopped it,\u2019\" Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program, told PolitiFact. \"Neither went after white supremacists.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CVE grants will end in July and the administration has not requested additional funding, suggesting the grant program could end.\nTrump proposed cuts to various programs\nBooker\u2019s spokeswoman also pointed to other Homeland Security programs that Trump proposed to cut including the Complex Coordinated Terrorist Attacks. These grants were created following the 2016 terrorist attacks in Paris to help state and local jurisdictions to prepare for and prevent attacks. The grants expire in July.\nBut experts told us that these grant programs are not intended to be directed at investigations. The main investigative agency is the FBI, and we couldn\u2019t find any available data that would show us whether the FBI has cut back on investigating domestic terrorism under Trump.\n\"I don\u2019t know of public information that would say one way or another, they don\u2019t publicize resource allocation at that level,\" said Brian Jackson, a homeland security researcher at the RAND Corporation who co-wrote a report for Homeland Security on terrorism prevention.\nDaveed Gartenstein-Ross, an expert on terrorism and CEO of Valens Global consulting firm, was a senior advisor to the director of Office of Community Partnerships, which oversaw the CVE program, under both Obama and Trump. He, too, said that these grant programs were not for investigations: \"There is no evidence at all that investigations have been cut.\"\nBut Gartenstein-Ross said programs that are designed to thwart domestic terrorism play an important role, even when they are not investigative.\nCutting such programs raises red flags among those who believe the federal government should do more to prevent domestic terrorism.\n\"We should be increasing our ability to work with state and local law enforcement to counter domestic terrorists \u2013 not inhibiting it,\" said Ryan Greer, who works on extremism issues at the Anti-Defamation League and formerly worked at the Department of Homeland Security.\nBooker spokeswoman Sabrina Singh challenged the notion that the anti-terrorism programs Booker referenced in his criticism of Trump were preventative, not investigative: \"I think that is a narrow interpretation. It\u2019s clearly a partnership that helps with investigative work\"\nOur ruling\nBooker said Trump \"cut funding from the Justice Department to investigate these domestic terrorist groups, these white supremacist groups.\"\nFor evidence, Booker pointed to cuts to programs from a separate agency -- Homeland Security. He didn\u2019t cite evidence of funding cuts in the Justice Department. In addition, Booker cited as an example the Countering Violent Extremism grant program which set to run out of funds this summer. This program funds terrorism prevention in local communities, not investigations. In 2017, the Trump administration did rescind two Obama-approved CVE grants to groups that had expertise in neo-Nazis, far right extremism or white supremacy.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bc53d591-2802-4779-9c76-396ac873ee91", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00768"}
