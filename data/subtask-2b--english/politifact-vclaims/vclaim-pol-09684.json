He even refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns!\"\n\nDid Bloomberg, co-chair of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, refuse \"to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns\"?\n\nWe dug into the facts and found that, while Bloomberg did mention guns when he said there wasn\u2019t need for additional help from the National Guard, his main reason was that the New York Police Department was doing fine at keeping the peace.\n\n What Bloomberg refused\n\nThe NRA\u2019s director of public affairs, Andrew Arulanandam, pointed us to the mayor\u2019s Oct. 31, 2012, news conference, two days after Sandy\u2019s storm surge devastated parts of New York City.\n\nWhen Bloomberg opened up the floor to questions, a reporter jumped in: \"Mr. Mayor, Brooklyn borough president Marty Markowitz has requested additional National Guard in Brooklyn. Do you agree?\"\n\nMarkowitz had called on the governor to \"allocate as many troops as possible\" to help the city\u2019s \"brave \u2014 but overwhelmed \u2014 first responders.\"\n\n\"There have been unfortunate incidents of looting in some locations,\" said Markowitz\u2019s statement, published the day of Bloomberg\u2019s news conference. \"All of our resources have been stretched to the limit, but in the name of public safety we need to send more National Guard personnel into Coney Island, Manhattan Beach, Gerritsen Beach, Red Hook and any other locations the governor deems appropriate.\"\n\nBloomberg, who could formally request such help from the governor, disagreed. New York City didn\u2019t need the help, he said.\n\nHere\u2019s what he told the reporter who asked about Markowitz\u2019s National Guard request:\n\n \"No, we appreciate the help. The National Guard has been helpful, but the NYPD is the only people we want on the street with guns, and we don't need it. There has been one or two minor outbreakings, disgraceful though they may be, of looting reported in the paper, but the vast bulk of people are doing the right thing. And in Brooklyn people are safe the same way as they are in the rest of the city. We have the resources. The NYPD is 100 percent confident that we can protect the public. We've been doing this for an awful long time. You just have to take a look at the crime rate to understand how good a job this is. And the National Guard has plenty of responsibilities. There are plenty of locations upstate and into surrounding states where they don't have a police department the size of New York, and they can use help from the state, and that's where they should be.\"\n\nBut even though the full context of his remarks indicates his reason was that the NYPD didn't need the help, the media pounced on his gun reference.\n\nThe NRA pointed us to a snippet from the Atlantic Wire, which covered the briefing live: \"3:19 p.m. \u2018The NYPD is the only people we want on the street with guns,\u2019 Bloomberg says when asked if he asked for National Guard help in Brooklyn.\"\n\nThe NRA also noted that the next day, the Brooklyn Paper wrote that Bloomberg \"snubbed Borough President Markowitz\u2019s impassioned plea to bring the National Guard to Hurricane Sandy-scarred Brooklyn \u2014 arguing that approving the Beep\u2019s request would be a waste of federal manpower and turn the borough into a police state.\"\n\nConservative media picked up the story from there:\n\n\u2022 NewsBusters: \"Thursday Report: Bloomberg Wouldn't Let Guard Into Brooklyn Over Their Possession of Guns.\"\n\n\u2022 Fox Nation: \"Report: Bloomberg Denied National Guard Assistance In Brooklyn Because Of Their Possession Of Guns.\"\n\n\u2022 Hot Air: \"Bloomberg kept National Guard out of NYC because they had guns?\"\n\n\u2022 Breitbart: \"BLOOMBERG TO BROOKLYN: NATIONAL GUARD NOT ALLOWED WITH GUNS.\"\n\nDid Bloomberg refuse to allow the National Guard into the city? Not exactly.\n\nHe requested National Guard support from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and got it.\n\nThe day before Bloomberg\u2019s news conference, Cuomo \"mobilized more than 2,300 Soldiers and Airmen\" to help, including in New York City. Several days later, Cuomo\u2019s office announced that more than 3,300 members of the National Guard had been deployed, including 850 from out of state.\n\nThe out-of-state reinforcements were housed at Floyd Bennett Field \u2014 in southeast Brooklyn.\n\nJohn McCarthy of Bloomberg\u2019s office told PolitiFact that the National Guard was in the city \"before, during and after the storm.\"\n\n Order and disorder\n\nBut LaPierre\u2019s partly right: Bloomberg didn\u2019t ask for National Guard troops \"to restore civil order.\"\n\nLaw enforcement wasn\u2019t part of their requested mission, said Eric Durr, director of public affairs for the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs.\n\nLocal government ran the show, requesting help from the state, he said. And Bloomberg didn\u2019t ask for armed troops.\n\n\"Our soldiers were there to assist in storm recovery,\" Durr said. \"They were not carrying weapons.\"\n\nAnd that\u2019s \"incredibly typical,\" said Durr, who joined the New York National Guard in 1988.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of 9/11, for example, he didn\u2019t carry a weapon.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s office confirmed the mayor \"did not want security provided by anyone other than NYPD.\"\n\nWhy?\n\n\"Because they are the best police force in the world,\" McCarthy said.\n\nThe city\u2019s police force, with about 34,500 in uniform, is more than twice the size of the New York National Guard.\n\nBut LaPierre also suggested there was a loss of civil order that required restoration.\n\nJust how much disorder was there?\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s office, Brooklyn borough president Markowitz, the New York Police Department and a congressman representing Brooklyn \u2014 not so much.\n\nIn the week after the storm, crime overall was down. Burglary was up.\n\nThe day Markowitz had appealed for more aid, the New York Times and New York Post had reported isolated looting in the evacuated Rockaways and Coney Island, with about two dozen arrests. The Post quoted unnamed sources describing people grabbing shirts from an Ann Taylor display, plus gadgets from a Brookstone store \"before cops arrived to stand guard.\"\n\nIn response to LaPierre\u2019s Daily Caller article, the Los Angeles Times reported that while crime overall dropped in the city after Sandy, there had been some spikes in burglary \u2014 17 burglaries in a precinct that last year had eight and 14 burglaries in a precinct that last year had three.\n\nBut citywide, the Times reported, \"there was a drop of 17% in shootings, 47% in rapes, 22% in robberies, 18% in assaults, 45% in grand larceny, and 22% in stolen cars. The city also went a record eight days without a murder directly after Sandy.\"\n\nRep. Hakeem S. Jeffries, a Democrat who represents New York\u2019s Eighth District, wrote a letter to LaPierre, saying his \"suggestion that the residents of southern Brooklyn were in grave danger due to 'looters' that 'ran wild' is baseless.\"\n\n\"I spent countless hours in the communities of Coney Island and Sea Gate. Nothing about your characterization of lawlessness rings true,\" Jeffries wrote.\n\nAnd Markowitz, the borough president who had requested the National Guard help, wrote to LaPierre, \"Your assertion that \u2018looters ran wild in South Brooklyn,\u2019 proves just how totally ignorant you are of what\u2019s really going on in Brooklyn and what\u2019s really in the best interest of Brooklynites. Your perception of Hurricane Sandy is nothing but fiction.\"\n\n(Seemed a little harsh to us from the guy who had pointed out \"unfortunate incidents of looting in some locations.\" But that\u2019s certainly more reserved than \"looters ran wild.\")\n\nOur ruling\n\nLaPierre described a \"hellish world\" in south Brooklyn after Hurricane Sandy where the mayor \"refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns.\"\n\nHe is wrong that Bloomberg refused to allow the National Guard into the city -- troops were already there and more arrived in the days afterward. However, he's right that Bloomberg rejected an armed National Guard, although the full context of the mayor's remarks indicate his primary reason was he felt the NYPD was able to keep the peace without the Guard's help.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
