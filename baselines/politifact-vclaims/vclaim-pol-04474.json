He\u2019s tweeted about dead voters delivering President Barack Obama\u2019s victory in 2012, floated charges about multiple voting in the primaries, and suggested that undocumented immigrants \"just walk in and vote\" in some polling places.\nTrump revived these theories as he fell behind Hillary Clinton in the polls (which, according to his surrogates, are \"skewed\").\n\"Nov. 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,\" he said at an Aug. 1 rally in Columbus, Ohio. \"People are going to walk in and they're going to vote 10 times, maybe, who knows?\"\n\"I know last time, you had precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican (Mitt Romney),\" he said to Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity that same night. \"I\u2019m telling you, Nov. 8, we better be careful because that election is going to be rigged and I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it\u2019s going to be taken away from us.\"\nThis is a serious allegation that challenges the integrity of the election, so we asked the Trump campaign to elaborate. We didn\u2019t hear back.\nWhen Trump has offered specifics \u2014 people voting though they\u2019re ineligible, people voting multiple times, people impersonating dead voters \u2014 he\u2019s actually talking about voter fraud, committed by individuals and committed very rarely.\nStolen 2012 election?\nTo sow doubts about the 2016 election, Trump pointed to alleged rigging in 2012.\nWhile some precincts in Philadelphia\u00a0exclusively voted for Obama in 2012, it\u2019s grasping for straws to claim this is evidence for election rigging.\nDefending Trump, Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity pointed to a Philadelphia Inquirer article that showed 59 precincts in inner-city Philadelphia in which \"Mitt Romney did not get a single vote, not one.\"\nBut Hannity leaves out that the same article also stated that \"such results may not be so startling after all.\" The Inquirer wrote that 75 to 80 percent of voters in big cities like Philadelphia\u00a0identify as Democrats, and 93 percent of African-Americans voted for Obama.\nWhen the paper sought out the few registered Republicans living in the 59 districts, it found that several had moved, others didn\u2019t realize they were registered with the party, and others confirmed that they had voted for Obama despite their political identification.\nElection inspector Ryan Godfrey, an independent who was a Republican in 2012, called Hannity\u2019s claims \"absurd and personally insulting.\" After all, Godfrey argued, there\u2019s a paper trail for the ballots in Philly and no evidence that he and the other election officials had risked prosecution to collude against Romney. \u00a0\nPlus, CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter countered, \"a Google search would show that there are also precincts in other states, like in Utah, where Obama did not get a single vote.\"\nTrumped up charges of voter fraud\nTrump\u2019s claims of voter fraud, which echo arguments for voter ID laws, are also not reflective of reality.\nWhile the U.S. Government Accountability Office has acknowledged that it\u2019s difficult to estimate how often voter fraud happens based on reported incidents, the evidence for rampant fraud is lacking.\nNews 21 found just 150 alleged cases of double voting, 56 cases of noncitizens voting, and 10 cases of voter impersonation across all elections from 2000 to 2011. Many of these never led to charges, while others were acquitted or dismissed. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School and an expert on voter fraud, found an even smaller number: 31 credible incidents out of more than 1 billion votes cast from 2000 to 2014.\nPut it in another way: You\u2019re more likely to get struck by lightning than to find voter fraud.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen voter fraud does occur, it\u2019s not always intentional. Multiple studies have traced known cases not to willful deception but to clerical errors or confusion.\nFor example, one case of a dead person voting (Alan J. Mandell) happened because a poll worker accidentally marked his name instead of the man who actually cast the ballot, Alan J. Mandel. Similarly, in one of just five cases of a noncitizen voting between 2000 and 2004, a permanent resident was told he was eligible and given a voter registration form by a DMV clerk when renewing his license.\nSo, given the rarity of occurrence, the lack of intent, and a federal penalty of a $10,000 fine or up to five years in prison, experts say it would be extremely difficult to rig an election through the ways Trump has suggested.\n\"I'd like to see him try to vote 10 times on Election Day. It would be virtually impossible and a knuckle-headed way to try to corrupt an election,\" said Lorraine Minnite, a political science professor at Rutgers University who wrote The Myth of Voter Fraud. \u00a0\nTo sway an election, an army of voters would have to visit multiple polling locations each, know the names and addresses of the people they were impersonating and produce fake ID\u2019s or forge their signatures \u2014 plus be willing to commit\u00a0perjury the entire time.\n\"Campaigns don\u2019t pay people to pretend to be people they\u2019re not. That\u2019s too stupid,\" said Mary Frances Berry, former chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and author of Five Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich, a book about electoral fraud.\nHow to rig an election\nFrom New York\u2019s Tammany Hall to the motto of \"vote early and often\" popularized in Chicago, election fraud is certainly part of U.S. political history. But election rigging today is constrained to local elections, as implementing a national election heist would be extremely difficult.\n\"Given the decentralized nature of our elections, there would be no single way to throw the results,\" said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine. \"Instead you\u2019d have to target enough states to make a difference in the Electoral College.\"\nThe first way is through buying votes, especially absentee ballots.\nBerry\u2019s Five Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich, which refers to the prize a Louisiana woman received for her vote, documents several cases of local campaigns and political machines purchasing votes, often from nursing homes and poor communities, in exchange for cash, whiskey or a paved driveway.\nThis is possible on a small scale because of a \"corrupt deal\" between local election officials and \"family fiefdoms\" with deep roots in municipal politics, Berry said.\nPresidential elections, on the other hand, are under much more scrutiny than sheriff races and subject to federal prosecution. For that reason, and given how complicated organizing the conspiracy across different communities would be, Berry says it\u2019s not probable that a national campaign or outside group would take the risk to buy a few votes.\nThe second way of rigging elections is through tampering with voting machines (looking at you, Olivia Pope of Scandal). Trump suggested this in 2012 when he warned that machines were switching Romney votes to Obama.\n\"That\u2019s not an indication of the system being rigged. That\u2019s an indication that it\u2019s lost its calibration,\" said Pamela Smith of Verified Voting, which monitors technological issues in elections.\nShe added that Trump likely was referring to voter reports of this common issue of overuse, while election rigging \"would require you not noticing.\" (Smith couldn\u2019t think of any examples of machines being tampered with and said, from her research, issues usually result from programming errors.)\nBallots cast on some electronic voting systems, however, don\u2019t have a paper trail, meaning the votes are not verifiable. Hackers could theoretically alter the results.\u00a0But this would also require a potential wrongdoer to physically access the machines on Election Day and serious coordination to circumvent all the security and auditing measures in place before, during and after voting, said Smith, adding, \"There are very few paths in the present scenario to flip something off the radar.\"\nThere\u2019s the added security of Pennsylvania law, which mandates post-election vote audits of randomly selected precincts. The majority of precincts in Virginia rely on paper ballots. And Florida, where use of electronic machines is fairly limited to providing accessibility for voters with disabilities, has a Republican governor (Gov. Rick Scott, a Trump supporter) and secretary of state (who oversees elections).\n\"Technological rigging or the more classic stuffing of the ballot box are not the kind of things that could be easily done or on the kind of scale that could affect an election,\" Hasen said. \"Trump\u2019s unsupported allegations are dangerous and fantasy.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. election system is rigged.\nHe has cited examples of voter fraud, which is extremely rare, often unintentional and not on a scale large enough to affect a national election.\nWhile there are isolated examples of bought local elections, experts say it cannot be replicated on a national scale. While it is possible to tamper with electronic voting machines, there is no evidence deliberate malfeasance has altered any election.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc4abb7b-5c25-49da-99c2-f86e08a8e0a3", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04474"}
