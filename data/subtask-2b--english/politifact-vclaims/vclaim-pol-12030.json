As it is, new jobs are not being created in New Jersey, according to Wisniewski, who also is chairman of the state Democratic Party.\n\n\"We\u2019ve seen far too long the governor\u2019s rhetoric doesn\u2019t match his actions,\" said Wisniewski (D-Middlesex) during the Nov. 21 interview. \"While he talks about job creation, we don't see jobs being created in this state.\"\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for PolitiFact New Jersey to realize Wisniewski\u2019s claim made no sense.\n\nThe state\u2019s economy may not be gaining as much speed as we\u2019d like, but the state has still seen an increase of nearly 40,000 private-sector jobs since January, according to the most recent seasonally adjusted data released by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development.\n\nLet\u2019s see how the labor statistics break down.\n\nA few days before Wisniewski made his statement, state officials released preliminary employment figures for October.\n\nCompared with October 2010, public-sector jobs saw a year-over-year decrease of 5,600. But that loss was offset by an increase of 28,100 private-sector jobs since October 2010.\n\nThus, total non-farm employment in October stood at 3,868,700, marking a year-over-year increase of 22,500 jobs, or about 0.6 percent.\n\nSo, what was Wisniewski talking about?\n\nThe assemblyman\u2019s communications director, Tim O\u2019Donovan, told us Wisniewski was referring to figures released last month. O\u2019Donovan pointed out how those figures show month-over-month decreases in total non-farm jobs in August and September.\n\nBut the latest data was available when Wisniewski made the claim. Also, according to Rutgers economics professor Joseph Seneca, one month is not a good indicator of employment changes, because single events can distort a given month.\n\n\"The standard approach would be to consider job changes over the past year (Oct 10 to Oct 11) or on a year to date basis (i.e. from Dec 10 through the latest month). Both of those measures indicate NJ is adding private sector jobs at a reasonable pace,\" Seneca told us in an email.\n\n\"The problem is that the recession losses were so large, the state has a long way to go to recover all the losses, but a start has been made in terms of private sector jobs,\" he added.\n\nIn a statement, Wisniewski said: \"If the Ledger wants to credit the Governor with job creation when unemployment has barely budged over the past year that's out of my control, but, as far as I'm concerned, it's far too premature to be giving anyone credit for creating jobs given our chronic unemployment and fragile economy.\"\n\nWe\u2019re not saying Republican Gov. Chris Christie is responsible for this job growth, but it\u2019s worth noting that since he took office in January 2010, New Jersey has seen an increase of 41,600 private-sector jobs.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBlasting Christie for his \"rhetoric\" about job creation, Wisniewski claimed \"we don't see jobs being created in this state.\"\n\nThe economic recovery may not be moving fast enough, but New Jersey has seen an increase in total non-farm jobs over the last year, driven by growth in the private-sector. Wisniewski should know better than to suggest otherwise.\n\nWe rate this statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12030"}
