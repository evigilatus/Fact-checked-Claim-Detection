Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats,\" Trump said Jan. 8 in his prime time address on the border wall. \"They changed their mind only after I was elected president.\"\nThat\u2019s a mischaracterization of the barrier that won Democratic support 13 years ago.\nJust over half of Democrats in the Senate voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush, including then-Sens. Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton. Most Democrats in the House voted against it, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi.\nThe law authorized a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the U.S.-Mexico border. By 2015, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had constructed 654 miles of fencing, the Government Accountability Office reported.\nThe fence was different from the wall Trump promised to build on the campaign trail, which he said would be made of \"hardened concrete\" as tall as \"95 stories\" with a \"very big, very beautiful door.\"\nTrump derided the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 campaign \u2014 he said it was \"not a wall\" but a \"little fence\" that could be scaled with a ladder.\n\"Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental \u2014 probably a snake was in the way or a toad,\" Trump said. (Actually, the project didn\u2019t face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2016 Associated Press report from the border described the fencing as \"rust-colored thick bars\" that form \"teeth-like slats.\" That includes the steel fence dividing Nogales in Arizona and Mexico, which is between 18 and 26 feet tall. \"There are miles of gaps between segments and openings in the fence itself,\" the AP reported.\nThe Democrats\u2019 offer to Trump is a continuing resolution on last year\u2019s appropriations act, which provided $1.3 billion for fencing and additional money for other types of border security. The language made it so that the funds could only be used on repairing or extending fencing that had already been built under the 2006 law.\nWe\u2019re rated similar statements in which the Trump administration has claimed Democrats wanted a wall\u00a0as Half True, but here, Trump goes farther. Democrats have not changed their stance on the border fencing they previously supported;\u00a0they simply don\u2019t support the more ambitious wall Trump proposes.\nOur ruling\nTrump said Schumer has \"has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected president.\"\nSchumer, along with tens of other Democrats including former President Barack Obama, voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. That\u2019s the majority of the barrier in place today along the southern border.\nHowever, the fence was mocked as a \"nothing wall\" by Trump in the past and was far less ambitious, both politically and physically, than the wall Trump wants to build now.\nFinally, Trump says the Democrats no longer support their previous position simply because he wants it. But Democrats have actually proposed current funding for the fencing that was approved in 2006.\u00a0\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2019-01-09 20:29:19 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Says Sen.
