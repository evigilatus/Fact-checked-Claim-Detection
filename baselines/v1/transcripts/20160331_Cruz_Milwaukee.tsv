0001	COOPER	Welcome to all of you who are joining us.
0002	COOPER	Were here with the three remaining Republican candidates.
0003	COOPER	In the audience tonight Republican and some independents, all of whom say they are voting in next weeks Republican primary.
0004	COOPER	Some have already made their decisions on a candidate, others still undecided.
0005	COOPER	They came up with the questions youll hear tonight.
0006	COOPER	We reviewed them to make sure the questions dont overlap.
0007	COOPER	Im going to ask a few questions as well, but tonight this town hall is a chance for voters to hear at length from the candidates.
0008	COOPER	So, lets get right to it.
0009	COOPER	Joining us right now, the U.S.
0010	COOPER	Senator from Texas.
0011	COOPER	Please welcome Ted Cruz.
0012	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0013	COOPER	Welcome.
0014	CRUZ	Thank you, good to be with you.
0015	COOPER	Congratulations on a big endorsement from the governor of the state, Scott Walker.
0016	COOPER	Obviously a great thing for your campaign.
0017	COOPER	Were going to hear a lot of questions tonight from the voters on the issues.
0018	COOPER	I want to just start by talking to you about a couple of issues of the day.
0019	COOPER	As you know, you talked a little bit today, Donald Trumps campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski (ph), charged today with Simple Battery.
0020	COOPER	If he was your campaign manager, would you ask him to resign?
0021	CRUZ	Of course.
0022	CRUZ	Look, it shouldnt be complicated that members of the campaign staff should not be physically assaulting the press.
0023	CRUZ	I mean, that shouldnt be a complicated decision.
0024	COOPER	He says hes innocent of all the charges.
0025	CRUZ	Well
0026	COOPER	 Do you believe it was assault?
0027	CRUZ	He has just been charged.
0028	CRUZ	I know that the reporter alleged that she was physically assaulted.
0029	CRUZ	That I will say, its consistent with the pattern of the Trump campaign.
0030	COOPER	Do you think it says something about the campaign itself?
0031	COOPER	About the leadership?
0032	CRUZ	The culture of the campaign has been a campaign built on attacks, on insults, and I think there is no place in politics for insults, for personal attacks, for going to the gutter, and there should be no place for physical violence either.
0033	COOPER	I want to ask you about the path ahead for you.
0034	COOPER	you need 85 percent of the remaining delegates to secure the nomination.
0035	COOPER	Not impossible, but highly improbable.
0036	COOPER	Will you admit tonight that a contested convention is your best bet to get the nomination?
0037	CRUZ	Not remotely because
0038	COOPER	Do you think you can get 85 percent?
0039	CRUZ	Absolutely, and our path going forward is to get 1,237.
0040	CRUZ	Most of the races coming up are either winnertakeall, or winnertakemost.
0041	COOPER	But, youve only gotten 30 percent of the delegates so far.
0042	COOPER	Were half over.
0043	CRUZ	Well
0044	COOPER	 How do you go from 30 percent to 85 percent?
0045	CRUZ	Ill tell you, the way you do that  its the situation.
0046	CRUZ	If two guys are hiking in the woods, and a bear start chasing, and you know the old joke that the fellow sits down and starts to put on his running shoes?
0047	CRUZ	And the guy turns to his friend and says, What are you doing?
0048	CRUZ	You cant outrun the bear.
0049	CRUZ	And, the guy says, I dont have to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun you.
0050	CRUZ	That principal is the same thing going forward, if we continue to beat Donald Trump  you know, we just had a few days ago in Utah a massive victory against Donald Trump and we got all of the delegates in Utah.
0051	CRUZ	If we continue to beat Donald Trump going forward most of the states are winnertakeall or winnertakemost, and we get North of 80 percent of the delegates simply by beating Donald Trump going forward.
0052	COOPER	But Donald Trump is still way out in front of you.
0053	COOPER	He won Louisiana.
0054	COOPER	You got more delegates out of Louisiana, which he is obviously upset about, but I mean, 85 percent in the remaining races, thats more than youve ever gotten anywhere.
0055	CRUZ	Look, but you dont have to win 85 percent, Anderson.
0056	CRUZ	The way it works, you have to win the races going forward but when you win, you get most or all the delegates.
0057	CRUZ	And heres the dynamic that has played out.
0058	CRUZ	A year ago there were 17 candidates.
0059	CRUZ	It was a fantastic, diverse, dynamic field.
0060	CRUZ	The field has narrowed now.
0061	CRUZ	And what Donald benefits from is division because Donald has had pretty consistently a floor of about 20 to 25 percent.
0062	CRUZ	But he has got a hard ceiling of about 35 to 40 percent that he has a real hard time breaking.
0063	CRUZ	And so when there are two or three or four other candidates and they divide the vote, he can win state after state with 30, 35 percent, even 40 percent.
0064	CRUZ	Head to head, Donald has an incredibly difficult time breaking 50 percent.
0065	COOPER	The Kasich campaign has made an effort to reach out to your campaign to strike some sort of a pact in order to defeat Donald Trump.
0066	COOPER	Wouldnt that make sense?
0067	COOPER	Apparently all the reports are so far youve not responded.
0068	CRUZ	Well, it makes no sense at all.
0069	CRUZ	John Kasich has no path to win it.
0070	CRUZ	We are competing to win.
0071	CRUZ	Were not competing to stop Trump.
0072	CRUZ	Were competing to win the nomination.
0073	CRUZ	John Kasich went 0 for 27.
0074	CRUZ	He lost 27 states in a row.
0075	COOPER	He admits though its going to go to a contested convention, thats where he says he can win.
0076	CRUZ	Look, I understand, except that its against the rules for John Kasich to be on the ballot.
0077	CRUZ	The rules provide that in order to be even on the ballot, if no one has 1,237, you have to have won at least 8 states.
0078	CRUZ	Now, there are only two candidates who are going to meet that threshold, Donald Trump and me.
0079	CRUZ	And so our preferred option is win 1,237 delegates before the convention.
0080	CRUZ	We are working hard to do that.
0081	CRUZ	And Ill mention Wisconsin is going to be critical in that.
0082	CRUZ	But the second option, which is entirely possible, we could get to a convention where nobody has 1,237 delegates, and we come in with a ton of delegates, Donald Trump comes in with a ton of delegates.
0083	CRUZ	And if that happens, then it becomes a battle for the delegates, but the only two names on the ballot are going to be Donald Trump and me.
0084	CRUZ	On the rules, those are the only two people that can be voted on.
0085	CRUZ	And I think in that situation, were in a very strong position to earn the 1,237 votes from the delegates who are elected by the people.
0086	COOPER	I want to talk about some policy here.
0087	COOPER	In the wake of the horrible attacks that we saw in Brussels, you proposed securing our borders, crushing ISIS, stopping refugees.
0088	COOPER	But you also suggested that law enforcement patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized. John Kasich said about that proposal So what we want to do is start policing Muslim neighborhoods, create more divisions, start policing neighborhoods in here La Crosse?
0089	COOPER	This is politics trying to appeal to peoples base instincts and fears.
0090	COOPER	Is that what youre doing?
0091	CRUZ	Look, what I believe we should do is we need a commanderinchief who is actually focused on keeping this country safe.
0092	CRUZ	You know, we saw
0093	COOPER	What does it mean, though, patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods?
0094	COOPER	How do you decide what neighborhoods  whats a Muslim neighborhood?
0095	CRUZ	Let me answer your question.
0096	CRUZ	We had a terror attack in Brussels last week.
0097	CRUZ	It was a horrific attack.
0098	CRUZ	President Obama could barely be bothered to stop his baseball game with communist dictators to say anything about it.
0099	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0100	CRUZ	And when he did, he followed this bizarre pattern that he has followed for year after year after year where he refuses to say the words radical Islamic terrorism.
0101	CRUZ	Instead what he does, what he did after the Paris terror attack, what he did after San Bernardino, is he goes on television and he lectures Americans about Islamophobia.
0102	CRUZ	Enough is enough.
0103	CRUZ	How about a president that actually stands up and defends this country?
0104	CRUZ	We need a commanderinchief
0105	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0106	COOPER	So what does that mean, patrol Muslim neighborhoods?
0107	CRUZ	What it means is that we target the enemy.
0108	CRUZ	Now, there is a difference between Islam and Islamism.
0109	CRUZ	Islamism is a political and theocratic philosophy that commands its adherents to wage violent jihad, to murder or to forcibly convert all infidels.
0110	CRUZ	And by infidels, they mean every one of the rest of us.
0111	CRUZ	Islamism is our enemy.
0112	CRUZ	And when President Obama and Hillary Clinton and the modern Democratic Party play this politically correct game of denying it, it means they dont fight it effectively.
0113	CRUZ	So, for example, lets talk about the consequences of it.
0114	CRUZ	Obama and Hillary both advocate bringing tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America.
0115	COOPER	Right, so you want to stop that, but you did talk about patrolling Muslim neighborhoods.
0116	CRUZ	Sure, absolutely.
0117	COOPER	And a lot of folks  you kept saying that worked in New York, but political correctness made the police stop that.
0118	CRUZ	Yes.
0119	COOPER	New York Police have pushed back on that.
0120	COOPER	Chief Bratton said thats just complete bunk.
0121	COOPER	And I want to read you what, in fact  I mean, the guy who ran that program that you say was such a big success says it didnt lead to any prosecutions, there were no leads from it.
0122	CRUZ	Listen, you are right that after I called for increased vigilance protecting us that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and New Yorks Mayor Bill de Blasio all attacked me.
0123	CRUZ	I wear that as a badge of pride.
0124	CRUZ	I will not apologize to anyone
0125	COOPER	 Bill Bratton, worked for Rudy Giuliani
0126	CRUZ	I understand that the Commissioner who works for Bill de Blasio has a political imperative.
0127	CRUZ	de Blasio is a leftwing radical.
0128	COOPER	The commander who oversaw the very program that you claim was as success in New York testified under oath that it didnt lead to any investigations in the six years.
0129	CRUZ	Anderson, in New York, this was a successful program.
0130	COOPER	 In what way?
0131	CRUZ	It was set up under Mayor Michael Bloomberg to monitor and to work cooperatively with the Muslim community to prevent radicalization, and to stop radical Islamic terrorism plots before it occurs
0132	COOPER	 Can you name one case
0133	CRUZ	There are a number of cases.
0134	CRUZ	It identified a bookstore that was a locus for radicalization and allowed law enforcement to after that bookstore, and what happened was when Mayor Bill de Blasio got elected he gave in to political correctness and shut the unit down.
0135	CRUZ	Listen, if you want to stop radical Islamic terrorism, the answer isnt to go hang out in random neighborhoods.
0136	CRUZ	It is instead to focus on communities where radicalization is a risk.
0137	CRUZ	And, Ill tell you what Europe has done.
0138	CRUZ	Europe has followed the path that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to put us on.
0139	CRUZ	That the tragedies, these terror attacks in Europe are a result of failed immigration policies where theyve allowed vast numbers of Islamic terrorists to come into Europe, and theyre in communities that are isolated.
0140	CRUZ	Theyre called NoGo communities where the law enforcement doesnt engage in those communities.
0141	CRUZ	One in Brussels, Molenbeek, has been a particular incubator for radical Islamic terrorism.
0142	CRUZ	Many of these terrorist plots trace back to Molenbeek.
0143	CRUZ	My plan is very simple, America should not make the mistakes of Europe.
0144	CRUZ	We should not disengage.
0145	CRUZ	We should have law enforcement actively engage to stop radicalization before it stops  and, I recognize that the media and the Democrats hate it when someone actually describes who the enemy is.
0146	CRUZ	Ill tell ya, as President, every single day I will wake up fighting radical Islamic terrorism and working to defeat it.
0147	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0148	COOPER	Turning back to the campaign.
0149	COOPER	Its obviously been a very rough and tumble week between you and Donald Trump.
0150	COOPER	A salacious story about you was published in National Enquirer.
0151	COOPER	You say Donald Trump, the people around him, were responsible for planting that story.
0152	COOPER	Do you have any proof of that?
0153	CRUZ	Sure.
0154	CRUZ	Theres the story, on its face, quoted on the record, Roger Stone.
0155	COOPER	Former advisor to
0156	CRUZ	 Roger Stone has been Donald Trumps Chief Political adviser.
0157	CRUZ	He planned and ran his presidential campaign, and hes been his hatchet man.
0158	CRUZ	He spent 40 years as a hatchet man.
0159	CRUZ	But, not only that, the head of the National Enquirer, a guy named David Pecker, is good friends with Donald Trump.
0160	COOPER	But you dont know it for a fact that Donald Trump planted that story?
0161	CRUZ	Of course I do.
0162	CRUZ	When his good friend  you know, the National Enquirer, in its history, has never endorsed a presidential candidate until Donald Trump?
0163	CRUZ	And, now, David Pecker  look, Donald Trump suggested David Pecker, the head of the National Enquirer, should take over Time Magazine.
0164	CRUZ	Who in their right mind should suggest the head of the National Enquirer should take over Time magazine?
0165	COOPER	Youve been very tough recently, but early on the campaign it seemed like you made a political calculation not to go after him.
0166	COOPER	Just last week on a radio program, you said that essentially those candidates who did go after him early on were road kill, you needed to build your base.
0167	COOPER	Back in December you tweeted, The establishments only hope, Trump and me in a cage match, sorry to disappoint, Donald Trump is terrific.
0168	COOPER	That was after hed already made fun of Carly Fiorinas face, after hed gone after Megyn Kelly.
0169	COOPER	At that point in December, did you really believe Donald Trump was terrific?
0170	CRUZ	Look, what I knew was that the media was engaged in a love fest.
0171	CRUZ	Giving Donald Trump $2 billion dollars in premium (ph)
0172	COOPER	 Sounds like you were engaged in a love fest.
0173	CRUZ	Lets be clear, how many hours of free media do CNN, and FOX, and every other station  you let him call in, and for a year  $2 billion dollars of free media
0174	COOPER	 Well, I got to say, weve asked you for interviews pretty much every day, and youve declined every offer on my program
0175	CRUZ	 Well, Anderson.
0176	COOPER	 So, you can come on any time
0177	CRUZ	 I want to point out Ive been inviting Donald Trump for several days to come and make this a debate.
0178	CRUZ	Hes coming later, and hes terrified to make it a debate because he doesnt want to actually stand and have his record challenged.
0179	COOPER	But, when you called him terrific back in December, did you really believe that, or was that political calculation?
0180	CRUZ	Let me make a point.
0181	CRUZ	There has been a distinction that I have followed throughout, which is that I keep the focus on issues and substance, so Im happy to draw distinction with Donald Trump on the issues, whether it is economic policy  that he doesnt have a policy to bring jobs back to America, whether it is national security where is advocating for a far too weak foreign policy that leaves us vulnerable.
0182	CRUZ	What Im not interested in doing is what Donalds pattern has been, which is the personal attacks.
0183	CRUZ	Its going to the gutter, its attacking family members.
0184	CRUZ	None of that has any place in politics.
0185	CRUZ	We ought to be discussing tax policy, we ought to be discussing national security.
0186	CRUZ	We ought to be discussing substance
0187	COOPER	 Lets do that now
0188	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0189	CRUZ	 Not engaging in mudslinging
0190	COOPER	 Lets go to our first member of the audience.
0191	COOPER	This is Thomas Dougherty (ph).
0192	COOPER	Hes a student from Brookfield (ph) who says hes still making up his mind.
0193	COOPER	So you could pick up a vote here.
0194	COOPER	Thomas, welcome.
0195	CRUZ	Great.
0196	CRUZ	Hey, Thomas.
0197	QUESTION	Hi, Senator Cruz.
0198	QUESTION	My question for you is, how and why does your religion play a part in your political decisionmaking?
0199	QUESTION	Dont you think it should be more of a moral belief and not something that can interfere with your decisionmaking when youre making decisions for all religions in the United States?
0200	CRUZ	Well, Thomas, thank you for that question.
0201	CRUZ	Listen, with Me, as with many people in America, my faith is an integral part of who I am.
0202	CRUZ	Im a Christian, and Im not embarrassed to say that.
0203	CRUZ	Im not going to hide that and treat it like its something you cant admit publicly and acknowledge.
0204	CRUZ	Its an important part of who you are.
0205	CRUZ	But I also think those in politics have an obligation not to wear their faith on their sleeve.
0206	CRUZ	There have been far too many politicians that run around behaving like theyre holier than thou.
0207	CRUZ	And Ill tell you, my attitude as a voter when some politician stands up and says, Im running because God told me to vote  to run, my reaction as a voter is, great, when God tells me to vote for you, well be on the same page.
0208	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0209	CRUZ	And so, listen, Im not asking you to vote for me because of my personal faith with Jesus Christ.
0210	CRUZ	Im asking you to vote for me because Ive spent a lifetime fighting to defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, fighting to defend the American free enterprise system, and we need a leader who will stand up every day and protect the rights of everyone, whether theyre Christians or Jews or Muslims or anyone else.
0211	CRUZ	The bill of rights protects all Americans.
0212	CRUZ	It protects atheists.
0213	CRUZ	Thats the beauty of the bill of rights, is that we have the freedom to seek out god, to worship and to live according to our faith and our conscience, and I think the Constitution and Bill of Rights is a unifying principle that can bring us together across faiths, across races, across ethnicity.
0214	CRUZ	And we need to come together behind the unifying principles that built America.
0215	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0216	COOPER	Thank you for your question.
0217	COOPER	I want you to meet  this is Tim Matson (ph).
0218	COOPER	His son, Jordan, traveled to Jordan in 2014, fought alongside Kurdish forces that were taking on ISIS.
0219	COOPER	Tim says he is undecided.
0220	COOPER	Tim, welcome.
0221	QUESTION	Senator, when Jordan left for Syria, I was furious with him.
0222	QUESTION	I couldnt understand how he could do this.
0223	QUESTION	But then I followed his steps on the internet, and I saw the mass murders and beheadings, sometimes of young children, and I understood.
0224	QUESTION	Now I know we cant be police of the world, but theres lines that have been crossed that no civilized nation should ignore.
0225	QUESTION	And we have a nation thats often said, never again, but there again, here we are.
0226	QUESTION	So as commander in chief, will you send an overwhelming force with unrestricted use of power to obliterate ISIS and send a message to those who want to do evil upon the innocents of their fate (ph) if they do this?
0227	CRUZ	Well, Tim, thank you for that question.
0228	CRUZ	And thank you for your son, Jordan, serving, and thank you for his sacrifice.
0229	CRUZ	You know, the question of when to commit U.S. armed forces to combat is the most serious decision any president can make.
0230	CRUZ	And I believe the decision to use military force should be keyed to the vital national security interest of this country.
0231	CRUZ	Far too often weve seen in the last seven years where President Obama has not focused on our national security interests.
0232	CRUZ	So, for example, we saw in Libya, Moammar Gadhafi, the dictator there, was a bad man.
0233	CRUZ	He had a horrible human rights record.
0234	CRUZ	He had been a state sponsor of terrorists.
0235	CRUZ	But Gadhafi in his latter years had actually shaped up his conduct pretty dramatically in response to U.S. strength and had become an active participant working with America stopping radical Islamic terrorists  tracking them down, apprehending them, handing them over to us.
0236	CRUZ	And what President Obama and Hillary Clinton did is they ended up joining with and leading many world forces in toppling Gadhafi, ultimately killing Gadhafi.
0237	CRUZ	And the consequence in Libya is that country was handed over to radical Islamic terrorists.
0238	CRUZ	Its become a war zone of battling war lords.
0239	CRUZ	And
0240	COOPER	The question is about U.S. troops, though, U.S. forces on the ground to defeat ISIS.
0241	CRUZ	I understand.
0242	CRUZ	And Im answering the question, Anderson.
0243	CRUZ	Thank you.
0244	CRUZ	That was an enormous mistake.
0245	CRUZ	And the reason they made the mistake is they werent focused on U.S. national security interests.
0246	CRUZ	They were in the interests of promoting democracy, and toppling a government that ends up handing it over to radical Islamic terrorists is a much worse outcome.
0247	CRUZ	We saw a similar thing in Egypt, where Obama and Hillary both cheered the toppling of Hosni Mubarak, the head of Egypt.
0248	CRUZ	Egypt was handed over to the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Morsi.
0249	CRUZ	The Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization.
0250	CRUZ	That was profoundly harmful for U.S. national security interests.
0251	CRUZ	Thankfully president elSisi is now in charge of Egypt.
0252	CRUZ	Now with regard to Syria, Assad is a monster.
0253	CRUZ	I agree with you.
0254	CRUZ	Hes a horrible man.
0255	CRUZ	He has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own citizens.
0256	CRUZ	He has murdered women.
0257	CRUZ	He has murdered children.
0258	CRUZ	He has used chemical weapons against them.
0259	CRUZ	But the problem is, if we simply topple Assad, the most likely outcome is that ISIS takes over Syria.
0260	CRUZ	And handing Syria over to ISIS, to radical Islamic terrorists who are waging war with us is a mistake.
0261	CRUZ	So your question of what we should do, our focus, I believe, in Syria should not be on toppling Assad.
0262	CRUZ	Our focus should be on utterly and completely destroying ISIS, because ISIS is our enemy and ISIS has declared war on America and they pose a direct threat to our national security interests.
0263	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0264	COOPER	In order to topple ISIS, would you be  I mean, his question is sending an overwhelming ground force.
0265	COOPER	Would you be willing to send U.S. troops on the ground?
0266	COOPER	Not just Special Forces as is currently being done.
0267	CRUZ	Look, I will do whatever is necessary militarily to defeat ISIS.
0268	CRUZ	Now, defeating ISIS is going to have a lot of components.
0269	CRUZ	One of the most important components is overwhelming air power.
0270	COOPER	Youve talked about carpet bombing and just recently you said carpet bomb them into oblivion. Lieutenant General Charles Brown Jr., who is the commander of U.S. Air Forces, Central Command, said carpet bombing is not effective for the operation that were actually executing because were using precisionguided munitions on a regular basis and, in fact, carpet bombing civilian areas is a violation of the Geneva Conventions.
0271	CRUZ	Nobody has talked about targeting civilian areas.
0272	CRUZ	What I have suggested we should do is use overwhelming air power.
0273	CRUZ	And let me  lets talk some specifics and some facts.
0274	COOPER	What does carpet bombing mean?
0275	CRUZ	Im trying to answer your question, Anderson.
0276	COOPER	OK. Just for a fact, ISIS is in many civilian areas.
0277	CRUZ	Lets talk specific facts.
0278	CRUZ	The first Persian Gulf War, a little over 25 years ago, we were launching roughly 1,100 air attacks a day.
0279	CRUZ	We were using overwhelming airpower.
0280	CRUZ	Its one of the great strengths of the tremendous American military is our air superiority is second to none.
0281	CRUZ	Right now, today, Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.
0282	COOPER	Right, but
0283	CRUZ	Compare the  but hold on, let me make my point, please, sir.
0284	CRUZ	If you compare those two numbers, 1,100 air attacks a day, we did that for 37 days, and then our troops went in and in a dayandahalf mopped up what was left of the Iraqi army.
0285	CRUZ	Eleven hundred air attacks a day does crushing debilitating damage.
0286	CRUZ	Fifteen to 30 a day is photoop foreign policy.
0287	COOPER	But Ive talked to commanders who actually did the air campaign who said, look, its easy when youre trying to take out  not easy, but its one thing when you are trying take out a governments military, you can bomb their militaryindustrial complex, you can bomb factories, you can bomb their centers of command and control, you can bomb barracks.
0288	COOPER	ISIS is a completely different kind of enemy.
0289	CRUZ	But you can use all of those tools.
0290	CRUZ	So you can take out their command and control headquarters.
0291	CRUZ	You can take out their communication.
0292	CRUZ	You can take out their means of transportation, ingress and egress.
0293	CRUZ	You can take out their oil fields.
0294	CRUZ	You can take out their oil refining capacity.
0295	CRUZ	You can take out their infrastructure.
0296	CRUZ	You can target their troops and their troop movements.
0297	CRUZ	And were not doing that right now.
0298	CRUZ	Overwhelming airpower is the first step, now its not the only step, but overwhelming airpower is the first step.
0299	CRUZ	The next step is arming the Kurds.
0300	CRUZ	The Kurds, the Peshmerga, fighting forces of the Kurds are very, very effective fighters.
0301	CRUZ	Theyre longtime allies of America.
0302	CRUZ	Theyre fighting ISIS right now.
0303	CRUZ	ISIS is using U.S. military equipment that they seized in Iraq.
0304	CRUZ	The Kurds are using outmoded equipment and the Obama administration refuses to arm them because of political reasons.
0305	CRUZ	That doesnt make sense.
0306	CRUZ	We ought to be arming the Kurds and let them kill ISIS.
0307	CRUZ	And then beyond that the question of Special Forces and ground troops.
0308	CRUZ	We should do whatever is necessary to win, but Ill tell you what I wont do is I will not send our troops into combat the way Barack Obama is doing with rules of engagement so strict that they cannot fight, they cannot win, and they cannot defeat the enemy.
0309	CRUZ	If were going to use our troops, were going to defeat the enemy.
0310	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0311	COOPER	I want to go to our next questioner.
0312	COOPER	This is Shannon OConnell.
0313	COOPER	She works in health care.
0314	COOPER	Shes an independent voter.
0315	COOPER	She says she is still undecided.
0316	COOPER	Shannon, welcome.
0317	CRUZ	Hi, Shannon.
0318	QUESTION	Thank you.
0319	QUESTION	My question is more personal in nature.
0320	QUESTION	What would you regard as your greatest personal failure and what did you learn from it?
0321	CRUZ	You know, those are always  whether in political campaign or a job interview, those are always tricky questions.
0322	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0323	CRUZ	You know, any time you go for a job interview, you sit down and youre like, OK, whats your greatest weakness?
0324	CRUZ	And, like, the classic answer people give at a job interview, you know, my greatest weakness is I just work too hard.
0325	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0326	CRUZ	Im just such a disciplined employee, I just put my work in front of everything else.
0327	CRUZ	Look, there are pros and cons to it.
0328	CRUZ	What I will say is Im apretty driven guy.
0329	CRUZ	That has pros and cons.
0330	CRUZ	I have always been a very driven guy.
0331	CRUZ	 Im just such a disciplined employee, I just put my work in front of everything else.
0332	CRUZ	Look, there are pros and cons to it.
0333	CRUZ	What I will say is Im a pretty driven guy.
0334	CRUZ	That has pros and cons.
0335	CRUZ	I have always been a very driven guy.
0336	CRUZ	I believe passionately in freemarket principles and the Constitution.
0337	CRUZ	My whole life  I mean, when I was a teenager, I studied and memorized a shortened mnemonic (ph) version of the Constitution and traveled around as part of a nonprofit organization in Houston speaking about the Constitution, speaking about freemarket principles.
0338	CRUZ	And, you know, a lot of that, I think the reason that Im so driven on this front has to do with my family background.
0339	CRUZ	My father was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba, and when my dad came to America, he had nothing, and it really is  its an amazing thing when you grow up in the house with someone whos fled oppression, because I remember when I was a little kid, wed be watching TV, and there was an urgency to politics.
0340	CRUZ	It wasnt, oh, thats interesting, a couple of candidates.
0341	CRUZ	It was, having principled men and women in office is how you protect yourself from tyranny.
0342	CRUZ	Now, Ill confess, growing up in a CubanAmerican household, youre raised where there are two families  there are two parties.
0343	CRUZ	The Republicans and the Communists.
0344	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0345	CRUZ	And anyone who is CubanAmerican will understand Im not kidding really with that.
0346	CRUZ	Now, I was really saddened to see Barack Obama go and pal around with the Castros and pose under a Che Guevera picture.
0347	CRUZ	I mean, it drove that point home.
0348	CRUZ	But as a kid, that gives you an urgency.
0349	CRUZ	And so at times, listen, Im hard charging.
0350	CRUZ	That means Ive stepped on some toes.
0351	CRUZ	That means Ive been focused very hard on fighting those fights, and maybe I should have pulled back in some circumstances.
0352	CRUZ	So it is a strength and a weakness.
0353	CRUZ	But I will say this, I am someone who what you see is what you get.
0354	CRUZ	You know what Im going to do in office.
0355	CRUZ	Its what Ive done every day.
0356	CRUZ	Its what I believe.
0357	CRUZ	Its what Ive spent my life fighting for.
0358	CRUZ	And I think were at a time where we need a president who we know what he will do, and we know we can trust them to follow through on what theyre saying.
0359	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0360	COOPER	Thank you for your question.
0361	COOPER	This is William Wake (ph).
0362	COOPER	Hes got one of the toughest jobs I think there is.
0363	COOPER	Hes a middle school social studies teacher.
0364	COOPER	He says hes leaning toward voting for you.
0365	COOPER	William?
0366	QUESTION	Senator Cruz
0367	CRUZ	Follow your instincts, William.
0368	QUESTION	Yes, right.
0369	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0370	QUESTION	My students will often ask me, you know, theyll say, have you seen or heard what the candidates are saying?
0371	QUESTION	And oftentimes its not about substance.
0372	QUESTION	Its about, you know, what name weve been calling each other.
0373	QUESTION	So I guess my question is, is it a good example to set for our youth of America, and should we stay on substance instead of calls each other names?
0374	CRUZ	Yes.
0375	CRUZ	Well, William, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you for the difference you make teaching kids and teaching in middle school.
0376	CRUZ	I mean, middle school is obviously just a really pivotal age.
0377	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0378	CRUZ	And I worry about that question, what lesson to our kids take watching this?
0379	CRUZ	You know, Heidi and I, our girls are 5 and 7.
0380	CRUZ	And theyre watching presidential candidates insulting each other, yelling, cursing, attacking family members.
0381	CRUZ	I mean, its gotten really ugly, and just when you dont think it can get any uglier, it gets uglier.
0382	CRUZ	I think that has no place in politics, and my view  I have no ability to control what another candidate does.
0383	CRUZ	But what I can control is my approach.
0384	CRUZ	Ill tell you the promise that I made to the people who joined our campaign from the beginning, the supporters who were with us from the beginning.
0385	CRUZ	I said, listen, I cant promise were going to win, I think we will, but I can promise you two things.
0386	CRUZ	One, were going to work every day with a joyful spirit, were going to work every day and put everything weave into this campaign., and number two, were going to do so with integrity.
0387	CRUZ	Were not going to go into the gutter.
0388	CRUZ	Were not going to attack people personally.
0389	CRUZ	Were not going to malign their character.
0390	CRUZ	Were going to focus on issues and substance.
0391	CRUZ	Now in the course of the campaign, there have been a bunch of candidates engaging in personal insults.
0392	CRUZ	Ive worked very, very hard to stay out of that and say, Im not going into the gutter.
0393	CRUZ	If you attack me personally, Im not going to respond in kind.
0394	CRUZ	Now, if you want to talk about your tax plan, Ill compare my tax plan to your tax plan.
0395	CRUZ	That should be the bread and butter of politics.
0396	CRUZ	And it is my hope that at the end of the day that that is the approach that prevails.
0397	CRUZ	I think its what the people of Wisconsin want.
0398	CRUZ	I think its what the people of America want.
0399	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0400	COOPER	Over here we have Jason Vorpel (ph).
0401	COOPER	Hes a dairy farmer from Random Lake, Wisconsin.
0402	COOPER	He says hes voting for you, Senator Cruz  Jason.
0403	CRUZ	Thank you, Jason.
0404	QUESTION	I am a dairy farmer here in Wisconsin, and dairy farming in my family goes back to the 1800s when my greatgreat grandparents starting farming with six cows.
0405	QUESTION	Today we have 2,800 cows.
0406	CRUZ	Wow.
0407	QUESTION	And its a 24hour operation.
0408	QUESTION	We offer a competitive wage and offer full benefits to all our employees.
0409	QUESTION	Most farms in the dairy industry cannot find Americanborn workers to milk the cows and take care of them.
0410	QUESTION	The only ones willing to do this hard work are Latino immigrants who, if we didnt have them for eight hours, there would be a crisis across the country in our industry.
0411	QUESTION	What is the shortterm solution to keep our current labor force intact?
0412	QUESTION	And what is the longterm solution moving forward?
0413	CRUZ	Right.
0414	CRUZ	Well, thank you for sharing your experience as a dairy farmer, and, you know, there are farmers across this country who are really hurting.
0415	CRUZ	And farmers are hurting from a lot of things.
0416	CRUZ	Theyre hurting from a federal government whose policies have been making it harder and harder for farmers to survive.
0417	CRUZ	Theyre hurting from an EPA who is imposing massive burdens on farms.
0418	CRUZ	For example, the Waters of the United States Rule where the EPA has tried to define a puddle or a drainage ditch on your farm to be navigable waters and thus subject to massive environmental regulations.
0419	CRUZ	And I think we need a president, we need an administration that takes the burdens off farmers so that it is easier to do your job which is incredibly important.
0420	CRUZ	Now, when it comes to labor, I understand the need to have labor and that it can be hard to have agricultural labor.
0421	CRUZ	You know, Ill tell you, though, one of the consequences of our immigration system right now, when weve got 12 million people who are here illegally, that has an effect of driving down wages for Americans across this country.
0422	CRUZ	There was a very interesting article, it was about, oh, a month, maybe six weeks ago in The Wall Street Journal, it was focusing on Arizona.
0423	CRUZ	Youll recall several years ago Arizona put in place really tough laws on illegal immigration.
0424	CRUZ	And they were criticized loudly for putting those laws in place.
0425	CRUZ	And it was interesting, this Wall Street Journal article, because it talked about what happened in the wake of that law, which is a great many of the illegal immigrants left.
0426	CRUZ	They left the state and went elsewhere.
0427	CRUZ	And it actually quoted a farmer, and thats the reason Im bringing up this example, it quoted a farmer, a fellow in Arizona who was growing peppers.
0428	CRUZ	And he complained, he said, listen, all people that we had picking peppers, they left.
0429	CRUZ	And he said, I didnt know what to do.
0430	CRUZ	I didnt know that we were going to be able to pick our peppers.
0431	CRUZ	And what it described that he did is he actually went and invented a new tool to help pick the peppers.
0432	CRUZ	And then he went down to the local community college and he ended up hiring Americans coming out of the community college.
0433	CRUZ	He had to pay them more.
0434	CRUZ	He paid them about $15 an hour.
0435	CRUZ	But he continues picking his peppers except hes doing so in a situation where what has happened in Arizona, the public expenditures have plummeted.
0436	CRUZ	Arizona is spending hundreds of millions of dollars less on prisons, on education, on hospitals, for those here illegally.
0437	CRUZ	That means thats hundreds of millions of dollars available to take care of U.S. citizens.
0438	CRUZ	And also unemployment has gone down and median wages for Americans have gone up in the construction industry, carpenters.
0439	CRUZ	Were seeing wages going up.
0440	CRUZ	And I think the view  our immigration laws should benefit American workers.
0441	CRUZ	That should be the focus of immigration laws.
0442	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0443	CRUZ	And so what I intend to do as president is, number one, were going to secure the border.
0444	CRUZ	Were going to end illegal immigration.
0445	CRUZ	We know how to do it.
0446	CRUZ	And whats missing is the political will to get it done.
0447	CRUZ	The difference is I will get it done.
0448	CRUZ	But beyond that, when it comes to legal immigration, listen, I think on immigration the principles are really simple.
0449	CRUZ	Legal, good.
0450	CRUZ	Illegal, bad.
0451	CRUZ	Its amazing how many  how many folks in politics, how many folks in the media have trouble understanding that.
0452	CRUZ	Im reminded, you guys remember former Congressman Sonny Bono from Sonny  Cher?
0453	CRUZ	Years ago Sonny Bono was asked, whats your view on illegal immigration?
0454	CRUZ	He said, well, its illegal, isnt it?
0455	CRUZ	Were going to solve this problem by securing the border and ending illegal immigration.
0456	CRUZ	And once we do that, thats going to drive up wages for Americans across this country.
0457	CRUZ	And in the agriculture world, I think the first option should be trying to find American workers.
0458	CRUZ	Now that may mean wages come up.
0459	CRUZ	It may mean that we have to use more tools.
0460	CRUZ	Weve seen in Arizona that has happened.
0461	CRUZ	And beyond that, our legal immigration system, if there are needs in the labor force and American workers not available to do it, thats where legal immigration should come in.
0462	CRUZ	But it should be in a situation where youre vetting the people rather than just having people come in that we dont know who they are, and we dont know their criminal history, we dont know their background.
0463	CRUZ	It should be through the legal system targeted in a way that protects American workers.
0464	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0465	COOPER	Were going to have more with Senator Cruz in just a moment.
0466	COOPER	Were going to take a short break.
0467	COOPER	Also ahead tonight in Milwaukee, John Kasich and Donald Trump.
0468	COOPER	But more with Ted Cruz coming up next.
0469	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0470	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0471	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0472	COOPER	And welcome back.
0473	COOPER	Were here at the Riverside Theater in downtown Milwaukee, taking voter questions for Senator Ted Cruz.
0474	COOPER	John Kasich, Donald Trump coming up.
0475	COOPER	But more voter questions now for Senator Cruz.
0476	COOPER	I want to start, though  more than six months ago, you pledged to support the Republican nominee.
0477	COOPER	When things started getting rough with Donald Trump, you said you were going to stick with that pledge because youd given your word.
0478	COOPER	I saw in an interview with my colleague, Sunlen Serfaty  I think it was just yesterday.
0479	COOPER	Youre said youre not in a habit of supporting people who attack your wife and attack your family.
0480	COOPER	Do you still stand by the pledge to support whoever the nominee, even if its Donald Trump?
0481	CRUZ	Well, Anderson, as you mentioned, what I said is true.
0482	CRUZ	Im not in the habit of supporting someone who attacks my wife and attacks my family.
0483	CRUZ	I think that is going beyond the line.
0484	CRUZ	I think our wives, I think our kids should be off limits.
0485	CRUZ	They dont belong in the attacks.
0486	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0487	CRUZ	And, listen, Im not an easy person to tick off, but when you go after my wife, when you go after my daughters, that does it.
0488	CRUZ	And I think  I want this race to stay focused on policy and issues and solutions to the real problems facing America.
0489	CRUZ	Thats where Im going to stay focused.
0490	CRUZ	But if other candidates dont, I think thats beyond the pale.
0491	COOPER	So I just have to followup, if Donald Trump is the GOP nominee, would you support him?
0492	CRUZ	Let me tell you my solution to that.
0493	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0494	CRUZ	Donald is not going to be the GOP nominee.
0495	CRUZ	Were going to beat him.
0496	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0497	COOPER	I would be remiss if I didnt followup.
0498	COOPER	Thats my greatest failing.
0499	COOPER	That was the question earlier for you.
0500	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0501	COOPER	My greatest failing is sometimes I dont follow up, so not to give into that, I mean, I got to ask, I will assume by you saying you would not support him, that the answer is you would not support him if he is the nominee?
0502	CRUZ	I gave you my answer.
0503	CRUZ	Listen, I think nominating Donald Trump would be an absolute train wreck.
0504	CRUZ	I think it would hand the general election to Hillary Clinton.
0505	CRUZ	Poll after poll after poll shows Donald Trump losing 10, 11, 12 points or more.
0506	CRUZ	I dont want to see the White House given over to Hillary Clinton.
0507	CRUZ	I dont want to see us lose the Senate and House, lose the Supreme Court for a generation, lose the Bill of Rights.
0508	CRUZ	I think nominating Donald Trump is a disaster, and so the answer to that is not to scream and yell and cry and attack him, the answer to that is to beat him at the ballot box.
0509	CRUZ	Thats what were working every day to do.
0510	CRUZ	Its what were campaigning every day here in Wisconsin to do.
0511	COOPER	This is Benjamin Miller.
0512	COOPER	Hes a student at University of Wisconsin.
0513	COOPER	He says hes also voting for you next week.
0514	COOPER	Benjamin, welcome.
0515	QUESTION	Good evening, senator.
0516	CRUZ	Benjamin, welcome.
0517	QUESTION	Both Paris and now Brussels have suffered blindside attacks by Islamic terrorists.
0518	QUESTION	Although I fear a terrorist attack on the United States, I have a greater fear of the government taking away my constitutional freedoms and privacy in the name of security.
0519	CRUZ	Yes.
0520	QUESTION	As president, how will you ensure that America is not blindly attacked, while also maintaining the privacy of the American people?
0521	CRUZ	Well, Benjamin, thank you for that question, and its a very important question.
0522	CRUZ	You know, there are some in politics who say its an eitheror choice.
0523	CRUZ	We can either protect America or protect our civil liberties.
0524	CRUZ	I dont accept that choice.
0525	CRUZ	I think it is possible to walk and chew gum at the same time.
0526	CRUZ	I think it is possible  and the difference  something the Obama administration is not very good at  theyre not very good at distinguishing between bad guys and good guys.
0527	CRUZ	So over and over again, the Obama administrations solution, for example, when it comes to surveillance, was to monitor the phone calls or the emails of millions of lawabiding citizens, but because of their political correctness, because they wont focus on and identify radical Islamic terrorists, they dont actually target the bad guys.
0528	CRUZ	Its why its so important  and you know, its interesting, Benjamin, people in the media, sometimes they ask, why does it matter whether Obama will say the words radical Islamic terrorism? It matters because if you dont identify the problem, you dont devote  you dont direct law enforcement and national security resources to stopping it.
0529	CRUZ	Ill give a specific example.
0530	CRUZ	My home state of Florida, Fort Hood, Nidal Hassan committed a horrific terrorist attack there.
0531	CRUZ	Now, the Obama administration knew before the attack that Nidal Hassan communicated with Anwar Al Awlaki, a known radical Islamic cleric.
0532	CRUZ	They knew that Nidal Hassan had asked about the permissibility of waging jihad and murdering his fellow soldiers.
0533	CRUZ	And yet for whatever reason, political correctness or what have you, they didnt do anything.
0534	CRUZ	If we find out that a member of the Armed Services is talking with a radical Islamic cleric and asking about waging jihad against his fellow soldiers, within minutes, MPs should show up at his door and put him in handcuffs.
0535	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0536	CRUZ	But they didnt do that, and Nidal Hassan murdered 14 innocent souls, including an unborn child, yelling allahu akbar. And then the Obama administration in truly a stunning display of political correctness defined that terrorist attack as workplace violence.
0537	CRUZ	We need to direct our resources at going after the Nidal Hassans, going after the radical Islamic terrorists, and we can do that at the same time as not infringing the privacy of lawabiding Americans, distinguishing between the bad guys and the good guys.
0538	CRUZ	Thats what this administration hadnt been doing.
0539	COOPER	Thank you for your question.
0540	COOPER	This is Victoria Ostry (ph), a small business owner from Brookefield (ph).
0541	COOPER	She says she is also voting for you next week.
0542	COOPER	Victoria?
0543	QUESTION	Hi, Senator Cruz.
0544	CRUZ	Hi, Victoria.
0545	QUESTION	Women are more than 50 percent of the voting electorate.
0546	QUESTION	What have you done, and what are you going to do to convince and persuade women to vote for you?
0547	CRUZ	Well, Victoria, thank you for that question, and youre absolutely right.
0548	CRUZ	You know, I will say one of the things Ive really been blessed in my life is that I have a grown up surrounded by strong women.
0549	CRUZ	My mom is someone who I admire immensely.
0550	CRUZ	My mom is IrishItalian.
0551	CRUZ	She grew up Wilmington, Delaware.
0552	CRUZ	She grew up in a workingclass family.
0553	CRUZ	Her mom was the second youngest of 17 kids.
0554	CRUZ	And, my mom became the first person in her family ever to go to college.
0555	CRUZ	And, that was not easy for her because my grandfather, her dad, he was not an easy man.
0556	CRUZ	He was a drunk, and he didnt think women should be educated.
0557	CRUZ	And, so my mom stood up to her father.
0558	CRUZ	She stood up to him, confronted him and she ended up going Rice.
0559	CRUZ	She majored in math in 1956., and then she got hired at Shell as a computer programmer.
0560	CRUZ	Now, you want to talk about two industries, computer science and oil and gas, neither one of which were welcoming to women, and my mom was at the intersection of them both.
0561	CRUZ	And, I remember my mom used to tell me a lot when I was a kid, she said, she very deliberately didnt learn how to type.
0562	CRUZ	She said, look, it was the 1950s.
0563	CRUZ	I understood the world I was living.
0564	CRUZ	She didnt want to be walking down the hall and have some man stop her and say, Sweetheart, would you type this for me?
0565	CRUZ	She wanted to be able to respond with a clean conscience and smile and say, I would love to help you out, but I dont know how to type.
0566	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE))
0567	CRUZ	I guess youre going to have to use me as a computer programmer instead.
0568	CRUZ	And, whether its my mom, who as a pioneer computer programmer  shes 81 now, shes been a best friend to me my whole life.
0569	CRUZ	Shes an amazing grandmother to our two little girls.
0570	CRUZ	Whether its my wife, Heidi, who is the daughter of Christian Missionaries, she lived in Africa as a kid several times.
0571	CRUZ	Shes someone who has been an incredible businesswoman.
0572	CRUZ	Shes strong.
0573	CRUZ	Listen, when youre married to a strong woman professional, you see the nonsense that women deal with in the business environment.
0574	CRUZ	You see the garbage they put up with.
0575	CRUZ	And, it makes you mad.
0576	CRUZ	Ive been blessed my whole life to be surrounded by strong women.
0577	CRUZ	I think women right now are particularly concerned about the direction of this country, are particularly concerned our kids are going to have, what kind of country were giving to the next generation.
0578	CRUZ	I think women quite rightly are very concerned about safety and security, and a president thats protecting us from terrorists.
0579	CRUZ	And, I believe what protects women  you know, the Democrats love to put everyone in a little pigeon hole, and so this is a womans issue, this is a Hispanic issue, this is an AfricanAmerican issue.
0580	CRUZ	Listen, I believe every issue is a womans issue, and the focus of my campaign is on three things.
0581	CRUZ	Its on jobs, freedom, and security.
0582	CRUZ	Bringing back the opportunity, raising wages, bringing jobs back to America, I think that is resonating powerfully with women, and fighting to protect the Bill of Rights, and equal opportunity for women and men, and everyone.
0583	CRUZ	And, Ill tell you theres no one I fight harder for than our two little girls, Caroline and Catherine who are the loves of my life, and who can do anything.
0584	CRUZ	And, I want to make sure they have a world they can live in where they have the opportunity to do anything.
0585	COOPER	Senator, thank you very much.
0586	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0587	COOPER	Im going to try and get time for two more questions.
0588	COOPER	I want you to meet Marv Simcakoski, hes from Stevens Point, he says at this point hes undecided.
0589	COOPER	Marv, welcome.
0590	QUESTION	Thank you both.
0591	QUESTION	My son, Jason, was a former Marine who was killed by overprescription of medication while he was an inpatient at the V.A.
0592	QUESTION	facility in Tomo, Wisconsin.
0593	QUESTION	Every day you see stories and news about people all over Wisconsin, people from rural areas, big cities, and small towns who are addicted to opioids and heroin.
0594	QUESTION	There is bipartisan legislation in front of congress right now named after my son which would, in part, require stronger opiate prescribing guidelines for V.A.
0595	QUESTION	providers.
0596	QUESTION	Will you support this bipartisan legislation, and do you support requiring stronger opiate prescribing guidelines, not only for the V.A., but for doctors across this country?
0597	CRUZ	Well, Marv, thank you for sharing your story, and thank you for your sons service and his sacrifice.
0598	CRUZ	Im sorry that you lost son, Jason.
0599	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0600	CRUZ	And this is a tragedy were seeing across the country.
0601	CRUZ	Were seeing veterans coming back struggling with PTSD.
0602	CRUZ	Struggling to get their health care needs treated, treated properly.
0603	CRUZ	Were seeing a V.A.
0604	CRUZ	that is dysfunctional.
0605	CRUZ	A V.A.
0606	CRUZ	that is lying.
0607	CRUZ	One of the things we need is we need real accountability in the V.A.
0608	CRUZ	I give you my word, if I am president, there will be accountability in the V.A.
0609	CRUZ	Those that have lied, those that have wrongfully denied care, they will be terminated.
0610	CRUZ	And if they broke the law, they will be prosecuted.
0611	CRUZ	We also need reform in the V.A.
0612	CRUZ	so that veterans have the power to choose their own doctors.
0613	CRUZ	Whether they want to choose the V.A.
0614	CRUZ	or a private doctor, theres no reason your son, Jason, couldnt have gone to the doctor down the street.
0615	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0616	CRUZ	Now, I agree with you, we need greater scrutiny, greater involvement preventing opioid abuse.
0617	CRUZ	You look at the prevalence of heroin  and I would note this is a tragedy.
0618	CRUZ	Roughly 50,000 people a year die of drug overdoses.
0619	CRUZ	More people in America die of drug overdoses than die in car crashes.
0620	CRUZ	And Marv, Im sorry to say, you and I are both members of a horrible club because I lost my sister, Miriam, to a drug overdose.
0621	CRUZ	And so Ive seen first hand  and it actually started  it started when she was in a car accident, and she got prescribed painkillers.
0622	CRUZ	And she kept on taking the painkillers, and then she started taking strong, and she started taking stronger.
0623	CRUZ	And Miriam led a difficult and troubled life.
0624	CRUZ	She made a lot of very poor decisions.
0625	CRUZ	And then just a few years ago, she took too many pills one night, and her son came in and found her dead.
0626	CRUZ	This is an epidemic that is destroying families across America.
0627	CRUZ	I am sorry for your familys loss.
0628	CRUZ	Im sorry.
0629	CRUZ	My nephew, Joey, her son, someone Im really proud of.
0630	CRUZ	Hes endured his moms difficult journey, and hes working a good job.
0631	CRUZ	Hes a responsible  hes a terrific young man.
0632	CRUZ	But we need a federal government that focuses on stopping this drug abuse, whether it is prescription drug abuse or whether it is illegal narcotics like heroin.
0633	CRUZ	And one of the most important ways to stop that  you know, unfortunately my sister, Miriam, ended up going down that path, going down the path of crack cocaine and drugs that destroyed her life.
0634	CRUZ	One of the ways to prevent that is we need to secure the border.
0635	CRUZ	We need to get serious about stopping the incredible flow from Mexican drug cartels that are poisoning our kids.
0636	CRUZ	And you have my commitment as president  Im not going to talk about it.
0637	CRUZ	Im not going to make empty promises.
0638	CRUZ	But we are going to devote the full resources of the federal government to finally, finally, finally secures the border, stopping illegal immigration, but stopping the deluge of drugs that is coming into this country and destroying the lives of people all across this country.
0639	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0640	COOPER	This is Tim Omer.
0641	COOPER	He says he is leaning in your favor.
0642	COOPER	Tim, welcome.
0643	CRUZ	Hey, Tim.
0644	TIM OMER, WISCONSIN VOTER	Welcome to Wisconsin, Senator.
0645	CRUZ	Thank you.
0646	OMER	As a growing company, our biggest challenge is finding talented and qualified people to fill all the positions that we have open in our company.
0647	OMER	As president of the United States, what could you do to help us find those talented people, find those quality people, build up the pool of people so that we can fill those positions and continue to grow our business?
0648	CRUZ	Tim, tell me what kind of company do you have?
0649	OMER	Were Wisconsin cheese.
0650	CRUZ	Wisconsin cheese, fabulous!
0651	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0652	CRUZ	I will confess something.
0653	CRUZ	And as my wife, Heidi, is my witness, my favorite food in all the world is cheese.
0654	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0655	CRUZ	And I am not says that to pander in Wisconsin.
0656	CRUZ	But if you wouldnt point it out here, where would you point it out?
0657	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0658	CRUZ	Listen, it is a huge problem we see of a need for a trained workforce and a need for a workforce thats prepared and wants to work.
0659	CRUZ	You know, as I meet with small business owners all across the country, I hear those concerns over and over and over again that its hard to get people who are qualified and who want to work and are prepared to work, and thats a real challenge.
0660	CRUZ	And, you know, the key to jobs and job creation is small businesses, is doing what you do.
0661	CRUZ	How many employees do you guys have?
0662	OMER	About 300.
0663	CRUZ	About 300.
0664	CRUZ	I mean, thats where job creation comes from.
0665	CRUZ	It comes from small businesses.
0666	CRUZ	Twothirds of all new jobs come from small businesses.
0667	CRUZ	Now, in terms of getting new and able workers, we need to do several things.
0668	CRUZ	Number one, we need to reform education.
0669	CRUZ	You know, the step to having welltrained workers is having a strong education program.
0670	CRUZ	And if you look at education right now, number one, I think the federal government needs to get the heck out of it.
0671	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0672	CRUZ	Its one of the reasons I promised on the very first day in office that Im going to direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day.
0673	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0674	CRUZ	And I think what we ought to be doing is abolishing the federal Department of Education and blockgranting that money to send it back to Wisconsin.
0675	CRUZ	I think the people of Wisconsin know much better what to do with that money.
0676	CRUZ	And part of that money, I think, should be directed at school choice programs, and allowing people who are trapped in failing schools to have the option of going to private schools, going to parochial schools, injecting competition in failing schools to empower parents and empower students.
0677	CRUZ	I think school choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st Century.
0678	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0679	CRUZ	And part of that money as well in Wisconsin ought to be directed to vocational training, ought to be directed to different nontraditional ways where people can earn skills, whether its distance learning, whether it is using the Internet, using options where your only option isnt spending $50,000 a year at a fouryear college but expanding the options for people to get education.
0680	CRUZ	I think that is a critical piece to improving the environment.
0681	CRUZ	And another critical piece is changing our welfare program.
0682	CRUZ	You know, our welfare program right now traps people in dependency.
0683	CRUZ	Now, my view on welfare is that the social safety net, it should be a trampoline and not a hammock.
0684	CRUZ	That the whole purpose of the social safety net should be to get you back on your feet.
0685	CRUZ	Everyone falls on hard times, but youre not helping someone trapping them in dependence.
0686	CRUZ	And Ill tell you, I visited with a fellow who owns a cookie factory.
0687	CRUZ	Tell you, between cookies and cheese, you really can have a great party right there.
0688	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0689	CRUZ	But he owns a cookie factory.
0690	CRUZ	And he talked to me about where in the 1990s when Congress passed welfare reform, when Congress put in place a strong work requirement for welfare, and you recall the liberals in the media were saying, youre going to throw people out on the street, people are going to be starving, its going to be terrible.
0691	CRUZ	Its one of the most successful public policy reforms weve ever seen.
0692	CRUZ	Millions of people left welfare and got jobs.
0693	CRUZ	This fellow who owns the cookie factory described to me how suddenly they had people lining up to work.
0694	CRUZ	Because they werent getting paid in perpetuity to stay at home and watch Gilligans Island. They had to go get a job.
0695	CRUZ	And you know what, if you help someone get a job, ultimately that is giving them the dignity of work.
0696	CRUZ	I believe every American wants to have that dignity to provide for their families.
0697	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0698	COOPER	Weve got to wrap it up.
0699	COOPER	I want to thank Senator Cruz very much for being with us.
0700	COOPER	Thank you, Senator.
0701	COOPER	When come back, Donald Trump, as our townhall continues here in downtown Milwaukee.
0702	COOPER	Senator, thank you.
0703	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
