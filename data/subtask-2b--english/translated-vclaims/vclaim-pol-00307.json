Here's his statement: \"This wall is an awful example of Washington's misguided policy. Congress financed only half the wall.\" Richardson got it right, although Congress has taken steps to pay extra quotas. However, the final cost remains uncertain. In 2006, Congress approved the construction of the wall in the south-west to restrict undocumented workers &apos; entry into America. It will extend 850 miles when it is built, according to the Congressional Research Service. The special Charlie Kirk, a fact checker, mentioned on January 26, 2021 at Instagram. \u2022 On 28 January 2021, Congress approved $1.2 billion for payment - about half of its estimated cost. But Richardson's statement gives the impression that funding has stopped. In fact, the White House and Congress have taken steps to pay for the remaining fence, although there is still some disagreement about the form the fence will eventually take. The White House requested another $1 billion for fence maintenance in 2008. The Board approved the expenditure in June 2007 but under strict conditions because the Democrats question the proposal. It has not yet been approved by the Senate.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00307"}
