John McCain, R-Ariz., opposes former President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to shorten Chelsea Manning\u2019s prison sentence \u007f\u2014 in part, he says, because her decision to release a large cache of government documents to WikiLeaks resulted in unnecessary deaths.\nIn 2013, a judge sentenced Manning, a private in the U.S. Army, to 35 years in prison, an unprecedentedly long sentence for a leak of government information, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In January 2017, Obama decided to commute her sentence. She will leave prison in May.\nIn a Jan. 18, 2017, interview, Fox News Host Bill O\u2019Reilly asked McCain for his reaction to Obama\u2019s decision.\nMcCain said he felt \"sorrow for the families of those individuals who identified in these leaks in Afghanistan that the Taliban went after and murdered. And rage because this president is basically endorsing a proposal that allows someone to go free who is responsible for the needless deaths of those people who are allies.\"\nO\u2019Reilly pushed back on McCain\u2019s assertion that individuals identified in the leaks were killed by the Taliban.\n\"I just wanted to know if it was specific leaks that came to you as a Senator which showed what WikiLeaks did with Manning's help killed people that were helping the U.S.A.,\" O\u2019Reilly said.\nMcCain replied: \"Let me be specific. The information I received when I was there was that the Taliban went after these people. I assume, killed them.\"\nThe interview left us still wondering if people were killed because their names appeared in the documents that Manning leaked, so we decided to put McCain\u2019s claim on the Truth-O-Meter.\nMcCain spokeswoman Julie Tarallo said the Taliban has a history of retaliating against people who cooperate with United States forces. She pointed to a 2010 interview by British television station Channel 4 with a Taliban spokesman, who said the group would \"punish\" Afghan nationals working for the United States named in the WikiLeaks logs.\n\"If they are U.S. spies, then we know how to punish them,\" said the spokesman,\u00a0Zabihullah Mujahid.\nBut we could find no evidence the Taliban acted on these threats. We scoured court documents, congressional hearing transcripts and media reports, and we found that the government has not named a single individual who was killed because he or she was named in the leaked files.\u00a0\nNot in public record\nIn 2010, Manning \u2014 then known as Bradley Manning \u2014 was an Army analyst in Iraq. She downloaded about 700,000 government files and gave many of them to WikiLeaks, who made the files public. The records included diplomatic cables, reports about the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and notably a video of a 2007 American helicopter attack in Baghdad that killed civilians.\nThe government was concerned that the Taliban or other adversaries might retaliate against foreign nationals named in the documents because the individuals cooperated with the United States. However, officials have never pointed to an example of someone actually getting killed because of the leaks.\nThe closest call came in August 2013, during the sentencing phase of Manning\u2019s trial, when the government tried to make the case that Manning\u2019s leaks caused harm. Robert Carr, a retired U.S. Army brigadier general who led an investigation into the leak, testified that he knew of \"one individual that was killed\" by the Taliban as a result of the leaks.\nHowever, Carr conceded that the person killed hadn\u2019t actually been named in the documents Manning gave to WikiLeaks. As a result, the judge decided to strike that testimony from the record. Here\u2019s the relevant exchange (from an unofficial transcript provided by the Freedom of the Press Foundation):\nCarr: \"As a result of the Afghan logs, I only know of one individual that was killed. The individual was an Afghan national. The Afghan national had a relationship with the United States government and the Taliban came out publicly and said that they killed him as a result of him being associated with the information in these logs.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefense attorney Major Thomas Hurley: \"Ma'am, we may object again as to relevance. General Carr is going to going to talk about how this person wasn't listed in the WikiLeaks \u00a0disclosures. This individual's name wasn't listed among those names, among the hundreds of names he talked about.\"\nJudge Denise Lind: \"Is this, what you're testifying \u00a0to, tied to the information in the disclosures in any way?\"\nCarr: \"The Taliban killed him and tied him to the disclosures. We went back and searched for this individual's name in all of the disclosures. The name was not there. It was a terrorist act on behalf of the Taliban threatening all of the others out there. But the name of the individual that was killed was not in the disclosures.\"\nSo the Taliban said they killed an individual because of the WikiLeaks logs, but the logs didn\u2019t actually mention this individual. Carr said that he only knew of that example.\nIn his closing argument at Manning\u2019s sentencing trial, lead attorney for the government Ashden Fein only said the leaks put hundreds of people \"at risk of injury, incarceration or death as a result of the release of their names.\" He didn\u2019t argue that anyone actually died.\nWe should note that part of Manning\u2019s trial took place in a closed hearing in order to discuss classified information. So it\u2019s possible that deaths caused directly by Manning\u2019s leaks could have happened, and we can\u2019t know unless that information was declassified.\nDavid Coombs, Manning\u2019s lawyer, attended the classified hearings. He told us that the government didn\u2019t present any evidence that showed individuals were killed as a direct result of the leaks.\n\"That information was never brought out because it doesn\u2019t exist,\" Coombs said, calling McCain\u2019s claim \"completely false.\"\nFein, the lead attorney for the government on the case,\u00a0declined to talk to us on the record.\nIf not deaths, what damage did Manning\u2019s leaks do to national security? The government has repeatedly said the main impact is a \"chilling effect\" \u2014 meaning foreign officials and citizens are less likely to speak and cooperate with American soldiers and diplomats.\nBut Obama administration officials have indicated the leaks didn\u2019t actually cause a lot of harm.\n\"I\u2019ve heard the impact of these releases on our foreign policy described as a meltdown, as a game-changer, and so on. I think those descriptions are fairly significantly overwrought,\" said former Defense Secretary Robert Gates in 2010, adding later, \"Is this embarrassing? Yes. Is it awkward? Yes. Consequences for U.S. foreign policy? I think fairly modest.\u2019\u2019\nIn a December 2010 interview on NBC, former Vice President Joe Biden said about WikiLeaks, \"I don't think there's any substantive damage, no. Look, some of the cables that are coming out here and around the world are embarrassing.\"\nOur ruling\nMcCain said, \"The Taliban went after and murdered\" people identified in the Chelsea Manning leaks.\nIn the several years since WikiLeaks released hundreds of thousands of government documents leaked by Manning, the government has not publicly identified a single example of the Taliban killing someone because that person was named in the leaks. If someone had died as a result, it seems logical that the incident would have become public knowledge, either through Manning's trial or in media reports.\nAt Manning\u2019s sentencing trial, one Army witness said he knew the Taliban killed one person and blamed it on the WikiLeaks revelations. However, that person\u2019s name doesn\u2019t appear in the files, and the military has provided no additional information.\nWe rate McCain\u2019s claim Mostly False.\nUpdate: This article has been updated to include more information from McCain's staff.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e3caaae4-5952-41f1-bb7e-3cde8f9a3f29", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03731"}
