But first, we should explain a couple of basic concepts.\n\n\nPolicymakers focus on the NDD spending because it's the part of the budget that the president and Congress can most easily control. The mandatory programs are just that \u2014 mandatory. They include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, programs that go up automatically based on how many people are eligible.\n\n\nDefense costs are often excluded because they are subject to outside forces such as whether the United States is at war. So that leaves NDD as everything else the government spends money on \u2014 education, agriculture, transportation, social programs, NASA, and a host of other things.\n\n\nPolicymakers often measure government spending against the gross domestic product, the total output of the U.S. economy, to show the relative share of government spending in the overall economy.\n\n\nSo now let's examine Obama's claim. First, we should note that although it was clear Obama was talking about the long-term impact of his budget, he didn't specify a time frame. A listener might not know if he was talking about the first five years or the last five, or some other period.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat allowed him to do some cherry-picking, to rely on the one number that supports his point when others do not. Indeed, he achieves that historic spending level only once in his 10-year-projection \u2014 in 2019, the final year, according to numbers from his Office of Management and Budget.\n\n\n(We should note that, unless the constitutional term limit is changed before then, even if he wins a second term, Obama will be out of office in January 2017, two years before we can see if his budget projections came true.)\n\n\nAlso, it's important to note that these are\n\nWhite House\n\nestimates. Administration officials say they are based on realistic policy decisions for future years, but the numbers have been criticized for being too optimistic.\n\n\nBrian Riedl, a budget analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said Obama is using unrealistic numbers to make his spending appear lower.\n\n\n\"This is a complete gimmick,\" Riedl said, adding that \"President Bush played the same game.\"\n\n\nIndeed, this is a standard ploy for presidents to promise to meet goals in later years when the circumstances are beyond their control.\n\n\nPresidents assume very low growth in government spending for the long-term to make their budgets look more lean. But when those years come, they usually propose much higher spending, Riedl said.\n\n\nAt the news conference, Obama acknowledged that his analysis was relying on GDP projections that are more optimistic than the ones from the Congressional Budget Office, a well-respected nonpartisan group. But he said his numbers were in line with other prominent economists.\n\n\nSo where does this leave us? Obama's claim is that \"we are reducing nondefense discretionary spending to its lowest level since the '60s.\"\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough his statement suggests broad success, he achieves the historic level only in the last year. Yes, it would be lower than the other presidents, but it would beat the lowest number only in 2019 \u2014 a year when Obama will be out of office. And he relies on economic assumptions that are slightly more optimistic than the ones from the well-respected CBO. So we find Obama's claim to be Barely True.\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15792"}
