While the headline is fake, because it describes all of the suspects as Muslims from Michigan without evidence, a key element of the story is based on real events: The federal government did charge 412 people nationwide in a health care bust in July.\nFresh Media News calls itself a website that provides \"daily updates of the hidden things.\" We found no disclaimer or contact information on the website and sent a message via Facebook and did not get a reply. Similar articles ran on other websites in July.\nThe article portrays Michigan Muslims as rampant criminals.\n\"The state of Michigan is clearly turning into a Sharia swamp, thanks to the reckless immigration policies of Obama over the last 8 years,\" stated the article.\nFresh Media News claims that federal officials made a bust in a $1.3 billion fraudulent scheme involving Medicare fraud, ripping off insurance companies and prescribing opioids.\nSome of the basic details are muddled -- the headline says the 412 suspects were from Michigan while part of the article says officials arrested 412 people nationwide.\nHere is what actually happened: On July 13, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the \"largest health care fraud takedown operation in American history.\"\nFederal authorities charged 412 defendants across about two dozen states, including doctors, nurses and other licensed medical professionals, for their alleged participation in health care fraud schemes involving approximately $1.3 billion in false billings. Thirty-two of the defendants were from the Eastern District of Michigan.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFresh Media News cited some accurate details in the case, including that the FBI raided medical offices in Detroit\u2019s historic Fisher building and named one of the actual Michigan defendants: Mashiyat Rashid.\nProsecutors allege that Rashid ran a conspiracy starting in 2008 that involved six other defendants and various companies in which they recruited homeless people as patients and sent phony bills to Medicare, according to The Detroit News.\nThe Detroit News described Rashid as a \"Muslim businessman, who moved to the United States from Bangladesh and is a U.S. citizen.\"\nWhile Fresh Media News wrote without evidence that the 412 suspects were Muslims, nothing in the federal documents we reviewed, including Sessions\u2019 remarks, mentioned the religion of the defendant. We contacted Sessions\u2019 press office and did not get a reply.\nIt\u2019s not surprising that a fake news story would target Muslims in Michigan.\nThe Muslim population has been growing in Michigan for decades and is now about 2.75 percent of the state\u2019s population as of 2015, according to a report by Muslims for American Progress, a project by the Institute for Policy Studies and Social Understanding that aims to educate the public about Muslims. (A Pew study estimates that Muslims comprise about 1 percent of the U.S.)\nMichigan Muslims comprise more than 15 percent of the state\u2019s medical doctors and more than 10 percent of the state\u2019s pharmacists.\nOur ruling\nFresh Media News wrote in a headline \" \u2018The largest bust in U.S. history\u2019 412 Muslims arrested in Michigan!\"\nThe federal government announced the bust of 412 people in a health care fraud scheme in July, but the suspects were from across the nation.
