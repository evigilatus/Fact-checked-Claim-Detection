According to the sidebar accompanying the broadcast, President Donald Trump won Michigan, capturing 50% of the vote to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s 44%.\u00a0\nThe results looked authentic, leading commenters on the YouTube video to claim the election had been rigged because votes were being tallied a week before Election Day, on Nov. 3.\nBut while the sidebar was real, the election results it showed were not. The sidebar, as the contestants on \"The Bachelor\" like to say, wasn\u2019t there for the right reasons.\nIn an apology statement posted to its website the following day, the TV station said the results displayed were \"randomly generated\" as part of a test of its systems ahead of Election Day.\n\"During the Bachelorette, WXYZ inadvertently aired an election result graphic as part of our testing of the systems we will use during election night coverage,\" the station said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on February 5, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNewly discovered video shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Clara Hendrickson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The results displayed \u2013 the presidential race, the Senate race and a number of congressional races to name a few, were part of a test and NOT actual results. In Michigan, no ballots are counted before election day.\"\nThe mishap was covered by the Detroit Free Press and the New York Times. The broadcast\u2019s mock results also showed Republican Senate candidate John James beating Sen. Gary Peters, a Democrat, and Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens fending off their GOP challengers.\nIn reality, those candidates will have to wait until Nov. 3 for the results to start rolling in.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA YouTube video said a broadcast of ABC\u2019s \"The Bachelorette\" showed the 2020 election results a week early.\nWXYZ, a Detroit-area ABC affiliate, did show what appeared to be Election Day results in a sidebar accompanying its broadcast of the reality TV show. That generated some confusion.\nBut the results shown were not real election results; they were randomly generated as part of a test of the affiliate\u2019s system. Michigan\u2019s ballots will be counted on Election Day. WXYZ made that clear in a statement posted Oct. 28, after the Oct. 27 YouTube video was uploaded.\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18818"}
