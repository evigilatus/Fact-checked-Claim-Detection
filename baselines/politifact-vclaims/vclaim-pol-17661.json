It has more than 2,000 shares.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nWe\u2019ve seen plenty of hoaxes that falsely conflate the 2019 coronavirus with other strains of the illness. And this post is no different.\nThere are seven kinds of coronaviruses that can infect humans. They were first identified in the mid-1960s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and some of the viruses are quite common.\nThe latest coronavirus, categorized as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is the strain that is spreading from Wuhan, China. More than 6,000 people have been infected worldwide, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s Jan. 29 situation report. There is no evidence that it was \"developed\" prior to the outbreak.\nSo while some Clorox labels mention \"human coronavirus,\" that is because it has been proven effective against past strains of coronavirus, which is to say it can be used on surfaces to stem the spread of the virus (it should never be ingested!). In a blog post published Jan. 24, Clorox said that several of its products are effective at killing coronaviruses \"similar to\" the 2019 strain.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The products listed below have demonstrated effectiveness against viruses similar to 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on hard, nonporous surfaces,\" the post reads. \"Therefore, per the EPA Emerging Pathogen Policy, these products can be used against 2019-nCoV when used as directed.\"\nUsually, per Environmental Protection Agency regulations, companies aren\u2019t allowed to make claims about the efficacy of disinfectants against pathogens unless regulators have reviewed them. But the coronavirus outbreak has triggered emergency guidance from the EPA.\nRELATED:\u00a0Fact-checking hoaxes and conspiracies about the coronavirus\nThat guidance sets forth two criteria. First, a manufacturer\u2019s disinfectant must be registered with the EPA for use on \"hard, porous or non-porous surfaces.\" Second, the disinfectant\u2019s label must make previously approved claims about its efficacy against one of three \"viral pathogen groupings.\"\u00a0\nClorox said three of its products meet those criteria, including disinfecting wipes, disinfecting bleach and \"Clean-Up Cleaner + Bleach.\"\nIn related news: Clorox shares rose several percentage points following the outbreak of the coronavirus. The company has historically performed well on the stock market during epidemics.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims a \"Clorox bottle claimed it could kill (the 2019 coronavirus)... before it was developed.\"\nIt\u2019s true that some Clorox products have labels that claim they\u2019re effective against human coronaviruses. But that\u2019s because they were proven effective against past strains of coronavirus \u2014\u00a0not the one currently spreading from China. There is no evidence that the 2019 coronavirus was \"developed\" prior to the outbreak.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17661"}
