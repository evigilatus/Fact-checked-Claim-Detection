Organizational matters", "truth_label": "false", "date": "stated on October 18, 2018 in an ad:", "title": "Karen Husley's defiling Tina Smith's money to claim profits from large pharmacies.", "text": "In a recent Republican Declaration of Minnesota for the U.S. Senate, a man and a woman mixing champagne pipes on the beach. Smith is defending her seat in the U.S. Senate on November 6th. She was appointed to this post earlier this year after her democratic colleague Al Franken stepped down following allegations of sexual misconduct. The announcement of \"good life\" comes from Smith's Republican Challenger, State X. The text leaves the screen quickly from the cleanness of the beach scene. The following line: \"Tina has benefited from the opium crisis.\" The ad lists other suspicious ways Smith is supposed to enjoy it, but this has attracted our attention. We decided to see whether the claim that Smith had financially benefited from the opiate crisis contained any water. As evidence of Smith's benefit from the opium crisis, the Husley campaign sent us financial disclosure forms, referring to Smith's shares and her joint husband at Abbott Labs valued at between $250,000 and $500,000. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for security, telling her that \"we're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, Smith's company invested in St. Jude's Medical Company, a medical equipment company, purchased by Abbott's laboratories in 2017. After the purchase, St. Jude's medical stock was changed to Abbott's stock. In 1996, Abbott was involved in the aggressive marketing of Oxycontin with Bordo Varma - the company responsible for the introduction of Oxycontin as supposedly safe opium pills. In the first year of Oxycontin's life in the market, Abbott earned $49 million. This annual figure jumped to $1.6 billion by 2002. However, Abbott severed links with opiates in 2002, almost 15 years before she obtained the company in which Smith had a shareholder. The Husley campaign also indicated that Archie Smith, Tina's husband, had held between $1,000 and $15,000 in stock in Johnson and Johnson, which had been prosecuted for his role in the opioid crisis. Johnson and Johnson are also the parent of two companies that have been sued for the marketing of opiates. In Smith &apos; s most recent financial report, income from that stock ranged from $200 to $1,000. The Governor, Hosley, claimed that Smith had benefited from the opium crisis. The idea that the Smiths benefited financially from the actions of Abbott Labs 14 years ago from the company's acquisition of St. Jude's medical company goes too far. Smith's husband holds between $1,000 and $15,000 in shares in Johnson and Johnson, but it is difficult to draw a straight line from this amount from stock ownership to \"profit from the opioid crisis.\" Overall, the statement is not accurate. We value this allegation wrong.
