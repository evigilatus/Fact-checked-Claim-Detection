Ron DeSantis challenged Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam\u2019s credibility on illegal immigration.\nDeSantis cast Putnam as not being conservative enough on immigration in a\u00a0chat May 2 with radio host John Fredericks, a supporter of President Donald Trump. Trump said DeSantis, a frequent guest on Fox News, would make a \"GREAT\" governor back in December. \u00a0\n\"Well, we are very different in our approach to illegal immigration,\" DeSantis said of Putnam. \"When he was in the Congress, he supported the McCain amnesty, he even supported the gang of eight Schumer-Obama amnesty when he was ag commissioner. He didn\u2019t even have to vote on it but he supported it. He opposed bringing troops, putting troops on our southern border using the National Guard.\"\nWhether Putnam supported \"amnesty\" is a complicated question. We previously rated that attack as Half True, because he has supported some initiatives that would benefit undocumented immigrants (including the 2013 \"Gang of Eight\" legislation) and others that wouldn\u2019t have.\nFor this fact-check, we wanted to know if Putnam opposed \"putting troops on the southern border using the National Guard.\"\nWe learned that Putnam did take a similar vote in 2004, but experts said the underlying policy \u2014 putting troops on the border \u2014 was not a major policy consideration in the early 2000s. More importantly, though, the talking point doesn\u2019t account for Putnam\u2019s general support of Trump\u2019s immigration policy.\nPutnam\u2019s 2004 vote\nPutnam served in the U.S. House for 10 years before he started two terms as agriculture commissioner in 2011.\nDeSantis\u2019s claim is rooted in Putnam\u2019s 2004 vote against an amendment to the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act.\nThe amendment authorized the defense secretary to assign members of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps to assist the Department of Homeland Security with border patrol duties, in some circumstances.\nThe amendment, sponsored by Rep. Virgil Goode, R-Va., did not say anything about the National Guard, as DeSantis said.\nThe amendment ended up passing with a vote of 231-191. Putnam and 19 other Republican lawmakers voted against it (Putnam being the only Republican from Florida to vote no).\nNews coverage of this amendment was miminal. Still, some lawmakers went on the record to say the amendment would have stretched military personnel too thin.\n\"Border security is and continues to be a top priority for me and for the Congress as a whole,\" then-Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., said at the time. \"But the Goode amendment would militarize our border and stretch the resources of our Army.\"\nIn the early 2000s, deploying the military to help control the southern border was not discussed as a major immigration enforcement strategy by either party, said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaurice Ferre\n\n\nstated on July 1, 2010 in an editorial meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaurice Ferre says Kendrick Meek \"has voted 98.6 percent of the time with the Democrat party.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Trenton Daniel \u2022 July 21, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea has surfaced from time to time, but it has never been a key component of any administration's strategy,\" he said.\nPutnam\u2019s support for similar measures\nWe asked Putnam spokeswoman Amanda Bevis why Putnam voted against the amendment. Instead, she reiterated Putnam\u2019s support for the White House\u2019s policy on immigration, which as of April includes sending National Guard troops to the southern border.\n\"Adam Putnam supports President Trump\u2019s actions to secure our borders, including activating troops for this critical purpose,\" she said. \"Without strong border security to prevent illegal aliens from unlawfully entering our country, the lives of American citizens are endangered.\"\nThis is the same quote Bevis gave Florida Politics earlier this year when reporters asked Putnam about his 2004 vote.\nWe could not find any recent instances of Putnam speaking directly in support of sending the National Guard to the border. On his campaign website video about immigration, Putnam speaks broadly of supporting Trump\u2019s policies.\n\"As governor we will work with President Trump to cut funding for sanctuary cities, we will support tighter border security and vetting for refugees from Muslim countries,\" he said in a video posted May 2017.\nWe also found several votes Putnam took in favor of border security measures and funding enforcement.\nFor example, he voted in favor of a border security bill in 2005 that would have required improving surveillance technology, training more agents, and upgrading border infrastructure.\nHe was one of multiple cosponsors of the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and voted for the legislation. The law signed by President George W. Bush authorized about 700 miles of fencing between the border of the United States and Mexico.\nPutnam also voted for legislation in 2004 that appropriated $34.2 billion for Homeland Security, including funds to increase the number of border agents.\nOur ruling\nDeSantis said Putnam \"opposed bringing troops, putting troops on our southern border using the National Guard.\"\nContext is key. In 2004, Putnam did vote against an amendment that authorized the secretary of defense to assign members of the military under certain circumstances to assist the Department of Homeland Security in securing the border.\u00a0\nWhat the claim leaves out is Putnam\u2019s overall support for Trump\u2019s immigration policy. While Putnam has not commented on Trump\u2019s specific plan to send National Guard to the border, he is generally enthusiastic about Trump\u2019s\u00a0approach to immigration.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that as a member of Congress, Putnam took several votes in favor of border security measures and funding enforcement.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-05-07 20:50:18 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Says Adam Putnam \"opposed bringing troops, putting troops on our southern border using the National Guard.\"    Ron DeSantis U.S. Representative https://soundcloud.com/user-618665518/desantis-hits-putnam-on-immigration-e-verify-and-record-as-a-career-politician   in an interview Wednesday, May 2, 2018 2018-05-02    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02099"}
