So what? Well, our RSP (retirement savings program) contributions are based on after-tax profits. The tax rate we pay is not 17 percent, as Warren Buffett would have you believe; with state taxes it is roughly\n45 percent.\"\n\nHe continued by stating:\n\n\"President Obama has announced that our planned tax rate would increase to roughly 65 percent, reducing our after tax income by 36 percent and dramatically reducing, if not eliminating, your and my RSP contributions.\"\n\nObama, of course, was re-elected.\n\nDoes that mean state and federal income tax rates are on their way up to a promised combined 65 percent for some taxpayers?\n\nBackground\n\nRite-Hite, which employs some 1,400 people in North and South America, Asia and Europe, specializes in the manufacture and sale of loading dock and industrial door safety products. White, the company\u2019s chairman as well as owner, is active civically, serving on the boards of Milwaukee\u2019s Summerfest, which is billed as the world\u2019s largest music festival; the Village of River Hills, an upscale Milwaukee suburb; and the foundation of Concordia University Wisconsin. He\u2019s also a contributor to Republican candidates.\n\nWe\u2019re leaving aside the question of whether White\u2019s email amounted to voter intimidation, which the local district attorney\u2019s office is still reviewing. White said in the e-mail that neither he nor his company \"will ever prejudice any employee for their political views.\" There are also lingering questions about the company\u2019s plans in the wake of Obama\u2019s re-election.\n\nNeither White nor his company's attorney responded to our requests for information about the claim of tax rates rising to 65 percent. But we can break it down.\n\nWhite\u2019s e-mail said RiteHite is an \"S corporation\" and that \"our corporate tax rate is the highest personal tax rate.\"\n\nShareholders of an S corporation report the business\u2019 income on their personal tax returns and are assessed tax at their individual income tax rates, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The highest individual tax rate is 35 percent, which is for people with an income above $388,350. So, White\u2019s claim focuses on these high-income taxpayers.\n\nIncreasing rates\n\nObama has proposed eliminating what are known as the Bush-era tax cuts, enacted under President George W. Bush, for individuals earning more than $200,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000. That would raise the top federal rate to 39.6 percent.\n\nAs for Wisconsin, its highest income tax rate is 7.75 percent. It is not slated to increase; in fact, Gov. Scott Walker has pledged to cut income taxes, perhaps in his 2013-15 budget.\n\nAdd the top state rate of 7.75 percent to the highest federal rate proposed by Obama, 39.6 percent, and you get just over 47 percent -- slightly more than the 45 percent White said Rite-Hite is paying.\n\nTo further analyze White\u2019s claim, we contacted several experts, including Milwaukee tax attorney John Vitek; Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance research director Dale Knapp; and Jack Norman, director of Tax Fairness WI, a joint project of two left-leaning Wisconsin organizations.\n\nEach said the new combined state-federal rate that Rite-Hite will pay as a result of Obama's re-election could exceed 50 percent:\n\n39.6 percent -- new top federal rate proposed by Obama\n7.75 percent -- top Wisconsin rate (unchanged)\n3.8 percent -- tax hike, starting in 2013, as part of \"Obamacare\" (the hike is on capital gains, dividend and interest income of high-income earners)\n2.35 percent -- Medicare tax (includes an increase of 0.9 percent under Obamacare)\n53.5 percent -- total combined rate\n\nSo, that\u2019s a significant increase. But it\u2019s also well short of 65 percent.\n\nTwo final notes:\n\nVitek, the tax lawyer, said Rite-Hite doesn\u2019t actually pay the taxes to the government; rather, it pays dividends to its shareholders to cover the taxes they are assessed as shareholders of Rite-Hite.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorman, the tax fairness group director (who wrote an analysis of White's e-mail), notes that tax rates are progressive -- you pay lower rates on the first portions of your income and higher rates on the higher portions.\n\nFor example, the federal tax rate is 10 percent on income up to $17,400; the rate is 15 percent on income between $17,400 and $70,700; and so on. Norman's point is that high-earners like White pay the highest rate, currently 35 percent, only on the portion of income above $388,340.\n\nOur rating\n\nThe owner of Milwaukee-based manufacturer Rite-Hite said that with Obama's re-election, the combined state and federal tax rate paid by his company would rise to about 65 percent.\n\nExperts say the rate might exceed 50 percent, but they see no way of it reaching 65 percent.\n\nWe don't have the benefit of White's math to consider, but barring any other evidence, we rate his claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10000"}
