When I heard that Mike DeWine wanted to allow insurance companies to refuse to pay for pre-existing conditions it made me sick to my stomach.\"\nDeWine later countered with his own TV ad in which his daughter says DeWine\u00a0\"supports health care coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\"\nWe wanted to fact-check Cordray\u2019s ad to see if DeWine wanted to allow insurance companies to refuse to pay for pre-existing conditions.\nDeWine isn't the only\u00a0Republican\u00a0to oppose Obamacare while stating support for the popular protection for pre-existing conditions.\u00a0\nLooking over Dewine\u2019s entire record, we find that he was a strong opponent of the Affordable Care Act for years, but now is staking out a more moderate position.\nDeWine\u2019s actions related to the ACA\nDeWine\u2019s campaign said that he has shown support for pre-existing coverage stretching back to the 1990s when he campaigned for and then won a seat in the U.S. Senate. In 1994, DeWine wrote on a survey by the Ohio Nurses Association that \"pre-existing conditions must no longer be a bar to insurance.\"\nFor example, in 1996 he voted along with the entire Senate in favor of a health insurance accountability bill that placed limits on pre-existing condition exclusions, among other things.\nBut as attorney general, DeWine has fought against the federal health care law. On his first day in office in 2011, DeWine joined a multistate lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeWine called the health care law a \"huge federal overreach\" because it mandated individuals to purchase insurance or face a penalty. He didn\u2019t mention pre-existing conditions, but the law guarantees coverage for people who have them.\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate in 2012, DeWine said he was disappointed in the outcome.\nAs attorney general, the first references we could find of DeWine defending pre-existing condition coverage were from this year.\nFor example, DeWine said during a September gubernatorial debate, \"I\u2019ve always been for coverage of people pre-existing illnesses.\"\nMore recently, DeWine has not joined either side of a multistate lawsuit filed in a Texas federal court in February by Republican attorney generals and governors. That lawsuit argues that the law is no longer constitutional because Congress gutted the individual mandate as part of the 2017 tax overhaul.\nDeWine didn\u2019t join the lawsuit because he believes it's up to Congress to decide whether to repeal Obamacare via that route, his office spokesman Dan Tierney told PolitiFact.\nDeWine argues that it\u2019s possible to oppose the law and the mandate, while keeping pre-existing condition coverage. But that\u2019s not what the federal government has said. The Justice Department\u00a0said in a legal brief that the individual mandate is inseparable from protections for people with pre-existing conditions. That\u2019s because if there were no mandate, people would wait until they were sick to purchase health insurance.\nOur ruling\nCordray\u2019s ad said, \"Mike DeWine wanted to allow insurance companies to refuse to pay for pre-existing conditions.\"\nDeWine was a strong opponent of the Affordable Care Act, joining a lawsuit to fight against it in 2011. DeWine argues his opposition was over the individual mandate, but if the lawsuit had prevailed it, would have struck down a law that guaranteed coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. This year, while being attacked over his health care record, DeWine said he has favored coverage for pre-existing conditions and pointed\u00a0to his record decades earlier in the U.S. Senate.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6b70c91e-e281-43d5-9879-77e0a13d2e7c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01528"}
