The tax base is unfrozen when the district ends, allowing public service providers to begin collecting taxes on the new, higher property values.\nUrban renewal has become a hot-button issue. Critics, including some in Clackamas County, say it gives government unchecked power to spend money without sufficient oversight and that it amounts to a giveaway to developers.\nClackamas County Commissioner Paul Savas, who is running for re-election, was targeted in a recent flier from the Tigard-based Freedom and Responsibility PAC. The flier, among other things, said Savas helped table a motion under which \"Residents could have received nearly $48M for Local Schools, Fire District, Sheriff\u2019s Dept. and Social Services.\"\nThe flier noted that the money would have come from the Clackamas Town Center Urban Renewal District, which formed in 1980 and ended in June with money left over. With local service providers seemingly straining for every cent these days, we decided to check whether Savas actually voted to deny them $48 million in unspent urban renewal money.\nAccording to the flier, here\u2019s where most of that money would have gone if not for Savas\u2019 vote: $20 million to the North Clackamas School District; $8 million to Clackamas Fire District #1; $8 million to the Sheriff\u2019s Office; and $8 million to Clackamas County\u2019s general fund.\nThe remaining $4 million, according to county documents, would go to the other 13 overlapping taxing entities that operated within the urban renewal district.\nWe called Savas, who was part of a 3-2 majority that voted to table a motion to return the $48 million in unspent urban renewal district money. It made sense, he said, to use the unspent money on needed but not yet approved projects in the district.\nShortly after tabling the motion, the board, by the same 3-2 split, authorized two road projects inside the district totaling $9.2 million. A discussion is set for early next year on what to do with the remaining $38.8 million.\nSavas took issue with two of the flier\u2019s key points: that the money could have been returned to \"residents\" and that $48 million was eligible for return.\nHe cited an email from Clackamas County Assessor Bob Vroman noting that Oregon law prohibits returning unspent urban renewal money directly to citizens. Instead, it has to go back to the individual service providers. State officials confirmed that prohibition.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoxanne Ross\n\n\nstated on May 15, 2011 in an online posting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultnomah County\u2019s food action plan \"clearly plans to disrupt the free market system in terms of food choices making it harder and more expensive for many residents to eat their food of choice.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Janie Har \u2022 June 24, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo residents would not have gotten a kicker-style check. On the other hand, taxpayers are residents, and they would have seen a benefit had agencies they support received millions of dollars.\nOn the other point, Savas said his vote actually saved Clackamas County residents nearly $20 million. Why? Because the $20 million claimed on the flier as destined for the North Clackamas School District actually would have gone to the State School Fund.\nSavas forwarded an email from Michael Wiltfong, the Oregon Department of Education\u2019s school finance director, who estimated that the North Clackamas District would have gotten only $600,000 of that $20 million. Information compiled by the county put the figure closer to $330,000.\nAs for the flier\u2019s other claims:\n$8 million for \"Fire\": Information compiled by Dan Johnson, the county Development Agency\u2019s manager, sets the figure at $6.95 million.\n$8 million for \"Sheriff\": Johnson\u2019s number is $4 million, but there\u2019s a big caveat. The money would go only to the Clackamas County Enhanced Law Enforcement District, which provides services only for unincorporated Clackamas County and the cities of Happy Valley and Johnson City.\n$8 million for \"Clackamas County\": This refers to the county\u2019s general fund. Johnson\u2019s number is $7.8 million -- the same if rounded up.\nWe called Richard Burke, treasurer for the Freedom and Responsibility PAC, for a response.\n\"I recognize that only a portion of this money would go to local schools,\" said Burke, a self-professed Libertarian who lives in Beaverton. \"But I stand behind my point that there\u2019s a pot of money that could have gone back to taxing districts if not for Paul\u2019s vote.\"\nIn a followup email, Burke defended his $8 million figure for the sheriff, citing Sheriff Craig Roberts\u2019 comments during budget hearings this year that his office was likely to get a good chunk of the $7.8 million headed to the general fund -- if commissioners had voted to return the money. But even if the money had gone to the fund, a sheriff\u2019s office spokesman said, it would have been a \"commissioners\u2019 decision on how to spend it.\"\nThe flier lists four figures. One -- the amount that would have gone to the general fund -- was accurate, and another -- the amount for fire services -- wasn\u2019t far off. The figure given for the sheriff\u2019s office was inaccurate and oversimplified, though, and the figure for schools was wrong in amount and recipient.\nOn the other point, residents would have seen a benefit from the return of the money, but it wouldn\u2019t have been given directly to them.\nWe rate the claim Mostly False because it contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08542"}
