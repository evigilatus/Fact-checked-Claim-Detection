It also struck us as an exaggeration. We wanted to know: What\u2019s the evidence for their claim that Republicans doctored the evidence?\n\nTale of the talking points\n\nThe emails in question trace the back-and-forth between the CIA, FBI, State Department and White House that resulted in controversial talking points used to explain the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi.\n\nThose talking points were used most infamously by Susan Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, on Sunday talk shows several days after the attacks. (In the resulting Republican uproar, she gave up her bid to be the next secretary of state.)\n\nEarly drafts of the CIA talking points made references to terrorist groups, saying \"we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qaida participated in the attack.\" But in 12 rounds of edits of the talking points, that reference disappeared.\n\nInstead, Rice told CBS\u2019 Face the Nation on Sept. 16, 2012:\n\n\"I think it's clear that there were extremist elements that joined in and escalated the violence. Whether they were al-Qaida affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al-Qaida itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine.\"\n\nRepublicans argued this was evidence the White House interfered, attempting to downplay a terrorist attack before the election.\n\nThe White House said the gap between early and late versions of the talking points could be chalked up entirely to the best assessment of the \"intelligence community\" \u2014 in other words, political concerns of the State Department or White House had nothing to do with it.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney went so far as to claim in November that the \"single adjustment\" by the White House and State Department was to change the word \"consulate\" to \"diplomatic facility.\"\n\nRepublican Sens. John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte wanted to see the evidence.\n\nIn January, they asked: Why had the administration refused to provide the full text of emails that would explain the deletion of references to al-Qaida and terrorism?\n\nLawmakers got a peek at the messages.\n\nBut the email exchange otherwise generally stayed under wraps \u2014 until some details appeared in an April 2013 report from House Republicans, then in May articles from the Weekly Standard, ABC News and others.\n\nThey made Carney\u2019s comments look entirely misleading: It turned out a State Department spokeswoman had raised \"serious concerns\" about the CIA talking points, and the White House had to play mediator \u2014 a bigger role for either of them than he had suggested.\n\nShortly after the news reports, which relied on leaks of messages that weren\u2019t yet public, the White House released 100 pages of back-and-forth between officials.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd something else interesting emerged.\n\nWhile a State Department spokeswoman had weighed in on the CIA talking points, contrary to Carney\u2019s suggestion, the early news reports that relied on leaks had inaccurately characterized a message from the White House. ABC News, for example, used a direct quote from a White House adviser that differed from the actual email text.\n\nThe difference mattered: In the early reports, it looked like the White House was piping up in support of the State Department, which better served Republicans\u2019 arguments that the White House was involved in a political coverup. The actual email looked like an even-handed attempt to resolve issues between the agencies.\n\nIn news reports, the message from Ben Rhodes, then a deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, included a direct mention of the State Department.\n\n\"We must make sure that the talking points reflect all agency equities, including those of the State Department, and we don\u2019t want to undermine the FBI investigation,\" ABC News reported he had written, according to CNN.\n\nBut Rhodes\u2019 email had actually said to the group, \"We need to resolve this in a way that respects all of the relevant equities, particularly the investigation.\"\n\nHe didn\u2019t, in fact, single out the State Department.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 explanation: Republicans doctored the emails!\n\nBut explanations from ABC News and the author of the Weekly Standard piece, Stephen Hayes, tell a somewhat different story.\n\nHayes explained to the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker that someone provided him with \"summaries\" of email messages \u2014 not altered versions of emails.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t speak to anyone who represented the email summaries as direct quotes,\" Hayes told the Post.\n\nABC News added an editor\u2019s note to its story that it \"should have been more precise in its sourcing of those quotes, attributing them to handwritten copies of the emails taken by a congressional source. We regret that error.\" Reporter Jonathan Karl said in an update that his source took notes on a long chain of emails that included references to the State Department, so the notes reflected that.\n\n\"Summaries\" and \"handwritten copies of emails\" are a bit different from \"doctored\" emails \u2014 wording that creates the impression of electronic fakery.\n\nMeanwhile, one detailed account of the email leak, from TPMDC, says that whomever shared the notes was \"presumably a Republican.\"\n\nIn other words, the leaker hasn\u2019t been named.\n\nWoodhouse didn\u2019t share evidence with us \u2014 or claim to know \u2014 exactly who leaked details from the emails. Nor could he prove that the source deliberately altered his or her notes to create a false impression, then lied to reporters.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Democratic National Committee claimed to its supporters that \"Republicans actually doctored emails between administration officials about Benghazi. Then, they released them to the press, trying to pass them off as real.\"\n\nBut when we asked, Democrats didn\u2019t provide evidence that discrepancies resulted from anything more than sloppy note-taking, or that journalists had been snookered into believing they had seen the original messages.\n\nABC News, in fact, took responsibility for imprecision in its story. Hayes of the Weekly Standard says no one tried to misrepresent summaries that were leaked to him as actual emails.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible the leaker\u2019s inaccurate notes were intended to deceive. But Democrats have failed to prove that\u2019s the case. Their claim about doctoring evidence could use some evidence. We rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09259"}
