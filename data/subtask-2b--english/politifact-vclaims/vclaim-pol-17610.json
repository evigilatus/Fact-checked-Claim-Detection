Would you really want a president who was dumb enough to let himself get drafted? I meant, it wasn\u2019t hard to get out of it, believe me. My doctor said I had a bump on my heel, or something. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even think he was a doctor, frankly. The government is just very, very stupid, OK? Which is why only I can fix it.\u2019 - Donald J. Trump Meet the Press, Aug. 28th, 2015.\"\nAdditional text along the bottom of the post says: \"Yes, he really said this. Remember it next time he claims to \u2018love the troops.\u2019 If you support Trump, you don\u2019t support the American military.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

News column that ran Aug. 4, 2016, and was written by national political columnist Matt Bai. The story\u2019s headline: \"Is there anything Trump could say to make his party cut and run?\" The article also says the statement comes from \"Meet the Press, Aug. 28,\" but a year is not listed.\nWhile the article doesn\u2019t include a satire or parody disclaimer, it contains a subhead that says the piece\u2019s content was published by \"Yahoo University Press in 2022\" and lists several other outlandish quotes from Republican politicians that don\u2019t appear to be real. Bai also confirmed to PolitiFact that the piece was intended to be satire and that the quote is not real.\nThere is no evidence that Trump actually said this and the only iteration we could find was in a satirical column.
