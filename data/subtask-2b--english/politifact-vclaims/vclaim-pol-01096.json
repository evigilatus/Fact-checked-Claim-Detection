Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who said it\u2019s morally wrong that billionaires can coexist alongside people living in extreme poverty. Ocasio-Cortez has discussed a 70 percent marginal tax rate on income that exceeds $10 million a year.\nBartiromo called this view \"quite naive,\" saying high earners already pay their fair share. Besides, they would have less incentive to work hard if a larger portion of their income went to fund the government, she argued.\n\"What is it going to do to the economy if you make it so economically difficult for the highest earners?\" Bartiromo said on Fox News, via satellite from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"According to the Tax Foundation, the top 10 percent of earners already pay almost 80 percent of all taxes. So you already have the highest earners paying their fair share.\"\nWe\u2019ll leave it to others to debate whether taxes on the wealthy should stay flat or go up. Here, we wanted to know if the numbers Bartiromo cited reflect the proportion of taxes paid by the rich. Turns out, they\u2019re pretty far off.\nTax burden by income group\nBartiromo did not reply to our request for comment. But a post on Fox News\u2019 website about her response to Ocasio-Cortez cited the pro-business Tax Foundation.\nWe reached out to the Tax Foundation, which pointed us to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0that\u00a0summarized the latest federal income and tax data from the\u00a0Congressional Budget Office's\u00a0\"Distribution of Household Income, 2015,\"\u00a0including individual and corporate income tax, payroll and excise taxes. The numbers were not as high as what Bartiromo said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following chart shows the share of the aforementioned federal taxes paid by America\u2019s top earners.
