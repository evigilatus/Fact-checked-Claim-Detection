In the cities run by Democrats, Sin Rand Paul, R-Ky. \"I think we should look at where income inequality seems worse,\" said Paul during the presidential debate of the Fourth Republic, hosted by the Fox Business Network in November 10. \"It seems worse in cities run by Democrats.\" We verified a similar claim made by Paul last year and found it half correct. Let's reconsider what we've discovered. We used the 2014 study by the Brookings Institution, which classified the top 10 cities and the lowest 10 cities according to income inequality. The Brookings Institution completed the report in March 2015 and there were changes in the ranking (based on 2013 data). We will follow the updated list. Looks like there's something to what Paul said. Of the 10 most unequal cities in the study, nine have democratic mayors. They are Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, Washington, New York, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis. Only one, Miami, has a Republican mayor. In contrast, five of the 10 most equal cities have presidents of the municipalities of the Republic of Albuquerque; Oklahoma City; Mesa, Ares.; Colorado Springs, Kolo; and Virginia Beach, Va. The other five have either a non-partisan mayor (Rale, N.S., Las Vegas, Arlington, Texas) or a Democrat (Colombos and Nashville). So on the numbers, Paul has a point. The question is, does this truth mean anything? The experts we talked to urged to take the claim with a grain of salt -- if not a full handshake. Here are some reasons. Mayors are not strong players in the local economy. In cases where such claims are filed, Polyte Fruit attempts to prove whether credit or blame is due. In this case, is it reasonable to attribute patterns of inequality exclusively, or even mainly, to the mayor? Not -- many factors play in the city's economic success. The Mayor of Detroit does not have much power over the international car market, and no mayor from New York can take all the credit for the economic adventure on Wall Street. While mayors &apos; policies may have an impact on margins, factors such as the State cycle, national business, broad demographic patterns and international business trends tend to have a far greater impact on economic inequality in cities. In addition, it should be noted that \"cities attract people on the basis of many factors, whose political leaders' party is likely to be small,\" as William Free, a senior colleague in the Brookings Urban Policy Programme, said. The patterns of urban inequality may be at least as much as the size of the population and geographical patterns as the party leadership. Focusing on party differences obscures the most fundamental difference between the most and least unequal cities. More unequal cities tend to be very large, and smaller cities tend to be smaller. The average population of the 10 most unequal cities on the Brookings list is over 700,000, compared with 430,000 for the more equal cities. (If the average is used instead, the average population of the 10 most unequal cities will be higher - 1.9 million versus 500,000). So it's not exactly apples to apples if you compare the characteristics of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago on the one hand with that of Colorado Springs, Virginia Beach and Arlington on the other. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, and all other things are equal, the larger cities tend to distribute income to the maximum extent, as their population is larger. By definition, this means almost greater proportions between the top and the bottom. In the meantime, big cities tend to attract more rich people -- people who can choose to live anywhere they want -- because big cities are closer to having world-class facilities. \"Real wealth tends to be in large cities, so it has high peaks as well as bottom, while income profiles in small areas are usually \"more compressed,\" said Jimmy Beck, Professor of Geography at the University of British Columbia, who studied urban and political patterns in the United States. The chief economist and deputy chief of analysis at the Trollia real estate site said Jed Kolko. In old cities, many middle-income people have moved to the suburbs, leaving higher levels of inequality behind. In contrast, more modern cities - such as Mesa (which is located near Phoenix) or Arlington (which is located near Dallas) - often contain many suburbs or, in fact, the suburbs themselves, as Kolko said. These cities tend to have a more modest income range. Why does all this matter? It underestimates the idea that party leadership has a major bearing on why some cities are relatively unequal and others relatively equal. The reason may actually go in the opposite direction. It is always important to remember that this association does not necessarily mean causality. In this context, it is not necessary for the republican leadership to create greater equality, as Paul's commentary assumes. It can even be greater equality that drives people to vote for the Republicans. Or it could be unconnected. \"I think it's going more in the direction that inequality provides the conditions for democratic success, rather than the Democrats who cause inequality,\" said Michael McDonald, a political scientist from the University of Florida specializing in electoral and geographical patterns. Any interpretation other than political leadership that causes greater equality weakens Paul &apos; s point of view. The pattern remains only if you look at cities, not urban areas. If you look at Kolko &apos; s research -- which studied inequality in wider urban areas, rather than cities per se -- Paul &apos; s pattern is collapsing. As of 2014, out of the 10 most equal urban areas, only one has a mayor - Colorado Springs. The other nine have either a democratic mayor, a non-partisan mayor or no mayor at all because they are not integrated. This list includes Lekland-Winter Haven, Fla; Allentown, Ba.; Salt Lake City; Bethesda-Rockville-Fredrick, Meade, Tacoma, Wash.; Las Vegas; Cape Coral Fort Myers, Fla.; Rally; Palm Bay-Milborn-Tetusville, Fla. \"What he was saying is that Democrats don't solve the problem,\" said Darling. \"It may be a problem that cannot be solved. The Democrats like to talk about this issue and have been allowed to put themselves as combatants for those affected by income inequality, yet they are not part of the business\" on this issue. This is a reasonable point, but we believe that the ordinary listener who hears Paul's comment assumed that he was arguing that republican policies have promoted greater equality in cities than democratic policies. As we have found, this is far from clear. The Governor Paul said that income inequality \"seems worse in cities run by Democrats.\" It has a point that one credible study shows a fairly strong relationship between the lack of inequality and a republican mayor. But experts say it's hard to draw conclusions from that. This allegation exaggerates the de facto authorities of mayors in the formation of inequalities in their cities and ignores the role of population size and suburbanism in promoting inequality. It also obscures the fact that urban areas, unlike cities, show no such relationship. The claim is partially accurate but leaves important details, so we evaluate it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05750"}
