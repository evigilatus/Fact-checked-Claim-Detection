John McCain has a long reputation as an opponent of pork-barrel spending, those billions of dollars for local projects earmarked quietly every year into massive federal spending bills.\n\n\nIn the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, 2008,\u00a0McCain said Sen. Barack Obama, in his relatively brief senatorial career, has asked for $932-million in pork for his home state of Illinois. Just to be sure everyone heard it, McCain cited the number\u00a0three times.\n\n\n\n\n\"He has asked for $932-million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly\u00a0$1-million dollars for every day that he\u2019s been in the United States Senate,\" McCain said.\n\n\nIn response, Obama noted, correctly, that he has eschewed any pork spending for fiscal 2009.\n\n\nSaid Obama: \"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.\"\n\n\nMcCain shot back that Obama did not suspend his requests for pork-barrel projects until after he was running for president, and then reminded viewers of that number again.\n\n\n\"He didn\u2019t happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932-million in requests,\" McCain said.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in case you missed it the first two times, McCain cited the number yet again a few minutes later.\n\n\n\"And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932-million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.\"\n\n\nWe should note that PolitiFact has\n\nfound\n\nthat while McCain has a well-deserved reputation in Washington as a pork-buster, his record is not entirely pristine. For example, McCain in 2006 co-sponsored legislation that asked for $10-million for an academic center at the University of Arizona to honor the late\u00a0United\u00a0States\u00a0chief justice William Rehnquist.\n\n\nBut as for his claim in the debate: Is it accurate?\n\n\nObama, on his Web site, has listed every earmark he\u2019s requested \u2013 but not necessarily received \u2013 as a U.S. senator. It totals $931.3-million.\n\n\nMcCain is also correct that it comes to nearly a million dollars for every day that Obama\u2019s been in the United States Senate, provided you include just working days.\n\n\nThe math goes like this: Obama was elected in 2004 and took office January 3, 2005. Since then, there have been about 930 working days, as they are defined by most people, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, which would mean McCain would be completely right if he had specified working days.\n\n\nTechnically, Obama's been \"in Congress\" for more than 1,350 days, if you count weekends. So how many points do you take off for McCain not saying \"every\n\nworking\n\nday\"? Not many. We say this claim is Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15960"}
