On July 26, she tweeted a link to a Vox.com article, adding:\nPaul Ryan on June 24th: \"Wages are rising.\"\n\nReality: \"Between the first and second quarters of 2018 \u2014 after the tax cuts were enacted \u2014 real wages fell by 1.8 percent.\"\nPaul Ryan on June 24th: \"Wages are rising.\"Reality: \"Between the first and second quarters of 2018 \u2014 after the tax cuts were enacted \u2014 real wages fell by 1.8 percent.\" \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/ltygIwhFGv\u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@TeamPelosi) July 26, 2018\n\n\nOthers who tweeted the same talking point included the Democratic Governors Association and the Fight for 15 coalition, which pushes for a higher minimum wage.\nThe talking point about plummeting wages is at best outdated, given the release of new information. In addition, the data cited is not one of several official measurements, and it appears to be a statistical outlier.\nWhere the number comes from\nThe statistic reached its widest audience after Vox published an article citing it July 23. The finding was previously noted in a Bloomberg column July 18 and, even earlier, in a CBS News article July 11.\nThe first thing to know is that the wage data in question did not come from longstanding government statistical series. Rather, it came from the PayScale Index, a calculation made by a private group. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s a problematic source, but it does mean that it needs to be weighed against the wage statistics compiled by the federal government, which are considered the gold standard.\nWhen the 1.8 percent decline first hit the media, official statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were not available for that same quarter \u2014 the second quarter of 2018. However, by the time Democrats and their allies began tweeting about the PayScale data, the second-quarter BLS data had become publicly available.\nWhen we looked at a standard BLS measurement for wages \u2014 median usual weekly inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers \u2014 we found that this measurement actually rose slightly between the first and second quarter of 2018, from $350 a week to $351 a week.\nThat's an increase of less than three tenths of 1 percent, rather than down by 1.8 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat other measures show\nGary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, suggested three additional BLS statistics to consult: average hourly earnings for all private employees; hourly earnings for manufacturing; and the employment cost index for private industry workers.\nBurtless adjusted each of these statistics for inflation and created an index showing how much each of the four wage measures had increased since the end of 2007. (In his system, the final data point of 2007 is pegged at 100, with any subsequent number above 100 showing how much it rose compared to the 2007 reference point.)\nHere\u2019s his final graph.\n\nKey: Blue = average real hourly earnings of all private employers; red = hourly earnings for manufacturing; green = median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers; purple = employment cost index: wages and salaries for private industry.\nGenerally speaking, the four BLS statistics have moved in tandem, showing wage increases above inflation since 2014, with a bit of a slowdown since 2016. At worst, wages are going sideways or moving slightly higher in the most recent quarter \u2014 not suddenly crashing, as the PayScale data indicated.\n\"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence I would trust that inflation-adjusted wages have declined noticeably, either over the entire Trump administration or in the period since Congress passed the new tax law,\" Burtless said.\nDean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, concurred.\n\"It\u2019s certainly fair to say real wages are not rising rapidly, and depending on the index chosen and the exact time period, they could even be falling slightly, but there is no plausible story where they fell 1.8 percent between the first and second quarter,\" Baker said.\nA spokesman for Pelosi said the tweet -- which was written by staff, not Pelosi -- \"quotes word for word\" from the Vox article and attached the link \"for full context and openness.\"\nPayScale, for its part, acknowledges that comparing the PayScale Index to other BLS statistics \"is comparing apples to pears.\" In a blog post, the company\u2019s chief economist and vice president of data analytics, Katie Bardaro, wrote that the PayScale Index is designed to capture how workers\u2019 wages change as they switch companies, while a BLS measure like the Employment Cost Index does not.\nShe concluded, \"Be careful of spurious comparisons of distinct measures and be sure to understand the underlying methodology of any metric you bring into your data arsenal.\"\nOur ruling\nPelosi tweeted, \"Between the first and second quarters of 2018 \u2014 after the tax cuts were enacted \u2014 real wages fell by 1.8 percent.\"\nThere's a grain of truth, in that one unofficial measurement did produce that finding. But it is an outlier. Official statistics contradicted that, showing stable or modestly rising wages. Those were available before the recent social media traffic.
