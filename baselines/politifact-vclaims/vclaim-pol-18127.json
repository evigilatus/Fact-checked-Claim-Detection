And looking at other countries that have been hit hard by the virus, including China and Italy, it\u2019s not an idle question.\nOn March 12, a reader sent us a comment from a website called Stop Mandatory Vaccination, run by a group that opposes bills to curb exemptions for vaccinations. (Here\u2019s some background on the anti-vaccine movement.)\nThe website said in part, \"The CDC can detain anyone with a fever \u2014 indefinitely. \u2026 Vaccination (is) a way people could get out of detention.\"\nSimilar comments on social media soon prompted high-level debunkings.\nLate on March 15, the National Security Council took to Twitter to knock down rumors about a national quarantine: \"Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID19. #coronavirus.\"\nText message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID19. #coronavirus\u2014 NSC (@WHNSC) March 16, 2020 \nQuarantines are real, but there\u2019s a lot of misinformation floating around about the details. Here, we\u2019ll attempt to clarify what\u2019s accurate, and what\u2019s not, about quarantines. (An inquiry to Stop Mandatory Vaccination was not returned.)\nWhat\u2019s the definition of a quarantine?\nThere are two related terms that address this phenomenon: quarantine and isolation. \"Isolation\" separates people with a confirmed case of a communicable disease from people who are not sick. \"Quarantine\" separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.\nThe last federal quarantine prior to the coronavirus outbreak came in the early 1960s, when officials were concerned about a smallpox outbreak. It\u2019s been a century \u2014 back to the 1918-19 \"Spanish flu\" pandemic \u2014 since large-scale isolations and quarantines were last enforced.\nFederal quarantine power stems from Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take measures to prevent the entry and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries and between states.\u00a0\nFederal regulations revised in 2017 allow the CDC \"to detain, medically examine, and release persons arriving into the United States and traveling between states who are suspected of carrying\" certain communicable diseases. (Here\u2019s what a sample quarantine order looks like.) Those powers are carried out with help from other federal agencies, such as Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard.\nThis federal government has exercised this power recently with travelers returning from locations where coronavirus has been spreading, based on presidential proclamations like this one.\nDistinguishing between federal, local, and state roles\nSo far we\u2019ve been referring to federal quarantines. But most quarantine power actually resides with state and local governments, as well as tribal law on tribal lands.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s because federal quarantine powers are limited to persons entering the United States from elsewhere. By contrast, states and localities enforce those powers within their own borders\n\"CDC officials are \u2018preparing as if (the new coronavirus) is the next pandemic,\u2019 but in reality, the laboring oar falls to state and local health departments,\" Polly J. Price, a professor of law and global health at Emory University, has written in the Atlantic.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the assertion we\u2019re checking in this article, by focusing on CDC, misses a lot of where the action is: state and local governments.\nWhat redress does someone have if they\u2019re ordered into quarantine?\nHistorically, forcible quarantines have been rare, and they require a court order. Most of the time, experts said, people who are infected are released on their own recognizance with a promise to self-quarantine.\nThere\u2019s judicial precedent for quarantine powers dating back to the early 1800s, but subsequent case law has required a degree of due process, especially given that a quarantine, unlike an arrest, involves the detention of someone who is not suspected of a crime.\nPast cases \"suggest that there are important limits on the ability of the U.S. and state and local governments when it comes to some types of public health action,\" said David Schultz, a professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University. The government has to show real harm, as well as that people get due process and a chance to appeal.\u00a0\nBecoming subject to forcible quarantines isn\u2019t just a question of having a particular germ; it also requires a strong likelihood that you will spread it to other people. \"Since most people can take precautions, this typically only happens in the case of person who can\u2019t stay away from other people,\" such as people who have a severe mental illness, said Wendy K. Mariner, a professor of health law at the Boston University School of Public Health.\nWhat if you refuse a mandatory order? Practical consequences for such an action are tricky. While fines and incarceration are allowed, no public health expert today recommends jailing a person unwilling to quarantine, because they would be introducing a contagion into a confined population.\n\"The likelier answer is hospitals with secure wards,\" Mariner said.\nCan a government detain anyone with a fever?\nNot any fever gets you quarantined, contrary to the assertion we\u2019re checking.\nThe government \"would have to have good evidence that the individual was exposed to COVID-19\" to impose a quarantine, said Lawrence O. Gostin, faculty director of Georgetown University's O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law.\n\"\u2018Fever\u2019 is too broad a definition,\" Mariner agreed.\nIn addition to coronavirus, the CDC is able to quarantine only for the following diseases: cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fever, SARS and pandemic flu.\nIs quarantine \"indefinite\" detention by the government?\nIt\u2019s an exaggeration to say quarantine is \"indefinite\" detention by the government, especially given what we know so far about the course of coronavirus disease.\nFirst, as we noted, quarantine is usually self-regulated. And for those instances when it\u2019s not, such as when an individual is uncooperative, the person is able to leave quarantine when they are no longer contagious.\nDoes getting a vaccination enable you to get out of quarantine?\nVaccination doesn\u2019t get you out of quarantine. Typically, vaccinations aren\u2019t cures; they\u2019re preventive measures. In any case, it\u2019s moot for coronavirus, because there is no vaccine yet.\nOur ruling\nClaims on the internet said \"the CDC can detain anyone with a fever \u2014 indefinitely. \u2026 Vaccination (is) a way people could get out of detention.\"\nThe CDC does have the power to isolate people with certain infectious diseases and quarantine those who had contact with an infected person. But this claim is wrong or misleading about many of the details.\nMost quarantine decisions will be up to states and localities, rather than the CDC. People can\u2019t be quarantined for just having a fever; they have to be shown to have been exposed to a specific set of diseases. Most quarantines are done voluntarily, not by force of the state. And vaccination is not a ticket out of quarantine. We rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18127"}
