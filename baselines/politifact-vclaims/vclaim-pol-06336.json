Jeb Bush told a crowd at an Orlando event that he was dedicated to conservative principles like reducing the size of government. \u00a0\n\"We reduced the government workforce by 13,000, 11 percent, during my eight years,\" he said on June 2, 2015, at Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s Economic Growth Summit at Walt Disney World. He also touted high job-creation numbers during his term.\nBush is expected to officially announce his candidacy on June 15. Meanwhile, we wondered whether his claim about shrinking the state government workforce passed muster.\nWorking through the cuts\nBush served two terms between 1999 and the start of 2007, and proposed cutting 25 percent of state employees early in his term. He didn\u2019t cut that many, but he did oversee a reduction in state workers. His Right to Rise PAC sent us state payroll numbers from Bush\u2019s tenure that backed the claim.\nA Bush spokesman said the data came from the Legislature\u2019s General Appropriations Act (i.e., the approved state budget) each year, minus workers for the State University System and temporary employees for which the governor\u2019s office isn\u2019t responsible. These are legitimate numbers, but can be hard to parse. To find them in the annual budget, which usually clocks in at more than 400 pages, you\u2019d have to add them up from the positions listed for each state agency.\nYou can sift through each budget if you\u2019d like, but we decided to look at it a slightly different way to make it a little simpler for you to gauge, using the state\u2019s Department of Management Services Annual Workforce Report.\u00a0That\u2019s a general snapshot of state personnel, how much they make and what jobs they do. Part of that count is the State Personnel System, which includes about two-thirds of state employees in more than 30 different agencies and departments. It also excludes university and temporary jobs, and a few others.\nThe numbers aren\u2019t exactly the same as what Bush\u2019s PAC provided, but the State Personnel System shows who is employed by state agencies at any given time.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nGeneral Appropriations Act\n\n\nState Personnel System employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1998-99\n\n\n127,363\n\n\n124,838\n\n\n\n\n1999-2000\n\n\n126,723\n\n\n124,160\n\n\n\n\n2000-01\n\n\n125,007\n\n\n123,505\n\n\n\n\n2001-02\n\n\n120,091\n\n\n120,581\n\n\n\n\n2002-03\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.

That shows that departments like Children and Families, Health, and Corrections all lost plenty of positions under Bush, who focused on privatizing state services.\nThat privatization of government work has been controversial. For example, contractors working for the Department of Children and Families have been criticized for cost overruns and running an ineffective, or even dangerous, privatized foster care program. Similar problems have been debated for contracts with payroll services and privately run prisons, among others.\nFlorida International University public administration professors Howard Frank and David Guo said that instead of focusing on how many state jobs were eliminated, it\u2019s better to consider whether the moves really saved the state money. The Department of Management Services doesn\u2019t dissect the differences between jobs that were cut and the contracts that replaced them. That makes it difficult to untangle exactly how much the state may have saved by privatizing, automating or consolidating government positions.\nThe state now has the lowest number of government workers per capita in the United States. But Bush\u2019s workforce cuts between 1999 and 2007 came as the state\u2019s population ballooned by about 3.5 million and the budget jumped from $48.6 billion to $73.9 billion.\nOur ruling\nBush said, \"We reduced the government workforce by 13,000, 11 percent, during my eight years.\"\nHe was referring to a specific count of workers in state agencies cut between 1999 and 2007, and in context we can consider his numbers pretty accurate. Experts told us it\u2019s important to keep in mind that privatizing state jobs or cutting positions doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily cheaper or better for taxpayers. The statement, however, is accurate, and we rate it True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06336"}
