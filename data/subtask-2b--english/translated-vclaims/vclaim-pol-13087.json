The purpose of the Romney speech was to distinguish between the Massachusetts health-care plan approved when it was the Governor and the national health-care law signed in 2010. In a separate item, we analysed whether Romney was justified in describing national law as \"the takeover of the government.\" Here, we will look at a comment made by Ingraham on public opinion in the State about the Massachusetts Plan. \"Look, I love dead Romney,\" said Ingerham. \"I think he's a really smart guy, and I think he's gonna be a good boss. In this, I don't understand, Bill. I mean, the costs have gone up. She's very unloved.\" We wondered whether the Massachusetts system was in fact \"unpopular\" with the population of the Gulf State. We have found two subtractions that shed light on this issue to one degree or another. One such study was conducted in early April 2011 by the University of Suffolk, which has 500 residents of Massachusetts. In response to the question, \"Do you think that health care in Massachusetts works?\" The poll found that 38% said yes, 49% said no, and 13% didn't decide. This appears to provide some support for Ingraham &apos; s claim. However, the question has been formulated more broadly than Engerham's claim because it refers to \"health care in Machusitis,\" which may include factors far beyond the State's health plan, such as their personal experiences with doctors, hospitals and specific pharmacists they use. Even if the results were a direct comment on the support of the Massachusetts system, 38 per cent for and 49 per cent against the Massachusetts system did not indicate that the State Health Care Act was \"unlovable\" as Ingerham said. It's unpopular, maybe, but it's not necessarily \"bold\" so. One of the most appropriate criteria for measuring the Plan &apos; s popularity is a survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health with the Boston Globe in mid-September 2009. The following are two questions that directly address Ingraham &apos; s claim. Both were asked from 467 respondents who told the poll that they were aware of the law: given what you know about it, in general, do you support or oppose the Comprehensive Health Insurance Act in Massachusetts? Support: 59 per cent opposition: 28 per cent unknown: 13 per cent do you think the Massachusetts Health Insurance Reform Act should be repealed, continue as it is, or continue with some of the changes that have been made? In response to the question: 11% continued as at present: 22% continued but with some changes: 57% did not know: 10% question I found that residents supported the law by more than two to one margin. The second showed that residents were not fully satisfied with all the provisions of the law, but that support for total abolition was low - only 11 per cent. One of the main warnings of the Harvard survey is that it was taken a year and a half ago, and the feeling has probably changed since then. (Law support has been reduced by about 10 points compared to the 2008 Harvard survey. However, despite their age, Harvard data directly address Ingerham &apos; s claim and indicate that she was mistaken. Robert Blindon, a researcher at Harvard University who helped to conduct the ballot, said: \"The statement that the plan is \"not popular at all\" is unfounded given the available polling data.\" With regard to the new referendum, David Paliologos, who conducted the survey in question, said that the question was valuable, recognizing that it was more focused. He said: \"It's a picture of how people now feel about health care in Massachusetts,\" he said. \"I think that's all we can get from the question. Unless the questions are identical in the wording, much of the comparison is left open to one &apos; s opinion.\" On the basis of expert advice, we decided not to consider a recent client satisfaction survey commissioned by the State agency that runs the State Health Insurance Exchange established by law. This study found that 84 per cent of CSP participants assessed them on a five-point satisfaction scale, while only 4 per cent said that they were not satisfied. Some news reports misstated that this was a survey of all Massachusetts residents, but it wasn't, so we don't think it's a valid criterion for evaluating Ingerham's comment. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, we should note that an estimated 400,000 Massachusetts residents - or only about 6 per cent of the population living in the state - received health coverage as a direct result of the law, according to the Blue Shield Blue Cross Foundation in Massachusetts. This has enabled 98.1 per cent of Massachusetts residents to provide insurance - the highest rate in any state. But this also means that the influence of the law was indirect to more than 9 out of 10 Massachusetts residents. The population needs to include a certificate of insurance when they submit their taxes. More importantly, but less clearly, they may find their insurance costs or taxes higher because of the way in which the law has restructured the insurance market. There is evidence that the increase in the number of insured residents in the State has put pressure on primary care doctors, which may lead to longer waiting for service. However, a political analyst in Massachusetts, a politician at the University of Tafts, Jeffrey Perry, said that he had not revealed a wave of legal opposition among the population. Perry said, \"Voices, like voters everywhere, are not satisfied with the high cost of health care.\" \"They see that in insurance premiums -- every salary and every year, prices rise. The reform of the uninsured during the Romney administration itself is largely invisible. People know it's there, but they don't know how it works (or, unless they're on it, they don't know how it works). There is very little press coverage of the program. In Massachusetts there is simply no disagreement about the plan at this stage. More often than not, there is no real organized opposition to it and no effort in the State Council to reconsider it.\" Perry concludes that Ingerham's claim is \"unlovable\" is \"very exaggerated.\" There are additional statements from the Harvard poll that support Perry's sense that he is actually indifferent - not opposition - to the views of the Massachusetts Plan. The explorers asked, \"In general, do you think this health insurance law helps, hurts, or does not significantly affect the quality of your health care, the cost of your health care, and your ability to pay medical bills if you want to get sick.\" \u2022 On quality, 23 per cent said that the law \"helps,\" 14 per cent said \"harms,\" and 55 per cent said that it \"has no significant effect.\" \u2022 With regard to cost, 19 per cent said it helped, 24 per cent said it hurts, and 47 per cent said it did not have much effect. \u2022 With regard to the ability of people to pay their medical bills, 24 per cent said they were helping them, 14 per cent said they were hurting, and 53 per cent said they made no big difference. In other words, for each of these three issues, a majority or plurality of respondents said that the law had not had a significant impact. So where does this leave us? Harvard statements contradict Ingraham &apos; s argument, showing reasonable support for the law in general as well as the feeling that he does not do much for them personally. The Suffolk survey is more recent, but the question is too broad to speak directly of Ingraham's claim. We found no further support for Ingerham's claim. Therefore, we value Angarham &apos; s statement that it is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13087"}
