He is now the eighth-wealthiest American, with a net worth of $54 billion, according to Forbes.\nBloomberg succeeded Rudy Giuliani as mayor in 2002 and served until 2013. He was succeeded by the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, who briefly ran for the Democratic presidential nomination before dropping out in September.\nIn 2013, near the end of his tenure, Bloomberg claimed that New York was the nation\u2019s safest big city. Our rating, looking at violent crimes plus property crimes, was Mostly True.\u00a0\nNow let\u2019s dig into each of the four parts of his current claim.\n\u2018Reduced murders by 50%\u2019\nBloomberg\u2019s campaign cited data showing there were 649 murders in 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office, and 335 in 2013, his final year in office. That\u2019s a reduction of roughly half.\nBut murders started declining a decade before Bloomberg took office and continued downward after he left.\u00a0\nMurders dropped \"precipitously\" during the 1990s \u2014 from roughly 2,200 at the start of the decade, noted Ames Grawert of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphic from the New York City Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice\n\u00a0\n\"Was the slope any steeper during Bloomberg than in the preceding decade? Not at all,\" said Jeffrey Fagan, a professor of law and a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University.\n\u2018Reduced police shootings to historic lows\u2019\nIn 2013, the total number of shots fired by officers \u2014 248 \u2014 and total shooting incidents \u2014 81 \u2014 were the lowest since the New York Police Department began keeping such records in 1971, according to the department\u2019s 2013 annual firearms discharge report, which Bloomberg\u2019s campaign cited. Police shot and killed eight people and injured 17 others that year, the report says.\nBut here, too, Bloomberg appears to be going too far by taking credit: The trend downward started before Bloomberg took office. And while shooting incidents hit the record low of 81 in 2013, they had risen to 105 a year earlier, during his tenure.\n\"The fact that reductions have continued under de Blasio shows that the declines are being driven by factors other than the municipal genius of mayoral-led policing and prosecutorial strategies,\" said Eugene O\u2019Donnell, a lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.\u00a0\n\u2018Reduced number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%\u2019\nIn 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office, New York City had 703 jailed or imprisoned inmates for every 100,000 residents, according to the mayor\u2019s Office of Criminal Justice. In 2013, it was 429\u00a0 \u2014 a drop of 39%.\nThe same chart shows, however, that the decline began years before Bloomberg took office and has continued for years afterward, the figure was 910 in 1996 before dropping to the 703 in 2001, a decline of 23% in five years. And there\u2019s another issue.\n\"The criminal prosecution/punishment decisions are not those of the mayor or his administration,\" said Franklin Zimring, a University of California, Berkeley, School of Law faculty director of criminal justice studies and author of the 2012 book, \"The City That Became Safe: New York\u2019s Lessons for Urban Crime and Its Control.\"\n\u2018No other city in America did what we did\u2019\nBloomberg\u2019s campaign says no other city has achieved the three reductions Bloomberg touted. There is truth to that.\n\"New York City is in a class by itself in the country on public safety \u2014 serious crime has dropped for decades,\" O\u2019Donnell told us.\nBut comparisons are dicey.\nThe FBI is one of the strongest voices warning that city-to-city comparisons are invalid. Among other things, the FBI points out that no two cities are alike and the rates at which crimes are reported vary among cities.\nOur ruling\nBloomberg said, \"No other city in America did what we did. We reduced murders by 50%, reduced police shootings to historic lows, reduced the number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%.\"\nHe\u2019s generally on target, as each of the three statistical claims are backed by the numbers. But Bloomberg can\u2019t claim all the credit, in that the declines began before he took office and continued afterward; and experts including the FBI warn against using statistics to make city-to-city comparisons.\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16643"}
