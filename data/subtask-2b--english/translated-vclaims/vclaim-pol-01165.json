He was the second immigrant child to die in the custody of the United States within a month. Some supporters of President Donald Trump retract criticism and point to the deaths of migrant children that are supposed to have occurred under the Obama administration. One of the memes, who shared over 12,000 times on Facebook, claims that \"18 children died while guarding the border patrol\" during Obama's administration. \"Where's the media rage then? \"Oh, ask. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There was no evidence to suggest that 18 children died in United States custody at the border during Obama &apos; s presidency. Following the boy's death on Christmas Eve, Internal Security Minister Kirsten Nelson issued a statement, in which he said that \"a dramatic increase\" in illegal border activity had pushed the immigration regime \"to a breaking point.\" As Nelson stated in this statement, it has been more than 10 years since a child died in the custody of U.S. border security. \"To put this in perspective, there were six deaths of migrants in detention at the Customs and Border Protection Office during the financial year 2018 - none of them were children,\" Nelson said. \"In fact, more than a decade has passed since a child died in their custody.\" The figure appears to come from a story from the conservative website of Dili Kaller, which reported that 18 adult detainees had died in the custody of the United States during Obama's years. The Facebook fact-finding articles mentioned on January 11, 2021 in Facebook by Samantha Buterman, Speaker of the House of Representatives (January 12, 2021) no longer acknowledge that detainees were adults between the ages of 24 and 49, citing a 2016 report by Human Rights Watch, an international organization conducting research and defending human rights. The report analysed mortality reviews issued by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority in June 2016. She also stated that the Committee had confirmed the death of 31 detainees since May 2012, but that only 18 persons had been released at that time. These reviews include the deaths of 18 adults in 13 facilities between 2012 and 2015. Among those who died were nationals of Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico, Canada, Honduras, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda and the Republic of Mozambique. Human Rights Watch also referred to a European Civil Liberties Union report that investigated eight other deaths in custody, all adults, from 2010 to 2012. \"I did not realize that the Human Rights Watch report was a possible \"source\" to this allegation, because it focused on adults,\" said Michael Pushnik, Senior Adviser of the Child Rights Division of the organization. \"I can confirm that we have not published any other report in which we have documented the deaths of children in immigration detention, and I have no reason to doubt the statement of the Minister of National Security that this is the first such death in many years.\" \"18 children died in the custody of the United States on the border\" when Obama was president. We have not been able to find any documentation to support the claim that any children died in United States custody at the border during the Obama administration. The Minister of Internal Security of Trump also said that until the last death, he had been more than a decade since a child died in border detention. It appears that the prosecution began with articles recirculating the 2016 Human Rights Watch report, which analysed the deaths of 18 adult detainees between 2012 and 2015.
