Jim Moran says top five oil U.S. companies raked in $1 trillion profit", "text": "Amid the partisan showdown on Capitol Hill over how to slice the deficit, Democrats want to get rid of some tax breaks for oil companies.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim Moran, a Northern Virginia Democrat, used an eye-catching statistic to justify doing just that.\n\n\"Over the past decade, the big five oil companies -- BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell -- made a total profit of nearly $1 trillion,\" Moran said in a Feb. 10 news release.\n\nNo doubt, oil companies have made big profits. But we wondered if the decade-long profit tally really did approach $1 trillion.\n\nAnne Hughes, Moran\u2019s spokeswoman, said the figure came from a report earlier this year by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.\n\nThe report says the five oil companies made $951 billion, not adjusting for inflation, from 2001 through 2010. Daniel Weiss, the author of the report, said he got the profit data from Google Finance and from the companies themselves.\n\nBut Weiss acknowledged he made a mistake while adding up the annual profit tallies.\n\nWeiss sent us updated figures for the 10-year period. Those numbers, which were adjusted for inflation to reflect 2011 dollars, showed the five companies had a total profit of $901.6 billion for the 10-year-period.\n\nWe dug around ourselves to see if Weiss\u2019 latest figure was correct, examining profit figures each of the companies listed in their annual reports from 2001 through 2010.\n\nWe found that British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhilips\u00a0\u00a0had a total decade-long profit of roughly $801.7 billion in raw dollars.\n\nThe total profit for the five companies peaked at $123.4 billion in 2007. Last year it was $77.5 billion.\n\nWhen we adjusted our annual figures for inflation, the five companies\u2019 10-year total profit was about $884.3 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s close to the Weiss\u2019 updated number. Still, both his figure and ours are about $100 billion away from $1 trillion. So it\u2019s a stretch to say that the 10-year profit was \"nearly $1 trillion.\"\n\nAdam Sieminski, chief energy industry economist at Deutsche Bank, didn\u2019t see much use in putting too much stock in an overall profit number for those oil giants.\n\nThe profits should be expected to be large because the of the size of the companies, he said.\n\n\"These are big companies,\" Sieminksi said. \"You would think the real question would be how does it compare to other industries, what are the profit margins in the oil industry relative to profit margins in health care and banking and construction and so on, and the answer is they\u2019re not that much different.\"\n\nWe compared the profit margins of oil companies to those of three major Virginia companies: Dominion Virginia Power, Altria and Norfolk Southern.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, profit margins at ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell ranged from a high of 10.0 percent to a low of 4.4 percent. Dominion, a regulated utility company, had an 11.5 percent profit margin in 2008 and an 8.7 percent margin in 2009. Norfolk Southern, one of the nation\u2019s largest railroads, had a profit margin between 13 percent and 16.1 percent each of the three years.\n\nAltria, the nation\u2019s largest tobacco company had a profit margin of 52.4 percent in 2007. It\u2019s margin was 25.5 percent in 2008 and 13.6 percent in 2009.\n\nSo these three companies, each in different industries, consistently out-performed the major oil companies. But because the oil giants all had much higher revenues -- between $285 billion and $470 billion compared to revenues around $10 billion for Norfolk Southern, $15 billion for Dominion and $20 billion for Altria -- the oil profits seem look more grandiose.\n\nLet\u2019s review:\n\nMoran said BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell took in nearly $1 trillion in profit over the past decade. \u00a0\n\nThat statement was based on a report from the Center for American Progress, which initially said profits totaled $951 billion, but then corrected its figure to $901.6 billion.\n\nOur math put the inflation-adjusted profits at $884.3 billion. That\u2019s still more than $100 billion away from the $1 trillion figure Moran cited.\n\nSo to say that the total profits was nearly $1 trillion is a stretch.\n\nThe overall tally is still sizable though, so we rate the claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13277"}
