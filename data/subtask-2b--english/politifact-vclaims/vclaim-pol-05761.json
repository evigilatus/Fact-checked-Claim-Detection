The most recent estimates show that 4.1 million drivers, or about one in seven on the state\u2019s roads, were uninsured as of 2012.\nA state law that went into effect in January has suddenly wiped away that problem, according to Assemblyman Luis Alejo, D-Salinas.\nAlejo announced in September that more than half a million undocumented state residents had obtained a driver\u2019s license under AB 60, which he authored.\nHe went on to say his law erases any worry about uninsured motorists rumbling down California\u2019s roads.\n\"I am proud to have authored this historic measure for not only the millions of hard working undocumented Californians that call California home, but also the 38 million California residents that can now rest assured that everyone on California\u2019s roads is properly licensed, tested and insured,\" Alejo said in a press release.\nWe wanted to fact-check the head-scratching claim that \"everyone on California\u2019s roads is properly licensed, tested and insured,\" with a focus on the insurance portion.\nWe started with some sobering data from the California Highway Patrol, which enforces the state\u2019s requirement that all drivers carry insurance.\nIn the first eight months of this year, its officers issued more than 66,000 citations statewide to drivers who failed to show valid insurance.\n\n*NOTE: The 2015 figure is a projection. As of Aug. 31, 2015, the CHP has issued 66,003 citations to improperly insured drivers.\nSource: CHP\nClearly, uninsured motorists are still keeping the CHP busy.\nEric Lin, a professor who studies insurance at Sacramento State University, called Alejo\u2019s statement wishful thinking.\n\"First of all, it\u2019s inaccurate,\" Lin said. \"I think that it\u2019s a goal that all of us should be trying to get to.\"\nThe professor cited an Insurance Research Council report from 2014 that estimates California had the most uninsured motorists in the nation in 2012, with 4.1 million.\nWhile the report centers on trends from three years ago, Patrick Schmid, the council\u2019s research director, said there\u2019s no doubt people are still driving without insurance in California.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact of the matter is there are motorists out there both nationally and within the state of California that are making the unwise decision to drive uninsured,\" Schmid said.\nWe asked Alejo\u2019s office to explain the lawmaker\u2019s claim. His spokeswoman responded in an email that the statement \"should have been a little more precise.\"\n\"In retrospect,\" she added, \"it should have read: \"\u2026but also the 38 million California residents that can now rest assured that everyone on California\u2019s roads will be properly licensed, tested and insured.\"\n\nAssemblyman Luis Alejo. Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio\nLin said he\u2019s \"not optimistic\" that Alejo\u2019s prediction will come true.\n\"This uninsured motorist problem is perplexing. It\u2019s very difficult to mitigate,\" the professor said.\nHe said AB 60 has the potential to reduce uninsured driving in California, though he and state insurance and motor vehicle officials said it was too early to say whether the law is having that impact.\nCalifornia does not require proof of insurance to obtain a driver\u2019s license. It does, however, require insurance to register a vehicle.\nInsurance experts say Alejo\u2019s claim about \"everyone\" being insured on California\u2019s roads is far from true.\nBut they point out that the percentage of uninsured motorists has been falling in recent years. Nationwide, \u00a0it dropped from 14.9 percent of drivers in 2003 to 12.6 percent in 2012, according to the research council.\nCompared with a few years ago, Schmid said the cost of auto insurance is less and more people are working, both of which persuade people to carry insurance.\nThe CHP data also point to fewer uninsured motorists. It shows a significant drop in citations issued for drivers who failed to show proof of insurance in each of the past five years.\nOur ruling\nAssemblyman Luis Alejo says \"everyone on California\u2019s roads is properly licensed, tested and insured.\"\nThis statement is clearly a dream, with no basis in fact.\nWhile indicators show the number of uninsured motorists is dropping, CHP officers are still very busy citing uninsured drivers. They wrote more than 66,000 tickets for uninsured drivers from January through August.\nInsurance experts call Alejo\u2019s claim inaccurate and wishful thinking. They also strongly doubt the problem will ever be fully solved.\nWe rate the claim Pants On Fire, which we define as a statement that is \"not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\"\nClick here for more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05761"}
