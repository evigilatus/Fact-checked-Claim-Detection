When you need to flip things blue there\u2019s always some mysterious mail-in ballots lying around that\u2019ll do the trick. Shameful!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s effort to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California\u2019s partnership with Facebook.) It received more than 700,000 views and 25,000 likes on the platform by early Wednesday afternoon.\nFacebook added a warning label at the bottom of the post citing the trustworthiness of voting by mail.\nWith the nation\u2019s focus on the still-undetermined presidential race, we set out to fact check Lahren\u2019s claim.\nA \u2018False And Unsupported Statement\u2019\u00a0\nWhile early election night results in several battleground states favored President Donald Trump, continued counting and reporting on Wednesday of legally voted mail-in ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan have turned the still-preliminary results in favor of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden.\u00a0\nSeveral battleground states were legally not allowed to tally mail-in votes before Election Day. That meant many votes from Democrats, who relied much more heavily on mail-in voting, were reported after figures from Tuesday\u2019s in-person voting, which Republicans relied on in greater numbers.\u00a0\nOfficials in those states have not cited evidence that unexplained mail-in ballots are turning states \"blue.\"\u00a0\n\"There is no support for the claim that ballots \u2018lying around\u2019 are mysteriously included in the count. This is a false and unsupported statement,\" Rick Hasen, a UC Irvine law professor and elections expert, wrote in an email, referring to both the contested states and California.\n\"Despite all of the complaints about third party collection of ballots (sometimes referred to pejoratively as \u2018ballot harvesting\u2019) there has been no evidence of any widespread fraud with mail in ballots in California elections,\" he added.\nRepublicans in 2018 criticized a new state law that allows anyone, even campaign workers, to collect and return mail-in ballots, which they dubbed \"ballot harvesting.\"\u00a0\nLater-arriving mail-in ballots, some collected under this new law, helped several Democratic congressional candidates win during that year\u2019s midterm election after Republicans had more votes counted on Election Day.\nAsked about Lahren\u2019s post, Sam Mahood, a spokesperson for the California Secretary of State\u2019s Office, said it \"offers no evidence.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Voting-by-mail has been popular in red, blue, and purple states for years. It\u2019s a secure and transparent process. Vote counting is open to the public and campaigns to view,\" Mahood wrote.\u00a0\nHe added there\u2019s been no indication of any large-scale fraud tied to mail-in voting during the current election.\nFor longtime California voters, there\u2019s nothing \"mysterious\" about mail-in ballots. Voters of all political stripes have used them safely and securely for decades to help both Democrats and Republicans win.\u00a0\nThe process \u2014 traditionally called absentee voting and now more commonly called mail-in voting or vote-by-mail \u2014 has been allowed for anyone who\u2019s registered, and for any reason, since 1979, according to the California Voter Foundation. A record 72% of votes cast in the California primary were by mail, a figure that\u2019s expected to be surpassed once all the state\u2019s general election ballots are counted in the weeks ahead.\u00a0\nMail-in ballots, in fact, were instrumental in the May special election victory by Republican Rep. Mike Garcia in northern Los Angeles County, undercutting the repeated claim by President Donald Trump that they favor Democrats and lead to corruption.\u00a0\nElection experts, along with state and county election officials and numerous studies have all rejected claims that mail-in ballots lead to widespread fraud. The studies include a 5-year investigation by the George W. Bush administration that turned up virtually no evidence of any organized effort to skew federal elections.\u00a0\nThere have been cases of voters trying to cheat using mail-in ballots, but experts say it\u2019s not systemic. When it happens, it gets caught.\u00a0\n\"Election fraud of all sorts is rare. There is a slightly less rare instance of voter fraud by absentee balloting,\" Charles Stewart, co-director of the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project, which analyzes election systems, told us in June. \"There are greater temptations and opportunities. Nonetheless, they are rare.\"\u00a0\nStewart pointed to one exception: A Miami mayoral election in 1998 \"that ended up being full of mail ballot fraud.\"\u00a0\nMore recently, Justin Levitt, a professor at the Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, examined United States elections from 2000 to 2014. He found just 31 credible incidents of voter fraud of any kind over that period, during which more than a billion votes were cast.\nOur Ruling\nA popular Facebook post from commentator Tomi Lahren said \"mysterious mail-in ballots lying around\" helped flip key states in the race for the White House for Democrat Joe Biden. It also suggested California\u2019s mail-in voting system is fraudulent.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no evidence that election officials discovered new or illegal ballots \"lying around\" after Election Day. Several battleground states where early results from Tuesday\u2019s in-person vote favored President Trump continued counting legally-voted mail-in ballots Tuesday night and Wednesday. Those ballots can take longer to count and some states were prohibited from starting to tally them until Tuesday.\u00a0\nAdditionally, Democratic voters relied more heavily on mail-in ballots, which explains why the early results have shifted.\u00a0\nElection experts and county election officials along with numerous studies have rejected the idea that mail-in ballots in California or any other state lead to widespread fraud.\u00a0\nLahren\u2019s post is making waves on social media. But it\u2019s not backed up by the facts.\u00a0\nWe rated it False.\u00a0\nFALSE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is not accurate.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18447"}
