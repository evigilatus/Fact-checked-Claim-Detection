That story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe \"simple math\" about Biden\u2019s voters is wrong.\u00a0\nGateway Pundit relies on bogus calculation to lead to false claim\nThe Gateway Pundit cites a tweet by Bill Binney, who worked at the National Security Agency from 1965 to 2001. Binney cited a Washington Post story about historic voter turnout in the November election.\u00a0\nThe Washington Post story said 66.2% of the voting-eligible population cast a vote. (The United States Elections Project calculates the eligible population by adjusting the voting-age population for non-citizens and ineligible felons, depending on state law.)\nWhile the Washington Post clearly cited the voting-eligible population, Binney and The Gateway Pundit instead looked up figures for the number of registered voters \u2014 even though not every American who is eligible to vote takes the steps to register.\u00a0\nBinney wrote that if there are 212 million registered voters and 66.2% voted, that means about 140 million voted. If Trump received 74 million votes, that leaves about 66 million for Biden, Binney wrote.\nBinney\u2019s implication is that there is no way Biden actually received about 81 million votes.\n\"These numbers don\u2019t add up to what we are being told. Lies and more Lies!\" Binney tweeted.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinney didn't explain\u00a0why, under this theoretically flawed analysis, it couldn\u2019t have been Trump who had erroneously received millions of votes.\nThe Gateway Pundit added up the number of registered voters and applied the same math formula and reported numbers in the same ballpark as Binney. The writer concluded that if Trump won 74 million votes, that left 67.5 million remaining for Biden. That means\u00a0\"13 million duplicate or made up ballots were created and counted for Biden!\"\nBut just as Binney did, the Gateway Pundit is plugging in the wrong number \u2014 the number of registered voters \u2014 while the Washington Post cited the number of adults eligible to vote.\nThe United States Elections Project found there were about 239.2 million eligible voters for the Nov. 3 election. Using that denominator and an approximately 66% turnout rate, it shows that about 158 million people voted for president.\u00a0\nThe Gateway Pundit also declared that \"Biden committed fraud\" and stole the election by \"millions\" of votes, a ridiculous assertion that included no evidence to back it up. Claims of widespread fraud have been debunked by federal security officials, as well as state election officials, including in GOP-led states such as Georgia. Nationwide, judges tossed out dozens of lawsuits by Trump and his allies that attempted to overturn the election, for lack of evidence.\u00a0\nThere is one more problem with the faulty claims by Binney and the Gateway Pundit \u2014 they rely on outdated data on registered voters. They cited World Population Review\u2019s state-by-state tally of registered voters, but that website shows the number of voters in some states months before the Nov. 3 election. For example, for Florida it shows 14,065,627 voters as of Aug. 31. But the relevant number is how many voters were registered as of the registration deadline, Oct. 6, which was 14,441,869.\nOur ruling\nA headline on The Gateway Pundit said, \"REVEALED: \u2018Simple math\u2019 shows Biden claims 13 million more votes than there were eligible voters who voted in 2020 election.\"\nThis isn\u2019t a case of simple math; it's a case of flawed analysis. The Gateway Pundit conflated registered voters with eligible voters. The two are not the same.\nThere is no evidence that Biden claimed 13 million more votes than was mathematically possible.\u00a0\nThis statement rates Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17313"}
