Dick Durbin, D-Ill., appeared on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe to share his thoughts about the president\u2019s pick.\nDurbin, the Democratic whip and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in the interview he believes Gorsuch should have a hearing, but that the nominee also should meet the required voting standard.\n\n\"(Gorsuch) should have a hearing and he should meet the voting standard that Supreme Court nominees are held to of 60 votes. A standard that was met by Elena Kagan as well as Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's choices,\" Durbin told the show\u2019s hosts.\nWith Senate Republicans considering the so-called \"nuclear option\" to lower the vote threshold needed to confirm Gorsuch, we decided to double-check Durbin\u2019s declaration.\nDurbin has a point, but he does oversimplifies the process for Senate votes on Supreme Court nominees. Notably, a formal confirmation vote does not require 60 votes.\nVoting standard?\nOf the nearly 4,000 government positions Trump must fill, 1,212 require a Senate confirmation.\nThat includes all Cabinet-level posts as well as hundreds of other senior positions and agency heads.\nHere\u2019s how the confirmation process will work for Gorsuch: He will testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. If the committee refers his nomination to the full Senate (a likely outcome due to the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee), a vote by the full Senate needs to be taken. The Senate majority leader moves to take the Senate into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute.\nThen, the Senate majority leader needs to bring a nominee to a vote by the full Senate. In Gorsuch\u2019s case, barring any outstanding circumstances, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent, a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee. However, if unanimous consent cannot be reached, and if at least one senator filibusters, Sen. McConnell would need to invoke cloture.\nA \"cloture vote,\" agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes. After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\nThis confirmation process for some positions became less burdensome thanks to a rule change on Nov. 21, 2013.\nWith the Senate\u2019s Republican minority blocking President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees for executive branch positions and, in particular, appeals court judges, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., triggered the so-called nuclear option by a successful 52-48 vote, eliminating the 60-vote threshold needed to confirm most nominations, and with it, the threat of a filibuster.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarack Obama\n\n\nstated on May 26, 2009 in a speech at the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Walking in the door (Sonia Sotomayor) would bring more experience on the bench, and more varied experience on the bench, than anyone currently serving on the United States Supreme Court had when they were appointed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Angie Drobnic Holan \u2022 May 26, 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rule change, however, excluded Supreme Court nominees, meaning that such nominations could be filibustered. And that\u2019s something that some Democrats have threatened \u00a0to do against the Gorsuch nomination. The Republicans currently hold 52 seats in the Senate -- enough to reach the final vote threshold of 51 votes, but only if they can get that far.\nNow that we\u2019ve addressed some background information about the nuclear option and current situation at hand, let\u2019s take a look at Durbin\u2019s claim.\nNomination and confirmation of Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan\nFollowing the election of Obama in November 2008, Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress and essentially held 59 seats in the Senate because two independents caucused with them.\nIn May 2009, Obama nominated U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Sonia Sotomayor of New York for the Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice David Souter.\nSenate Judiciary Committee hearings began on June 1 of that year, and Sotomayor was confirmed by a vote of 68-31 on Aug. 6.\nDemocratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts did not vote. He died on Aug. 25 -- 15 months after being diagnosed with brain cancer. If Kennedy had been present for the vote, Senate Democrats would have had a filibuster-proof majority. But that didn\u2019t matter because nine Republicans voted to confirm Sotomayor.\nThen almost exactly one year later, Obama\u2019s nominee to replace retiring Justice John Paul Stevens, U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan, was confirmed by the Senate on Aug. 6 in a 63-37 vote, with five Republicans voting in favor and one Democrat, former Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, voting against.\nDuring the confirmation of both Sotomayor and Kagan, Democrats had a comfortable majority that was near filibuster-proof if not for the absence of Kennedy in August 2009 and the lone dissenting Democratic vote by Nelson in August 2010.\nOn the surface, the margins achieved by Sotomayor and Kagan would seem to support Durbin\u2019s argument that the confirmations required 60 votes. However, it\u2019s more complicated than that. The nominations were never filibustered, so no 60-vote cloture motion was required. And the final confirmation required only 51 votes. In fact, two sitting justices -- Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas -- never reached 60 votes in their final tally.\nThe key word that trips up Durbin is \"standard.\" The existing Senate \"standard\" says nothing about reaching 60 votes. If the standard for passing a class is earning a C, and someone gets a B, it doesn\u2019t mean that a B was required to pass the class. The \"standard\" to pass the class is still a C.\nWhether this longstanding standard lasts into the future, given the degree of polarization in Congress today, is another question entirely.\nOur rating\nIn an interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe show, Durbin said Obama\u2019s nominees met a standard of 60 votes, \"a standard that was met by Elena Kagan as well as Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's choices.\"\nObama\u2019s nominees cleared the procedural hurdles and won 60 votes and then some. The Senate confirmed Kagan by a roll call vote of 63-37 in 2010, and Sotomayor was confirmed in 2009 by a vote of 68-31.\nKagan and Sotomayor ultimately would have had enough votes to be able to break a filibuster, but they never had to -- and the margins they got on the final, simple-majority vote can\u2019t be used to retroactively define what the \"standard\" was.\nWe rate the statement Half True.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    2 6  Politifact Rating:   Says President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees met a standard of 60 votes, \"a standard that was met by Elena Kagan as well as Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's choices.\"    Richard Durbin U.S. Senator    in an interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe  Wednesday, February 1, 2017 02/01/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03689"}
