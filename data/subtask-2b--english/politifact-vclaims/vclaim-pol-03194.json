The image used at the top of the story is taken from NBC footage recorded after a shooting at the Capitol on March 28, 2016.\nBut FreedomCrossroads.us had a familiar feel to it \u2014 it shared a design template with TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody site responsible for literally hundreds of fake news stories popping up across the Internet.\nThat site was run by a man named Christopher Blair, who has told us he was a self-described liberal troll living in Maine. He said his aim was to trick conservatives with absurd and fictional news stories that exposed how gullible they were.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Whois lookup showed that FreedomCrossroads.us is registered to Blair, and lists information PolitiFact had previously used to contact him.

The Pelosi post is credited to an author called \"Truth Dealer,\" who is crosslisted as Alan Whitemor.\nFreedomCrossroads.us said on its page footer that the site made up its stories. \"Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate,\" it reads.\nPelosi did not have any kind of breakdown.
