In that statement, she acknowledged the allegations against Kavanaugh but said that she did not base her decision on them.\n\"(W)hile the recent allegations against him are troubling and deserve a thorough and fair examination by the Senate Judiciary Committee, my decision is not based on those allegations but rather on his positions on several key issues, most importantly the avalanche of dark, anonymous money that is crushing our democracy,\" the statement read.\nMcCaskill repeated a version of the claim in an Oct. 30 interview with CNN, saying she \"made her decision before the allegations had even really surfaced, way before the ugly confirmation process.\"\nMcCaskill\u2019s decision to vote \"no\" did precede other allegations of sexual misconduct.
