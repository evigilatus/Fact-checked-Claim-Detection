The plans, the story said, were announced by the Austin Parks Foundation, which was described as intending to award the money as grants.\n\n\"Half of it will be spent on improving smaller parks in the Barton Hills, Zilker, Bouldin Creek, Old West Austin, West Austin and Rollingwood neighborhoods,\" the story said, with the remaining $150,000 devoted to the park\u2019s irrigation system.\n\nSpread $150,000 evenly among six neighborhoods and it comes to $25,000 each.\n\nBut that\u2019s indirect guidance; we sought definitive evidence. By email, Bone guided us to Abel Campos, a city accountant, who emailed us a copy of a $25,000 check, dated Jan. 12, 2007, made out to the city by the parks foundation. Campos also shared a March 20, 2007, letter to the city from Charlie McCabe, then the foundation's executive director, stating the money reflected proceeds from the Rolling Stones concert.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBone said the Rolling Stones gave $25,000 to Rollingwood after the band performed at Zilker Park. That\u2019s the amount of money that flowed through the Austin Parks Foundation to the city described as proceeds from the big show. We rate the statement as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09209"}
