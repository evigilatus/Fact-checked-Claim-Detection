Bruce Braley got into a dispute with a neighbor because her chickens wandered onto his vacation property, a lake house in Holiday Lake, Iowa.\nThere\u2019s a website,\u00a0BraleyChicken.com, and reports of\u00a0promotional rubber chickens. Karl Rove\u2019s conservative political action committee American Crossroads\u00a0released an ad\u00a0in July attacking Braley over the dispute.\nIn Des Moines on Sept. 28, Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst was well\u00a0prepared with\u00a0a quip\u00a0about what the chicken incident says about Braley as a leader. Ernst and Braley are vying to succeed retiring Democrat Tom Harkin in one of the nation\u2019s\u00a0tightest\u00a0and most-watched Senate contests.\n\"Congressman, you threatened to sue a neighbor over chickens that came onto your property,\" Ernst said. \"You\u2019re talking about bipartisanship. How do we expect as Iowans to believe that you will work across the aisle when you can\u2019t walk across your yard?\"\n\"That\u2019s just not true,\" Braley replied. \"I never threatened to sue anyone.\"\nThe chicken incident, which came to light in July, has been well\u00a0reported. But we wondered about their disagreement at the debate. Did Braley actually threaten to sue or not?\nThere was a real dispute over chickens, but we didn't find evidence for a lawsuit threatened against the neighbor.\nThe backstory\nThe Braleys\u2019 neighbor, Pauline Hampton, keeps chickens in her backyard as pets and therapy animals. These chickens were previously unfenced and would occasionally wander onto the Braleys\u2019 property, and Braley\u2019s wife, Carolyn, claimed she could smell them.\nHampton says she did not know that the chickens were bothering her neighbors until this past spring, when Carolyn Braley told Hampton that she would be filing a complaint to the neighborhood homeowner\u2019s association.\nThe\u00a0neighborhood rules\u00a0say, \"No animals or birds, other than household pets, shall be kept on any lot.\"\n(The Braleys weren\u2019t the only Holiday Lake residents who had problems with the chickens, according to Yahoo\u00a0and the\u00a0Washington Post, both of which interviewed other Holiday Lake residents.)\u00a0\nCarolyn Braley\u2019s complaint came up at the neighborhood association\u00a0board meeting\u00a0in May. The board ruled that the chickens are indeed pets and Hampton could keep them, as long as she fenced them into her yard.\nProblem solved?\nWell, not quite.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawyer\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that any legal action was taken, so why do Republicans keep saying Braley threatened to sue over the chickens?\u00a0\nAfter the matter was settled, the conservative\u00a0Iowa Republican, broke the story after it acquired a series of\u00a0emails. They show that Braley contacted the neighborhood association\u2019s lawyer about a week after the board\u2019s decision about Hampton\u2019s chickens, complaining about the board\u2019s \"lack of action\" and saying he believes \"chickens are not pets and should not be permitted at Holiday Lake.\"\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Iowa Republican\u00a0treated these emails as a smoking gun.\u00a0\nHowever, these emails -- among the lawyer, the neighborhood association board and Braley -- do not say anywhere that Braley was considering a lawsuit.\nIn fact, they say the opposite. The lawyer, Thomas Lacina, writes: \"The implication from Mr. Braley was that he wants to avoid a \u2018litigious situation.'\u00a0\"\u00a0\nIowa Republicans say that the fact that Braley, a former trial lawyer, hinted at a \"litigious situation\" is evidence enough that he was considering a lawsuit -- but it still doesn\u2019t definitively prove it.\nOne interpretation of the email is that Braley said to the lawyer he wants to \"avoid a litigious situation,\" but he will sue if he has to. But another interpretation is that Braley told the lawyer he planned to \"avoid a litigious situation\" under all circumstances.\n\nPoint is, we don't know what was going on in Braley's head or the details of private conversations he had with his wife and the lawyer -- and neither does Ernst.\n(By the way -- Jeff Patch, the author behind the\u00a0Iowa Republican\u00a0story,\u00a0is now\u00a0the communications director for the Iowa Republican Party.)\nA spokesman for Braley told us that \"a lawsuit was never part of the picture at all -- nor was there ever any threat of a lawsuit. Any claims to the contrary are false.\"\n\"I just reached out to somebody I knew expecting to get a phone call back and instead this thing blows up,\" Braley told the\u00a0Washington Post.\nIn an interview with PolitiFact, Hampton said Braley never threatened to sue her -- though she was under the impression that he threatened to sue the neighborhood association board.\nIn a local newspaper, the\u00a0Quad City Times,\u00a0one board member said he thought a lawsuit was in the air, while the board\u2019s vice president said he never thought that was a serious possibility.\nWe called the neighborhood association board, but they declined to comment and hung up the phone.\nWe also want to note that the original\u00a0Iowa Republican\u00a0story says the association\u2019s\u00a0lawyer billed the board\u00a0nearly $1,700 over the dispute, but the budget document does not specify that the costs directly pertained to Braley\u2019s interaction with the lawyer.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the board vice president told the\u00a0Quad City Times\u00a0that the figure wasn\u2019t entirely accurate, and the association's lawyer \"handles a number of chores and has a monthly budget.\"\nOur ruling\nErnst said Braley \"threatened to sue a neighbor over chickens that came onto (his) property.\"\nSome might not like the way Braley and his wife handled a dispute with a neighbor -- by going to the neighborhood association and then consulting\u00a0the association's\u00a0lawyer. Even so, there is no material evidence that Braley threatened a lawsuit against the neighbor\u00a0or was even considering one. Even the neighbor says that.\nWe rate Ernst\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07215"}
