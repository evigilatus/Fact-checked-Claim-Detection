Trump has said coronavirus precautions shouldn\u2019t hold back the U.S. economy and that states should take the lead on testing, mask requirements and more. He\u2019s also advocated for the rapid development of vaccines.\u00a0\nBiden, meanwhile, has advocated for nationwide mask-wearing and physical distancing. He wants to dramatically increase access to rapid testing and he supports additional assistance for hospitals and public health workers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe video on Facebook cuts between Kaye\u2019s commentary and several clips from Biden, including the following statements from his Aug. 20 speech before the DNC:\u00a0\n\"If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I\u2019ll be an ally of the light, not the darkness. It\u2019s time for us, for we the people, to come together.\"\n\"If I\u2019m your president on day one we\u2019ll implement the national strategy I\u2019ve been laying out since March.\"\n\"We\u2019ll develop and deploy rapid tests with results available immediately.\"\u00a0\n\"We\u2019ll make the medical supplies and protective equipment that our country needs and we\u2019ll make them here in America so we will never again be at the mercy of China or other foreign countries in order to protect our own people.\"\u00a0\n\"We\u2019ll make sure our schools have the resources they need to be open, safe and effective.\"\nKaye didn\u2019t provide any evidence in the video that Biden poached those lines from President Donald Trump. Rather, he criticized the former vice president for promising policies Kaye argued Trump had already enacted.\nAround the 3:15 mark, Kaye said: \"Every single thing he\u2019s mentioned to this point, every single thing he\u2019s mentioned \u2014\u00a0rapid testing, getting it out there quickly, American-made ventilators and supplies getting to the places where they\u2019re needed, getting the schools open in a safe environment where kids can learn \u2014\u00a0every single thing he pointed out is something that the current occupant of the Oval Office has already done. It\u2019s like he literally just watched a Donald Trump press conference, took notes and said, \u2018Oh that\u2019s good. I\u2019ma tell people that\u2019s my plan.\"\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

On Aug. 11, he said that his administration had \"delivered over 1,800 rapid point-of-care testing devices to nursing homes\" and that officials were in the process of delivering such devices to all Medicare and Medicaid-certified nursing homes.\nOn July 28, he said \"we made major investments in new rapid point-of-care tests.\"\u00a0\nBiden said: \"We\u2019ll make the medical supplies and protective equipment that our country needs and we\u2019ll make them here in America so we will never again be at the mercy of China or other foreign countries in order to protect our own people.\"\u00a0\nTrump has talked about medical supplies and protective equipment but, according to Factba.se, he hasn\u2019t talked about them in connection with China.\u00a0\nAnd Trump has also spoken publicly about opening schools safely, but he didn\u2019t say, as Biden did, that \"we\u2019ll make sure our schools have the resources they need to be open, safe and effective.\"\nOur ruling\nInvoking plagiarism, the post claims, \"Joe Biden\u2019s speech stolen from Trump!\" We found no similar passages from Biden\u2019s speech originating in a Trump speech.
