Social media users and BuzzFeed News identified the man as Clayton John Hickey, a registered nurse at Regional One Hospital in Memphis and a resident of Olive Branch.\nThe day after the election, Regional One tweeted that it was \"aware of a photograph in circulation\" and that they \"are investigating and will take appropriate action.\"\nRegional One did not respond to our inquiry.\nThe viral photo of a man with a racist shirt at a polling station in Mississippi is not photoshopped.
