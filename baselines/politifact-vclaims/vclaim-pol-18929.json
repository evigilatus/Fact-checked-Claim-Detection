(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere are three clear problems with the Facebook post and the tweet at the center of it.\n\nFirst, antifa has not been designated as a terrorist organization. It is not a singular group. The term stands for \"anti-fascist\" and is used to describe a broad coalition of activists \u2014 including communists, anarchists and socialists \u2014 that has been around for decades.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, there\u2019s no evidence that antifa activists are responsible for the wildfires that have raged in Oregon and across the West Coast. As we\u2019ve reported, police and fire officials have dispelled rumors about antifa. Many of the wildfires appear to have been sparked accidentally.\nRELATED: Antifa activists did not start the West Coast wildfires\n\"FBI Portland and local law enforcement agencies have been receiving reports that extremists are responsible for setting wildfires in Oregon. With our state and local partners, the FBI has investigated several such reports and found them to be untrue,\" the FBI said in a statement.\nA Facebook representative said on Twitter that the platform was \"removing false claims that the wildfires in Oregon were started by certain groups.\"\nFinally, the Scarsdale Antifa Twitter account behind the original post is suspect. New York magazine identified it in 2017 as one of many likely fake antifa accounts. A reporter noted on Sept. 12, two days after the tweet in question went up, that the account had been suspended.\nA Twitter spokesperson confirmed Sept. 14 that the account was suspended for violating Twitter\u2019s policy on \"platform manipulation and spam.\" The policy says violations occur when users operate fake accounts, use multiple accounts to artificially amplify or disrupt conversations, artificially inflate their followers or engagement, or misuse Twitter\u2019s features.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18929"}
