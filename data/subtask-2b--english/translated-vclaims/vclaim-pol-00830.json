Let's look at it. First, the judge's reference. In March, Fox News suspended Janine Peru from its \"justice with Judge Janine\" program after reading a written comment about the United States Republic of America Elehan Omar, D-Minn, who, according to CNN, was \"a large-scale criticism of Islamophobia.\" Fox revealed the same month that Brazil was joining the network. Brazil is a former interim president of the Danish National Council and a former commentator of CNN. The CNN network forced Brazil to resign in October 2016 after WikiLeaks &apos; e-mails revealed that it had shared with Hillary Clinton some of the questions that CNN managers were likely to address to the candidate who was then president during the discussions sponsored by the network and open meetings. \"We are completely uncomfortable with what we learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while CNN's contribution was made,\" said Network spokesman Lauren Pratapas at the time. \"The network did not give Brazil access to any questions, preparatory materials, attendance list, background information or meetings prior to the municipal hall or discussion.\" On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" By Daniel Vanky, 19 January 2021, Brazil was a supporter of Clinton, and, as the New York Times reported, the fact that it shared the questions with a candidate \"seems to reduce the integrity of the event.\" In an article in March 2017 for Time magazine, Brazil called the Clinton campaign e-mail \"A mistake I will regret forever.\" Brazil did not respond immediately to Poletti Fact e-mail asking for the accuracy of the article. Nor did a spokesperson for the National Democratic Commission respond to an e-mail from the Politifakt newspaper. However, we found no evidence that Brazil faced criminal charges with regard to diversion, although some people wished otherwise. We searched for news coverage of any arrests or crimes related to Brazil, and we found a motion for change. org called \"Arest Donna Brasel.\" In November 2017, Politico published an excerpt from the then Brazilian book, \"Hacks: The Inter Project of the Ins and Exacts that put Donald Trump in the White House.\" In this, it describes the attempt to find evidence of internal corruption that would show DNA was tampering with the system to throw the foundation to Hillary. I discovered a \"trust fund agreement\" between the campaign and the National Democratic Party that was signed before Clinton received the democratic nomination. \"If the battle was fair, one campaign wouldn't have control of the party before the voters decided which one they wanted to lead,\" I wrote. \"This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it endangers the integrity of the party.\" The conservative weekly standard checked his own facts for the allegation that the DNA illegally stole 2016 primary from Bernie Sanders. In that publication, he referred to a collective action against the National Democratic Congress Party, which claimed that the organization had violated its charter \"by working with a single campaign to effectively choose who would win the democratic vote.\" The National Defence Commission replied that it had no legal obligations \"to remain neutral throughout the process.\" The lawsuit was dismissed. As for the mail that Brazil calls a criminal, we evaluate it wrong. See Figure 1 on PolityFact.com", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00830"}
