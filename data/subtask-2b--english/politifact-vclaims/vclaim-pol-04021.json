He\u2019s held a number of key administrative posts in the Richmond region but never has held elective office. So we wondered if he had, indeed, voted to cut millions from city schools, as Stoney said.\nFootnotes on Stoney\u2019s flier base the claim on an April 17, 2012, article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that updated a funding feud between Mayor Dwight C. Jones and the city\u2019s School Board.\nThe controversy began in February 2012, when the board passed a school budget with $263.7 million in projected expenses but only $239.9 million in projected revenues.\nRather than cut expenses, the board opted to approve its underfunded budget and ask Jones and the Richmond City Council to make up the difference.\nJones responded in March by appointing a task force of 11 public and private executives to look for savings in the School Board\u2019s budget that wouldn\u2019t hurt classroom instruction. Berry, a former Richmond budget director, was one of the appointees.\nThe panel hired two outside consultants, including former Richmond City Manager Robert C. Bobb, to find possible short- and long-term cuts. The consultants\u2019 $35,000 fee was paid by the Greater Richmond Chamber Foundation. \u00a0\nOn April 16, 2012, the panel voted 10-1 to recommend $23.8 million in cuts to the School Board\u2019s proposed budget. Berry voted with the majority.\nAn article in the next day\u2019s Times-Dispatch - footnoted in Stoney\u2019s flier - said the task force \"leaned heavily\" on the consultant\u2019s recommendations in finalizing its list of proposed cuts. The list included:\n\u2022cutting 20 teacher positions;\n\u2022cutting 25 teacher aides;\n\u2022cutting 50 non-teacher positions;\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022imposing three furlough days;\n\u2022changing various health care benefits;\n\u2022changing the structure of plant service and security; and\n\u2022eliminating the employee bonus pool.\nStoney\u2019s flier calls the package of cuts \"Berry\u2019s plan,\" but there\u2019s nothing in The Times-Dispatch\u2019s coverage that suggests he was the mastermind. To the contrary, the article cited by Stoney says the task force \"heavily leaned\" on the recommendations of its consultants in finalizing its list of proposed cuts. It also should be noted that Berry was not one of the two people Jones appointed as co-chairmen of the panel.\nA week later, Jones asked City Council to contribute an additional $5.1 million for education - far below the extra $23.8 million the School Board sought. The mayor rejected the task force\u2019s recommendations for furlough days and eliminating health benefits for the school system\u2019s pre-Medicare retirees. The council increased that amount to $5.6 million.\nIn the end, Richmond schools were left with a $250 million budget for the 2012-13 school year, anchored by a $129.4 million appropriation from the City Council and with the rest coming from state and federal sources. That was slightly higher than the $249.1 million for the 2011-12 school year, which included $123.8 million in city funds.\nOur ruling\nStoney\u2019s flier says, \"Jack Berry voted for a plan to cut $23.8 million from our schools.\"\nThe Richmond School Board passed a budget in 2012 that exceeded its revenues by $23.8 million and asked the city to make up the difference.\nMayor Jones refused and appointed an 11-member advisory committee, which included Berry, to find savings. The panel voted 10-1, with Berry\u2019s support, to recommend a plan that itemized $23.8 million in cuts to the board\u2019s proposed budget. The City Council largely adopted that plan.\nStoney\u2019s statement suggests that Berry had an official role in the budget deliberations. He didn\u2019t. Berry served as an adviser to the mayor with instructions to find efficiencies. He didn\u2019t have a say in the actual appropriation of city funds for education; that remained in the hands of the City Council.\nIt\u2019s also misleading to say, as Stoney does, that the plan \"cut\" $23.8 million from schools. Most of that sum was hoped-for new money from the City Council that the School Board never received. \u00a0\nSo Stoney\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores important facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/23f24b7a-2d34-4c7d-9f00-81e65e12263b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04021"}
