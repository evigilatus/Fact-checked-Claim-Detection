In the same interview, while assessing potential Democratic candidates for president in 2020, he also made a claim we want to check about a controversial idea floated by Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 about a 70 percent tax rate.\nSuggesting the idea is loved by most Americans, Moore said:\n\"I\u2019m talking about a Fox News Poll this week, where it said 70 percent of the American public agree with her on having the top marginal rate for the rich \u2014 their taxes \u2014 70 percent rate, on the rich. And that\u2019s a Fox News Poll saying that over two-thirds of the country support her.\"\nThere is widespread support among Americans to raise taxes on the rich.\nBut do 70 percent support a 70 percent tax rate \u2014 as reported by the conservative TV outlet?\nThe proposal\nFirst, a bit on the idea that Ocasio-Cortez floated on CBS\u2019 60 Minutes, which her office has told PolitiFact is more a discussion-starter than a proposal:\nThe 70 percent income tax rate would affect dollars received above $10 million.\nThat rate would be a big jump from the current top marginal tax rate of 37 percent, which kicks in for income above $510,300 for individuals and $612,350 for married couples.\nIt\u2019s estimated that about 16,000 would be affected by the 70 percent rate.\nNow, to that Fox News Poll.\nNo 70% rate question\nMoore\u2019s claim is based on a Fox News Poll that was conducted Jan. 20-22, one of Moore\u2019s producers told us. The producer also cited a Washington Post news story, which said that the poll found 70 percent support for raising taxes on income above $10 million.\nOne thing to note is the poll was of a narrower group than Moore said \u2014 a random sample of registered voters, not all Americans. More importantly, despite Moore\u2019s claim, the poll did not ask about a specific maximum tax rate.\nHere are\u00a0the poll question and the results:\nDo you favor or oppose increasing tax rates only on families earning over $10 million a year? \n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavor: 70 percent\nOppose: 24 percent\nDon\u2019t know: 5 percent\nSo, that\u2019s 70 percent support for increasing tax rates on families earning over $10 million.\nBut the poll didn\u2019t ask about raising the top rate on those families to 70 percent \u2014 or any particular rate at all.\nSo, Moore is not accurately quoting the Fox News Poll.\nWhen we pointed that out to Moore\u2019s producer, the producer sent us a statement in which Moore says:\n\"Public polling overwhelmingly shows that the American people are in favor (of) raising taxes on the wealthy and on corporations, and we finally have more leaders in Washington who aren\u2019t afraid to advocate for it.\"\nSo, there is support for Moore\u2019s broader point. For example, a The Hill/HarrisX Daily Poll of registered voters, conducted about a week before the Fox News Poll, found 59 percent support\u00a0a 70 percent top tax rate.\nThe question and the results from that poll:\nCurrently the top tax rate is 37 percent. Would you favor or oppose a tax proposal that would apply a 70 percent rate to the 10 millionth dollar and beyond for individuals making $10 million a year or more in reportable income? \nStrongly favor: 29 percent\nSomewhat favor: 30 percent\nSomewhat oppose: 20 percent\nStrongly oppose: 21 percent\nOur ruling\nMoore said, \"Seventy percent of the American public agree with\" Ocasio-Cortez \"on having the top marginal (tax) rate for the rich\" at 70 percent, and \"that's a Fox News Poll saying that.\"\nA Fox News Poll found 70 percent of registered voters, not all Americans, support the general idea of raising income tax rates on families earning over $10 million.\u00a0But we don\u2019t know from the poll what percentage of Americans supports making the top tax rate 70 percent.\nSo Moore got the details wrong, but there is some support for his broader point about U.S. sentiments toward taxing wealthier Americans.\u00a0We rate Moore\u2019s statement Mostly False.\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2019-02-06 17:47:24 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"Seventy percent of the American public agree with\" Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \"on having the top marginal (tax) rate for the rich\" at 70 percent, and \"that's a Fox News Poll saying that.\"     Michael Moore Filmmaker and pundit https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/michael-moore-ocasio-cortez-is-the-democratic-leader-1436313155609   In an interview  Friday, February 1, 2019 2019-02-01    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01056"}
