The Congressional Race was in North Carolina's ninth province, where Republican Democratic Dan Bishop defeated Dan McCreedy in a special election on September 10. Trump's comments were received during a special event in New York on September 27. Trump told the crowd that Bishop was behind the race until he visited North Carolina and went rogue from the race. \"But the candidate, Dan Bishop, won a lot. He was 17 and they had a mile long lines. According to Trump, according to Bloomberg's version of the speech. This is at least the second time that Trump claims Bishop has dropped by 17 points. The first came on election night. Dan Bishop fell 17 points ago three weeks ago. Then he asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race. The big gathering last night. Now it looks like he's gonna win, \"He tweeted. Polyte Fact looked at the publicly available ballot, as well as the results of the race, to see whether Trump was right about his competitiveness. We couldn't find any public reconnaissance that showed Bishop was behind us by 17 points, or even by two numbers. We found that his description of the election results was exaggerated. What Paul reported was Five-Tine's location tracked down some of the polls in the county. No public survey has brought McCreedy up to 17. The most popular poll in his favor brought him up to five points, and the most favourable vote for a bishop made him up to four points. An opinion poll published three days before the election got McCreedy to three points. The policy ballot, known as the Pakistan People &apos; s Party, held a special vote for the residents of Region 9 about two weeks before the elections. This poll showed Bishop, as Tom Jensen said, the director of the company. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" By Paul Specett of February 1, 2021, Fox, a news source on the Internet, he conducted a similar examination of the facts and was unable to find a survey to support Trump's allegations as well. The ballot piece, which is close to supporting Trump's claim, was tweeted by Jim Blaine, Bishop's campaign adviser. An internal survey of the campaign showed that McCreedy rose 14 percentage points on Bishop. But that poll is a little out of the ordinary. Details - such as those who conducted the survey, who responded to the survey, and history - are not available to the public. Polyte Fakt Blaine and Samantha Cotton, a regional contact manager for the Trump campaign, contacted but did not receive a reply at the time of publication of this fact check on the Internet. The results of most experts considered the race to be a throwout, a surprise given the history of the province. \"while we thought that the Republicans were in a better position to win the NC-9 special election - and this may end - the latest data, and recent circumstances, suggest that the race is close enough that we should make it a throw with less than a week until the election on Tuesday,\" wrote Kyle Kondick, editor of Crystal Sabatu's ball, on 5 September. Trump won 12 points in the region in 2016. No democracy has won a congressional race since 1963, according to Charlotte's observer. This year did not happen either. Bishop McCready was defeated by 3,788 votes - 96,573 against 92,785. This is divided into 50.69 per cent of the votes for Bishop and 48.70 per cent of the votes for McCready, by 1.99 percentage points. Not exactly a blast. Trump said Bishop was a 17-point low in the national congressional race, and then he won \"a lot.\" No public survey was nearly in support of Tramp &apos; s claim, and the final margin was only two percentage points. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00076"}
