Mueller relied heavily on his earlier report in describing the two-year investigation, which left some elements open for interpretation. President Donald Trump was quick to present his own analysis, tweeting after the 29 May 2019 press conference, \"Nothing changes from Muller's report. There was insufficient evidence, and the person is therefore innocent in our country. The case is closed! Thank you.\" Mark Buchanan, a Democrat in Wisconsin, objected to this description. \"The President's claim that there was insufficient evidence, and therefore the person is innocent in our country. The case is closed! 'It is not true and is directly inconsistent with what Special Adviser Mueller said earlier today, Buchanan tweeted. Did Buchanan, who called for Trump's isolation, rightly contradict Mueller's comments? This is dark water, but let's dive in. The essence of Trump's tweet - and thus Bokan's claim about it - is to refer to \"insufficiency of evidence.\" Nothing changes from Mueller's report. There was insufficient evidence, and the person is therefore innocent in our country. The case is closed! Donald Trump. What did Muller say about that? \"The first volume of the report details many of the efforts that emerged from Russia to influence the elections,\" Mueller said, a reading of the remarks at the Ministry of Justice news conference. \"This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign's response to this activity, as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.\" M\u00f8ller therefore made a vague reference to the \"insufficiency of evidence\" of a conspiracy concerning Russian intervention. At the same time, Trump's tweet has a more specific and far-reaching meaning - that there was no evidence that Trump himself had committed any crime. Mueller didn't say anything like that. On February 8, 2021, Greg Kelly reported on the newsmax section \"Only one person died that day\" during the January 6 US riots. \u2022 On February 9, 2012, Muller addressed a possible explanation such as Trump in his comments. \"After that investigation, if we had confidence that the President clearly didn't commit a crime, we would have said so,\" said Muller. \"Anyway, we didn't determine whether the president committed a crime.\" In addition, Mueller said that his office had failed to assess whether Trump had committed a crime - because he could not bring any such charges against the current President in any case. \"In the framework of the old Ministry's policy, the President cannot be charged with a federal crime while in office. This is unconstitutional, \"Mueller said. \"Dealing with the president with a crime wasn't an option we could consider.\" It would be unfair for someone to be charged with a crime when there can be no court decision on the actual charge. Insulation was the only way to address that issue. \"The opinion (Ministry of Justice) says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally charge the current president for misconduct,\" Mueller said. \"These are the principles under which we work. From them, we have concluded that we will not reach a decision in one way or another as to whether the President has committed a crime.\" Ron Bohmer, the spokesman for Buchanan, said that the tweeting of Congressman refers to this restriction. \"Special Adviser Mueller did not refer to insufficient evidence, but rather limited the ability to charge the President and made it very clear that he could not be exonerated,\" Bhuhar said in an e-mail. Therefore, Buchanan's claim of \"direct contradiction\" is not entirely cut and dried. Trump used the same term as Mueller. However, it is clear that Trump exceeded his limit in his summary of Muller's comments, claiming a level of proof that Muller did not present. The Governor Bocan said that we have Trump's response to Muller - that there is \"insufficiently evidence\" and therefore Trump is innocent - is \"in direct contradiction\" to what Muller said. Mueller used the term \"insufficiency of evidence,\" but this was in general reference to evidence of a widespread conspiracy involving interference in the Russian elections. Trump's tweet is a comment on his guilt or innocence. In fact, Muller was very clear that he couldn't charge a sitting president with a crime, so he couldn't, out of fairness, charge him with one. Mueller was keen to note, \"If we had confidence that the President clearly didn't commit a crime, we would have said so.\" Our definition of \"mostly true\" is a precise phrase but needs clarification or additional information. That fits me right here. Sharing the facts 2019-05-30 19:36:44 UTC PoliticsFact 5 1 7 PoliticFact Dacting: Most of them true. Donald Trump's claim that \"there was insufficient evidence and therefore the person is innocent in our country\" is directly inconsistent with Special Adviser Robert Mueller's statement.
