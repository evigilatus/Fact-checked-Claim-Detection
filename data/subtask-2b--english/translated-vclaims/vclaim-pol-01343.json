In October 3, Sen Joe Manshin, D-W.Va., tweeted, \"#WV has the highest per capita overdose rate in any country in our nation. For this reason, I have ensured that the Patient and Community Support Act includes a allocation to States such as WV. This language has more than tripled the amount of funding that comes to our mandate for next year.\" # WV has the highest per capita overdose rate in any country in our nation. For this reason, I have ensured that the Patient and Community Support Act includes a allocation to States such as WV. This language has more than tripled the amount of funding provided to our mandate for next year. We will focus on whether West Virginia \"has the highest per capita overdose rate in any country in our nation.\" We have moved on to the analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compiled and analysed by the Kaiser Foundation for the Family. Data from 2016. The Manchen tweet was not specific as to whether it referred to a specific overdose of opiates or an overdose in general. An analysis of the Kaiser Family Foundation includes data for both categories, so we looked into both categories. On January 31, 2021, Ryan Fornier reported on Twitter \"Biden's administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\" 1. This is the graph showing data specifically on overdoses of opium. The data examine the number of overdoses per 100,000 population, a measure equal to per capita. An overdose rate of opiates in West Virginia is easily superior to the second degree state, New Hampshire. As for the overall overdose, West Virginia ends first, with Ohio ranked second. The governor said West Virginia has the highest per capita overdose in any state in our nation. Official government data show that West Virginia ranks first per capita in both the specific overdoses of opiates and, more generally, the overdoses. We're evaluating the statement right.
