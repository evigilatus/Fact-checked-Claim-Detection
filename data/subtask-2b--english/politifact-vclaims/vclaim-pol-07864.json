Republicans decry the initial characterization of events from U.N. ambassador Susan Rice as deliberately misleading. Democrats argue the attack against the vulnerable Benghazi complex should not be a surprise after GOP-driven cuts in embassy security funding.\nRonan Farrow, who worked as director of global youth issues under former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and is the son of actress and activist Mia Farrow, highlighted embassy security issues in a 2013 story for The Atlantic, mentioning Clinton\u2019s warnings in 2011 that a lack of funding\u00a0would hurt national security.\nFarrow reiterated these concerns in a May 5, 2014, segment on his MSNBC show, Ronan Farrow Daily, amid news of another House-driven Benghazi investigation spurred by a recently revealed White House adviser\u2019s email with talking points for Rice.\nOn his show, Farrow asked Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., if House Republicans \"erred\" in 2011 when they \"cut $128 million from the administration\u2019s request for embassy security funding, that really laid the foundation.\" Later, Farrow said both parties are at fault because \"in 2010, Democrats cut $142 million from those security requests.\"\n\"So this is really a back and forth, and it actually seems like, in my view, if you look at the history, both Democrats and Republicans are guilty of this, passing the buck,\" he said. \"It\u2019s easy to gain political plaudits by saying \u2018spend less around the world,\u2019 and then it leads up to these tragedies.\"\nThe connection Farrow's drawing is clear enough: Congressional budget cuts, made by Democrats and Republicans,\u00a0contributed to the security failures at the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi. But as we'll show you, security funding has been increased in recent years and State Department officials say budget requests did not factor into the\u00a0violent attack on Sept. 11, 2012.\u00a0(Some of this ground was covered by the Washington Post Fact-Checker.)\nThe \"cuts\" aren't cuts\nThe first thing to know is the cuts over recent years aren\u2019t really cuts (i.e. taking money away from embassy security funding). Instead, Congress declined to provide the full amount requested by President Barack Obama.\u00a0\nReally, this practice goes\u00a0farther back. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service says the department\u2019s base requests have not been fully funded since 2008 (in 2009, the department\u2019s base request was not met but it got more money in supplemental funds).\nSo what\u2019s the deal?\nWe struggled to verify some of Farrow\u2019s numbers, as there are many money pots that support embassy facility security and officer positions. Straight-up budget numbers are a little hard to figure out because of Congress\u2019 affinity for budget strategies like \"continuing resolutions\" and sequestration. We got the following figures from the Congressional Research Service (page 23 of this 2013 PDF) and chose to look at total security spending, which includes supplemental and overseas contingency funds primarily\u00a0for missions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nState Department Funds for Embassy and Diplomatic Security (total security spending, plus supplemental and overseas contingency operations funds)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nRequest\n(in millions)\n\n\nEnacted\n\n\nDifference\n\n\n\n\nFY 2008\n\n\n$2,138.7\n\n\n$2,127.7\n\n\n-$11.6\n\n\n\n\nFY 2009\n\n\n$3,404\n\n\n$3,519.5\n\n\n$115.5\n\n\n\n\nFY 2010\n\n\n$3,562.6\n\n\n$3,420.8\n\n\n-$141.8\n\n\n\n\nFY 2011\n\n\n$2,761.3\n\n\n$2,576.6\n\n\n-$184.7\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFY 2012\n\n\n$4,395.5\n\n\n$4,076.2\n\n\n-$319.3\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhichever numbers you use, they tell a similar story: Congress did not fully fund the administration\u2019s diplomatic security requests for several years. That's\u00a0not unusual, said John Norris, director of the Sustainable Security and Peacebuilding Initiative\u00a0at the liberal Center for American Progress. The difference between what the president wanted and what Congress appropriated is not akin to a budget cut as much as it is part of the push-and-pull of the budget process.\n\"It\u2019s rare for Congress to fully appropriate what\u2019s requested, or what is most often the case is some areas will be fully funded, some will be dramatically underfunded,\" Norris said. \"Some will send back more money than what they requested reflecting whatever priorities are in Congress.\"\nWhat's even more important for this fact-check is embassy security\u00a0spending grew tremendously post 9/11.\nFrom 1998 to 2012, the embassy security budget rose by more than 1,000\u00a0percent from $200 million to $2.6 billion, Norris said, and the infusion of money means that there are four security personnel for every diplomat.\u00a0Base security funds, which represent a chunk of the total spending represented in the chart above, increased by 32 percent from fiscal year 2008 to 2012, according to CRS.\n\"If you look at the numbers in what we\u2019re spending, it\u2019s really hard to make the case that (budget constraints) is kind of the root cause of it,\" Norris said.\nMoney ties to the Benghazi facility\nAs for Benghazi, funding decisions by Congress don't appear to be a major factor in the 2012 attack. Investigations have faulted State Department management decisions for security breakdowns more than insufficient funding.\nThe State Department made some upgrades to the facility, such as increasing the height of perimeter walls, but the outpost in Benghazi was designated as a temporary facility. It did not have to meet State Department\u00a0security standards of other full-time offices, and\u00a0it was ineligible for some security upgrade money.\nThe facility did receive\u00a0financial and other support for security repairs from diplomatic outposts in the Libyan capital of Tripoli and Egypt, But officials on the ground in Benghazi struggled to get additional security\u00a0upgrades because they didn\u2019t have cash reserves and had to rely on the embassy in\u00a0Tripoli to pass along requests.\nThere have been many inquiries into the situation in Benghazi, some of which we will touch on in this fact-check. One by the Senate Homeland Security Committee points out neither the State Department nor Congress sought extra money for Libya or Benghazi in a supplemental request, even as officials in Libya asked for a more sizable officer presence.\nFarrow quoted a portion of the 2012 report\u00a0by the Accountability Review Board, a group\u00a0led by former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering to examine the security picture at the special mission.\u00a0The security was \"inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place,\" the report states.\nBut was that Congress' fault?\nThe report said\u00a0Congress \"must do its part\" to address security risks and meet mission imperatives and suggested\u00a0the State Department get more flexibility for building money so temporary facilities in dangerous situations can get more advanced security upgrades.\nBut it primarily faulted \"systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies,\" and not unfulfilled budget requests.\nAnother finding: The embassy in Tripoli was not an effective advocate in pressing Washington to provide more security for the Benghazi compound, which included a\u00a0CIA annex.\u00a0Senate committee investigations also\u00a0cite unanswered cables\u00a0for more temporary officers from Libyan Ambassador Christopher Stevens\u00a0to the State Department. \u00a0\nState Department officials, meanwhile have said publicly that\u00a0budgets were not a factor.\nDuring a House hearing into the attack on\u00a0Oct. 10, 2012, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher asked deputy assistant secretary of state Charlene Lamb:\u00a0\"Was there any budget consideration and lack of budget which led you not to increase the number of people in the security force there?\"\n\"No, sir,\" Lamb said.\nLater, Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, asked, \"So there\u2019s not a budget problem. It\u2019s not you all don\u2019t have the money to do this?\"\n\"Sir, it\u2019s a volatile situation. We will move assets to cover that,\" Lamb said.\nMore of the same on May 8, 2013. Responding to a Democratic member who pointed to embassy security spending in recent GOP House budgets, committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., prodded Eric Nordstrom, former regional security officer in Libya, about Lamb\u2019s previous testimony.\nIssa said, \"Mr. Nordstrom, you were on that panel. Do you remember what she (Lamb) said?\"\n\"Yes, she said that resources was not an issue,\" Nordstrom said. \"And I think I would also point to the (Accountability Review Board) report, if I'm not mistaken, that they talked to our chief financial officer with (Diplomatic Security), who also said that resources were not an issue.\"\nFarrow's executive producer Kathy O\u2019Hearn\u00a0defended his characterization of the situation.\u00a0\n\"In every segment, we have been diligent in making mention ... that this is not simply a question of resources, but one of how existing resources can be used,\" O'Hearn said. \"We feel strongly that our reporting has been judicious and thorough.\"\nYet Farrow's interview with Schiff certainly lingers on the question of whether there were enough resources and the role of Congress. He first says that some Republicans are \"strident\" that resources were not an issue, then pivoted to\u00a0Clinton\u2019s 2011 warnings that not agreeing to the White House's proposed budget\u00a0would hurt national security. After that,\u00a0Farrow brought\u00a0up specific budget decisions by members of Congress. Only after that\u00a0did he note that some standard building\u00a0funds available to the State Department were not able to be used in Benghazi.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nFarrow pointed to \"cuts\" by Democrats and Republicans in Congress in recent years from what the Obama administration requested in embassy security funding and tied it to Benghazi, saying, \"It\u2019s easy to gain political plaudits by saying \u2018spend less around the world,\u2019 and then it leads up to these tragedies.\"\nIt's true that\u00a0Congress did not fully fund embassy security requests from the Obama administration in recent years, which is what Farrow argues amounts to a \"cut.\" But funding for embassy security is up from 2008, and up dramatically since before 9/11.\nHow does this tie into the Benghazi attack? State Department officials and government experts lay more blame on decisions by upper management not to provide the temporary Benghazi facility with more officers and better protections than the availability of money.\nFarrow made that very point in his segment, which makes it odd that he led his segment by tying the attack with insufficient congressional funding.\nWe rate his claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07864"}
