Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, meanwhile, hold Virginia\u2019s two U.S. Senate seats.\nIf you\u2019re a political junkie, stop here for a minute. Try to figure out the last full year - before 2014 - that Democrats had such a lock.\nNow, let\u2019s go back in time together.\nFrom 2010 through 2013, Gov. Bob McDonnell, Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling and Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli - all of them Republicans - held the state\u2019s top three positions. Actually, the GOP had at least one of those three offices every year since the early 1990s, when Democrats held them all under Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, Lt. Gov. Don Beyer and Attorney General Mary Sue Terry.\nBut even with no Republicans holding an executive post in state government, the GOP back then had John Warner, who served in the U.S. Senate from 1979 until 2009.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to go back to 1969 to find the last full year when Democrats held all five statewide posts. That year, Gov. Mills Godwin, Lt. Gov. Fred Pollard and Attorney General Robert Button were in office along with U.S. Sens. Harry F. Byrd Jr. and William B. Spong Jr.\nLater that year, Linwood Holton became the first Republican elected governor in Virginia. He was inaugurated Jan. 17, 1970. Byrd and Godwin, like many Southerners, abandoned the Democratic Party in the early 1970s as it moved to the left. Byrd became an independent in 1971 and, two years later, Godwin was re-elected governor as a Republican.\nWhy is the GOP now frozen out of statewide seats? \u00a0A key reason is demographics, said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.\nMuch of Virginia\u2019s population growth in recent decades has been in urban and suburban areas that tend to vote Democratic, such as Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads and greater Richmond, as well as in university towns, Sabato said.\n\"This really started in the 1960s, in a big way,\" he said.\nVoters in rural parts of the state remain receptive to socially conservative ideas that Republicans embrace, but \"that\u2019s not where the people are,\" Sabato said.\nOur ruling\nGillespie said this is the first time in more than 40 years that a Republican doesn\u2019t hold a single statewide office.\nActually, you have to go back almost 47 years to find the last time the GOP didn\u2019t hold at least one statewide seat.\nWe rate Gillespie\u2019s claim True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/91c7a5d7-7b70-4e32-907d-2e45b471f42b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04974"}
