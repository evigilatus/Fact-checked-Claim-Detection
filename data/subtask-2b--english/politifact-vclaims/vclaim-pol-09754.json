Currently, the nation\u2019s capital has only a non-voting delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives and no U.S. senators. The issue has been such a frustration that D.C. license plates feature the protest motto, \"Taxation Without Representation.\"\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that we noticed a Facebook post recently. Here\u2019s the text:\n\n\"Washington, D.C., now has:\n\"Greater population than Wyoming & Vermont\n\"More active duty military than 29 states\n\"More tax revenue than 29 states\n\"A larger domestic product than 27 states\n\"But no vote on the floor of the House OR the Senate?\n\"What\u2019s up with that?\"\n\nWe wondered how accurate the post\u2019s claims were, so we took a look. We\u2019ll take them in order.\n\n\u2022 Greater population than Wyoming and Vermont\n\nThis one\u2019s true, as long as you use 2012 population estimates rather than the last full Census count in 2010. (D.C.\u2019s population grew quickly within that two-year span.) In 2012, the district was estimated to have 632,323 residents, putting it ahead of Vermont at 626,011 and Wyoming at 576,412, but no other state.\n\n\u2022 More active duty military than 29 states\n\nThe most recent data we found was for 2009, and it shows that the Facebook post actually underestimated the nation\u2019s capital. There are 31 states that had fewer active duty military personnel than D.C. (This may not be too surprising, given that the Pentagon is just across the river in Virginia.)\n\n \u2022 More tax revenue than 29 states\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau ranks all 50 states by tax revenue collected, but it doesn\u2019t include D.C. However, we were able to find the D.C. data separately, in a D.C. government document.\n\nMeshing the data together, we found that D.C. total tax revenue for fiscal year 2011 was higher than 14 states, not 29 states. So this claim is incorrect.\n\n\u2022 A larger gross domestic product than 27 states\n\nData from the U.S. Commerce Department shows that for fiscal year 2011, the district only outranked 17 states with a smaller gross domestic product than D.C. So this statistic is off the mark as well.\n\nOur ruling\n\nWe found that the Facebook post was accurate in describing D.C.\u2019s ranking in population and active-duty military personnel, but significantly off in describing tax revenues and gross domestic product. That said, D.C.\u2019s actual rankings -- higher than 14 states in tax revenues and higher than 17 states in gross domestic product -- do support the post\u2019s underlying point that many smaller states have congressional representation when D.C. does not. On balance, we rate the post Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.
