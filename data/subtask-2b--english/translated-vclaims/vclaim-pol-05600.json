In the democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire, Sanders continued to express support for the one-time and popular health-care system in most parts of the world. To illustrate, Sanders compared the costs of health care between the United States and two other Western countries - the United Kingdom and France. \"Why spend nearly three times as much per capita as they spend in the United Kingdom -- 50 per cent more than they pay in France?\" Saunders asked. The insurance companies, the pharmaceutical companies, are bribing the U.S. Congress. We need to pass the medical care system for every single motive.\" The numbers of Sanders are largely stopped and healthy. OECD has data for all three States. The following table is disabled. The United States of America France (per capita) total US$ 3,234,713.8 of outstanding fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Act - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" Source: OECD calculates, with US spending totalling approximately 2.7 times that of the United Kingdom per capita and slightly more than twice that of France per capita. Everything is measured in dollars, and data from 2013. It is interesting to note the role of public spending in each country. In the United States, public and private spending are almost identical. In the United Kingdom and France, private spending constitutes a much smaller segment of the total. In this case, Sanders &apos; claim is more accurate than his more comprehensive accounts in the past. In 2009 and again in 2015, he claimed that the United States spent twice as much on health care as any other country. These claims are too broad. Our rule, Sanders, said that the United States spends almost three times on health care per capita in the United Kingdom and almost twice as much in France. Figures from a reliable independent source support this. We're assessing this statement right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0780cbed-5c25-4675-9ab5-b140caaf3e95", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05600"}
