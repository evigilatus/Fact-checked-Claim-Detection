Trump rushed in reinforcements, threatened to destroy Iran, & made sure no lives were lost in Baghdad. That\u2019s the difference between a traitor & a leader.\"\nThe post is wrong in its assertions about Clinton, who was secretary of state during the attack in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. The only element of truth in this comparison is that Trump did rush in military reinforcements.\nClinton and Benghazi\nThe Benghazi attacks killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s true that the State Department did not honor requests for more security prior to the attacks, but there was no evidence that Clinton was made aware of those requests.\u00a0\nAs for Clinton\u2019s response, none of the many congressional investigations about the attacks asserted (as Trump did) that she was inattentive throughout the hours in which the attacks occurred.\nMoreover, it was not Clinton\u2019s responsibility to send troops to the scene \u2014 the military chain of command took that responsibility. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred.\u00a0\nSeveral investigations found that no action by Clinton, or anybody in the administration, could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump and Baghdad\nThe terrorist attacks were much more violent than the storming of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.\nAs Time magazine reported, protesters broke into the U.S. Embassy compound shouting \"Death to America!\" and \"Death to Israel!\" and smashed through a main door, set a reception area on fire, and covered the embassy wall with militia flags and anti-U.S. graffiti.\u00a0\nThe same day, Dec. 31, U.S. marines deployed to Iraq. The next day, Trump deployed more troops to the Middle East.\u00a0\nTrump blamed Iran for the attack and issued a threat.\n\"Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,\" Trump tweeted on Dec. 31: \"They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy new year!\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post attacked Clinton, claiming: \"Hillary ignored multiple requests for security, didn\u2019t respond for 13 hours, & let 4 Americans die in Benghazi. Trump rushed in reinforcements, threatened to destroy Iran, & made sure no lives were lost in Baghdad.\"\nThere was no evidence that Clinton ignored requests for more security before the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed in attacks in Benghazi in 2012. It was the military\u2019s responsibility, not Clinton\u2019s, to respond; and several investigations concluded that no one in the administration could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths.\nMeanwhile, in a much different situation, Trump did rush military reinforcements after the storming of the U.S. embassy in Iraq. He threatened to hold Iran responsible, but did not threaten its destruction.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17523"}
