(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe claim\u2019s source is a report out of Germany based on online submissions of childrens\u2019 reactions to wearing masks. In the span of one week in October 2020, about 20,000 people had entered data on nearly 26,000 children.\nThe tally is unsettling:\n\"Impairments caused by wearing the mask were reported by 68% of the parents. These included irritability (60%), headache (53%), difficulty concentrating (50%), less happiness (49%), reluctance to go to school/kindergarten (44%), malaise (42%) impaired learning (38%) and drowsiness or fatigue (37%).\"\nNow, let\u2019s look at why that doesn\u2019t mean nearly as much as it might seem at first blush. (Hat tip to Health Feedback for their work on this.)\nFirst, while the number of respondents is high, that says nothing about whether they are representative of the German population. Participation was based solely on personal preference. There\u2019s evidence to suggest the group was heavily skewed toward people who were mask skeptics.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe German research paper said that about 42% of respondents thought the German government had gone too far in its efforts to stop the spread of COVID, and another 31% said the policies were inappropriate or incomprehensible.\nBut a random poll in August found that only 10% of the German public thought the government\u2019s rules were over the top. A large majority \u2014 77% \u2014 said stricter controls were needed.\nThe other key flaw in the post is that it assumes all of the negative results \u2014 which themselves are subject to interpretation \u2014 were caused by the wearing of masks. There was no effort to standardize the description of the kids\u2019 reactions, and no control group.\nSome of the children might have always been reluctant to go to kindergarten. Some of them might always have had trouble concentrating.\nWithout standards on capturing data on how the children reacted, and without a matched group of children who didn\u2019t wear masks, there\u2019s no way to say that the masks caused the children\u2019s reactions.\nThe result is a jumble of numbers, not valid data.\nThis Instagram post recycled a claim made in early January. The fact-checkers at Health Feedback debunked that one a few days later.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19246"}
