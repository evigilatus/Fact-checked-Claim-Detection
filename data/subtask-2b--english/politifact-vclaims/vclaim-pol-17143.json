(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nSearching for the quote online, we couldn\u2019t find any credible, corroborating sources.\u00a0\nBut we did find elements of the Facebook post in public remarks Rice has made in the past.\u00a0\nPart of the quote seems to come from a 2012 speech Rice gave at a fundraiser for a congressional candidate in Utah.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rice said that what concerns here most is that the \u2018essence of who we are and we believe is actually changing,\u2019\" the Salt Lake Tribune reported at the time.\u00a0\n\"America has never had a narrative of grievance. We\u2019ve never believed \u2018I am doing poorly because you\u2019re doing well,\" the paper quoted Rice as saying. \"The moment we begin to believe that we are doing badly because someone else is doing well, that moment that aggrievement takes over, it\u2019s not long before his twin brother comes behind, and that would be entitlement.\"\u00a0\nEarlier that year, during the Republican National Convention, she said something similar: \"My fellow Americans, ours has never been a narrative of grievance and entitlement. We have never believed that I am doing poorly because you are doing well. We have never been jealous of one another and never envious of each other\u2019s successes. No, no, ours has been a belief of opportunity. And it has been a constant struggle, long and hard, up and down, to try to extend the benefits of the American dream to all.\"\nThough the Facebook post could be read to mean that Rice said this describing the Democratic Party, that does not appear to be the case at either of these two events. However, it is clear that she is advocating for Republican candidates in both speeches.\u00a0\nAs for other elements of the quote in the Facebook post, we couldn\u2019t find evidence that Rice made those statements. If such evidence emerges, we\u2019ll update this fact-check accordingly.\u00a0\nIn the meantime, while this Facebook post does pull from statements Rice has made, this doesn\u2019t appear to be a direct quote from Rice, or a shot at the Democratic Party.\u00a0\nWe rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17143"}
