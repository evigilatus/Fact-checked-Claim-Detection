But, even as she celebrated her victory, Hassan was asked to address the matter one more time last week, this time before a national audience.\n\nInterviewing Hassan the morning after the election on\u00a0MSNBC\u2019s Daily Rundown, anchor Chuck Todd asked the newly elected governor about the prospects of a broad-based tax.\n\n\"I served in the state Senate for six years with retiring Gov. John Lynch. During that time, we had the fourth lowest unemployment rate in the country,\" Hassan told Todd during the\u00a0November 7 interview. \"Our economy works really well without an income or a sales tax.\"\n\nThroughout campaign season and beyond, candidates commonly refer to New Hampshire\u2019s unemployment rate as one of the country\u2019s lowest. But, was it really fourth best in the country during Hassan\u2019s time in office? We decided to check the books.\n\nFederal counts show that the numbers fluctuated slightly during Hassan\u2019s time in the Senate. She she served three terms between 2004-10 before running for governor this year. Amid the changes, New Hampshire\u2019s rate remained among the lowest.\n\nHere\u2019s a year-by-year review.\n\n2005: 3.6 percent unemployment, tied with Montana for fourth lowest.\n2006: 3.5 percent, tied with Alabama, Delaware for seventh lowest.\n2007: 3.5 percent, tied with Delaware, New Mexico for eighth lowest.\n2008: 3.9 percent, sixth lowest\n2009: 6.2 percent, tied with Iowa for fifth lowest\n2010: 6.1 percent, fourth lowest\n\n(As a side note, New Hampshire retained its spot as the fourth-lowest unemployment rate, 5.4 percent, in\u00a02011, the year after Hassan left office.)\n\nSo, the numbers show Hassan\u2019s claim to be in the ballpark. The state\u2019s unemployment rate ranked fourth lowest in both her first year in office and her last, and even when it rose, it remained among the country\u2019s lowest.\n\nBut, Hassan cited the state\u2019s unemployment rate as evidence the state doesn\u2019t need an income or sales tax. For purposes of this check, we wanted to look at the connection between taxes and unemployment rates to see if there\u2019s a link as Hassan suggests.\n\nAnalysts say there\u2019s no direct correlation.\n\nAcross the country, tax policy may contribute to a strong jobs environment, but a variety of other, more local factors likely weigh heavier in determining the unemployment rate, according to Scott Drenkard, an economist with the business-backed Tax Foundation.\n\n\"New Hampshire fits with the pattern of having low unemployment and having a good tax system, but there are lots of contributing factors,\" Drenkard said. \"I can't say there's a very robust correlation (with the tax structure).\"\n\nAmong the other states that rank among the lowest unemployment rates, for instance, Idaho, Vermont and Virginia all have both income and sales taxes. Hawaii, which had the nation\u2019s lowest unemployment rate, had the nation\u2019s highest income tax rate in 2005 and 2006, Hassan\u2019s first two years in office, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nIn New Hampshire, factors such as the state\u2019s small population, its lack of big population centers and its demographics -- older and educated -- contribute heavily to its strong employment, according to Dennis Delay, an economist with the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies.\n\n\"For an older population, they're more likely to have jobs and hold on to jobs than the younger population is,\" Delay said.\n\nFurther, New Hampshire features strong manufacturing and health care sectors, among others, that keep employment strong, even in economic downturns, said Annette Nielsen, an economist for the state Employment Security office.\n\n\"It\u2019s a whole mix of things. We have fairly strong high-tech manufacturing, and that combined with not a huge population, it doesn\u2019t take a whole lot to create (good employment numbers),\" Nielsen said.\n\nPut more succinctly, \"There\u2019s no real connection between unemployment and tax structure,\" said Jon Shure, director of state fiscal strategies at the national Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. \"The key thing to creating jobs in any state is to make sure that you're investing in infrastructure, transportation, health care, all the components of a strong economy. \u2026 It\u2019s not necessarily taxes.\"\n\n\nOur ruling:\n\nNew Hampshire\u2019s unemployment rate fluctuated a little through Hassan\u2019s tenure. But, even as it reached No. 7 among states in 2006 and No. 8 in 2007, New Hampshire\u2019s rate remained among the country\u2019s lowest. And, by the time Hassan left office in 2010, New Hampshire\u2019s rate had returned to fourth, where it stood in her first year.\n\nWe\u2019ll give the new governor credit for getting her numbers right (mostly). But, her stated connection between the unemployment rate and New Hampshire\u2019s tax structure doesn\u2019t hold up. Analysts in New Hampshire and around the country suggest that other factors -- \u00a0including states\u2019 size, demographics and work base -- drive unemployment more than taxes.\n\nWe rate this claim Half True.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09995"}
