In 2015, Donald Trump tweeted that Hillary Clinton started the movement in 2008, adding \"She was all in!\"\nWe rated this statement False, because there was no link to the movement and Clinton.\nPriebus falls halfway into the same hole, but added that her supporters also started the myth. We wanted to revisit the claim in a broader context.\nIt started with an email\nIn a previous fact-check, we found no evidence that Clinton or her official campaign had any direct link to starting the birther movement.\nFactcheck.org confirmed this, too. They reported that no journalist who explored this theory found a connection to anyone in the Clinton camp.\nClinton even denied the accusation when CNN\u2019s Don Lemon asked if she started the rumor Obama was not born in America.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n By Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is \u2013 no. That is so ludicrous, Don. You know, honestly, I just believe that, first of all, it\u2019s totally untrue, and secondly, you know, the president and I have never had any kind of confrontation like that,\" Clinton said.\nSo the first part of Priebus\u2019 statement is inaccurate. However, Priebus has a point about Clinton supporters starting the movement.\nDuring a somewhat close primary race between Obama and Clinton,\u00a0it was reported that Clinton supporters sent out anonymous emails questioning\u00a0if Obama was actually born in Hawaii.\nThis was originally reported by Politico and the Telegraph. In addition, John Avalon, editor-in-chief of the the Daily Beast, wrote in his book, Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America, that Clinton volunteer Linda Starr played a key role in spreading the tale.\nStarr, who served as a delegate in the Texas state convention, volunteered for the Clinton campaign during the Texas primary, according to Avalon.\nStarr teamed up with a Pennsylvania lawyer Philip Berg, and Berg went to federal court, suing to block Obama\u2019s nomination. That suit was thrown out multiple times, according to our article from 2015.\nOn June 7, 2008, Hillary Clinton suspended her campaign, and urged her supporters to rally behind Obama.\nOur ruling \nPriebus said Clinton\u2019s campaign and her supporters started the birther movement. Half of this claim is true.\nIt has been reported by several news outlets that Clinton supporters sent emails accusing Obama of being born outside the United States. However, there is no evidence that Clinton or her official campaign had anything to do with it.\nOn balance, we rate Priebus\u2019 claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3b1f7651-2206-4984-bf4f-534f5448ffd6", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04402"}
