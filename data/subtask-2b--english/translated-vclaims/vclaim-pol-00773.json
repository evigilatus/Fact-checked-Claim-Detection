They don't.", "text": "The plans to establish a squadron of the next generation of fighter planes in Borlington were met with strong resistance among some voters, who last year approved decisions in three cities to de-position. However, F-35 aircraft are scheduled to arrive from September. One of the organizations leading the resistance, the Centre for Peace and Justice, has shifted its focus in recent months to the possibility that jet aircraft in Berlin might be equipped with nuclear bombs. Rachel Siegel, Executive Director of the group, e-mailed this week entitled \"A warning for action: stop the nuclear detonators coming to Vermont!\" \"F-35 detonators, scheduled to reach Burlington this fall, were assigned with a nuclear mission,\" written. This is new information and makes Vermont a target for all other nuclear-processed states. When we considered this issue in June 2018, no F-35 companies were given a nuclear mission, and information on whether it was possible one day to commission such a mission to Borlington was insufficient. But it wasn't a decision to be made within months. Did something change? We asked Siegel what she was referring to. \"I misspoke/I got it wrong\" answered. \"The F-35 weapons system has a nuclear mission, but each individual aircraft has not yet been updated to have a nuclear capability.\" The upgrading will require software improvements and retroactive adjustment. Last year, the Vermont National Guard said that the army did not discuss, as a matter of policy, where nuclear weapons existed. Captain. On Tuesday, Mikkel Arkovic, spokesman for the Guard, said that F-35 aircraft were subject to change over time as required. \"The planes coming to Berlington will not be nuclearly capable.\" \"There are no plans to add devices to make the F-35s wing 158 capable of producing nuclear power.\" So there are no plans, but the guard says that plans can change. We contacted retired Colonel Rosan Greco, who was at the forefront of the battle against the F35 in Vermont, and he spent part of her career. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, she admitted that Siegel's message could easily be misread, but it was accurate if the parts were dismantled. F35s coming to Berlington. The F-35s have a nuclear mission (right). Greco cited the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review of the United States Department of Defense, which contains numerous references to F-35 as part of the country &apos; s nuclear deterrence strategy. \"The modernization of dual-capable combat bombers with the next generation of F-35 fighter aircraft will maintain the strength of NATO's position on deterrence and maintain our capability to deploy nuclear weapons, if the security situation so requires,\" then Secretary of Defense Jim Matisse wrote in the introduction to the report. \"The United States integrates nuclear capability into F-35 that is forward deployable and capable of nuclear proliferation as an alternative to the current old DCA aircraft (a dual-capable aircraft), says the report. According to the Union News site in November, Lockheed Martin won a $83.1 million prize from the Air Force for the development and testing of F-35A nuclear power equipment. Greco doesn't argue that the bombers heading for Perlington will be nuclearly capable when they arrive. But a fleet of F35s headed for European allies will be. One of the weapons experts told VTDiger last year that \"a comprehensive review process\" would be undertaken before the Ministry of Defence to make F-35 the leaking nuclear power. Greco said, \"The people who come here will not have the ability now,\" but most people know how the military works with certainty that at some point they will be upgraded to nuclear power, and when they are, we will not.\" Even if the F-35s based in Berlington are equipped with nuclear power, that doesn't mean that the bombs will be in Vermont -- there might be a pickup point somewhere else. Even if the bombs are stored in Vermont, that information is highly classified. \"Either F-35s will be assigned a nuclear mission is probably something no one will ever know,\" said Greco. Our judgment will be drafted in a confusing manner at best, but it is certainly misleading. The readers believe that the bombers coming to Vermont will be equipped to carry nuclear bombs. That's wrong. However, it is true that the Ministry of Defence intends to use F-35s to deliver its nuclear arsenal if necessary. There is good reason to believe that the bombers in Berlin could one day be given a nuclear mission. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00773"}
