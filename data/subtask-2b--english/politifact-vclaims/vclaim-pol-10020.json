Batchelder, up for re-election Nov. 6, 2012, recently sought the support of The Plain Dealer\u2019s editorial board. \n\nDuring an endorsement interview on Sept. 18, 2012, the subject turned to healthcare in Ohio and the Medina Republican, among other things, noted the state\u2019s impressive network of children\u2019s hospitals was worth bragging about. \n\nFor example, Ohio is the only state with a \"flagship, world-class children\u2019s hospital within two hours of every child living in the state,\" according to the Ohio Children\u2019s Hospital Association. \n\nDuring the interview, Batchelder noted that \"We (Ohio) have more hospitals that are children\u2019s hospitals than any other state in the union.\" \n\nThat got Politifact Ohio\u2019s attention. \n\nThe Buckeye State is large, but not as populous as, say, California, New York or Texas. So, could it really have more children\u2019s hospitals than any other state? \n\nPolitiFact Ohio asked Batchelder\u2019s office where the speaker got this information. The speaker\u2019s spokeswoman, Shannon Boston, directed us back to the website of the Ohio Children\u2019s Hospitals\u2019 Solutions for Patient Safety, a non-profit organization that works to align the vision of all of Ohio\u2019s children\u2019s hospitals. \n\nAnd how many hospitals does it list? Eight. \n\nBoston contends that Ohio is tied with Texas and California, which also each have eight children\u2019s hospitals according to organizations in those states similar to the Ohio Children\u2019s Hospital Association \u2014 the California Children\u2019s Hospital Association and the Children\u2019s Hospital Association of Texas. \u00a0\n\nBut a closer look found that the hospitals listed on those websites to which we were directed for hospitals in California and Texas only represent a portion of all children\u2019s hospitals in those states. These state hospital associations are member-based organizations and not every hospital is necessarily a member and listed on the websites. \n\nIn fact, Angela Krile, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Children\u2019s Hospital Association, when asked about Batchelder\u2019s claim, said: \"I have never heard that we have the most children\u2019s hospitals but we do have the highest rated system of children\u2019s hospitals in the country.\" \n\nThe second part of her comment, about Ohio\u2019s hospitals being highest rated, would indeed be \u00a0noteworthy. But it is the first part of her comment that PolitiFact Ohio is checking for this article. \n\nPolitiFact Ohio checked with the National Association of Children\u2019s Hospitals. Spokeswoman Gillian Ray directed us to a state-by-state list of children\u2019s hospitals on its website.\n\nBy its count, Ohio hardly has the most children\u2019s hospitals in the country. \n\nNot even close.

Even the two Ohio-based children\u2019s hospital associations do not list the same number of hospitals, and neither lists every children\u2019s hospital in the state. \n\nAs an aside, there clearly appears to be a strong network of children\u2019s hospitals in Ohio which draws the state high rankings in several areas of care, accessibility and amount of research taking place at the various institutions. But all that does not add up to having the most available hospitals of their kind as compared to other states, as Batchelder claimed. \n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10020"}
