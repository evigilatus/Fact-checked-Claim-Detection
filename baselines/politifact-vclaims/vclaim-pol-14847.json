Rick Perry, over his state-paid salary during a June 17 news conference, suggesting Perry had gone back on his word not to accept a five-figure raise.\n\u201cSeveral years ago, he signed a law giving himself a $40,000 pay increase,\u201d White said. \u201cHe told you, the people in the press, that he wasn\u2019t going to take that pay increase. I don\u2019t think he kept that promise.\u201d\nWe decided to review White\u2019s left-right-left combination.\nIn response to our inquiry, White\u2019s campaign pointed us to Perry\u2019s tax returns, newspaper articles and actions taken by the Texas Legislature in 2007. That year, lawmakers included raises for eight top officials, including the governor, in the budget bill for fiscal years 2008 and 2009, according to a Dallas Morning News article published June 7, 2007.\nPerry signed the legislation into law June 15, 2007, according to information from the Legislature\u2019s Web site.\nIn the law, the governor\u2019s annual salary was set to jump 30 percent, from $115,345 to $150,000 -- an increase of $34,655, which is less than the $40,000 that White quoted.\nKaty Bacon, a spokeswoman for White, told us when we inquired that White overstated the size of the raise at his recent press conference and \u201cshould have said about $35,000.\u201d\nWhite\u2019s campaign pointed us to news articles indicating Perry wouldn\u2019t take the raise.\nRobert Black, then a spokesman for the governor, was quoted in the June 2007 Morning News article saying Perry would not accept the pay raise when it kicked in that September, the start of the state\u2019s fiscal year: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t taken a pay raise and doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary.\u201d\nA Fort Worth Star Telegram news article published June 8, 2007, quoted Black as saying that \u201cwe asked them [lawmakers] to give the governor an opt-out provision, and they did that.\u201d A clause in the 2008-09 budget titled \u201cGovernor\u2019s Salary Authorization\u201d says the governor can set his salary \u201cat any amount below the listed authorization\u201d \u2014 in this case, $150,000.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerry\u2019s office confirmed that he has not exercised the opt-out provision since his raise became law.\nWe didn\u2019t find statements from Perry or his aides to the effect that instead of refusing the pay increase, the governor would donate it to charity. Yet Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger wrote us in an e-mail: \u201cThe governor did not seek a pay raise, but the Texas Legislature authorized an increase from $115,000 to $150,000 in 2007 and 2009. Since that time, he has only taken home about $115,000 each fiscal year and has donated the rest to charity.\u201d\nPerry\u2019s take-home state pay -- meaning wages subject to federal income taxes -- increased from $103,320 in 2006 to $111,361 in 2007 and $135,925 in 2008, according to his tax returns for those years, which he has made public. Bob Martin, a Houston accountant who studied Perry\u2019s tax returns at the request of an Associated Press reporter, told us the amount of taxes that were withheld from Perry\u2019s pay in 2008 indicated that his gross salary was $150,000. He speculated that the difference between Perry\u2019s taxable wages and his gross salary could be explained by pre-tax deductions such as retirement contributions; such deductions would be on Perry\u2019s W-2 form. We found no sign of Perry making his W-2s public.\nIn an Aug. 27, 2009 article, the Morning News reported that in 2008, Perry took \u201cthe almost $30,000 raise provided to him by the Legislature\u201d and spread it among the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, the March of Dimes and \u201ca foundation that provides aid to families of fallen veterans.\u201d Perry\u2019s 2008 tax return shows gifts of $9,996 each to the March of Dimes, the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, and the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, where Perry\u2019s wife, Anita, works.\nThe governor filed an extension on his 2009 tax return, so details on more recent charitable donations and take-home pay are not yet available. \nThe White campaign says its examination of Perry\u2019s available tax returns for the years he\u2019s been governor found that Perry has not yet given the full amount of his pay increase to charity. The campaign did two different calculations: First, it compared the increase in Perry\u2019s taxable state-paid income in 2007 and 2008 (about $40,000) with his total charitable gifts during the same time ($38,399). Second, it compared the increase in Perry\u2019s gross state salary ($46,206) with the donations ($38,399).\nCesinger later said the governor had \u201ccontributed an additional $8,668 in 2008 to the State Employee Charitable Campaign that was not claimed as a deduction on his tax return.\u201d A gift of that amount would close the gap cited by the White campaign.\nAll in all, does White land his three-part punch?\nHe errs on the size of the raise.\u00a0\nWhile Perry didn\u2019t personally tell the media he wouldn\u2019t take the raise, a gubernatorial spokesman speaking on his behalf was quoted in newspaper articles as saying so.\nPerry\u2019s spokeswoman told us he\u2019s made charitable donations exceeding the additional dollars that came his way in the raise. But that\u2019s not the same as not accepting the raise in the first place. Nor has Perry used the opt-out provision put into the law to allow him to do so.\nWe rate White\u2019s statement as Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14847"}
