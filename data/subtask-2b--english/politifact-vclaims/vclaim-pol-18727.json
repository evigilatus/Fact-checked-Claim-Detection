Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., created a website for attacking his opponent, Republican state Rep. Nancy Mace.\n\"Nancy Mace denies climate change\" is one of Cunningham\u2019s claims on MaceFacts.com.\nIn statements made since September, Mace has not always ruled out the impact of human beings, but she has consistently resisted an embrace of climate change. Several times, she has suggested the science is inconclusive.\u00a0\nThe race\nThe race pitting Mace, a state representative since 2018, against first-time House member Cunningham is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.\u00a0\nThe Cook Political Report rates the match-up as \"lean Democratic,\" meaning the race is competitive but Cunningham has an advantage.\nClimate change\u00a0\nAccording to NASA, the Earth\u2019s climate has changed throughout history. But \"the current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely \u2014 greater than 95% probability \u2014 to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia.\"\nEvidence for the \"rapid climate change\" includes a global temperature rise, warming of the oceans and shrinking ice sheets.\nHere\u2019s a look at six sets of statements Mace has made, focusing on instances where she has spoken at some length.\n\"Not clear cut\"\nAt a Sept. 3 event sponsored by the Post and Courier, a newspaper in Charleston, a reporter who said he was posing a question from a reader asked Mace if she believes in climate change. Mace began her answer by saying:\u00a0\n\"I\u2019m kind of mixed on this. I\u2019m not a scientist, and I\u2019ve read science on both sides of this issue. To me, it\u2019s not clear cut. I know that here in downtown Charleston, we\u2019re seeing rising sea levels. And that could be a product of the climate, but that\u2019s also partially a product of the peninsula being largely built on landfill in many places.\"\nWhen the reporter followed up by asking Mace what she\u2019s not sure about, Mace said:\n\"So, if you look at the history of Earth, we\u2019ve had climate changes many times, over 130 times over millions of years. And so part of it might be man-made; part of it might be just natural environmental causes as part of the cycle of Earth.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Bill Gates said \u201cat least 3 billion people need to die\u201d from the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe added:\n\"I think it\u2019s more complicated than people really realize. You can\u2019t say one or the other when there\u2019s data on both sides of the issue. And I read about scientists that have flipped from one side to the other \u2014 both ways \u2014 so it\u2019s hard to understand and know which one is right.\"\n\"Up for debate\"\nThe Washington Examiner reported Sept. 11 that it asked Mace to clarify her position on climate change.\u00a0\nMace replied, according to the newspaper, that \"she is \u2018not a scientist\u2019 and acknowledged sea levels are rising, but whether it is caused by \u2018man-made\u2019 climate change or natural reasons is \u2018up for debate.\u2019\"\n\"Consider all available data\"\nIn a questionnaire, the Post and Courier asked Cunningham and Mace: \"Do you believe in climate change?\" The answers were published Sept. 13, with Mace saying:\n\"I\u2019m not a scientist, but I do know we should consider all available data. South Carolina\u2019s 1st Congressional District is in a unique part of the country subject to massive flooding and Atlantic storms, compounded by our low elevation.\"\n\"Science is never settled\"\nAt their first debate, on Sept. 28, Cunningham and Mace were asked if they \"agree with the overwhelming majority of scientists who say that climate change is happening due to manmade greenhouse emissions leading to an increase in extreme weather events.\" Mace replied:\n\"My opponent is going to tell you I\u2019m a climate denier, which is dishonest. My opponent has said that the science is settled on this. Well, the science is never settled. Scientists will tell you that. I look at the issue from every angle and try to find a solution, as I\u2019ve done as a state lawmaker. Scientists once said the Earth was flat and it\u2019s not, and so these things are evolving, as well.\"\n\"Over 130 climate changes\"\nAt their second and final scheduled debate, on Oct. 7, Cunningham and Mace were asked about what has caused a recent rise in the sea level in the area and what they would do about it. Mace said:\n\"Our Earth has had over 130 climate changes over its history. We are facing great climate change. We\u2019re seeing an increase in the number of hurricanes, sea levels are rising.\"\nSome science says man contributes\nIn response to Cunningham\u2019s attack, Mace\u2019s campaign cited to PolitiFact an article published Oct. 14 in the Charleston City Paper. The newspaper said it asked Mace if humans are causing climate change, and she responded:\n\"Does man contribute to it? I mean, a lot of the science says that,\u00a0 too, but I want to stay informed and do as much as we can, but the other thing that\u2019s important to me is that we just cannot simply rely on the United States (to address it).\"\nOur ruling\nCunningham\u2019s claim that Mace \"denies climate change\" is accurate, but needs some clarification. Mace has hedged on the issue, saying the science isn\u2019t conclusive. We rate Cunningham\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18727"}
