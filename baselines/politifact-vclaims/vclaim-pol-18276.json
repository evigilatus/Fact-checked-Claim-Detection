Travis McMichael murdered Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black man, out for a jog.

A police report said that after Arbery ran past him on a residential street, he and Travis McMichael grabbed two guns and followed Arbery in a truck, according to a story in the New York Times. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has said that Travis McMichael shot and killed Arbery.\u00a0\nBut the man who appears in the photo with Kemp is James Stachowiak, a man the Council on American-Islamic Relations called \"a violent anti-Muslim extremist\" when the group posted the image on Facebook in October 2018.\u00a0\nAt the time of the photo, Kemp, a Republican, was in a close race for governor against Democrat Stacey Abrams. A campaign spokesman responded to critics who wanted Kemp to apologize for the photo by saying Kemp \"takes hundreds of photos a day while traveling the state. It\u2019s ridiculous to think he should be held responsible for the beliefs of every person who wants to snap a picture with him.\"\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Stachowiak is well-known to law enforcement and civil rights groups. In 2016, for example, Georgia Capitol police put out a notice warning he was planning an unauthorized, anti-Islam rally to shred the Koran, according to the newspaper.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post claiming Stachowiak is Gregory McMichael False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18276"}
