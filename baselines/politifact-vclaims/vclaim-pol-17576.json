But no mention of grape juice.\nWhy not?\nLike the experts in the other articles, Baylor College of Medicine professor Mary Estes and Ming Tan, a professor in the division of infectious diseases at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center told us there is no scientific evidence to back the grape juice claim.\nStomach flu is normally caused by a virus infection that occurs in the intestinal tract, not in the stomach, and drinking grape juice will not change the acidity of the stomach anyway, Tan told us.\u00a0\nHe added: \"Exposure to stomach flu bugs does not necessarily lead to stomach flu because some factors, like your blood type, can affect the attachment of the bugs to your intestinal cells. This explains why only (some) people get sick in a stomach flu outbreak even if everyone has been exposed.\"\nMoreover, said University of Iowa professor of internal medicine and epidemiology Eli Perencevich, once exposed \"you get sick 12 to 24 hours after, so the three-day day thing is another dubious claim.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says:\u00a0 \"If you\u2019ve been exposed to the stomach flu,\" you can avoid getting it if you \"drink 3 glasses of 100% grape juice a day for 3 days.
