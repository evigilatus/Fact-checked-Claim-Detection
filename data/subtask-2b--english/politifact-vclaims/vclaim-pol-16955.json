(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nNot the only exception\u00a0\nUnlike some other hotel groups operating in Las Vegas, Trump\u2019s hotel did not donate rooms, food or supplies, according to\u00a0reporting by us and other media.\u00a0\nBut there\u2019s no reason to believe Trump\u2019s hotel was the only exception.\nLas Vegas is the nation\u2019s largest hotel market, with roughly 150,000 rooms and thousands more under construction, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority lists 277 lodging establishments in the city as of December 2019, not including time-shares.\u00a0\nThe American Hotel & Lodging Association says more than 16,000 U.S. hotels have signed up to participate in its initiative to link hotels offering rooms with first responders and health care workers seeking lodging. As of April 6, three days before the Facebook post, 36 Las Vegas hotels were participating, the association told the Review-Journal.\u00a0\nThe association didn\u2019t respond to our requests for details. Neither did the Las Vegas Hospitality Association, which counts 260 companies among its members.\nThe 64-story, 1,282-room Trump International Hotel Las Vegas opened just off on The Strip in 2008. It\u2019s one of eight hotels and resorts that the Trump Organization owns in North America.\u00a0\nTrump still owns the company. But after becoming president, he gave up his position as an officer and day-to-day control, and the company\u2019s assets were put into a trust that is managed by his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric.\nCoronavirus shuts down hotels\nNevada Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered a statewide shutdown of hotels, casinos and other non-essential businesses on March 17.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, several hotel groups operating in Las Vegas have announced donations of hotel rooms, food and supplies for workers dealing with the health crisis.\u00a0\nPolo Towers, Cancun Resort and Desert Paradise Resort are among Diamond Resorts properties offering complimentary accommodations to medical personnel and first responders, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Wynn Resorts told the newspaper it is offering financial aid, food and personal protective equipment to local medical facilities and nonprofits in Las Vegas.\nNationally, Marriott announced it has committed to provide $10 million worth of free hotel stays for health care professionals in cities hard hit by COVID-19, including Las Vegas.\nThe Trump Organization did not reply to our requests for information for this fact check.\nTrump has saluted hotels and other businesses for their role in helping Americans cope with the coronavirus crisis. But media reports say that his own company hasn\u2019t played much of a role.\u00a0\nProPublica reported April 2 that in its review of Trump Organization properties, it \"couldn\u2019t find any sign they were joining the effort to fight the coronavirus, even as the president urges other companies to do so.\" The article said many Las Vegas hotels and casinos that closed because of the governor\u2019s order \u2014 including MGM, Wynn, Boyd Gaming, Station Casinos and Caesars \u2014 \"provided huge quantities of unused food\" and cash to a local food bank. The food bank director said nothing had been donated by the Trump hotel.\nPolitico reported April 9 that local and state officials around the country were asking hotels to volunteer to house patients or first responders. In the seven U.S. cities with Trump luxury hotels, including Las Vegas, no local officials said the Trump properties were in discussions to house overflow patients or medical personnel.\nIn response to the pandemic, the Trump Organization laid off or furloughed about 1,500 employees at Trump hotels in the United States and Canada, including in Las Vegas, the Washington Post reported on April 3. The company employs about 4,000 people.\nLas Vegas-based Caesars Entertainment Corp. said April 2 it expects to furlough about 90% of its employees. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt are among hotel owners furloughing tens of thousands of workers or slashing staff.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post attacks Trump\u2019s Las Vegas hotel as being the only one in the city that didn\u2019t offer food or rooms for emergency personnel.\nThe Trump Organization hasn\u2019t provided any information, and searches by PolitiFact and other news organizations didn\u2019t turn up any evidence that Trump\u2019s properties have made such donations.\nSeveral other hotels in Las Vegas have made donations, but the Trump hotel does not appear to be the only exception. The city has hundreds of hotels, motels and inns, and a hotel industry trade group says 36 Las Vegas hotels were participating in its national initiative to offer rooms to first responders and health care workers.\u00a0\nFor a statement that contains an element of truth, but leaves a misleading impression, our rating is Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16955"}
