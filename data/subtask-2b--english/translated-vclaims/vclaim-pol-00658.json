Cooper and most Democrats said that legislation brought unnecessary government rules into complex medical situations. Nevertheless, the Republicans say that the rules are necessary. On April 30, the State Senate voted to override Cooper &apos; s veto. Subsequently, the legislator, Dan Bishop, who is running for Congress in the Ninth Congressional Chamber of North Carolina, acknowledged his progress in trespassing. \"I was proud to cast a decisive vote tonight in the State Senate to end the killing of children in North Carolina, against the liberal veto power of Governor Roy Cooper,\" Bishop posted on his Facebook page and website. First, Bishop claimed that he had voted \"to end the killing of children\" in North Carolina was misleading because current federal laws already protected newborns born alive during the abortion, as reported by the Poletti Fuckett newspaper last month. Since we have already written about this, let us look instead at Bishop's claim that it is a \"critical vote.\" We believe that this statement deserves attention because it indicates that Bishop was a swinging voice and that the fate of the bill depended on Bishop and Bishop alone. This is some kind of allegation that PolityFact has been reviewing for years. It is common for politicians to try to take the sole credit for the success of a law or, on the contrary, for their opponents to try to attribute the sole blame to someone. But these allegations are often exaggerated, and this is the case with Bishop as well. There were 30 votes to override and the Bishop made one of the expected Republican votes. However, the draft law written by the Democratic Party would not have come forward without democratic assistance. 1 out of 30 VOTES needs to abolish the veto, the State Council and the State Senate each need three fifths of its current members to support the idea. On April 30, the Senate voted in favour of 30 votes and opposed 20 votes, the effort of one vote. While Bishop's vote was mathematically important, it is misleading for him to say that he voted \"judgment.\" On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" \u2022 On February 1, 2012, Jerry Cohen, former Special Adviser to the General Assembly in the city of Northern California, and a long-time legislative officer, described Bishop's claim as \"unsolved.\" \"I suppose with an oral roll-call vote you can say who is 30 yes,\" said Cohen. \"Unless it's bloated (though) it's not technically incorrect.\" In North Carolina, key votes are usually held electronically at the same time. This is not a primary school class where the teacher calls for the name of each student, one by one. So there is rarely a drama born by the late John McCain in 2018, when he walked to the Senate floor and made a downward motion to vote against \"impartial abolition\" of the Affordable Care Act. How North Carolina's voting works is like a silent auction, or the final round of \"Jeopardy!\" The room is silent, and senators are given time to press a button. The sounds are anonymous until the results appear on the screen. The screen shows the results only after the vote. This system is organized in a manner that rarely puts pressure on any of the legislators. However, legislators sometimes highlight themselves by voting outside the border with their party, or by trying to change their vote, or both. In 2012, for example, the fracture in North Carolina was legitimized after a democratic pressure from Charlotte accidentally hit the wrong button and voted with the Republicans. The Republic of Becky Carney made the mistake late at night. Immediately after the vote, her voice can be heard on her microphone, saying: \"Oh, my God. I pressed the green, \"it's in the WRL report. I asked Tom Tillis, who is now from the United States. Senator, but at that time she was the Speaker of the House of Representatives if she could change her voice. Sometimes votes are allowed to change, but Teal'c refused. In the voting, Bishop, op. cit., Don Davis of Pete County received the greatest attention. He was the only democracy that voted with the Republicans to support the override, and he gave the Republican Party the only vote he needed to push the override effort. As at 8 May, Cooper &apos; s veto remained in place because the Council had taken no decision to override it. Our bishop said that he \"rejection of a decisive vote\" to override the opposed law of \"born life.\" His vote was important because without him, the extravagant effort would fail. But it would also have failed without any of the other 29 votes. So it's misleading for Bishop to say that he voted \"Guess.\" We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.
