Former First Lady Michelle Obama once said, \"Eggs are what's wrong with America.\" The article presents a picture of the former First Lady, with words at the bottom, \"Now imagine Bush saying, \"The Blacks are what's wrong with America. He still thinks there's no media bias?\" There are other versions of the mem that replace Bush Petramp. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no example of Michelle Obama saying those words, or any difference in that quote. The rumors can be traced to Obama &apos; s 2015 speech at the University of Tuskeje, a historic black private university in Alabama. Following the speech, the Jewish News.com, a right-wing website that often pushes conspiracy theories, published an article entitled \"White People and America is the problem - Michelle Obama is addressing the Black University with her loose letter.\" A few months later, the site re-used the same story, but this time with the headline: \"Michele Obama says \"White People Is What's Wrong in America,\" the fact-checking articles set out on January 12, 2021 in Instagram says that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives Mater's protests. \u2022 On January 16, 2012, articles contained misleading content, and the main title of the second title was a distorted view of Obama's speech and did not derive from any statement she had made.

Michelle Obama told the graduates that the way forward wouldn't be easy, especially for people like you and me. \"The world will not always see you in those hats and dresses. They will not know how much effort you have made and how much you have sacrificed to this day, but will assume who they think you are based on their limited concept of the world. And my husband and I know how frustrating that experience can be. We have both felt that those daily angles are clamoured throughout our entire lives - people who crossed the street for fear of their safety; writers who watched us closely in all those stores; people who were in official events who assumed that we were \"helpers\" - and those who questioned our intelligence, our honesty, and even our love for this country.\" A full copy of the letter is available in the archives of the White House and a video of the speech is available on YouTube. Our renewed rule Mimi claims that Michelle Obama said, \"The whites are wrong in America.\" The false rumor stems from Obama &apos; s inaugural speech at a historically black university in 2015. While its message was explicit about ethnic relations in the United States, it did not say those words at any time. The Mim (and the stories that helped stimulate it) disseminate misleading information and give a twisted interpretation of its words. We're assessing this allegation pants on fire!
