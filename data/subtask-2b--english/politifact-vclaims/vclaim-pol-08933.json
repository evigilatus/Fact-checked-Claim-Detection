Anthony List, an anti abortion-rights group, funded a new ad that claims Booker, a Democrat and Newark\u2019s mayor, condones abortion at any stage of pregnancy and without restrictions.\n\"He supports late-term and partial-birth abortion and opposes safety regulations,\" the ad states.\nConservative activist Steve Lonegan is Booker\u2019s challenger in an Oct. 16 special election for a Senate seat left vacant after Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg\u2019s death in June.\nThe groups say Booker\u2019s support of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s platform gives credence to their claim, but the Truth-O-Meter has determined there\u2019s a little more to this story than what the ad portrays.\nLet\u2019s begin by reviewing how the groups came to identify Booker\u2019s supposed support of late-term and partial-birth abortions, and opposition to safety regulations.\nMallory Quigley, communications director for the Susan B. Anthony group, directed us to Booker\u2019s support of the national committee\u2019s platform.\n\"We\u2019re taking a look at the Democratic Party platform which unequivocally supports a woman\u2019s right to choose without any restrictions and regardless of ability to pay,\" Quigley said. \"That was supported by Booker and a host of others.\"\nIndeed, the ad shows a clip from Booker\u2019s Sept. 4, 2012 address during a Planned Parenthood rally at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C\n\"I was a co-chair for the DNC platform, when we affirmed a woman's right to choose,\" Booker said during the rally.\nSo Quigley is correct that Booker and others supported the Democratic National Committee platform and women having the right to choose.\nNow let\u2019s review the national committee\u2019s platform on abortion.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe platform makes no mention of specific procedures such as late-term or partial-birth abortion, and states support for a woman\u2019s right to make decisions about her pregnancy, \"including a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay,\" according to a statement from the Democratic National Committee.\nThe committee also supports a woman\u2019s decision to carry a pregnancy to term.\n\"We strongly and unequivocally support a woman's decision to have a child by providing affordable health care and ensuring the availability of and access to programs that help women during pregnancy and after the birth of a child, including caring adoption programs,\" the platform states.\nNext, we checked with Booker campaign spokesman Kevin Griffis about the mayor\u2019s stance on abortion.\n\"We can all agree that we want to prevent unintended pregnancies, and therefore the need for abortion,\" Griffis said in an e-mail. \"Fundamentally, Mayor Booker believes that a woman's health decisions should remain between her and her doctor. Mayor Booker supports Roe v Wade, which allows women the right to choose up to the point of viability.\"\nAs for late-term and partial-birth abortions?\n\"Cory Booker does not oppose restrictions on post-viability abortions if exceptions are made for the health and the life of the mother,\" Griffis said, meaning the mayor would support a woman\u2019s choice in that case to decide the fate of her pregnancy with her doctor.\nThe American Commitment Action Fund did not respond to our request for comment.\nOur ruling\nA new ad targeting Booker claims, \"He supports late-term and partial-birth abortion and opposes safety regulations.\"\nA spokeswoman for one of the groups behind the ad notes that Booker\u2019s stance on abortion comes from his support of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s 2012 platform, which Booker co-chaired.\nThe platform, though, makes no mention of late-term or partial-birth abortion, which a Booker spokesman agreed the Democrat would support a woman\u2019s right to choose if\u00a0her life or health is in danger.\u00a0The platform says nothing else about safety regulations, which some states \u2013 such as Texas \u2013 have cited in attempts to ban abortion after a certain point in pregnancy.\nThat makes this claim partially accurate, but lacking important details -- and that fits the definition of Half True.\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08933"}
