Former President Donald Trump\u00a0withdrew in 2017 from\u00a0the international treaty, designed to reduce\u00a0carbon emissions, although\u00a0terms of the agreement stipulated that the U.S. could not formally exit until Nov. 4, 2020.\u00a0\n\"This would be a tremendous mistake,\" Christian wrote.\u00a0\"The accord carries sky-high costs with very low benefits and unfairly imposes a double standard based on unproven assumptions and climate models that are wrong nearly all the time.\"\u00a0\nThen Christian pointed to a\u00a02017\u00a0study\u00a0released by an economic research firm\u00a0on behalf of\u00a0the\u00a0U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the\u00a0American Council for Capital Formation, a\u00a0pro-business\u00a0think tank on economic policy.\u00a0\n\"The cost of the Paris Climate Accord to the American economy is steep. The agreement will cost American workers 6.5 million jobs and $3 trillion in economic growth by 2040,\" Christian wrote, citing the 2017\u00a0study.\u00a0\nThe study, entitled \"Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Regulations On the\u00a0Industrial Sector,\" was also cited by Trump when justifying his\u00a0decision to\u00a0withdraw\u00a0from the\u00a0Paris\u00a0accord.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that,\" Trump said\u00a0in\u00a0his\u00a02017\u00a0announcement from the Rose Garden.\u00a0\nIncomplete picture\nThe bleak outlook sparked scrutiny over the figures.\u00a0When the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0initially joined the accord in 2016,\u00a0the Obama\u00a0administration set long-term goals for reducing\u00a0economy-wide emissions by 80%\u00a0from\u00a02005 levels by 2050. The administration listed a mix\u00a0of\u00a0existing and planned\u00a0policies that would help the U.S. meet that goal, but\u00a0reductions\u00a0stemming\u00a0from\u00a0those\u00a0policies\u00a0would still fall short of the 2050 target.\u00a0\u00a0\nAlthough\u00a0there\u2019s debate over\u00a0how far short the policies would come, \"it is clear that such a gap cannot be filled without contributions from the industrial sector,\" reads the study, which was\u00a0conducted\u00a0by NERA Economic Consulting.\u00a0The profit and job loss figures cited by Christian and Trump represent the economic cost\u00a0of closing that gap according to NERA\u2019s analysis.\u00a0\u00a0\nTrump and Christian\u00a0repeat the report\u2019s findings accurately.\u00a0More restrictions on fossil fuel emissions\u00a0mean higher cost of production, and higher cost of production means the closure of\u00a0uncompetitive\u00a0manufacturing businesses, and those\u00a0closures\u00a0mean fewer manufacturing jobs.\u00a0These losses\u00a0and\u00a0their knock-on effects\u00a0beyond the manufacturing sector would amount to 1.1 million jobs lost by 2025 and 6.5 million by 2040, according to NERA.\u00a0\nThe loss of jobs results in a corresponding decline in gross domestic product,\u00a0with a loss of $250 billion by 2025 that accelerates to $3 trillion by 2040.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The decline in GDP accelerates over time as the targets become much more difficult to comply with and the targets start to constrain output in all sectors,\" the study says.\u00a0\nBut the study\u2019s authors note an important caveat to\u00a0their\u00a0key findings\u00a0that Trump and\u00a0Christian\u00a0omit.\u00a0Not only are the long-term projections subject to a great deal of uncertainty,\u00a0they said,\u00a0the study\u00a0did not\u00a0factor in all of the\u00a0offsetting\u00a0job gains and GDP growth associated with a\u00a0clean tech transition.\u00a0\nIn a\u00a0news\u00a0release following\u00a0Trump\u2019s announcement of\u00a0U.S.\u00a0withdrawal from the Paris\u00a0agreement, NERA\u00a0stated that \"the Trump administration selectively used results\" from its study.\u00a0\n\"NERA\u2019s study was not a cost-benefit analysis of the Paris Agreement, nor does it purport to be one,\" their statement said.\u00a0\"The objective of the study was to estimate the range of cost sensitivity associated with meeting deep U.S.\u00a0emissions targets under alternative implementation approaches affecting U.S.\u00a0industrial sectors.

And as new technologies accelerate the\u00a0transition, new jobs could be created therewith.\u00a0\nFor example, over a million\u00a0Americans\u00a0are employed in the fossil fuel sector\u00a0while\u00a0close to half that amount\u00a0are employed in solar and wind,\u00a0even though solar and wind comprise just 10% of the energy mix,\u00a0according to the\u00a0commission's report.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It is expected that reduced employment in fossil fuels through the transition can be more than offset by a rise in employment in renewables and construction,\" the study said.\u00a0\u00a0\nGlobally, the commission found that low-carbon\u00a0jobs\u00a0may employ up to 65 million people by 2030, which could offset employment reductions in declining sectors.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen asked about considering possible\u00a0offsetting\u00a0benefits\u00a0in his criticism of the Paris accord, Christian\u00a0only questioned the logic of eliminating existing energy jobs while subsidizing jobs in\u00a0renewables.\u00a0According to\u00a0the International Renewable Energy Agency,\u00a0global\u00a0direct subsidies to renewables are expected to increase\u00a0from $166 billion in 2017 to\u00a0$192 billion in 2030,\u00a0while subsidies to fossil fuels\u00a0fall from $447\u00a0billion to $165 billion over the same 13-year period.\u00a0\n\"I do not see a benefit in putting in place punitive policies that eliminate well-paying energy jobs and then using our taxpayer dollars to create new jobs through subsidizing other less efficient forms of energy,\" he said.\nUnder the Paris accord, the U.S. committed to reducing emissions by about 25% by 2025 compared to 2005 levels. Biden\u2019s move to rejoin the accord means that\u00a0the U.S. must submit an emission reduction plan, although the details are\u00a0not yet known.\u00a0\n\"Since our state makes up 40% of the nation's production, we will be disproportionately impacted compared to other states in terms of economic and job loss,\" Christian said.\u00a0\nOther factors\nThe NERA report also doesn\u2019t factor in\u00a0the cost of climate-related disasters\u00a0that, by most scientific accounts, are projected to increase in frequency as global temperatures rise.\u00a0Over the past two decades,\u00a0global\u00a0climate-related disasters \u2014 primarily floods and storms \u2014 accounted for\u00a0$2.3 trillion in damages, with the U.S. bearing the brunt of the economic losses, according to a report by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.\u00a0Under a\u00a0future scenario with\u00a0limited or no emission reductions, these disasters are expected to worsen\u00a0in severity and frequency,\u00a0meaning that a business-as-usual response to climate change can\u00a0cost the economy trillions.\u00a0\n\"Current economic models are deeply inadequate in capturing the opportunities of such a transformational shift, or the grave dangers of climate inaction,\" the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate study says.\u00a0\"We need a new class of economic models that can capture the powerful dynamics at play, including technological advances, preservation of essential natural capital, and the full health benefits of cleaner air and a safer climate including the containment of pandemic diseases.\"\u00a0\nLike Trump, Christian has been\u00a0vocal skeptic of climate science.\u00a0He was first elected\u00a0to\u00a0the Railroad Commission in 2016\u00a0having attracted endorsements and contributions from industry groups, energy companies and other state officials.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe\u2019s repeatedly made arguments\u00a0against\u00a0global warming and its man-made causes,\u00a0calling those who underscore\u00a0future impacts of climate change \"climate catastrophists.\"\u00a0\n\"These activists repeatedly imply that climate change is \u2018settled science\u2019 and that 97 percent of scientists agree that the main reason\u00a0for global warming is manmade greenhouse\u00a0gasses.\u00a0However, real science is never \u2018settled\u2019 and 97 percent of scientists don\u2019t agree. ... This is far from settled science,\" Christian wrote\u00a0in a 2019 letter to Gov. Greg Abbott.\u00a0\nA\u00a02016 survey of scientific\u00a0studies\u00a0found that\u00a097% of actively publishing climate scientists agreed on the\u00a0cause of\u00a0global warming.\u00a0\n\"The vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists \u2013 97 percent \u2013 agree that humans are causing global warming and climate change,\" according to NASA. \"Most of the leading science organizations around the world have issued public statements expressing this, including international and U.S. science academies, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a whole host of reputable scientific bodies around the world.\"\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nChristian wrote in an open letter\u00a0that reentry into the Paris\u00a0Climate\u00a0Accord will \"cost American workers 6.5 million jobs and $3 trillion in economic growth by 2040,\"\u00a0accurately\u00a0citing a study\u00a0released in 2017 by NERA Economic Consulting.\u00a0\u00a0\nThose figures were similarly\u00a0referenced by Trump\u00a0in justification of\u00a0his decision to\u00a0withdraw\u00a0from the\u00a0accord.\u00a0After that announcement, authors of the study\u00a0said the \"Trump\u00a0administration selectively used results\" and failed to consider key limitations of\u00a0their findings.\u00a0\u00a0\nChristian similarly omitted these caveats.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate this claim\u00a0Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19206"}
