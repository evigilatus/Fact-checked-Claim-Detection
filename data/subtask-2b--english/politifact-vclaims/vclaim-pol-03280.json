They also aren\u2019t happy how Trump often spends his weekends away from the White House visiting one of his properties.\nSen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., put the two criticisms together recently.\n\"The thing that I'm most disappointed about so far, and this is a little thing, but\u00a0Trump's budget cut the meals on wheels\u00a0program. Completely, gone,\" McCaskill said at an April 14, 2017, town hall.\u00a0\n\"If we are not doing meals on wheels, it is cutting off our nose to spite our face, because the people who can't get nutrition at home and don\u2019t stay well end up in a nursing home, and you end up paying the bill, so meals and wheels is a small investment,\" McCaskill said. \"If Donald Trump would stay home from Mar-a-Lago one weekend, if he would stay home from Mar-a-Lago for one weekend, it would pay the entire meals and wheels budget for the state of Missouri for almost two\u00a0years. One weekend.\"\u00a0\nMcCaskill continued.\n\"So, if he --\u00a0he has not called me ever --\u00a0and there hasn't been a particular reach out to me ... but if he did, I would say you know what\u00a0I would do if I were you, it'd be a really smart idea. I would announce on a\u00a0Friday\u00a0I'm not going to Mar-a-Lago, and this week I\u2019m going to make sure that the money that we would've spent, the $3\u00a0million that we would've spent goes to the meals on wheels\u00a0program in Tennessee or in Kansas, or in how about Missouri.\"\nTrump's budget proposal would cut\u00a0$192 billion from federal nutritional assistance programs, the New York Times has reported. The question of this fact-check is: Would one fewer trip to Mar-a-Lago save Missouri's meals on wheels programs for two years?\nTrump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago trips\nPinning down the cost of a trip to Mar-a-Lago is difficult. As PolitiFact has previously reported, the closest thing we have is a 2016 Government Accountability Office report detailing the costs of a 2013 trip taken by President Barack Obama. The trip was four days from Chicago to Palm Beach, Fla., and cost $3.6 million.\nBut the author of that report has said it should not be used to estimate the cost of Trump\u2019s travel to Florida.\n\"We wouldn\u2019t recommend substituting the numbers from President Obama\u2019s trip to any other trip,\" Brian Lepore, director of defense capabilities and management at GAO, told PolitiFact in April. (We rated a fact-check saying Trump's trips cost $3.6 million Half True.)\nWhen the president travels, generally several military aircraft are involved. These include Air Force One, carrying the president, his entourage and guests, cargo planes packing motorcade limousines and other equipment, and aircraft to transport personnel who conduct security sweeps before the president arrives.\nThis is the main driver of presidential travel costs. Air Force One alone costs nearly $180,000 per hour of flight as of 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service. The GAO report found that total air and boat support accounted for more than 85 percent of the $3.6 million spent on Obama\u2019s 2013 trip.\nBut these costs change significantly from trip to trip, so it\u2019s hard to nail down the average cost.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, a president could take two identical weekend trips to Palm Beach, both trips requiring a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. But one trip could cost a good deal more than the other depending on where the C-130 has to fly in from. Military logistics could mean that one week it comes from Delaware, the next from Texas.\nOr, if the president\u2019s event schedule for one of the Palm Beach weekends requires a helicopter, an additional or bigger plane might be necessary to transport the helicopter.\nAnother group has estimated Trump's trips to Florida have cost much less.\u00a0Judicial Watch, a conservative group, said public records show that two Trump weekend Mar-a-Lago trips cost $1.28 million.\nThe authority on the matter, the GAO,\u00a0has accepted a request to examine the costs of Trump\u2019s Mar-A-Lago trips. Unfortunately\u00a0that report isn\u2019t available yet.\nMissouri\u2019s meals on wheels costs\nWhile there are difficulties estimating the cost of a trip to Mar-A-Lago, McCaskill\u2019s bigger issue is with how she discussed\u00a0Missouri's meals on wheels budget.\nMeals on wheels is a catch-all term for companies or organizations that provide nutrion assistance to low-income people, primarily seniors. Meals on Wheels is one specific organization that provides delivered meals, but it's only one.\nMcCaskill spokeswoman Sarah Feldman said McCaskill was speaking specifically about one federal funding source, Community Development Block Grants. The block grants help fund nutrition assistance programs in five Missouri\u00a0cities: St. Louis, St. Charles, St. Peters, St. Joseph and Independence. In fiscal year 2016, grants for home-delivered meals totaled $356,900. Spread over two years, that's a total of $713,800.\nWhat's not clear\u00a0from McCaskill's comments, however, is that\u00a0meals on wheels programs in Missouri include much larger funding streams.\u00a0Jenny Bertolette, spokeswoman for Meals on Wheels America, said the main source of funding for meals on wheels is the Older Americans Act. That program provided\u00a0about\u00a0$10.5 million\u00a0in federal funding for meal assistance in Missouri, according to a 2017 fact sheet (the figures are from 2014).\u00a0\nThat's way more -- in one year -- than any estimate for a Mar-a-Lago trip. And the Older Americans Act isn't the only source of funding.\u00a0\nFor instance, Meals on Wheels of Greater St. Louis, says it does not receive any government funding. Yet it spent nearly $340,000 in 2013 on program expenses, according to required government filings.\nOur ruling\nMcCaskill said that if Trump stayed home from Mar-a-Lago for one weekend, then it would pay for the cost of meals on wheels in Missouri for two years.\nWe don't know how much it costs for Trump to visit Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. A GAO report said it cost $3.6 million for Obama to take a four-day, two-city trip in 2013, but the author of that report said that figure should not be used to make other estimates. Another group pegged the cost much lower.\nMore problematic, McCaskill only looked at Community Development Block Grants when considering the cost of home-delivered meal programs in Missouri. The comparison falls apart entirely when you look at a fuller set of funding streams.\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-23 18:24:34 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"If Donald Trump would stay home from Mar-a-Lago one weekend, it would pay the entire meals on wheels budget for the state of Missouri for almost two years.\"    Claire McCaskill U.S. senator   In a town hall Friday, April 14, 2017 2017-04-14    Read More  info    \n\nUpdate (5 p.m. May 23): This post was updated to include additional comments from McCaskill.
