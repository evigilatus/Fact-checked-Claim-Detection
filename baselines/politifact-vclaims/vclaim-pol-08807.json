At one point, he lamented the economic hardship in his city.\nThe mayor distributed a list that showed the ratio of city poverty to suburban poverty in the nation\u2019s 51 largest metropolitan areas, those with a metro population above 1 million. Then he said of Milwaukee:\n\"We are the only metropolitan area in the entire country where you\u2019ve got that ratio higher than four, meaning that the poverty rate is four times greater in the city than it is in the suburbs. Only one. Only one.\"\nThere\u2019s no question the city of Milwaukee has had some of the highest poverty rates in the country. Let\u2019s see if the measure Barrett uses -- a city-to-suburban poverty ratio -- is accurate.\nBarrett\u2019s numbers\nThe list Barrett provided came from NewGeography.com, which is \"devoted to analyzing and discussing the places where we live and work.\" It was included with a July 2012 article by Wendell Cox of Demographia, a Belleville, Ill., public policy firm.\nUsing 2010 census data, Cox provided a ratio to show how much greater the poverty rate is in the city vs. the suburbs in the 51 largest metro areas.\nFor Milwaukee, the poverty rate was 29.5 percent in the city and 6.9 percent in the suburbs -- a ratio of 4.3. In other words, the city\u2019s poverty rate was 4.3 times higher than the suburban rate.\nAnd, as Barrett said, Milwaukee was the only large metro area with a ratio above 4.\nThe three next-highest ratios behind Milwaukee, along with the city poverty rate vs. the suburban rate were:\n\n\n\n\nMetro area\n\n\nCity poverty rate\n\n\nSuburban rate\n\n\nRatio\n\n\n\n\nHartford, Conn.\n\n\n31.2%\n\n\n7.8%\n\n\n3.99\n\n\n\n\nBaltimore\n\n\n25.6%\n\n\n6.7%\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.80\n\n\n\n\nRochester, N.Y.\n\n\n33.8%\n\n\n9.3%\n\n\n3.62\n\n\n\n\nNewer numbers\nNearly a week before Barrett made his claim, the U.S. Census bureau released new poverty figures -- for 2012. Barrett alluded to them in his editorial board interview and had commented on them several days earlier in a Journal Sentinel news article.\nA day after the new census figures, the Brookings Institution think tank posted a report on the 2012 poverty rates. The report didn\u2019t list ratios like those in the report Barrett had cited.\nBut a simple calculation of Brookings\u2019 city and suburban poverty rates shows that both the Milwaukee and Hartford, Conn., metro areas had a poverty ratio above 4:\n\n\n\n\nMetro area\n\n\nCity poverty rate\n\n\nSuburban rate\n\n\nRatio\n\n\n\n\nHartford, Conn.\n\n\n38%\n\n\n7.9%\n\n\n4.81\n\n\n\n\nMilwaukee\n\n\n29.9%\n\n\n7.3%\n\n\n4.10\n\n\n\n\nOur rating\nBarrett said that among the nation\u2019s 51 largest metropolitan areas, Milwaukee is the \"only one\" where the poverty rate is more than \"four times greater in the city than it is in the suburbs.\"\nBarrett was correct in citing 2010 census figures showing Milwaukee was the only large metro area with a poverty ratio above 4, but his claim went a bit too far in that the just-released 2012 figures show two areas with that ratio. That did not, however, undermine the thrust of his point, that the Milwaukee metropolitan area is virtually alone by this measure.\nWe rate the statement Half True.\nIf you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08807"}
