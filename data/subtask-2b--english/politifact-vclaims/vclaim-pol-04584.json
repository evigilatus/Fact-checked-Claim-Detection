When the report first came out in June, Hillary Clinton also jumped on the fact that an adviser to a former Republican presidential candidate had produced such a critical report.\nBut Trump responded to say: Not so fast. Mark Zandi, Moody\u2019s chief economist and the report\u2019s lead author, actually supports Clinton and President Barack Obama.\nSo who is this guy?\nZandi is a well-respected economist, and politicians and economists on both sides of the aisle like him. His latest report, which is sharply critical of Trump\u2019s policy proposals, is a methodical examination that looks at three possible scenarios: one where Trump\u2019s proposals are adopted in full, one where they are adopted on a smaller scale, and one that envisions a compromise with Congress. (Moody\u2019s says a similar report about Clinton\u2019s proposals is forthcoming.)\nAssuming that Trump\u2019s proposals are adopted in full, the analysts do, in fact, estimate that the economy will be \"significantly weaker,\" and there will be a 3.5 million drop in jobs, as Kaine said.\n\"Under the scenario in which all his stated policies become law in the manner proposed, the economy suffers a lengthy recession and is smaller at the end of his four-year term than when he took office,\" the report says. \"By the end of his presidency, there are close to 3.5 million fewer jobs, and the unemployment rate rises to as high as 7 percent, compared with below 5 percent today. During Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, the average American household\u2019s after-inflation income will stagnate, and stock prices and real house values will decline.\"\nThough others might take issue with some aspects of his findings, the purpose of this fact-check is not to cast doubt on the quality of Zandi\u2019s Trump report or his work generally. We have quoted him as an expert source on the economy in previous stories.\nRather, Kaine is using Zandi\u2019s Republican credentials as a former McCain adviser to make the point that even Republicans think Trump\u2019s proposals would be bad for the economy. But it turns out he is leaving out an important piece of information that leaves a giant hole in that particular line of argument \u2014 notably that Zandi has donated the maximum amount of $2,700 to Clinton\u2019s primary campaign.\nBeyond this presidential cycle, Zandi has donated to a variety of Democrats going back to 2007. Zandi confirmed to PolitiFact that he is a registered Democrat.\nIn the 2008 presidential race, though, he did support Republican candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. He donated more than $2,000 to McCain\u2019s campaign, and he was one of several economists advising McCain in an official capacity.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Zandi definitely wasn\u2019t McCain\u2019s chief adviser, as Kaine said, and has called his role in the campaign \"very modest.\"\nZandi was a Democrat back then, too, but he told the Wall Street Journal he is \"eclectic\" and that he has done work for members of both parties, a point he has since reiterated.\nAfter the 2008 election, though, Zandi turned out to be an important asset to the Obama administration.\nZandi told us he wasn\u2019t an official adviser to Obama or the White House, but he has produced research concluding the Obama administration\u2019s response to the 2008 financial crisis was a success. And he was on Obama\u2019s short list to regulate the Federal Housing Finance Agency, though he didn\u2019t get the job.\nWe asked Zandi what he would tell people who question whether his report on Trump is neutral, given his sizeable donation to Clinton and past connections with Democrats.\n\"We used the same model of the economy we use for all our studies,\" he said. \"And the study is completely transparent. Moreover, the approach we took is the same approach the (nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office) takes when evaluating similar fiscal policy proposals. I'm very interested in hearing substantive critiques of our work.\"\nOur ruling\nKaine said \"John McCain\u2019s chief economic adviser during the \u201908 race \u2026 estimated that Trump\u2019s promises would cause america to lose 3.5 million jobs.\"\nThe Moody\u2019s report concluded that Trump\u2019s economic proposals, if adopted in full, could cost 3.5 million jobs. And Zandi was a donor and economic adviser to the McCain campaign. But he was not the chief adviser, and this isn\u2019t the full picture of his political affiliations.\nAs it turns out, Zandi is a registered Democrat and donated the maximum amount to Clinton\u2019s primary campaign.\nZandi is a well-respected economist, and we are not in this fact-check casting doubt on the credibility of his Trump report or his work generally. He has advised and worked on issues for politicians on both sides of the aisle for many years.\nBut to identify Zandi only as a former adviser of McCain leaves out a lot of the story about Zandi\u2019s political affiliations. We rate Kaine\u2019s claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/097b24d4-9ee7-492a-abbe-ea4ea40bd86f", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04584"}
