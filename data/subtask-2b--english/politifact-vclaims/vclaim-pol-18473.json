A great city, now one of the most dangerous cities in America and definitely in Texas.\u201d", "truth_label": "pants-fire", "date": "stated on October 28, 2020 in a press conference:", "title": "No, Austin is not one of the most dangerous cities in Texas, let alone in the U.S.", "text": "Texas\u2019 top political leaders gathered in Houston Oct. 28 at a \"Back the Blue\" news conference to express support for police officers and lambaste cities that cut police budgets.\nGov. Greg Abbott sat alongside Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen, R-Lake Jackson, and U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, to reiterate plans for a state takeover of police functions in Austin after the City Council voted in August to cut $21.5 million from the police budget and shift another $128 million from the Police Department to other city departments.\nAbbott and other Republican leaders have criticized the council\u2019s move repeatedly, but Patrick turned up the volume in remarks he gave during the Houston event.\n\"The city of Austin is a disaster if you haven\u2019t been there. A great city, now one of the most dangerous cities in America and definitely in Texas,\" Patrick said.\n\"If we don\u2019t back the police, we\u2019re not going to have any police and you\u2019re going to be left on your own,\" he said. \"And if you think that\u2019s hyperbole, it\u2019s not.\"\nWe were curious about Patrick\u2019s claim that Austin is now one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S. and Texas. Let\u2019s compare how Austin crime measures up against other major metropolitan areas.\nMost \"dangerous\" cities in the U.S.\nWe don\u2019t know exactly what Patrick means by the term \"dangerous\" \u2014 his office did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls for explanation. A city could be considered dangerous, for instance, by its vulnerability to floods, wildfires or other natural disasters that threaten a population\u2019s security. But considering the context in which Patrick\u2019s comments were made, a \"Back the Blue\" pledge event, it\u2019s safe to assume that Patrick was referring to crime.\nWe also don\u2019t know what information Patrick based his claim on. However, criminologists took Patrick\u2019s use of \"dangerous\" to specifically mean violent crime, or crimes that threaten a person\u2019s physical safety. This category, defined by Austin police as crimes against persons, includes violations such as murder, kidnapping and assault.\nWhen ranking Austin\u2019s violent crime rates to that of other large U.S. cities, Austin comes nowhere near the top of the list.\nAustin police reported 3,953 incidents of violent crime in 2019, a rate of about 400 incidents for every 100,000 residents, according to the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting program. Among the nation\u2019s 30 largest cities that report crime numbers to the FBI database, Detroit topped the list with about 1,965 violent incidents per 100,000 residents, followed by Memphis, Tenn., Baltimore and Milwaukee.\nAustin\u2019s violent crime rate of 400 incidents per 100,000 residents ranked 28th among the 30 largest U.S. cities, above El Paso and San Diego. Austin ranked near the bottom of that list in 2018 and 2017 as well.\n\n\u00a0\nMost \"dangerous\" cities in Texas\nPatrick\u2019s second claim, that Austin is \"definitely\" one of the most dangerous cities in Texas, is also not borne out by last year\u2019s crime data.\nThe FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting program shows that, among 534 Texas cities reporting data, Austin ranks 128th. The cities with the highest violent crime rates are South Padre Island, New Boston, Snyder and Oyster Creek, each with a rate above 1,200 incidents per 100,000 residents.\nIf you look at only the largest 25 cities in Texas \u2014 cities with populations the size of Round Rock, 132,747, or larger \u2014 Austin ranked 13th. Houston, Lubbock, Dallas, Corpus Christi and Amarillo, in that order, are the cities with the highest violent crime rates in Texas.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FBI has not released any crime numbers for 2020, but the Austin police chief\u2019s latest monthly report shows that, while certain categories of violent crimes are up, violent crime on the whole is about even with where it was this time last year. Murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, intimidation and incest are up so far, while rape, forcible sodomy, sexual assault, simple assault and others are down.\n\n\u00a0\nEscalating rhetoric on Austin\u2019s crime\nPatrick\u2019s claim is the latest attack from Republican leaders on the Austin City Council\u2019s budget decision.\nIn August, a week after the council approved the budget, Abbott held a news conference pledging to push legislation next year that would freeze property tax revenue for any city or county that cuts law enforcement spending. He also said Austin \"is the No. 1 city in America in the year-to-year percentage increase in murders, with a percentage increase of more than 64% for the first half of this year,\" citing the 23 homicides recorded in the first half of 2020 compared to the 14 recorded in the first half of 2019.\nA PolitiFact analysis rated his claim Half True, noting that percentage change figures can be misleading when dealing with low numbers. (Abbott made that statement in Fort Worth, which had a murder rate last year more than double Austin\u2019s.)\nThen in October, Abbott said in a tweet that Austin\u2019s property crime was rising and that \"this is the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police.\" Another PolitiFact analysis rated that Mostly False. At the time Abbott made the claim, property crime was down by 2% this year compared to last year, Austin police reports show.\nThe Texas Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative state legislators, released a video on Oct. 5 signaling its intent to join the fight against police budget cuts during the next legislative session.\n\"Crime is up because police funding is down. That\u2019s the wrong direction for public safety in Texas,\" state Rep. Briscoe Cain, R-Baytown, said in the video.\nPatrick\u2019s claim that Austin is now one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S. is a notable escalation of the political rhetoric, experts say.\n\"It\u2019s a totally ridiculous comment and it\u2019s completely divorced from reality,\" said Carsten Andresen, an assistant professor of criminal justice at St. Edward's University. \"It is possible to have a lot of critiques of Austin, and it\u2019s possible to make a lot of critiques from a conservative perspective about Austin. But this remark is just a lying pants-on-fire situation.\"\n\"It\u2019s inaccurate to say that Austin has suddenly shot up and become this super dangerous place,\" said Texas State University criminologist Sean Roche.\nRoche also notes that prevalence of crime is not the only thing that influences how people perceive crime. Severity of crimes also influence our perception, especially crimes like murder.\nAustin recorded a rate of about 3.2 murders per 100,000 residents in 2019, making it the 15th highest murder rate among Texas\u2019 25 largest cities. This year, as of September, the rate was at about 3.5 murders per 100,000 residents.\nOur ruling\nIn describing Austin as a \"disaster,\" Patrick said that the city is \"now one of the most dangerous cities in America and definitely in Texas.\"\nAmong the 30 largest cities in the U.S., Austin's violent crime rate ranks 28th. And among the 25 largest cities in Texas, Austin ranks 13th.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18473"}
