Many of the $175.5 billion budget allocations were criticized by Flanagan. This included the budget call for funding of the Jos\u00e9 Peralta State dream law in New York, which allows undocumented students to receive financial aid from the State. He was named in honour of a senator who defended the legislation before his death in 2018. \"Because of the new one-party government in New York, other democratic-led priorities that have made it part of the final budget include full funding for an initiative to provide free university education to illegal immigrants, while refusing to increase funding for the educational assistance programme that would help middle-class families to afford college costs.\" We've heard this allegation before and wanted to know if it was true. The House of Representatives and the Senate have passed the Dreams Act, which provides study assistance to undocumented students, but the Government has not yet signed it into law. (Andrew Como) The Komo Statement on the budget agreement between his administration and the legislature provides for the expenditure plan \"Implementation and full funding of the Jos\u00e9 Peralta New York State dream law in the amount of $27 million.\" In January, Komo's budget proposal outlined his priorities and explained the dream law. \"The Law on Dreams will grant undocumented students access to the Excelsior Grant, the educational assistance programme, as well as other State-run scholarships,\" according to the Como Budget Briefing Book. \"The investment of $27 million in fiscal year 2020 in the future of young migrants is an investment in the future of New York.\" A spokesman for the State Budget Division, Freeman Klobot, confirmed that the description of the Law of Dreams in the briefing book was still accurate in the final budget. Scott Reeve, spokesman for Flanagan, said that the budget that had been enacted contained $27 million for the Law of Dreams, which provided \"free university education for people who are here illegally.\" Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" On 26 January 2021, with regard to the funding of the State educational assistance programme, or the technical advisory programme, the Republicans in the Senate preferred to expand access by increasing the grant and raising the income limits to allow families to qualify, as Riv said. The Technical Advisory Programme provides scholarships for students to study in public or private institutions. The Democrats of the Senate also wanted to increase funding for the Technical Advisory Programme, and included an expansion in the Single Council Bill - thus named because a corresponding bill was not submitted to the Assembly. The expansion of the technical advisory programme had not been included in the final budget. The TAP award is a maximum of $5,165, while college tuition fees in the New York State University system are a maximum of $6,870. The gap between the TAP grant and the education costs of eligible students in each complex is covered. Funding for the TAP increased from $915.3 million to $947.7 million. The vast majority of the increase, $27 million, will finance dreams, as Klobot said. The remainder of the increase, $5.4 million, was for other students. With the $27 million allocated by TAP not accounted for, TAP allocations increased by less than 1 per cent. Como's spokesman called Flanagan's statement \"false and misleading\" because it ignores other budgetary procedures to expand access to higher education through the State Higher Education Programme, which provides free education on the campus of New York University and the University of Sanny to students in the United States. \"Excelsior will enter the third and last three years of progressive entry, increasing income eligibility to allow New Yorkers with family income of up to $125,000 to qualify,\" said Komo Don Kaplan. The budget is funded by Excelsior in the amount of $119 million. Last year &apos; s allocation was $118 million. The Excelsior Grant contains several rules to be followed by beneficiaries, including providing that they live in New York State for the duration of the award. The Governor Flanagan said that our state budget provides \"free university education\" to people who are illegally in the United States, and that it does not expand TB grants to the middle class. The budget implements the Dreams Act, which allows undocumented migrants to apply for and receive study assistance programmes if they meet established criteria. However, TAP funding increased by $5.4 million for other students - a slight increase, but still an increase. We evaluate Flanagan's claim mostly true.
