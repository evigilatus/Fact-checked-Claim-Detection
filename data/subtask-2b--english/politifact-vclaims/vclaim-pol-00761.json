That\u2019s because Donald Trump\u2019s president.\"\nThis statement is particularly hard to prove affirmatively. Drug prices are measured through a host of metrics and affected by all sorts of political and economic forces.\nWe reached out to the White House for more explanation. Its staff directed us to a report published last October by its Council of Economic Advisers, as well as to data suggesting the consumer price index for prescription drugs declined in January 2019 compared with January 2018.\nBut experts who reviewed that data said it doesn\u2019t necessarily support Mulvaney\u2019s claim \u2014 and certainly not by the magnitude he suggests.\nA broad brush, and some missing data\nWe interviewed five experts who all agreed that, no matter which metric was used, evidence is lacking to unequivocally say drug prices decreased last year. The most generous reading came from Matthew Fiedler, a health economist at the Brookings Institution: It\u2019s \"within spitting distance of something that\u2019s true.\"\nBut with more examination, the claim\u2019s veracity became murkier.\n\"Drug prices\" can refer to many things: a list price, a net price (what is paid after rebates, or the discounts negotiated by insurers or other payers), the pharmacy\u2019s price or total national spending on prescription drugs.\nLet\u2019s start with the latter. Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows total spending on prescription drug prices has climbed during the past several years. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) In 2018, total spending continued to grow, just at a slower pace. That\u2019s a positive trend, experts noted, but it isn\u2019t the same thing as spending going down.\n\"It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re spending less money on drugs than before,\" said Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University.\nWe also examined the CPI data the White House provided. It could suggest that in the past year prescription drugs\u2019 list prices have indeed dropped, and even by a meaningful amount.\nBut the CPI data doesn\u2019t account for whether manufacturers lowering their list prices have also changed the size of the rebates they provide. That\u2019s essential information in understanding if the real price of a drug \u2014 what insurance pays and, ultimately, what consumers pay \u2014 has actually changed.\nThese trend lines also vary depending on the 12-month period they cover, argued Walid Gellad, an associate health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh. January to January could show a list price decrease, but July to July could show an increase.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlus, the CPI data includes only drugs sold through retail, or about three-fourths of all prescriptions. That excludes many high-priced specialty meds sold only via mail order, argued Michael Rea, who heads Rx Savings Solutions, a consulting firm.\nIt also paints with a broad brush \u2014 obscuring, many said, just how many list prices are continuing to climb.\nThis year, the list price of more than 3,000 drugs went up, while the price of only 117 went down, according to data compiled by Rx Savings Solutions. Last year, an analysis by the Associated Press revealed that, from January to July, 4,412 branded drug prices went up, while 46 were cut.\nSo, Mulvaney\u2019s downward price claim didn\u2019t come out of thin air. But interpreting the data to mean that drug prices are down ignores crucial parts of the prescription drug marketplace.\nThe White House\u2019s work\nMulvaney also said Trump has played a key role in bringing down drug prices. When we asked the administration what he meant, a spokesman pointed to their efforts to bring more generic drugs to market \u2014 a boost the White House said has fueled competition and helped make lower-price alternatives available to consumers.\nBut there\u2019s no evidence yet to suggest that the boost in generic drug approvals has that effect. Experts said it takes time for these products to reach the marketplace, create competition and demonstrate a measurable impact on prices.\nIndeed, many of those generics, while approved, never went to market. This White House assertion also doesn\u2019t account for high-priced, branded drugs that lack a generic counterpart.\nYes, Trump\u2019s tough talk \u2014 accusing pharma companies of \"getting away with murder\" \u2014 may have persuaded some drug manufacturers to hold off on increasing their prices \u2014 at least temporarily, or until after the government releases key stats on how many prices have gone up, Dusetzina said. But it\u2019s hard to separate that phenomenon from the pressure also levied by Congress and state legislatures.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the administration has proposed many new policies meant to curb drug prices, many noted, such as eliminating some kinds of rebates, or changing how Medicare Part B pays for drugs. But none of those have taken effect \u2014 so they haven\u2019t brought prices down.\nOur Ruling\nMulvaney said, \"Drug prices in this country actually came down last year for the first time in 50 years. That\u2019s because Donald Trump\u2019s president.\"\nAt first glance, CPI data could conceivably support the argument that the list prices for some prescription drugs dipped. But that data doesn\u2019t include many high-priced specialty drugs that drive costs up, and the pattern it illustrates can change based on the time frame selected.\nThe CPI data set obscures the individual drugs for which the list prices have increased \u2014 with far more going up than down. It also does not account for a drug\u2019s true \"net price.\"\nMulvaney\u2019s statement also does not reflect trends showing that, nationally, spending on drugs has continued to climb, even if that growth has slowed. There is also no evidence to support the argument that Trump himself is responsible for changes in drug pricing.\nThis claim has an element of truth, but it ignores key facts and context that would give a very different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.\n\u00a0\nThis fact check was reported and edited by Kaiser Health News.
