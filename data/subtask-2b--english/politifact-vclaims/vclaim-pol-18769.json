Ron Johnson confuses and misses on claim about COVID-19 deaths", "text": "U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has raised eyebrows more than once during the coronavirus pandemic.\nEarlier this year, he noted most people survive COVID-19 and argued governments shouldn\u2019t shut down economies to contain the virus. The senator himself tested positive in early October and said he would wear a moon suit if needed to vote in person to confirm Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u00a0\nOn Oct. 21, 2020, Johnson, a Republican, made another comment that turned heads in Wisconsin, where cases of COVID-19 continue to skyrocket and overwhelm hospitals.\u00a0\n\"Unfortunately, we\u2019ve had more deaths, but generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we\u2019ve flattened the curve,\" he said on a call with Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce. \"We\u2019ve gotten better at treating it.\"\nIs he right that deaths are \"pretty flat because we\u2019ve flattened the curve\"?\nLet\u2019s dig in.\u00a0\nCOVID-19 deaths in Wisconsin\nJohnson\u2019s claim came as part of his legislative update for the WMC, the state\u2019s largest business lobby. Here\u2019s his full statement about COVID-19 deaths, which he made after WMC president and CEO Kurt Bauer asked the senator how he was feeling:\u00a0\n\"I think it\u2019s important to note, and I heard a little bit of your earlier presenter, as we\u2019re struggling with, there\u2019s no doubt about it, a surge in cases \u2014 we had another record day yesterday in COVID \u2014 unfortunately, we\u2019ve had more deaths, but generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we\u2019ve flattened the curve, we\u2019ve gotten better at treating it, we know about the anti-inflammatories and steroids and convalescent plasma, which will hopefully be available here shortly.\"\nAccording to the state Department of Health Services, COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wisconsin are at their highest ever. The state\u2019s worst day came Oct. 21 \u2014 the same day Johnson made this claim \u2014 when officials reported 48 deaths, surpassing a previous record of 34 reported on Oct. 13. As of Oct. 22, 2020, the seven-day average for deaths sat at 21.\nIn the spring, by contrast, the number of deaths reported in one day peaked at 22, and the seven-day average never surpassed 13.\n\"Of course the curve has not flattened and we don't have the virus under control,\" Patrick Remington, a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologist and director of the preventive medicine residency program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nFlattened the curve?\nWhen asked for evidence to support the senator\u2019s claim, spokesman Ben Voelkel said Johnson was \"talking about flattening the curve of deaths nationally \u2014 \u2018generally,\u2019 as he puts it.\" Voelkel said that statement is supported by statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the New York Times.\u00a0\nBut Johnson began by mentioning the recent spikes in Wisconsin and was speaking to a group of Wisconsin business leaders, leaving listeners with the impression that he meant death numbers here. He made no attempt to distinguish statewide trends from national.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson also revisited the point during a telephone town hall the next day, saying \"we can see the light at the tunnel nationally on this.\"\n\"We have a dramatic increase in cases in Wisconsin,\" he said. \"And again, the good news is, if you do look at the number of deaths, those have kicked up as well, but it\u2019s still relatively flat. It hasn\u2019t followed the same uptick in terms of number of cases.\"\nLet\u2019s take a look at the national data cited by Johnson\u2019s staff.\u00a0\nAccording to the New York Times, daily reported coronavirus deaths peaked in mid-April, with some days exceeding 2,700 nationwide. More recently, that number ranged from 267 deaths on Sept. 27 to 1,208 on Oct. 21. However, the more telling seven-day average largely stayed in the 700s over the past month.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks deaths weekly, pointed to similar trends: a peak in mid-April followed by a slight increase around August and a decline since early September.\u00a0\nSo, from that perspective, Johnson\u2019s claim is more on point. Deaths have decreased overall since the pandemic\u2019s onset, and seven-day averages reported by the New York Times remained steady in recent weeks even as daily numbers fluctuated.\u00a0\nThere is a problem here, though. Johnson attributes the \"pretty flat\" deaths in part to a flattening of the curve, which typically refers to the number of cases. And the United States clearly has not flattened the curve.\u00a0\nAs Johns Hopkins University has noted, flattening the curve \"involves reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases from one day to the next\" to help prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed.\u00a0\nData from the university show the United States is doing the opposite \u2014 the seven-day average has risen steadily since September.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nOn a call with Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, Johnson said, \"Generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we've flattened the curve.\"\nCases are up nationwide and in Wisconsin, so the curve of new cases has not been flattened. And deaths in Wisconsin are at an all-time high, even if nationally they have been more stable.\u00a0\nA Johnson spokesman argued the senator was referring to national trends when he spoke. However, he made the claim in the context of discussing the situation in Wisconsin, and even if one were to use a national perspective, he\u2019s only partially correct.\nA statement is Mostly False when it contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nThat fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18769"}
