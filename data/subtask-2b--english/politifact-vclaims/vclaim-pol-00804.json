He was discussing the then-current Senate Bill 451 and what the bill could offer both teachers and students. At one point he called improving the state\u2019s education system a moral imperative.\nIn West Virginia, he said, \"our students enter in at fourth grade the first time they\u2019re tested, 37th or 38th in the nation\u2014which is not good, but it\u2019s not horrible.

(We reached out to Carmichael, but he did not respond.)\nWe turned to the Nation\u2019s Report Card, an archive of National Assessment of Educational Progress test scores. NAEP was first administered in 1969 and is the largest continuing, nationally representative assessment of student achievement in such subjects as math, reading, science, and writing\nThe Nation\u2019s Report Card allows users to compare specific states to the nation as a whole in a variety of subjects. This is the main interactive page for West Virginia\u2019s state comparisons.\nThe Nation\u2019s Report Card looks at math and reading scores and organizes states into three categories: \"higher\" than the target state, \"not significantly different\" than the target state, and \"lower\" than the target state. Here\u2019s a chart showing West Virginia\u2019s ranking for fourth graders. The figure shown is the number of states ranked \"higher\" than West Virginia in the year noted.\n\nBy this data, Carmichael is generally in the right ballpark, though scores in recent years have had a wider range than he suggested -- from 30 to 41, rather than 37 or 38.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the chart for eighth graders:\n\nFor eighth grade, the rankings aren\u2019t quite as low as Carmichael had indicated, but he does have the general trend line correct: In most cases, West Virginia\u2019s ranking dropped in math and reading between fourth and eighth grade.\nWhat about testing near the end of high school? The data that\u2019s available makes it difficult to say.\nThere are only two years for which data is available at all -- and for those years, not every state took part.\n\nSo while it looks like West Virginia improved dramatically by the end of high school, there were actually so few states participating that each of these rankings represents a last-place slot for that year.\nSuperficially, this supports Carmichael\u2019s assertion -- that by the end of high school West Virginia students are \"near last.\" But since about two-thirds of the states didn\u2019t participate, we really don\u2019t know for sure how well or poorly West Virginia ranked among all 50 states.\nOur ruling\nCarmichael said that in West Virginia, \"our students enter in at fourth grade the first time they\u2019re tested, 37th or 38th in the nation\u2014which is not good, but it\u2019s not horrible. By the time they\u2019re in the 8th grade, they\u2019re 46th or 47th, and then upon 11th grade testing they\u2019re near last.\"\nJudging by the past six years of NAEP rankings, Carmichael\u2019s specific figures are slightly off for fourth and eighth grades, but the trend he points out -- a decline for West Virginia between fourth and eighth grades -- is accurate and consistent.\nAs for the end of high school, however, while West Virginia does drop to last among participating states, that finding is undercut by the reality that most states did not take part in the testing. That makes it difficult to know how well West Virginia fared nationally.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2019-04-03 23:27:08 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  In West Virginia, \"our students enter in at fourth grade the first time they\u2019re tested, 37th or 38th in the nation\u2014which is not good, but it\u2019s not horrible.
