Facebook users flagged the story as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site's efforts to clear fake news from users' news feeds.\nThe story claims that the doctors found the enzyme nagalase in vaccines, connecting nagalase to cancer, autism and diabetes. The article speculates that the doctors were murdered in order to prevent their findings from going public.\nWe reached out to the website but got no response. (Neonnettle later emailed us to say it deleted the post.)\nTheir argument is that nagalase suppresses the immune system and would therefore be bad if found in vaccines. There have been controversial studies that claim to show that the GcMAF protein, which aims at reduction of nagalase concentration in the body, could be treatment to diseases like cancer, autism, or HIV. These are all diseases where the nagalase level is supposed to be high.\nThat theory lacks scientific evidence, though. The British government has warned against the purchase of GcMAF, since it is not licensed and its production does not adhere to production standards. \u00a0Scientific journals where those theories were published have retracted them, because they are not proven.\nHealthnutnews.com identified five doctors it said were connected to the nagalase discovery. \u00a0But we found little evidence that the deaths of doctors are were connected to the vaccine controversy.\nDr. Bruce Hedendal, a 67-year-old doctor in Florida, was found dead in his car in June 2015. The actual cause of his death is not clear, but natural causes have been cited by Florida local TV stations. Hedendal was a chiropractor, and there are no reports that he was involved in challenging the pharma industry in any way.\nAnother doctor from Florida, Dr. Theresa Ann Sievers, 46, was found murdered in her Florida home in 2015. An\u00a0investigation found that her husband Mark had hired two men, Curtis Wayne Wright Jr. and Jimmy Rodgers, to kill her so he could collect insurance money.\nAgain, her death was not connected to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a follow-up article, healthnutnews.com broadened the theory to include two additional doctors. Dr. Jeffrey Whiteside, 63, went missing after a fight with his wife and was found dead. His death was ruled a suicide.\nDr. Patrick Fitzpatrick,a 74-year-old retired eyedoctor,\u00a0went missing while hiking in Montana. The police searched but never found him. A officer of the Gallatin County Sheriff\u2019s office told the Bismarck Tribune that Fitzpatrick may have suffered from occasional confusion, due to his advanced age. He also said that they had no reason to believe criminal activity was involved in this case.\nThe only person who was actually involved in the vaccination debate was Dr. Jeff Bradstreet, 61. He became controversial for his claim that vaccines could cause autism, a theory that has been refuted by \u00a0several studies. Bradstreet treated his autism patients with the GcMAF protein, which the FDA does not recognize as treatment for autism.\nAccording to the Rutherford County, N.C.. Sheriff\u2019s Office, his wounds appear to be self-inflicted. He was not murdered. But his death in 2015 gave way to a wave of conspiracy theories.\nWhile the article says these doctors died in connection with promoting theories about vaccines, only Bradstreet\u2019s case even comes close. And even that is a stretch.\nAs for sourcing, neonnettle.com refers to thebigriddle.com, which posted the exact story a year ago. Thebigriddle.com cites conspiracyclub.co as its source, a site that doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\nOur ruling\nThe article puts forward a conspiracy theory that is based on the actual deaths of American doctors, but there is no information that they worked together on vaccine discoveries, nor were their deaths connected. \u00a0The conclusions in the article are pure speculation.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.\nUPDATE Feb. 12, 2019: Neonnettle said it deleted the post. We've updated this fact-check to reflect that new information and have changed the headline.\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts   Politifact    6 7  Politifact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Doctors who discovered cancer enzymes in vaccines all found murdered.\"    Internet rumors  Bloggers   In a headline Thursday, March 2, 2017 03/02/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03472"}
