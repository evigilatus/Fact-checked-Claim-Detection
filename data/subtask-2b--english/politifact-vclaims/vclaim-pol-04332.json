It\u2019s now bubbling into the mainstream media.\nWe thought it was time to intervene on one line of thinking.\nIn a tweet on Sept. 11, @Ten_GOP said photos showed Clinton with an \"undercover nurse.\" (The account is not the official account of the Tennessee Republican Party.)\n\nIt didn\u2019t take too long for people to connect the image with an image of Clinton\u2019s personal physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack.\n\nAnd from there, it journeyed to the pages of online newspapers and the accounts of Fox News television personalities.\nHere\u2019s the treatment from the Express of the United Kingdom:\n\nAnd Sean Hannity of Fox News:\n\nAnd Lou Dobbs of Fox Business:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust one problem: The woman pictured is neither Bardack nor an \"undercover nurse.\"\nIt\u2019s a former Clinton staffer, Christine Falvo. Falvo worked in Clinton\u2019s New York Senate office from 2001-09, and also worked with Clinton while she was secretary of state.\nFalvo left the State Department in 2012 to work for Rubenstein Communications.\n\"If there is anything I can ever do to be helpful to you, please don't hesitate to let me know,\" Falvo wrote to Clinton in May 2012. \"I want to be a resource whenever needed!\"\nAccording to the New York Post, Falvo was working as a volunteer advance person for Clinton at the 9/11 event.\nClinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon also identified the woman holding Clinton's hand in the photo as Falvo to the Washington Post. Falvo worked on 9/11 issues while she worked for Clinton in the Senate.\nWe reached out to Falvo and will update this post if we hear back.\nOur ruling\nBloggers started a rumor that photos showed Clinton with an \"undercover nurse\" at the Sept. 11 memorial in New York. The undercover nurse then became Clinton\u2019s personal doctor.\nNeither is true. The woman in the photos is a former Clinton staffer who was helping at the memorial.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/67c3b389-1420-4a7e-bded-8af2eafc7b02", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04332"}
