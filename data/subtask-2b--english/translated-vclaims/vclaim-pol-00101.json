Only last November, voters in Missouri rejected proposal D, which would have increased the State &apos; s gas tax by 10 cents and used funds to boost expenditure on roads and bridges. Without additional funding, the Ministry of Defence relies on federal grant funds to address infrastructure problems such as that posed by the old Missouri Bridges. In his August 29 newsletter, Sam Griffs, R. Moe, announced that the Department of Defense would receive a federal grant of $20.7 million for the State Bridge Replacement Program. To highlight the importance of the challenges, Griffiths said, \"The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old - most of it designed to last only 50 years.\" The problem seems a little severe and dangerous, so we decided to see if the numbers would hold. To some extent, they took judgment from the website of the Ministry of Defence and Religious Affairs. But that doesn't mean it's time to panic every time you drive over a bridge. How old is he? The Ministry of Defence position confirms that the average age of Missouri bridges is 48 years. The average takes into account all bridges from newly constructed bridges to bridges over 48 years of age. How old are Missouri's biggest bridges? We don't know. The engineer of the State Bridge Dennis Hickman pointed to a lack of records around 1900. Some 40 bridges were built before 1909; they are at least 110 years old and may be older. Hickman explained that life design does not mean that the bridge closes or becomes unsafe on its 50th birthday. The design life intended is not a specific expiration date. In fact, it is closer to the date of sale to the date when it indicates when the quality of the bridge needs more accurate control. On August 20, 2015, in comments at the Missouri State Fair, \"Almost nine out of ten pence that will be spent,\" he turned 200 miles from Highway 70 into a toll road \"will be from people outside Missouri.\" By Alison Grieves \u2022 September 29, 2015, \"When they reach that age, you will keep them much more, and you will repair them much more,\" said Hickman. \"They become more maintained\" There is also some variation in the design of the lives of Missouri bridges to take them into account. For decades, Hickman said, the design life for 50 standard years, and about 8,000 bridges 10,400 DOD have a 50-year design life. In the past 10 to 15 years, the design of bridges with a 75-year life span has become more common; some 2,350 bridges have been built according to this standard. For a longer time, river crossing bridges are built with 100 years of design life. Some 50 bridges currently fall into this 100-year design age group. In total, a total of 6,000, or 60 per cent, of the Missouri bridges exceeded their envisaged design period, and Hickman said that the Ministry of Defence's ability to extend these bridges was unique to each bridge and its particular circumstances. But it is the bridge requirement, which is not meant for design life, that determines the course of action of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Defence. The Federal Act requires that all publicly owned highway bridges of more than 20 feet be inspected almost every two years and, at present, 909 bridges inspected by the Ministry of National Defence are classified as weak according to national federal standards for the search of bridges. The poor are the worst estimate the bridge can get and remain open for use. Heckman said that weak bridges lead to weight limits that impede economic development and limit the safety of the population of Missouri. \"The heavy trucks can't use them. Farmers cannot use them when they move their grains or pigs to the market. And so you end up with a lot of turns.\" As he said, many bridges cannot support the weight of a school bus, a fire truck, or an ambulance. Most states only seek to have about 3 to 4% of their bridges ranked poor, as Hickman said. Currently, 9% of Missouri bridges are poor. \"At our current funding levels, we are basically trampling on water,\" said Bob Brendel, Special Task Coordinator of the Ministry of National Defence. \"We basically repair and replace about a number of bridges each year as they fall into the category of poor.\" Our governor Griffiths said, \"The middle bridge in Missouri is 48 years old - most of it designed to last only 50 years.\" This statement comes directly from the data of the Ministry of State Bridges, but needs some clarification. Most bridges need not be replaced when they reach the age of 50. At that time, engineers could have expected that they needed further maintenance. The situation, not the design of life, determines the death of the bridge. With that extra information, we're mostly assessing the claim.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00101"}
