Mayes said reducing the state\u2019s housing costs and its high share of poverty are among his top goals.\nThere\u2019s no doubt California is an expensive place to live. And its housing market has experienced a strong rebound following the Great Recession.\nBut is it fair to say California\u2019s state lawmakers \u2014 who receive the highest base salary of any state legislators in the country at $104,000 \u2014 can\u2019t afford a home in the Golden State?\nWe set out on a fact check.\nOur research\nSeveral economists pointed us to the California Association of Realtors Traditional Housing Affordability Index.\nIt lists California\u2019s median priced single-family home at $515,940, noting the minimum qualifying income to reasonably afford that home is $100,290.\nFor condos, the median price is $418,230 with a minimum qualifying income of $81,290. All figures are based on home sales data from the third quarter in 2016, the most recent period available.\n\nSOURCE:\u00a0California Association of Realtors Traditional Housing Affordability Index.\nAs a comparison, Zillow.com lists the median home value in California at $485,800, through December 31, 2016.\nOn the realtors index, the qualifying income figures assume homebuyers spend no more than one-third of their income on housing, make a 20 percent down payment, and pay the national average interest rate, plus principal, interest, property tax and homeowner\u2019s insurance.\nBased on their salaries, and the supplemental pay lawmakers receive, it\u2019s clear California state lawmakers can afford the state\u2019s median single-family home or condo, and less expensive homes. Notably, California\u2019s state lawmakers receive up to $35,000 per year in per diem to cover their costs while working in Sacramento, including housing. Their flights to and from their districts are also paid by the state.\nHigh coastal costs\nWhen we asked Mayes\u2019 office for evidence to back up his claim, his spokesman Matt Mahon told us the assemblyman is correct if we consider the cost \"to buy a home in a number of California cities.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s different from Mayes\u2019 blanket statement that \"Legislators themselves cannot afford to buy housing in California.\" But, for some context, we decided to examine the range of home costs in the state.\nThe realtors association index places a median priced single family home in the San Francisco Bay Area at $785,980 with a corresponding minimum qualifying income at $152,780. In San Diego, those figures are $589,260 and $114,540, respectively. Prices in other coastal cities, from Santa Cruz to Santa Barbara to Ventura, are also considerably higher than the median.\nState lawmakers, assuming they earned close to base pay, were the sole income earners in their household and had no additional sources of income, would find fewer affordable homes in these markets.\n\"It just depends on where they come from. Maybe in the big cities they would struggle,\" said Anna Scherbina, an associate professor at the UC Davis Graduate School of Management, who studies investment management and behavioral finance.\n\"If Mayes wants to buy a home in Santa Barbara or San Mateo then, yes, he will have some problems. But if he's looking to buy in Bakersfield, the Central Valley, or South Sacramento, he's not going to have too much of a problem,\" added Jesus Hernandez, who lectures at the UC Davis sociology department and has written about housing. \"Mayes is trying to make a point that housing prices are sky high again making it difficult for even middle class folks to buy. And he does have a valid concern.\"\n\nMembers of the California State Assembly take the oath of office. \u00a0File photo / Capital Public Radio\u00a0\nPrices away from the coast\nTaking another look at the realtors\u2019 index, they show the median price of a single family home in Bakersfield was $224,670, with a minimum qualifying income of $43,670. For Sacramento, the median price was $327,040 with a minimum income of $63,570. In the Inland Empire, which includes much of Mayes\u2019 district, the median price was $318,960 which requires a minimum salary of $62,000.\nState lawmaker salaries are on the high-end, not just for lawmakers across the country, but for anyone in California. The state\u2019s median household income was $61,818 in 2015 dollars, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nThrough the third quarter of 2016, just 31 percent of homebuyers in California could afford to purchase the state\u2019s median-priced single family home, according to the realtors\u2019 index. It was the 14th consecutive quarter that the index has been below 40 percent.\nIn addition to their state salaries, many legislators collect income from the small businesses they own, from stocks and rental properties, according to a check of their statements of economic interests. Many also list household income generated by their spouses.\nOur ruling\nAssembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes recently claimed: \"Legislators themselves cannot afford to buy housing in California.\"\nMayes has a point when considering some of California\u2019s priciest coastal cities.\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, it would take a minimum salary of $152,000 to afford a median priced single family home, well above the $104,000 base pay for state legislators.\nBut Mayes did not make this qualification. Instead, he declared legislators in general can\u2019t afford California homes. Based on data from the California Association of Realtors Traditional Housing Affordability Index, that\u2019s just not the case.\nAt $515,000, California\u2019s median priced single family home is expensive. But the salary to reasonably afford that home is $100,290, less than a legislator\u2019s base pay. Many, though not necessarily all, lawmakers have other sources of income including the income of a spouse, or from owning a small\u00a0business, that would increase their purchasing power.\nMayes\u2019 statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nWe rate it Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013\u00a0The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/46718580-8637-4912-acd4-23c6a781b1e5", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03701"}
