John Cassich wiped out his state economic record. In repeated allegations he often made -- including on his campaign site -- Cassish said: \"Ohio took from the $8 billion hole... to a $2 billion surplus.\" We decided to take a closer look. $8 billion hole? There's an argument for $8 billion, but there's also an argument for something like $6 billion, according to a deep dive by a simple Cleveland dealer in 2011. The figure of $8 billion was raised from a $7.7 billion gap between expenditure and projected income. This was a preliminary estimate effective January 2011, based on the assumption made several months ago that there would be no new income growth. However, income grew as the economy recovered that year, reducing the gap to $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion -- an account approved by the Director of the Casish Budget, Tim Kane, in an interview with the newspaper in 2011, although he objected to some methodological details. Whatever the number, Cassich avoided a possible mistake when he spoke of this as a \"hole\" rather than a deficit, because Ohio, like most states, could not face an actual budget deficit. The $8 billion gap is more accurately described as a projected deficit rather than a deficit. Two billion dollar surplus? On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for incineration security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021, this figure is clearer. The State Office of Budget and Management reported in July 2015 that the state \"Tyday's Rainbox\" contained just over $2 billion, which was virtually zero when Kasi\u0107 took office in 2011. Is Cassi\u0107 worthy of praise? It is not unreasonable to give Kasesh some credit for the improvement of the State &apos; s economic wealth - he is the Governor, in the end, and to formulate the State &apos; s fiscal policy in coordination with the legislature. But it is important to remember that he took office at the very beginning of the national economic recovery, and with the improvement of the national economy, the economy of Ohio has also improved. When Casich was inaugurated in January 2011, the unemployment rate in Ohio was 9.2 per cent -- exactly the same as the national rate. Today, the national unemployment rate is 5.3 per cent, and the rate in Ohio is 5.2 per cent. Therefore, Cassesh's timing was lucky. Our governor, Casic, said, \"Ohio took from an eight-billion-dollar hole... to a $2 billion surplus.\" It is possible to argue whether the initial amount should be $6 billion instead of $8 billion. However, Kasi\u0107 did not withdraw this figure from the air, and it was certainly high according to historical criteria. He also used the term \"hole,\" which was more appropriate than \"deficit\" could have been. At the same time, the figure of $2 billion appears to be constant. However, it should be noted that Kasi\u0107 took place slightly when he said \"I\" did so, as the financial improvement in the State received considerable assistance from the national economic recovery. The statement is accurate but requires additional information, so we often appreciate it.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06107"}
