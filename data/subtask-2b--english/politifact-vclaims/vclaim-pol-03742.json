Wade decision.\nA bill, commonly referred to as the Reproductive Health Act, would change state law to guarantee women the choice to have or refuse an abortion or contraception if the Supreme Court reverses Roe v. Wade. Different versions of the bill have been introduced for at least seven years in the Legislature. This year\u2019s debate over the measure included tough questions to the bill\u2019s sponsor, Assemblymember Deborah J. Glick, from members opposed to the bill.\n\"So, if a baby is born intact and alive but has not yet taken its first breath, it has no rights?\" Assemblymember Steven F. McLaughlin asked. \"Is that the position you are taking?\"\n\"New York state law says you are alive when you begin to breathe,\" Glick said. \"That\u2019s not me, that\u2019s just the law.\"\nIs Glick right? Is that the law?\nState abortion law\nGlick said her definition comes from the current state law on abortion.\nThe definition is included in the state\u2019s penal law, or criminal code, which defines the crime of abortion, where someone intentionally causes a pregnancy to be terminated without consent or justification.\nThe law says a person, \"when referring to the victim of a homicide, means a human being who has been born and is alive.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Schmitt\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a news conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jill Terreri Ramos \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo a fetus inside the womb is not considered a person, and therefore does not have rights under state law. That is why someone can legally have an abortion after being pregnant for 24 weeks to preserve the life of the mother.\nState health law\nState health law goes a step further in defining when someone is considered born.\nUnder Public Health Law, live birth is defined as \"the complete expulsion or extraction from its\u00a0mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached; each product of such a birth is considered live born.\"\nIt is up to a medical professional to determine if there is evidence of life in the infant. If the medical professional finds evidence, it is legally considered the birth of a person.\n\"The reality is that if they are born and alive they are a person and have full rights,\" Glick said in a phone interview. \"And that is the determination of a medical person at the time.\"\nOur ruling\nGlick said during an Assembly debate that \"New York state law says you are alive when you begin to breathe.\"\nState law says a person has been born alive when the fetus has exited the woman\u2019s body and shows signs of life. The law specifically mentions breathing as one of the signs. But the law also mentions other evidence of life, such as a beating heart.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim as Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d7c7b893-a127-4f3a-a477-ae2ef6cc526a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03742"}
