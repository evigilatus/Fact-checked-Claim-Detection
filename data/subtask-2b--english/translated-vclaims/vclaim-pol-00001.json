As we criticize Chicago's vulgar cop. \u2219 Eddie Johnson to interrupt his speech to the International Association of Chiefs of Police on Monday, Trump repeated again pants on fire! The claim that the city has the most stringent weapons laws in the country, compared to the violence in Chicago, Afghanistan - as it did in the past with Baltimore - and the claim that the reductions in crime here do not go hand in hand with those taking place at the national level. Trump said, \"For the past two years, the number of murders in America and the major cities of America has fallen, unlike what happened here, by more than 10%.\" \"If we take Chicago's numbers out of our total numbers, the numbers are going to be amazing -- and they are, even in Chicago.\" At the national level, homicides have not decreased as much as the President has said. Moreover, Chicago's comparison conflicts with city and federal data. Chicago has not only witnessed murders of much more than 10% in recent years, but its decline is in competition with a few other large cities. The White House press officials did not respond to our request for comment. Chicago takes the lead, not to fall behind Chicago has experienced 27% fewer murders so far this year than it was at this time two years ago, Chicago Police Department data for mid-October show. However, initial federal data for 2019 are not yet available, so we compared the latest federal data - from 2018 - to 2016 figures. That year Johnson became the best cop in the city. A year of high homicides in Chicago ended with a total of 765 murders, a total of more than the New York City and Los Angeles indices combined. These figures, which are reported by local law enforcement agencies to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Consolidated Crime Reporting Programme, show that Trump did not pay attention to several counts. First, the number of murders reported throughout the country in 2018 was 6.9 per cent lower than in 2016 - not more than 10 per cent, as claimed. Second, the declines in Chicago during the same period from 765 murders to 563 murders were greater than those seen in all but three cities of the country: San Antonio, San Diego and San Jos\u00e9. On January 27, 2021, Marco Rubio stated in his remarks: \"Only in the third world do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders?\" and in the history of Miriam Valverde on January 29, 2021, a shift that has received considerable news coverage over the past two years. In 2018, for example, the Chicago Sun Times reviewed the Federal Bureau of Investigation data for the previous year and found that Chicago alone accounted for 86 per cent of the net decrease from 2016 in national homicides. This remarkable decline is also something Johnson used to defend himself when responding to the Trump attack. \"The President is right about one thing: violent crime in the United States declined last year for the second consecutive year,\" said Johnson at a press conference on Monday. \"But Chicago was the one who set a table for those cuts.\" Ames Growart, who leads the Quantitative Research Team at the Brennan Center for Justice of the New York University School of Law, said that although the killing rate in Chicago is still four times higher than the national average, the city has made significant progress in recent years - something that Tramp's comments ignore. Grawart said, \"He's totally wrong in Chicago.\" \"The city has become safer in the past two years and it is not right to say that Chicago is lagging in the national direction... it is one of the cities that led the downward trend in the last two years.\" In our judgment referring to Chicago, Trump said: \"For the past two years, the number of murders in America and major cities in America has fallen, unlike what happened here, by more than 10%. Chicago has experienced a nearly 30 per cent decline in homicides over the past several years. This far exceeds the national decline of just under 7 per cent. Instead of hindering the nation, as Tramp suggested, Chicago's progress contributed to the national decline in violent crime. We appreciate Trump's demands for fire pants!
