1	Rachel Maddow	We’re in the middle of the fourth presidential impeachment proceedings in our nation’s history.
2	Rachel Maddow	Ambassador Gordon Sondland delivered testimony today in the House impeachment inquiry that buttressed the case that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting with President Zelensky because he wanted the Ukrainian president to announce investigations that would benefit President Trump politically.
3	Rachel Maddow	Senator Warren, you have said already that you’ve seen enough to convict the president, and remove him from office.
4	Rachel Maddow	You and four of your colleagues on this stage tonight who are also US Senators may soon have to take that vote.
5	Rachel Maddow	Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way?
6	Rachel Maddow	And if so, how?
7	Senator Warren	Of course I will.
8	Senator Warren	And the obvious answer is to say, first read the Mueller Report, all 442 pages of it, that showed how the president tried to obstruct justice, and when Congress failed to act at that moment, and that the president felt free to break the law again and again and again.
9	Senator Warren	And that’s what’s happened with Ukraine.
10	Senator Warren	We have to establish the principle, no one is above the law.
11	Senator Warren	We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it.
12	Senator Warren	But I want to add one more part based on today’s testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there?
13	Senator Warren	This is not a man who had any qualifications except one.
14	Senator Warren	He wrote a check a million dollars, and that tells us about what’s happening in Washington.
15	Senator Warren	The corruption, how money buys its way into Washington.
16	Senator Warren	You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they’re going to get ambassadorships on the other side.
17	Senator Warren	And I’ve taken a pledge.
18	Senator Warren	Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don’t ask to be an ambassador, because I’m not going to have that happen.
19	Senator Warren	I asked everyone who’s running for president to join me in that, and not a single person has so far.
20	Senator Warren	I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say, we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder.
21	Rachel Maddow	Senator Warren, thank you, Senator Klobuchar, You’ve said that you support the impeachment inquiry, but you want to wait for a Senate trial to hear the evidence and make a decision about convicting the president.
22	Rachel Maddow	After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?
23	Amy Klobuchar	I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct, and I’ve called for an impeachment proceeding.
24	Amy Klobuchar	I just believe our job as jurors is to look at each count, and make a decision.
25	Amy Klobuchar	But let me make very clear that what this impeachment proceeding about is really our democracy at stake.
26	Amy Klobuchar	This is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine, but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests in front of our country’s interest.
27	Amy Klobuchar	And this is wrong.
28	Amy Klobuchar	This is a pattern with this man, and it goes to everything from how he has betrayed our farmers, and our workers, to what he has done with foreign affairs, leaving the Kurds for slaughter, sucking up to Vladimir Putin every minute of the day.
29	Amy Klobuchar	That is what this guy does.
30	Amy Klobuchar	And I think it is very, very important that we have a president that’s going to put our country first.
31	Amy Klobuchar	I was thinking about this when I was at the Carter Presidential Museum, and on the wall are etched the words of Walter Mondale when he looked back at their four years, not perfect, and he said this, “We told the truth.
32	Amy Klobuchar	We obey the law.
33	Amy Klobuchar	We kept the peace.” We told the truth, we obeyed the law.
34	Amy Klobuchar	We kept the peace.
35	Amy Klobuchar	That is the minimum that we should expect in a President of the United States.
36	Rachel Maddow	Senator, thank you, Senator Sanders, I’d like to go to you.
37	Rachel Maddow	Americans are watching these impeachment hearings.
38	Rachel Maddow	At the same time, they’re also focused on their more immediate, daily, economic, and family concerns.
39	Rachel Maddow	How central should the president’s conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any democratic nominees campaign for president?
40	Rachel Maddow	How central would it be to yours?
41	Bernie Sanders	Well, Rachel, sadly, we have a president who is not only a pathological liar, he is likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America.
42	Bernie Sanders	But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what?
43	Bernie Sanders	We’re going to lose the election.
44	Bernie Sanders	Right now, you’ve got 87 million people who have no health insurance, or under-insured.
45	Bernie Sanders	We are facing the great existential crisis about time in terms of climate change.
46	Bernie Sanders	You got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street, and you got 18 million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing.
47	Bernie Sanders	What the American people understand is that the Congress can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time.
48	Bernie Sanders	In other words, we can deal with Trump’s corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country.
49	Bernie Sanders	We also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt, dominated by a handful of billionaires, and that our economy is rigged with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of America.
50	Bernie Sanders	We can do it all when we rally the American people in the cause of justice.
51	Rachel Maddow	Mayor Budttigieg, let me put the same question to you.
52	Rachel Maddow	How [inaudible 00:05:24] campaign, how central would it be to yours?
53	Pete Buttigieg	Well, the constitutional process of impeachment should be beyond politics, and it is not a part of the campaign, but the president’s conduct is.
54	Pete Buttigieg	The impeachable conduct that we have seen, in the abuse of power that we’re learning more about in the investigations.
55	Pete Buttigieg	But just to be clear, the president’s already confessed to it on television, but that’s just part of what we’ve seen.
56	Pete Buttigieg	Under normal circumstances, a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all, which was the president had to confess, in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans.
57	Pete Buttigieg	We are absolutely going to confront this president for his wrongdoing, but we are also each running to be the president who will lead this country after the Trump Presidency comes to an end, one way or the other.
58	Pete Buttigieg	I’m running to be the president for that day the sun comes up, and the Trump Presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country.
59	Pete Buttigieg	And we are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever, and while doing it, address big issues that didn’t take a vacation for the impeachment process, or for the Trump Presidency as a whole, a climate approaching the point of no return.
60	Pete Buttigieg	The fact that we’ve still got to act on healthcare, kids learning active shooter drills before they learn to read, and an economy where even when the Dow Jones is looking good, far too many Americans have to fight like hell just to hold onto what they’ve got.
61	Rachel Maddow	Mr. Mayor.
62	Pete Buttigieg	Those are the crises that will be awaiting the next president, and will be at the heart of our campaign.
63	Rachel Maddow	Mr Mayor.
64	Rachel Maddow	Thank you.
65	Rachel Maddow	Andrea.
66	Andrea Mitchell	Vice President Biden, you’ve suggested in your campaign that if you defeat President Trump, Republicans will start working with Democrats again.
67	Andrea Mitchell	But right now Republicans in Congress, including some of whom you’ve worked with for decades, are demanding investigations, not only of you but also of your son.
68	Andrea Mitchell	How would you get those same Republicans to work with you?
69	Joe Biden	Well, look, the next President of the United States is going to have to do two things.
70	Joe Biden	Defeat Donald Trump, that’s number one.
71	Joe Biden	And number two, going to have to be able to go into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places, and get a Senate majority.
72	Joe Biden	That’s what I’ll do.
73	Joe Biden	You have to ask yourself up here, who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place, to win the presidency in the first place.
74	Joe Biden	And secondly, who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the house, and in the Senate?
75	Joe Biden	And by the way, I learned something about these impeachment trials.
76	Joe Biden	I learned number one, that Donald Trump doesn’t want me to be the nominee.
77	Joe Biden	That’s pretty clear.
78	Joe Biden	He held up aid to make sure that while at the same time innocent people in [inaudible 00:08:11] are getting killed by Russian soldiers.
79	Joe Biden	Secondly, I found out that Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be president.
80	Joe Biden	So I’ve learned a lot about these things early on from these hearings that are being held.
81	Joe Biden	But the bottom line is, I think we have to ask ourselves the honest question, who is most likely to do what needs to be done?
82	Joe Biden	Produce a democratic majority in the United States Senate, maintain the House, and beat Trump?
83	Andrea Mitchell	Senator Harris, your thoughts about that?
84	Kamala Harris	Well first of all, we have a criminal living in the White House, and there is no question that in 2020, the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment is justice is on the ballot.
85	Kamala Harris	And what we saw today is Ambassador Sondland, by his own words told us that everyone was in the loop.
86	Kamala Harris	That means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the President, from what we heard today, the Vice President, the Secretary of State and the Chief of Staff.
87	Kamala Harris	And so this not only points to the corrupt nature of this administration and the need for these impeachment proceedings to go forward, but it also points to another issue.
88	Kamala Harris	And back to the question that you asked earlier, which is what does this mean for the American people?
89	Kamala Harris	Because what it means when I watch this, is that there are clearly two different set of rules for two different groups of people in America.
90	Kamala Harris	The powerful people, who with their arrogance think they can get away with this, and then everybody else.
91	Kamala Harris	Because here’s the thing.
92	Kamala Harris	For those working people who are working two and three jobs, if they don’t pay that credit card by the end of the month, they get a penalty.
93	Kamala Harris	For the people who don’t pay their rent, they get evicted.
94	Kamala Harris	For the people who shoplift, they go to jail.
95	Kamala Harris	We need the same set of rules for everybody, and part of the reason I’m running for president is to say that we have to bring justice back to America for all people.
96	Kamala Harris	And not just for some.
97	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you, Senator.
98	Andrea Mitchell	Senator Warren, you have cast yourself as a fighter.
99	Andrea Mitchell	If you were elected though, you would be walking into an existing fight, a country that is already very divided over the Trump Presidency, among other things.
100	Andrea Mitchell	Do you see that divide as permanent, or do you need to bring the country together if you become president to achieve your goals?
101	Senator Warren	So I think the way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is we talk about the things that unite us.
102	Senator Warren	And that is, that we want to build an America that works for the people, not one that just works for rich folks.
103	Senator Warren	You know, I have proposed a two cent wealth tax.
104	Senator Warren	That is a tax for everybody who has more than 50 billion dollars in assets.
105	Senator Warren	Your first 50 billion is free and clear.
106	Senator Warren	But your 50 billionth and first dollar, got to pitch in 2 cents.
107	Senator Warren	And when you hit a billion dollars, you’ve got to pitch in a few pennies more.
108	Senator Warren	Here’s the thing, doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone.
109	Senator Warren	It’s about saying you built something great in this country, good for you.
110	Senator Warren	But you did it using workers.
111	Senator Warren	All of us help pay to educate.
112	Senator Warren	You did it using, you’re getting your goods to on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for.
113	Senator Warren	You did it protected by police and firefighters, all of us help pay the salaries for.
114	Senator Warren	So when you make it big, when you make it really big, when you make it top one 10th of 1% big, pitch in 2 cents, so everybody else gets a chance to make it.
115	Senator Warren	And here’s the thing, that’s something that Democrats care about, independents care about, and Republicans care about.
116	Senator Warren	Because regardless of party affiliation, people understand across this country, our government is working better and better for the billionaires, for the rich, for the well-connected, and worse and worse for everyone else.
117	Senator Warren	We come together when we acknowledge that and [crosstalk 00:11:50] real change.
118	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you Senator.
119	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you.
120	Andrea Mitchell	Senator Booker, do you agree with that strategy?
121	Senator Booker	Well, first of all, I think we all agree that we need to bring in a lot more revenue in this country.
122	Senator Booker	We actually have a real problem with the tax rates, tax loopholes, tax cheats, and I don’t agree with the wealth tax the way that Elizabeth Warren puts it, but I agree that we need to raise the estate tax.
123	Senator Booker	We need to tax capital gains as ordinary income.
124	Senator Booker	Real strategies will increase revenue.
125	Senator Booker	But here’s the challenge.
126	Senator Booker	We as Democrats need to fight for a just taxation system.
127	Senator Booker	But as I travel around the country, we Democrats also have to talk about how to grow wealth as well.
128	Senator Booker	When I stood in church recently, and asked folks in a black church, how many people here want to be entrepreneurs?
129	Senator Booker	Half the church raised their hands.
130	Senator Booker	If we as a country don’t start, if we as a party, don’t start talking, not just about how to tax wealth, but to give more people opportunities to create wealth, to grow businesses, to have their American dream.
131	Senator Booker	Because yeah, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, $15 an hour.
132	Senator Booker	But the people in communities I frequent, they’re not aspiration for their lives is not just to have those fair wages.
133	Senator Booker	They want to have an economy that provides not just equalities in wealth, but they want to have equalities of opportunity.
134	Senator Booker	And that’s what our party has to be about as well.
135	Andrea Mitchell	Senator Warren, you wanted to respond?
136	Senator Warren	Sure.
137	Senator Warren	So let me just tell you what we can do with that two cent wealth tax.
138	Senator Warren	Two cents on the top one 10th of 1% in this country, and we can provide universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five.
139	Senator Warren	That is transformative.
140	Senator Warren	We can provide universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in America.
141	Senator Warren	We can stop exploiting the women, largely black and brown women who do this work, and we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America.
142	Senator Warren	We can put 800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools.
143	Senator Warren	We can make college tuition free for every kid.
144	Senator Warren	We can put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities, and we can cancel student loan debt for 95% of the folks who’ve got it.
145	Senator Warren	Two cent wealth tax and we can invest in an entire generation’s future.
146	Andrea Mitchell	All right.
147	Andrea Mitchell	Let me let Senator Booker respond.
148	Senator Warren	Sure.
149	Senator Booker	You know, again, I agree with the need to do all of those things.
150	Senator Booker	We’re all united in wanting to see universal preschool, and I’ll fight for that.
151	Senator Booker	We’re all united in wanting to fund HBCUs.
152	Senator Booker	Heck, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for two parents that went to HBCUs.
153	Senator Booker	But the tax, the way we’re putting the forward right now, the wealth tax, I’m sorry, it’s cumbersome.
154	Senator Booker	It’s been tried by other nations.
155	Senator Booker	It’s hard to evaluate.
156	Senator Booker	We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation.
157	Senator Booker	But again, we as Democrats have got to start talking, not just about how we tax from a stage, but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it.
158	Senator Booker	Look at VC dollars in this country.
159	Senator Booker	75% of them go to the three metropolitan areas.
160	Senator Booker	There is worth in the inner city.
161	Senator Booker	There is value in our rural areas.
162	Senator Booker	If I am President of the United States, we’re going to have a fair just taxation where millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share, but dear God, we’re going to have pathways to prosperity for more Americans.
163	Senator Booker	We’re going to see a change in what we see right now.
164	Senator Booker	Small businesses, new startups are going down in this country.
165	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you, Senator, Senator Warren.
166	Senator Booker	We need to give more new entrepreneurs access to wealth.
167	Andrea Mitchell	Senator Warren, briefly, just your last thoughts on this.
168	Senator Warren	So, just the idea behind what is fair, today the 99% in America are on track to pay about 7.2% of their total wealth in taxes.
169	Senator Booker	I’m not disagreeing with that.
170	Senator Warren	The top one 10th of 1% that I want to say pay two cents more, they’ll pay 3.2% in America.
171	Senator Warren	I’m tired of freeloading billionaires.
172	Senator Warren	I think it’s time that we ask those at the very top to pay more, so that every single one of our children gets-
173	Senator Booker	But everybody is tired of freeloading billionaires.
174	Senator Booker	Everybody’s tired of corporations paying zero taxes, I’m not disagreeing with that.
175	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you very much.
176	Andrea Mitchell	Senator Warren.
177	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you.
178	Andrea Mitchell	Mayor Buttigieg, you have said quote, I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point.
179	Andrea Mitchell	The Republican party never stopped fighting President Obama in his eight years in office.
180	Andrea Mitchell	So what would you do that President Obama didn’t do to change that?
181	Pete Buttigieg	Well, as President Obama commented recently, we are now in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago.
182	Pete Buttigieg	And to me, the extraordinary potential of the moment we’re in right now is that there is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues, that didn’t exist in the same way even a few years ago.
183	Pete Buttigieg	Even on issues where Democrats have been on defense, like immigration, and guns, we have a majority to do the right thing.
184	Pete Buttigieg	If we can galvanize, not polarize that majority.
185	Pete Buttigieg	For example, on healthcare.
186	Pete Buttigieg	The reason I insist on Medicare for all who want it as the strategy to deliver on that goal we share of universal healthcare, is that that is something that as a governing strategy, we can unify the American people around.
187	Pete Buttigieg	Creating a version of Medicare, making it available to anybody who wants it, but without the divisive step of ordering people onto it whether they want to or not.
188	Pete Buttigieg	And I believe that commanding people to accept that option, whether we wait three years as Senator Warren has proposed or whether you do it right out of the gate, is not the right approach to unify the American people around a very, very big transformation that we now have an opportunity to deliver.
189	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you Mr. Mayor.
190	Andrea Mitchell	Kristen Welker.
191	Kristen Welker	Let’s talk about Medicare for all.
192	Kristen Welker	Senator Warren, you are running on Medicare for all, Democrats have been winning elections even in red states with a very different message on health care, protecting Obamacare.
193	Kristen Welker	Democrats are divided on this issue.
194	Kristen Welker	What do you say to voters who are worried that your position on Medicare for all could cost you critical votes in the general elections?
195	Senator Warren	I look out and I see tens of millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their medical bills, 37 million people who decided not to have a prescription filled because they just can’t afford it.
196	Senator Warren	People didn’t take the test the doctor recommended because they just can’t afford it.
197	Senator Warren	So here is my plan.
198	Senator Warren	Let’s bring as many people in and get as much help to the American people as we can, as fast as we can.
199	Senator Warren	On day one, as president, I will do, bring down the cost of prescription drugs on things like insulin and EpiPens.
200	Senator Warren	That’s going to save tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars for people.
201	Senator Warren	I’m going to defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump Administration.
202	Senator Warren	And in the first hundred days, I’m going to bring in 135 million people into Medicare for all at no cost to them.
203	Senator Warren	Everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four, income less than $50,000.
204	Senator Warren	I’m going to lower the age of Medicare to 50 and expand Medicare coverage to include vision and dental and longterm care.
205	Senator Warren	And then in the third year when people have had a chance to feel it, and taste it and live with it, we’re going to vote, and we’re going to want Medicare for all.
206	Kristen Welker	Senator, thank you, Senator.
207	Kristen Welker	Senator Sanders, let me bring you into this conversation-
208	Bernie Sanders	Thank you, I wrote the damn bill.
209	Kristen Welker	And ask you the question, I want to ask you the question this way, Senator Sanders, you describe your campaign including your plans for Medicare for all as a political revolution, President Obama explicitly said the country is quote less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement.
210	Kristen Welker	The average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it, end quote.
211	Kristen Welker	Is President Obama wrong?
212	Bernie Sanders	No, he’s right.
213	Bernie Sanders	We don’t have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want.
214	Bernie Sanders	And the American people understand today that the current healthcare system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional.
215	Bernie Sanders	Now you tell me how we have a system in which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country, and yet we got 87 million uninsured, underinsured, in some cases we pay 10 times more for prescription drugs as do the people of Canada, or other countries.
216	Bernie Sanders	500, 000 people go bankrupt because of medically-related issues, they come down with cancer, and that’s a reason to go bankrupt?
217	Bernie Sanders	Now, some of the people up here think that we should not take on the insurance industry.
218	Bernie Sanders	We should not take on the pharmaceutical industry.
219	Bernie Sanders	But you know what?
220	Bernie Sanders	If you think back to FDR, and if you think to JFK, and Harry Truman, and Barack Obama, as a matter of fact, people have been talking about healthcare for all.
221	Bernie Sanders	Well, you know what?
222	Bernie Sanders	I think now is the time.
223	Bernie Sanders	And in the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for all, Medicare for all, that means no deductibles, no copayments, no out-of-pocket expenses.
224	Bernie Sanders	That’s where we got to go.
225	Kristen Welker	Thank you Senator Sanders.
226	Kristen Welker	Vice President Biden.
227	Joe Biden	You know, we can do this without charging people raising 30, 40 trillion dollars.
228	Joe Biden	The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for all.
229	Joe Biden	It couldn’t pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats.
230	Joe Biden	It couldn’t pass the House.
231	Joe Biden	Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who thinks it makes sense.
232	Joe Biden	We should build on Obamacare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan, and not make people choose.
233	Joe Biden	Allow people to choose I should say.
234	Joe Biden	If you go the route of my two friends on my right and my left, you have to give up your private insurance.
235	Joe Biden	160 million people like their private insurance, and if they don’t like it, they can buy into a Medicare-like proposal.
236	Joe Biden	In my plan, drug prices go down, premiums go down across the board.
237	Joe Biden	But here’s the deal.
238	Joe Biden	They get to choose.
239	Joe Biden	I trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest, and not demand of them what the insurance companies, they want no competition, and my friends say you have to only go Medicare for all.
240	Kristen Welker	Vice President Biden, thank you.
241	Kristen Welker	Ashley.
242	Ashley Parker	Congresswoman Gabbard, you have criticized Hillary Clinton as the quote personification of the rut that has sickened the democratic party.
243	Ashley Parker	What is the rut you see in the democratic party?
244	Tulsi Gabbard	That our democratic party unfortunately is not the party that is of, by, and for the people.
245	Tulsi Gabbard	It is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others foreign policy, by the military industrial complex, and other greedy corporate interests.
246	Tulsi Gabbard	I’m running for president to be the democratic nominee that rebuilds our democratic party, takes it out of their hands and truly puts it in the hands of the people of this country.
247	Tulsi Gabbard	A party that actually hears the voices of Americans who are struggling all across this country, and puts it in the hands of veterans and fellow Americans who were calling for an end to this ongoing Bush, Clinton, Trump, foreign policy, doctrine of regime change wars, overthrowing dictators in other countries, needlessly sending my brothers and sisters in uniform into harm’s way to fight in wars that actually undermine our national security, and have cost us thousands of American lives.
248	Tulsi Gabbard	These are Wars that have cost us as American taxpayers, trillions of dollars since 9/11 alone, dollars that have come out of our pockets, out of our hospitals, out of our schools, out of our infrastructure needs.
249	Tulsi Gabbard	As president, I will end this foreign policy, end these regime change wars, work to end this new cold war and arms race, and instead invest our hard earned taxpayer dollars actually into serving needs of the American people right here at home.
250	Ashley Parker	Thank you congresswoman.
251	Ashley Parker	Senator Harris, any response?
252	Kamala Harris	Oh, sure.
253	Kamala Harris	I think that it’s unfortunate that we have someone on the stage who is attempting to be the democratic nominee for President of the United States, who during the Obama administration spent four years, full-time on Fox news criticizing President Obama.
254	Tulsi Gabbard	That’s ridiculous Senator Harris.
255	Kamala Harris	Who had spent full-time criticizing people on this stage, as affiliated with the democratic party, when Donald Trump was elected, not even sworn in, buddied up to Steve Bannon to get a meeting with Donald Trump in the Trump Tower, fails to call a war criminal by what he is as a war criminal, and then spends full time during the course of this campaign, again, criticizing the democratic party.
256	Kamala Harris	What we need on the stage on the November is someone who has the ability to win, and by that we need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump, and someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition, and bring the party and the nation together, I believe I am that candidate.
257	Ashley Parker	Thank you Senator.
258	Ashley Parker	Congresswoman Gabbard, I’ll give you a chance to respond.
259	Tulsi Gabbard	What Senator Harris is doing is unfortunately continuing to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I’m making the leadership and the change that I’m seeking to bring in our foreign policy, which only makes me guess that she will, as president, continue the status quo.
260	Tulsi Gabbard	Continue the Bush/Clinton/ Trump foreign policy of regime change wars, which is deeply destructive.
261	Tulsi Gabbard	This is personal to me, because I served in Iraq.
262	Tulsi Gabbard	I left my seat in the state legislature in Hawaii, volunteered to deploy to Iraq where I served in a medical unit where every single day I saw the terribly high human cost of war.
263	Tulsi Gabbard	I take very seriously the responsibility that the president has to serve as Commander in Chief, to lead our armed forces, and to make sure always, no, I’m not going to put party interests first.
264	Tulsi Gabbard	I will put the interests of the American people above all else.
265	Ashley Parker	Thank you Congresswoman.
266	Ashley Parker	I want to briefly give Senator Harris a final second to respond.
267	Kamala Harris	I believe that what our nation needs right now is a nominee who can speak to all people.
268	Kamala Harris	I spent my entire career standing mostly in a courtroom, speaking five words, Kamala Harris for the people.
269	Kamala Harris	And it was about all the people, regardless of their race, regardless of their gender, regardless of where they live geographically, regardless of the party with which they’re registered to vote, or the language their grandmother speaks.
270	Kamala Harris	We need someone on this debate stage in November who has the ability to unify the country, and to win the election, and I believe again, I am that candidate.
271	Ashley Parker	Thank you, Senator.
272	Kamala Harris	Thank you.
273	Ashley Parker	Mr. Steyer, You have denounced the special interests that pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the political process to influence it, but in fact you have spent over $300 million of your own money in support of your political goals.
274	Ashley Parker	How do you respond to critics who see you is the embodiment of a special interest?
275	Tom Steyer	What I’ve done over the last decade is to put together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to take on unchecked corporate power.
276	Tom Steyer	We have a broken government in Washington DC.
277	Tom Steyer	It’s been purchased by corporations.
278	Tom Steyer	Over the last decade, with the help of the American people, we have taken on and beaten the oil companies, we have taken on and beaten the tobacco companies, we’ve taken on and beaten utilities, we’ve taken on and beaten the drug companies.
279	Tom Steyer	I’ve also built one of the largest grassroots organizations in the United States.
280	Tom Steyer	Last year, NextGen America did the largest youth voter mobilization in American history.
281	Tom Steyer	I also, in partnership with seven national unions, knocked on 15 million doors in 2016, and 10 million in 2018.
282	Tom Steyer	What I’ve done is to try to push power down to the American people, to take power away from the corporations who’ve bought our government.
283	Tom Steyer	And I’m talking now about structural reform in Washington DC.
284	Tom Steyer	Term limits.
285	Tom Steyer	If you want bold change in the United States, you’re going to have to have new and different people in charge.
286	Tom Steyer	I’m the only person on this stage who will talk about term limits.
287	Tom Steyer	Vice President Biden won’t.
288	Tom Steyer	Senator Sanders won’t, even Mayor Pete Buttigieg will not talk about term limits and structural change.
289	Tom Steyer	I would let the American people pass laws themselves through direct democracy.
290	Tom Steyer	It’s time to push the power back to the people-
291	Ashley Parker	Thank you Mr. Steyer.
292	Tom Steyer	And away from DC.
293	Ashley Parker	Mr. Steyer, thank you.
294	Ashley Parker	Senator Klobuchar, a brief response.
295	Amy Klobuchar	Well, I’m someone that doesn’t come from money and I appreciate the work of Mr. Steyer, but right now we have a system that’s not fair.
296	Amy Klobuchar	And it’s not just fair for money, and so what I would do is start a constitutional amendment, and pass it to overturn Citizens United.
297	Amy Klobuchar	That’s what we should do so that we stop this dark money and outside money from coming into our politics.
298	Amy Klobuchar	I have led the way on voting, and I can tell you right now, one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn 18.
299	Amy Klobuchar	If we had a system like this, and we did something about gerrymandering, and we stopped the voting purges, and we did something significant about making sure we don’t have money in politics from the outside, Stacey Abrams would be governor of this state right now.
300	Ashley Parker	Thank you Senator.
301	Amy Klobuchar	And that’s what should have happened.
302	Amy Klobuchar	So while I appreciate his work, I am someone that doesn’t come from money.
303	Amy Klobuchar	I see my husband out there, my first Senate race, I literally called everyone I knew and I set what is still an all-time Senate record.
304	Amy Klobuchar	I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends.
305	Amy Klobuchar	And I’d like to point out, it is not an expanding base.
306	Amy Klobuchar	So I don’t just think this with my head, I feel it in my heart.
307	Ashley Parker	Thank you Senator Klobuchar.
308	Ashley Parker	Mr. Yang-
309	Tom Steyer	Since I was named, I’d like to chime in here.
310	Ashley Parker	Mr. Yang, you’ve made a virtue of your outsider status.
311	Ashley Parker	You’ve never served in the military, or in government.
312	Ashley Parker	What has prepared you to respond to a terrorist attack or a major disaster?
313	Andrew Yang	Well first, I just want to stick up for Tom.
314	Andrew Yang	We have a broken campaign finance system, but Tom has been spending his own money fighting climate change, and you can’t knock someone for having money and spending it in the right way, my opinion.
315	Tom Steyer	Thanks Andrew.
316	Andrew Yang	Yeah, no problem.
317	Andrew Yang	As Commander in Chief, I think we need to be focused on the real threats of the 21st century.
318	Andrew Yang	And what are those threats?
319	Andrew Yang	Climate change, artificial intelligence, loose nuclear material, military drones, and non-state actors.
320	Andrew Yang	And if you look up, we’re in the process of potentially losing the AI arms race to China right now.
321	Andrew Yang	Because they have more access to more data than we do, and their government is putting billions of dollars to work subsidizing the development of AI in a way that we are not.
322	Andrew Yang	We are 24 years behind on technology, and I can say that with authority, because we got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995.
323	Andrew Yang	Think about that timing.
324	Andrew Yang	I guess they thought they’d invented everything.
325	Andrew Yang	The next Commander in Chief has to be focused on the true threats of tomorrow, and that’s what I’ll bring to the table as commander in chief.
326	Ashley Parker	Thank you, Mr. Yang.
327	Ashley Parker	Andrea?
328	Andrea Mitchell	Mayor Buttigieg, let’s talk about your record as a candidate.
329	Andrea Mitchell	You were elected mayor in a democratic city, receiving just under 11,000 votes.
330	Andrea Mitchell	And in your only statewide race, you lost by 25 points.
331	Andrea Mitchell	Why should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?
332	Pete Buttigieg	Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump.
333	Pete Buttigieg	I get that it’s not traditional establishment Washington experience, but I would argue we need something very different right now.
334	Pete Buttigieg	In order to defeat this president, we need somebody who can go toe to toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that he’s been appealing to.
335	Pete Buttigieg	I don’t talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them.
336	Pete Buttigieg	I don’t even golf.
337	Pete Buttigieg	As a matter of fact, I never thought I’d be on a Forbes Magazine list, but they did one of all the candidates by wealth, and I am literally the least wealthy person on this stage.
338	Pete Buttigieg	I also wore the uniform of this country, and know what is at stake in the decisions that are made in the Oval Office, in The Situation Room.
339	Pete Buttigieg	And I know how to bring people together to get things done.
340	Pete Buttigieg	I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small, but frankly where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small.
341	Pete Buttigieg	The usual way of doing business in Washington is what looks small, and I believe we to send somebody in who has a different kind of experience, the experience on the ground, solving problems, working side by side with neighbors on some of the toughest issues that come up in government.
342	Pete Buttigieg	Recognizing what is required of executive leadership, and bringing that to Washington so that Washington can start looking a little more like our best run communities in the Heartland, before the other way around starts to happen.
343	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you Mayor.
344	Pete Buttigieg	…Communities in the Heartland before the other.
345	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you, mayor.
346	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you, mayor.
347	Andrea Mitchell	Senator Klobuchar, you said this of mayor Buttigieg.
348	Andrea Mitchell	Quote: “Of the women on the stage.
349	Andrea Mitchell	Do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience he had?
350	Andrea Mitchell	No, I don’t.
351	Andrea Mitchell	Maybe we’re held to a different standard.” Senator, what did you mean by that?
352	Amy Klobuchar	First of all, I’ve made very clear, I think that Pete is qualified to be up on this stage and I am honored to be standing next to him.
353	Amy Klobuchar	But what I said was true.
354	Amy Klobuchar	Women are held to a higher standard, otherwise we could play a game called name your favorite woman president, which we can’t do because it has all been men and including all vice presidents being men and I think any working woman out there, any woman that’s at home knows exactly what I mean.
355	Amy Klobuchar	We have to work harder and that’s a fact, but I want to dispel one thing because for so long, why has this been happening?
356	Amy Klobuchar	I don’t think you have to be the tallest person on this stage to be president.
357	Amy Klobuchar	I don’t think you have to be the skinniest person.
358	Amy Klobuchar	I don’t think you have the loudest voice on the stage.
359	Amy Klobuchar	I don’t think that means that you will be the one that should be precedent.
360	Amy Klobuchar	I think what matters is if you’re smart, if you’re competent and if you get things done.
361	Amy Klobuchar	I am the one that has passed over a hundred bills as the lead Democrat in that gridlock of Washington in Congress on this stage.
362	Amy Klobuchar	I think you’ve got to win and I am the one Mr. Vice president that has been able to win every red and purple congressional district as the lead on a ticket every time.
363	Amy Klobuchar	I governed both with my head and my heart and if you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.
364	Andrea Mitchell	Mr. Vice president, just a quick response.
365	Joe Biden	I think a woman’s qualified to be president and there’s no reason why.
366	Joe Biden	If you think the woman is the most qualified person now you should vote for them.
367	Joe Biden	The reason why I think I should be president and be the nominee is number one, I have brought people together my entire career.
368	Joe Biden	In the United States Senate, I’ve passed more major legislation than everybody on this stage combined.
369	Joe Biden	From the violence against women act, to making sure we have the chemical weapons treaty to did to dealing with Milosevic.
370	Joe Biden	The whole range of things that I’ve been engaged in my whole career.
371	Joe Biden	I’ve done it.
372	Joe Biden	I’ve brought people together.
373	Joe Biden	I’m always told by everybody on here, things have changed.
374	Joe Biden	You can’t do that anymore.
375	Joe Biden	If we can’t.
376	Joe Biden	I thought the question was initially ask of the Senator, how do you unify this country?
377	Joe Biden	We have to unify this country.
378	Joe Biden	I have done it.
379	Joe Biden	I have done it repeatedly and lastly to be commander in chief, there’s no time for on the job training.
380	Joe Biden	I’ve spent more time in the situation room, more time abroad, more time than anybody up here.
381	Joe Biden	I know every major world leader, they know me and they know when I speak.
382	Joe Biden	If I’m the president United States who were four who were against and what we’ll do and we’ll keep our word.
383	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you.
384	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you, vice president.
385	Andrea Mitchell	Ashley.
386	Ashley Parker	Senator Booker, one of the defining characteristics of the Trump is that the American people hear from him directly all the time about everything on Twitter and just about everywhere else.
387	Ashley Parker	Setting aside your views of his tone, is that unfiltered communication, something you as president would continue?
388	Ashley Parker	Is this one of the norms broken by president Trump that needed to change?
389	Senator Booker	So look, this president has broken norms as you’ve said.
390	Senator Booker	He used this platform to demean, degrade and divide this country in ways that are repugnant and appalling.
391	Senator Booker	But the next president, whoever they are, is going to have to be someone who can heal and bring this nation together, this whole nation.
392	Senator Booker	So absolutely in that office, I will do whatever it takes to make sure we bring this country together.
393	Senator Booker	But it’s not for a kumbaya moment.
394	Senator Booker	We are a nation that achieves great things when we stand together and work together and fight together.
395	Senator Booker	So absolutely.
396	Senator Booker	When I was mayor of the largest city in my state, and this is where I agree with mayor Pete.
397	Senator Booker	Mayoral experience is very important.
398	Senator Booker	And I happened to be the other road scholar mayor on this stage.
399	Senator Booker	And what I learned there is that you have to be an executive that can heal.
400	Senator Booker	In my city, we have racial divides.
401	Senator Booker	We have geographic divides that go from wealth to people that are struggling.
402	Senator Booker	The success of my city was because we brought us all together and did things that other people said couldn’t be done.
403	Senator Booker	When I am president United States, my campaign from the very beginning has not changed.
404	Senator Booker	My charge is to see a nation right now, which has so much common pain to channel that back into a sense of common purpose and I will do whatever it takes.
405	Senator Booker	Bringing creativity to that office like has never been seen before.
406	Ashley Parker	Thank you, senator.
407	Ashley Parker	Rachel.
408	Rachel Maddow	Chants of lock her up are still heard at president Trump’s rallies today.
409	Rachel Maddow	Now, some opponents of the president are turning the same slogan against him.
410	Rachel Maddow	They’ve chanted, lock him up at a recent World Series game in Washington and at a Veterans Day event in New York and Senator Sanders at at least two of your campaign events recently.
411	Rachel Maddow	Senator, should Democrats discourage this or are you okay with it?
412	Bernie Sanders	Well, I think the people of this country are catching on to the degree that this president thinks he is above the law.
413	Bernie Sanders	And what the American people are saying, “Nobody is above the law” and I think what the American people are also saying is in fact, that if this president did break the law, he should be prosecuted like any other individual who breaks the law.
414	Bernie Sanders	But at the end of the day, what we need to do is to bring our people together, not just in opposition to Trump.
415	Bernie Sanders	The initial question I think that you wrote, that somebody raised him was that we are a divided nation.
416	Bernie Sanders	You know what?
417	Bernie Sanders	I kind of reject that.
418	Bernie Sanders	I think when you talk about the pain of working families in this country, majority of the American people want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage.
419	Bernie Sanders	When you talk about the climate crisis, the overwhelming majority of the American people know that it is real.
420	Bernie Sanders	They know we have to take on the fossil fuel industry.
421	Bernie Sanders	They know we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
422	Bernie Sanders	Even on issues like guns, the American people are coming together to end the horrific level of gun violence.
423	Bernie Sanders	So I believe, yep, we’ve got to deal with Trump, but we also have to have an agenda that brings our people together so that the wealth and income doesn’t just go to the people on top, but to all us.
424	Rachel Maddow	Vice president Biden, let me ask you to pick up on the issue that Senator Sanders just raised about no one being above the law.
425	Rachel Maddow	When president Ford pardoned president Nixon, he said it was to heal the country.
426	Rachel Maddow	Would you support a potential criminal investigation into president Trump after he leaves office?
427	Rachel Maddow	Even if you thought it might further inflame the country’s divisions?
428	Joe Biden	Look, I would not direct my justice department like this president does.
429	Joe Biden	I’d let them make their independent judgment.
430	Joe Biden	I would not dictate who should be prosecuted or who should be exonerated.
431	Joe Biden	That’s not the role of the president of the United States.
432	Joe Biden	It’s the attorney general of the United States, not the president’s attorney private attorney.
433	Joe Biden	And so I would whatever was determined by the attorney general, I supported, that I appointed, let them make an independent judgment.
434	Joe Biden	If that was the judgment that he violated the law and he should be in fact criminally prosecuted then so be it.
435	Joe Biden	But I would not direct it and I don’t think it’s a good idea that we model ourselves after Trump and say, “lock him up.” Look, we have to bring this country together.
436	Joe Biden	Let’s start talking civilly to people and tweeting.
437	Joe Biden	The next president starts tweeting should… Anyway, it just, we look, it’s about civility.
438	Joe Biden	We have to restore the soul of this country and that’s not who we are.
439	Joe Biden	That’s not who we’ve been.
440	Joe Biden	That’s not who we should be.
441	Joe Biden	Follow the law.
442	Joe Biden	Let the justice department make the judgment as to whether or not someone should be prosecuted, period.
443	Rachel Maddow	Senator Sanders, let me ask you briefly to respond to that.
444	Rachel Maddow	The difference of opinion there with vice president Biden.
445	Bernie Sanders	Well, I think Joe is right.
446	Bernie Sanders	I think that is the function of the attorney general, but what I am of the opinion is that the American people now do believe, and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television, they do believe that we have a president who thinks he’s above the law.
447	Bernie Sanders	We have a president who is engaged in corruption.
448	Bernie Sanders	We have a president who was obstructed justice, and in my view, somebody was a violated the emoluments clause.
449	Bernie Sanders	I think Joe is right.
450	Bernie Sanders	That is the function of an independent department of justice, but my inclination is that the American people do believe that this president is in violation of the law.
451	Joe Biden	Can I respond very quickly?
452	Rachel Maddow	Briefly, senator.
453	Joe Biden	Distinction, should he be impeached and should it be thrown out of office?
454	Joe Biden	That’s one question.
455	Joe Biden	He’s very close to impeaching… He’s indicted himself.
456	Joe Biden	Number two, after he’s thrown out of office or after he’s defeated, should he be then prosecuted?
457	Joe Biden	Should he be prosecuted for a criminal offense while he was president?
458	Joe Biden	That’s a judgment to be made by an attorney general.
459	Rachel Maddow	Mr. vice president, thank you.
460	Rachel Maddow	Ashley.
461	Ashley Parker	We now focus on an issue facing and many Americans, childcare and paid family leave.
462	Ashley Parker	Here in Georgia, the average price of infant daycare can be as much as $8,500 per child per year.
463	Ashley Parker	That’s more than in state tuition at a four year public college in Georgia.
464	Ashley Parker	Mr. Yang, what would you do as president to ease that financial burden?
465	Andrew Yang	There are only two countries in the world that don’t have paid family leave for new moms, the United States of America and Papua New Guinea, that is the entire list and we need to get off this list as soon as possible.
466	Andrew Yang	I would pass paid family leave is one of the first things we do.
467	Andrew Yang	I have two kids myself who are four and seven, one of whom is autistic and has special needs and it’s breaking families backs.
468	Andrew Yang	We need to start supporting our kids and families from the beginning because by the time they’re showing up to Pre-K and kindergarten, in many cases, they’re already years behind.
469	Andrew Yang	Studies have shown that two thirds of our kids’ educational outcomes are determined by what’s happening to them at home.
470	Andrew Yang	This is stress levels, number of words, read to them as children type of neighborhood, whether a parent has time to spend with them.
471	Andrew Yang	So we need to have a freedom dividend in place from day one, $1,000 a month for every American adult, which would put in many cases, $2,000 a month into families pockets so that they can either pay for childcare or if they want stay home with the child.
472	Andrew Yang	We should not be pushing everyone to leave the home and go to the workforce.
473	Andrew Yang	Many parents see that trade off and say if they leave the home and work, they’re going to be spending all the money on childcare anyway.
474	Andrew Yang	In many cases, it’d be better if the parents stays home with the child.
475	Ashley Parker	Thank you, Mr. Yang.
476	Ashley Parker	Sticking with this topic, no parent in the United States is federally guaranteed a single day of paid leave when they have a new baby.
477	Ashley Parker	A number of you on stage tonight have plans to address this.
478	Ashley Parker	Senator Harris, you’re one of the candidates proposing legislation to guarantee up to six months of paid family leave and Senator Klobuchar, you’re one of the candidates proposing up to three months.
479	Ashley Parker	I want to hear from both of you on this, starting with you Senator Klobuchar, why three months?
480	Amy Klobuchar	I looked at this economically and I want to make sure of that.
481	Amy Klobuchar	We help people because it’s just pointed out we are way behind the curve, our country is when it to providing paid family leave and childcare.
482	Amy Klobuchar	We must do this and we will do this if we have the right person heading up the ticket so we can win big.
483	Amy Klobuchar	But what I had done with all of my plans is I have showed how I’m going to pay for them meticulously.
484	Amy Klobuchar	I think that is really, really important when we have a president in the white house right now who have told over 10,000 lies.
485	Amy Klobuchar	So when you look at my website at amyklobuchar.com you will see my plans and you’re also going to see how I’m going to pay for it.
486	Amy Klobuchar	And I think that is so important because this president is literally increasing the debt, treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in a bankrupt casino and really putting this country in a worse financial situation every single day.
487	Amy Klobuchar	So yes, my plan is three months.
488	Amy Klobuchar	I think that’s good.
489	Amy Klobuchar	I’d love to do more.
490	Amy Klobuchar	As I’ve said before, I’d love to staple free diplomas under people’s chairs.
491	Amy Klobuchar	I just am not going to go for things, and this is not, I’m not talking about Senator Harris’s plan here.
492	Amy Klobuchar	But I’m talking about some of the other ideas that have been out here.
493	Amy Klobuchar	I am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car.
494	Amy Klobuchar	I think that we have an obligation, we have an obligation as a party to be yes, fiscally responsible.
495	Amy Klobuchar	Yes, think big, but make sure we have people’s backs and are honest with them about what we can pay for and that is everything from sending rich kids to college for free, which I don’t support to kicking 149 million off their health insurance for health insurance in four years.
496	Amy Klobuchar	I just think we have to be smart about how we do this.
497	Ashley Parker	Thank you, Senator and Senator Harris, why six months and also how would you pay for that?
498	Kamala Harris	Sure.
499	Kamala Harris	Everybody please visit my website, kamalaharris.org for the details on everything I talk about.
500	Kamala Harris	Six months, so part of how I believe we’re going to win this election is it is going to be because we are focused on the future.
501	Kamala Harris	We are focused on the challenges that are presented today and not trying to bring back yesterday to solve tomorrow.
502	Kamala Harris	So on paid family leave, it is no longer the case in America that people are having children in their 20s.
503	Kamala Harris	People are having children in their 30s often in their 40s, which means that these families and parents are often raising young children and taking care of their parents.
504	Kamala Harris	Which requires a lot of work from traveling back and forth to a hospital to daycare, to all of the activities that are required, much less the healthcare needs that are required.
505	Kamala Harris	And what we are seeing in America today is the burden principally falls on women to do that work.
506	Kamala Harris	And many women are having to make a very difficult choice whether they’re going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family, or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on.
507	Kamala Harris	So six months paid family leave is meant to and is designed to adjust to the reality of women’s lives today.
508	Kamala Harris	The reality also is that women are not paid equal for equal work in America.
509	Kamala Harris	We pass the Equal Pay Act in 1963 but fast forward to the year of our Lord 2019 and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar.
510	Kamala Harris	Black women, 61 cents, Native American women, 58 cents Latinos, 53 cents.
511	Kamala Harris	So, but so my policy is about, there’s a whole collection of work that I’m doing that is focused on women and working women in America and the inequities and therefore the injustice that women in America are facing that needs to be resolved and addressed.
512	Ashley Parker	Thank you, senator.
513	Ashley Parker	Kristen.
514	Kristen Welker	Mr. Steyer, millions of working Americans are finding that housing has become unaffordable, especially in metropolitan areas.
515	Kristen Welker	It is particularly acute in your home state of California and places like Los Angeles and San Francisco.
516	Kristen Welker	Why are you the best person to fix this problem?
517	Tom Steyer	When you look at inequality in the United States of America, you have to start with housing.
518	Tom Steyer	Where you put your head at night determines so many things about your life.
519	Tom Steyer	It determines where your kids go to school.
520	Tom Steyer	It determines the air you breathe, where you shop, how long it takes you to get to work.
521	Tom Steyer	What we’ve seen in California is as a result of policy, we have millions too few housing units and that affects everybody in California.
522	Tom Steyer	It starts with a homeless crisis that goes all through the state, but it also includes skyrocketing rents that affect every single working person in the state of California.
523	Tom Steyer	I understand exactly what needs to be done here, which is we need to change policy and we need to apply resources here to make sure that we build literally millions of new units.
524	Tom Steyer	But the other thing that’s going to be true about building these units is we’re going to have to build them in a way that’s sustainable.
525	Tom Steyer	That in fact, how we build units where people live has a dramatic impact on climate and on sustainability.
526	Tom Steyer	So we are going to have to direct dollars, we’re going to have to change policy and make sure that the localities and municipalities who’ve worked very hard to make sure that there are no new housing units built in their towns, that they have to change that and we’re going to have to force it and then we’re going to have to direct federal dollars to make sure that those units are affordable so that working people can live in places and not be spending 50% of their income on rent.
527	Kristen Welker	Thank you.
528	Kristen Welker	Mr Cyrus.
529	Kristen Welker	Senator Warren.
530	Kristen Welker	I see your hand raised.
531	Senator Warren	Yes.
532	Senator Warren	Think of it this way.
533	Senator Warren	Our housing problem in America is a problem on the supply side and that means that the federal government stopped building new housing a long time, affordable housing.
534	Senator Warren	Also private developers, they’ve gone up to the mansions.
535	Senator Warren	They’re not building the little two bedroom, one bath house that I grew up in, garage converted to be a bedroom for my three brothers.
536	Senator Warren	So I’ve got a plan.
537	Senator Warren	For 3.2 million new housing units in America, those are housing units for working families for the working poor, for the poor poor for seniors who want to age in place for people with disabilities.
538	Senator Warren	For people who are coming back from being incarcerated.
539	Senator Warren	It’s about tenants rights, but there’s one more piece.
540	Senator Warren	Housing is how we build wealth in America.
541	Senator Warren	The federal government has subsidized the purchase of housing for decades for white people and has said for black people, “You’re cut out of the deal.” That was known as red lining when I built a housing plan.
542	Senator Warren	It’s not only a housing plan about building new units, it’s a housing plan about addressing what is wrong about government sponsored discrimination, how we need to address it and we need to say we’re going to reverse it.
543	Kristen Welker	Thank You, Senator, Senator Booker.
544	Senator Booker	I’m so grateful again as a mayor, who was a mayor during the recession, who was a mayor during a housing crisis who started my career as a tenants’ rights lawyer.
545	Senator Booker	This are all good points, but we’re not talking about something that is going on all over America, which is gentrification and low income families being moved further and further out, often compounding racial segregation.
546	Senator Booker	And so all of these things, we need to put more federal dollars in it, but we’ve got to start empowering people.
547	Senator Booker	We use our tax code to move wealth up the mortgage interest deduction.
548	Senator Booker	My plan is very simple.
549	Senator Booker	If you’re a renter who pays more than a third of your income in rent, then you will get a refundable tax credit between the amount you’re paying in the area meeting your rent.
550	Senator Booker	That empowers people in the same way we empower homeowners and what that does is it actually slashes poverty.
551	Senator Booker	10 million people out, and by the way, for those people who are facing eviction, it is about time that the only people when they show up in rentals court that have a lawyer is not the landlord.
552	Senator Booker	It is also low income families struggling to stay in their home.
553	Kristen Welker	Thank you, Senator.
554	Kristen Welker	Rachel.
555	Rachel Maddow	We’re going to take a quick break, but we will be right back with these candidates from the MSNBC Washington Post Democratic Candidates Debate in Atlanta, Georgia.
556	Rachel Maddow	Stay with us.
557	Rachel Maddow	Welcome back to the MSNBC Washington Post Democratic Candidates Debate.
558	Rachel Maddow	Let’s get right back into it.
559	Rachel Maddow	American farmers are struggling under the effects of president Trump’s trade war with China.
560	Rachel Maddow	The Trump administration’s payments to farmers to offset those losses, already have a price tag that is more than double what was spent on the Obama administration’s auto bailout.
561	Rachel Maddow	Mayor Buttigieg, would you continue those farm subsidies?
562	Pete Buttigieg	We shouldn’t have to pay farmers to take the edge off of a trade war that shouldn’t have been started in the first place.
563	Pete Buttigieg	I will support farmers, but not long ago I was in Boone, Iowa, a guy came up to me, he said, “I got my Trump bailout check, but I would have rather spent that money on conservation.” By the way, this isn’t even making farmers whole.
564	Pete Buttigieg	If you’re in soybeans, for example, you’re getting killed and it’s not just what this president’s done with the trade war and a lot of parts of the country.
565	Pete Buttigieg	The worst thing is these so-called small refinery waivers, which are killing those who were involved in ethanol.
566	Pete Buttigieg	Look, I don’t think this president cares one bit about farmers.
567	Pete Buttigieg	He keeps asking them to take one for the team, but more and more I’m talking to people in rural America who see that they’re not going to benefit from business as usual under this president.
568	Pete Buttigieg	I believe that so many of the solutions lie with American farmers, but we have to stand up for them not just with direct subsidies and support, but with making sure we do something about the consolidation, the monopolies that leave farmers with fewer places to purchase supplies from and fewer places to sell their product to, and American farming should be one of the key pillars of how we combat climate change.
569	Pete Buttigieg	I believe that the quest for the carbon negative farm could be as big as symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car in this country.
570	Pete Buttigieg	And it’s an important part of how we make sure that we get a message out around dealing with climate change that recruits everybody to be part of the solution including conservative communities where a lot of people have been made to feel that admitting climate science would mean acknowledging their part of the problem.
571	Rachel Maddow	I’m sorry to interrupt but I need you to answer the question.
572	Rachel Maddow	Would you continue those subsidies or not?
573	Pete Buttigieg	Yes, but we won’t need them cause we’re going to fix the trade war.
574	Rachel Maddow	Thank you sir.
575	Rachel Maddow	The UN recently reported that what was once called climate change is now a climate crisis, with drastic results already being felt.
576	Rachel Maddow	Climate is also an issue important to our audience.
577	Rachel Maddow	We received thousands of questions from our viewers and many of them were about climate.
578	Rachel Maddow	Calista from Minneapolis writes this out.
579	Rachel Maddow	“Leading the world in resolving the climate crisis will be a multi-decade project spending far beyond even a two term presidency.
580	Rachel Maddow	If you are elected president, how would you ensure that there is secure leadership and bipartisan support to continue this project?” Congresswoman Gabbard.
581	Tulsi Gabbard	This is an issue that impacts all of us as Americans and people all over the world.
582	Tulsi Gabbard	This is not a Democrat issue or Republican issue.
583	Tulsi Gabbard	This is about the environmental threats that each and every one of us face.
584	Tulsi Gabbard	These are the kinds of conversations that we’re having in our town hall meetings and house parties in different parts of the country where we have Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, and independents coming together saying, “Hey, we are all concerned about making sure that we have clean water to drink for our families, that we have clean air to breathe, that we’re able to raise our kids in a community that’s safe.”
585	Tulsi Gabbard	It is the hyper partisanship in Washington unfortunately, that has created this gridlock that has stood in the way of the kinds of progress that I bring bring about as president, transitioning our country off of fossil fuels and ending the nearly $30 billion in subsidies that we as taxpayers are currently giving to the fossil fuel industry.
586	Tulsi Gabbard	Instead of investing in a green, renewable energy economy.
587	Tulsi Gabbard	That leads us into the 21st century with good paying jobs, a sustainable economy, investing in infrastructure and transitioning our agriculture.
588	Tulsi Gabbard	That is a great contributor to the environmental threats we face towards an agriculture system that focuses on local and regional production of food, healthy food that will actually feed the health and wellbeing of our people leading as a leader in the world to make the global change necessary to address these threats.
589	Rachel Maddow	Thank you, congresswoman.
590	Rachel Maddow	I want to bring in Mr. Steyer on this.
591	Rachel Maddow	You’ve made climate change a central point of your political career to this issue of making change, changes that last.
592	Rachel Maddow	Making changes that are permanent.
593	Rachel Maddow	Could you address that, sir?
594	Tom Steyer	Rachel, I’m the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the number one priority for me.
595	Tom Steyer	Vice president Biden won’t say it.
596	Tom Steyer	Senator Warren won’t say it.
597	Tom Steyer	It’s a state of emergency and I would declare a state of emergency on day one.
598	Tom Steyer	I would use the emergency powers of the presidency.
599	Tom Steyer	I know that we have to do this.
600	Tom Steyer	I’ve spent a decade fighting and beating oil companies, stopping pipelines, stopping fossil fuel plants, ensuring clean energy across the country.
601	Tom Steyer	I know that we have to do this.
602	Tom Steyer	I also know that we can do this.
603	Tom Steyer	I would make this the number one priority of my foreign policy as well.
604	Tom Steyer	We can do this and create literally millions of good paying union jobs across this country.
605	Tom Steyer	I would make sure that my climate policy was led by environmental justice and members of the communities where this society has chosen to put our air and water pollution, which are low income black and brown communities and when we ask how are we going to pull this country together, how about this?
606	Tom Steyer	We take on the biggest challenge in history.
607	Tom Steyer	We save the world and we do it together.
608	Tom Steyer	If you think that would pull America together, I do.
609	Rachel Maddow	Quickly vice president Biden, you were name checked there.
610	Rachel Maddow	I’d like to give you a chance to response.
611	Joe Biden	Yeah, I was.
612	Joe Biden	I think it is the existential threat to humanity.
613	Joe Biden	It’s the number one issue and I might add, I don’t really need kind of a lecture from my friend.
614	Joe Biden	While I was passing the first climate change bill and that Politifact said was a game changer.
615	Joe Biden	While I manage the $90 billion recovery plan, investing more money in infrastructure that related to clean energy than any time we’ve ever done it.
616	Joe Biden	My friend was producing more coal mines and produce more coal around the world according to the press than all of Great Britain produces.
617	Joe Biden	I welcome him back into the fold here and he’s been there for a long while.
618	Joe Biden	But the idea that we talk about where we started and how we are, let’s get this straight.
619	Joe Biden	I think it is the existential threat of our time.
620	Rachel Maddow	Thank you, Mr. Vice president.
621	Tom Steyer	Can I respond to that, Rachel?
622	Rachel Maddow	You may respond, Mr Steyer.
623	Tom Steyer	I came to the conclusion over 10 years ago that climate was the absolute problem of our society and was the unintended consequence of our whole country being based on fossil fuels.
624	Tom Steyer	Everybody in this room has lived in an economy based on fossil fuels and we all have to come to the same conclusion that I came to over a decade ago.
625	Tom Steyer	If we’re waiting for Congress to pass one of the bills, and I know everybody on this stage cares about this, but Congress has never passed an important climate bill ever.
626	Tom Steyer	This is a problem, which continues to get worse.
627	Tom Steyer	That’s why I’m saying it’s a state of emergency.
628	Tom Steyer	That’s why I’m saying it’s priority one.
629	Tom Steyer	If it isn’t priority one, it’s not going to get done, and this is something where we absolutely have to address it upfront.
630	Tom Steyer	We have to make it the most important thing and we can use it to rebuild and re-imagine what the United States is.
631	Tom Steyer	We can be the moral leaders of the world again, while we clean up our air and water, and create millions of good paying jobs.
632	Rachel Maddow	Senator Sanders, I’m going to ask you to jump in here.
633	Bernie Sanders	Tom, you stated, you were talked about the need to make climate change a national emergency.
634	Bernie Sanders	I’ve introduced legislation to just do that.
635	Bernie Sanders	Now, I disagree with the thrust of the original question.
636	Bernie Sanders	Because your question has said, “What are we going to do in decades?” We don’t have decades.
637	Bernie Sanders	What the scientists are telling us, we don’t get our act together within the next eight or nine years.
638	Bernie Sanders	We’re talking about cities all over the world, major cities going on the water.
639	Bernie Sanders	We’re talking about increased drought, talking about increased extreme weather disturbances.
640	Bernie Sanders	The United Nations is telling us that in the years to come, they’re going to be hundreds of millions of climate refugees causing national security issues all over the world.
641	Bernie Sanders	What we have got to do tonight and I will do as president, is to tell the fossil fuel industry that they’re short-term profits on not more important than the future of this planet.
642	Bernie Sanders	And by the way, the fossil fuel industry is probably criminally liable because they have lied and lied and lied when they had the evidence that they are carbon products were destroying the planet and maybe we should think about prosecuting them as well.
643	Rachel Maddow	Thank you, Senator Sanders.
644	Rachel Maddow	Andrea.
645	Andrea Mitchell	President Trump has dramatically changed America’s approach to our adversaries by holding summits with Kim Jong-un, getting out of the Iran nuclear deal and at times embracing Vladimir Putin and other strong men.
646	Andrea Mitchell	So let’s talk about what kind of commander in chief you would be.
647	Andrea Mitchell	Senator Harris, North Korea is now threatening to cancel any future summits.
648	Andrea Mitchell	If president Trump does not make concessions on nuclear weapons.
649	Andrea Mitchell	If you were commander in chief, would you make concessions to Kim Jong-un in order to keep those talks going?
650	Kamala Harris	With all due deference to the fact that this is a presidential debate, Donald Trump got punked.
651	Kamala Harris	He has conducted foreign policy since day one, born out of a very fragile ego that fails to understand that one of the most important responsibilities of the commander in chief is to concern herself with the security of our nation and Homeland.
652	Kamala Harris	And to do it in a way that understands that part of the strength of who we are as a nation and therefore an extension of our ability to be secure is not only that we have a vibrant military, but that when we walk in any room around the globe, we are respected because we keep to our word, we are consistent, we speak truth, and we are loyal.
653	Kamala Harris	What Donald Trump has done from pulling out of the Paris agreement to pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal to consistently turning a back on people who have stood with us in difficult times, including most recently, the Kurds, points out that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the national security of our nation at this moment.
654	Andrea Mitchell	But would you make concessions to North Korea?
655	Kamala Harris	Not at this point.
656	Kamala Harris	There are no concessions to be made.
657	Kamala Harris	He has traded a photo op for nothing.
658	Kamala Harris	He has abandoned by shutting down the operations with South Korea for the last year and a half, so those operations which should be, and those exercises which should be active because they are in our best national security.
659	Kamala Harris	The relationship that we have with Japan.
660	Kamala Harris	He has in every way compromised our ability to have any influence on slowing down or at least having a check and balance on North Korea’s nuclear program.
661	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you.
662	Andrea Mitchell	Senator.
663	Andrea Mitchell	Mr. vice president.
664	Andrea Mitchell	President Trump inherited the North Korea problem from past presidents, so we’re in decades.
665	Andrea Mitchell	What would a president Biden do that president Obama didn’t do in eight years?
666	Joe Biden	First of all, I would go back and making sure we had the alliances we had before he became president.
667	Joe Biden	He has absolutely ostracized us from South Korea.
668	Joe Biden	He has given North Korea everything they want to create in the legitimacy.
669	Joe Biden	By having a meeting with Kim Jong-un who’s a thug, although he points out that I’m a rabid dog needed to be beaten with a stick.
670	Joe Biden	Very recently it was a comment.
671	Bernie Sanders	Other than that, you like him.
672	Joe Biden	Other than that, I like him.
673	Joe Biden	And not in Japan and Australia and being a Pacific power.
674	Joe Biden	And putting pressure on China in order for them to make sure that it is a non, it is a nuclear-free peninsula.
675	Joe Biden	And the way we do that is we make clear to China, which I have done personally with the president of China, and that is we’re going to move up our defenses.
676	Joe Biden	We are going to continue to make sure we increase our relationship with South Korea.
677	Joe Biden	And if they view that as a threat, it’s an easy thing to respond to.
678	Joe Biden	They in fact can in fact put pressure on.
679	Joe Biden	… to respond to.
680	Joe Biden	They can, in fact, put pressure on North Korea.
681	Joe Biden	But the fact is that we’re in a position where he has done this across the world.
682	Joe Biden	He’s embraced thugs.
683	Joe Biden	Look what Putin is doing in Europe.
684	Joe Biden	Putin is, his whole effort is to break up NATO to increase his power, look what he’s done to it.
685	Joe Biden	This guy has no idea what he’s doing, he has no notion how to go about it and we need a commander in chief for what he stands.
686	Joe Biden	Everybody knows what he or she-
687	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
688	Andrea Mitchell	Two more US soldiers were killed today in Afghanistan, tragically, in America’s longest war.
689	Andrea Mitchell	Senator Sanders, you’ve long said you want to bring the troops back home from Afghanistan.
690	Andrea Mitchell	Would you cut a deal with the Taliban to end the war even if it means the collapse of the Afghan government that America has long supported?
691	Bernie Sanders	Well, let me just say this.
692	Bernie Sanders	One of the big differences between the Vice President and myself is he supported the terrible war in Iraq and I helped lead the opposition against it.
693	Bernie Sanders	And not only that, I voted against the very first Gulf War as well.
694	Bernie Sanders	And I think we need a foreign policy which understands who our enemies are, that we don’t have to spend more money on the military than the next 10 nations combined.
695	Bernie Sanders	But to answer your question, yeah.
696	Bernie Sanders	I think it is time after spending many trillions of dollars on these endless wars which have resulted in more dislocation and mass migrations and pain in that region, it is time to bring our troops home.
697	Bernie Sanders	But unlike Trump, I will not do it through a tweet at three o’clock in the morning.
698	Bernie Sanders	I will do it working with the international community and if it’s necessary to negotiate with the Taliban, of course, we will do that.
699	Bernie Sanders	But at the end of the day we have to rethink the entire war on terror, which has caused so much pain and lost so many lives, not only for our own men and women in the armed forces, but for people in that region as well.
700	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you, Senator.
701	Andrea Mitchell	Ashley?
702	Ashley Parker	Thank you.
703	Ashley Parker	Mr. Yang.
704	Ashley Parker	If you win the 2020 election, what would you say?
705	Ashley Parker	In your first call with Russian President, Vladimir Putin?
706	Andrew Yang	Well, first I’d say, “I’m sorry I beat your guy.”
707	Senator Warren	It’s a sorry, you’re not sorry?
708	Andrew Yang	Well, not sorry.
709	Andrew Yang	And second, I would say the days of meddling in American elections are over and we will take any undermining of our democratic processes as an act of hostility and aggression.
710	Andrew Yang	The American people would back me on this.
711	Andrew Yang	We know that they’ve found an underbelly and they’ve been clawing at it and it’s made so that we can’t even trust our own democracy.
712	Andrew Yang	The third thing I would say is that we’re going to live up to our international commitments.
713	Andrew Yang	We’re going to recommit to our partnerships and alliances including NATO.
714	Andrew Yang	And it was James Mattis, that said that the more you invest in diplomats and diplomacy, the less you have to spend on ammunition.
715	Andrew Yang	That has to be the path forward to help build an international consensus, not just against Russia, but also to build a coalition that will help us put pressure on China in terms of their treatment of their ethnic minorities and what’s going on in Hong Kong.
716	Andrew Yang	I want to propose a new world data organization, like a WTO for data because right now unfortunately we’re living in a world where data is the new oil and we don’t have our arms around it.
717	Andrew Yang	These are the ways that we’ll actually get Russia to the table and make it so they have to join the international community and stop resisting appeals to the world order.
718	Ashley Parker	Thank you, Mr. Yang.
719	Ashley Parker	Rachel?
720	Rachel Maddow	On the issue of China, Senator Booker, China is now using force against demonstrators in Hong Kong where millions have taken to the streets advocating for democratic reforms.
721	Rachel Maddow	Many of the demonstrators are asking the United States for help.
722	Rachel Maddow	If you were president, would the US help their movement and how?
723	Senator Booker	Well, first of all, this is a president who seems to want to go up against China in a trade war by pulling away from our allies and in fact, attacking them as well.
724	Senator Booker	We use a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada.
725	Senator Booker	At the very time that China is breaking international rules, is practicing unfair practices, stealing technology, forcing technology transfer and violating human rights, this nation is pulling away from critical allies.
726	Senator Booker	We would need to show strength against China.
727	Senator Booker	There’s a larger battle going on on the planet earth right now between totalitarian and dictatorial countries and free democracies, and we see the scorecard under this president not looking so good, with China actually shifting more towards an authoritarian government with its leader now getting rid of term limits.
728	Senator Booker	I believe we need a much stronger policy.
729	Senator Booker	One that’s not led as president Trump seems to want to do in a transactional way, but one that’s led by American values.
730	Senator Booker	Yes, we will call China out for human rights violations, but not only that, we will stop engaging in things that violate American rights.
731	Senator Booker	Because it is a human rights violation when people at our border, children are thrown in cages.
732	Senator Booker	It’s a human rights violations without coming to the United States Congress for an authorization to the use of military force for us to refuel Saudi jets to bomb Yemeni children.
733	Senator Booker	It is about time that this country is led by someone who will say the values of freedom and democracy or what we are going to lead with, and begin to check China, check Putin and the other folks who are trying to undermine American values and democratic values around the globe.
734	Rachel Maddow	Thank you, Senator.
735	Rachel Maddow	Andrea?
736	Andrea Mitchell	Mr. Vice President, the CIA has concluded that the leader of Saudi Arabia directed the murder of US-based journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.
737	Andrea Mitchell	The state department also says the Saudi government is responsible for executing nonviolent offenders and for torture.
738	Andrea Mitchell	President Trump has not punished senior Saudi leaders, would you?
739	Joe Biden	Yes.
740	Joe Biden	And I said it at the time, Khashoggi was in fact murdered and dismembered and I believe in the order of the Crown Prince.
741	Joe Biden	And I would make it very clear we were not going to in fact sell more weapons to them, we were going to in fact make them pay the price and make them in fact the pariah that they are.
742	Joe Biden	There’s very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia.
743	Joe Biden	And I would also, as pointed out, I would end subsidies that we have, end the sale of material to the Saudis.
744	Joe Biden	Well, they’re going in and murdering children and they’re murdering innocent people and so they have to be held accountable.
745	Joe Biden	And with regard to China, we should, look, unless we make it clear that we stand for human rights, we should be going to the United Nations seeking condemnation of China.
746	Joe Biden	What they’re doing with a million Uighurs that are essentially in concentration camps in the west.
747	Joe Biden	We should be vocally speaking out about the violation of the commitment they made to Hong Kong.
748	Joe Biden	We have to speak out and speak loudly about violations of human rights.
749	Andrea Mitchell	Senator Klobuchar-
750	Amy Klobuchar	Yes.
751	Andrea Mitchell	Just to follow up, would you go against the Saudis even though that would potentially help around their adversaries?
752	Amy Klobuchar	We need a new foreign policy in this country and that means renewing our relationships with our allies.
753	Amy Klobuchar	It means rejoining international agreement and it means reasserting our American values.
754	Amy Klobuchar	When the President did not stand up the way he should have to that killing and that dismemberment of a journalist with an American newspaper, that sent a signal to all dictators across the world that that was okay, and that’s wrong.
755	Amy Klobuchar	And I want to add a few things to what my colleagues have said.
756	Amy Klobuchar	First of all, the question about Russia.
757	Amy Klobuchar	When we look at international agreements, we must start negotiating back with Russia, which has been a horrible player on the international scene.
758	Amy Klobuchar	But the President precipitously got out of the nuclear agreement with Russia and we must start negotiating even though they were cheating for the good of this world.
759	Amy Klobuchar	And we must also start the negotiations for the New START Treaty.
760	Amy Klobuchar	And when it comes to China, we need someone that sees the long-term like I do, just like the Chinese do.
761	Amy Klobuchar	Because we have a president that literally makes decisions based on his next tweet and they are in it for the long game.
762	Andrea Mitchell	Senator Sanders?
763	Bernie Sanders	I think I may have been the first person up here to make it clear that Saudi Arabia not only murdered Khashoggi, but this is a brutal dictatorship which gets every taken can to crush democracy, treats women as third class citizens.
764	Bernie Sanders	And when we rethink our American foreign policy, what we have got to know is that Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally.
765	Bernie Sanders	We have got to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room under American leadership and say, “We are sick and tired of us spending huge amounts of money and human resources because of your conflicts.”
766	Bernie Sanders	And by the way, the same thing goes with Israel and the Palestinians.
767	Bernie Sanders	It is no longer good enough for us to simply to be pro-Israel.
768	Bernie Sanders	I am pro-Israel, but we must treat the Palestinian people as well with the respect and dignity that they deserve.
769	Bernie Sanders	What is going on in Gaza right now, where youth unemployment is 70 or 80% is unsustainable.
770	Bernie Sanders	We need to be rethinking who our allies are around the world, work with United nations and not continue to support brutal dictatorships.
771	Andrea Mitchell	Thank you, Senator.
772	Andrea Mitchell	Rachel?
773	Rachel Maddow	Senator Warren.
774	Rachel Maddow	Only about 1% of Americans serve in the United States military right now.
775	Rachel Maddow	Should that number be higher?
776	Senator Warren	Yes, I think it should be.
777	Senator Warren	All three of my brothers served in the military.
778	Senator Warren	One was career military, the other two also served.
779	Senator Warren	I think it’s an important part of who we are as Americans and I think the notion of shared service is important.
780	Senator Warren	It’s how we help bring our nation together, it’s how people learn to work together from different regions, people who grew up differently.
781	Senator Warren	It’s also about how families share that sacrifice.
782	Senator Warren	I remember what it was like when I was a little girl, my brother, my oldest brother who served five and a half years off and on in combat in Vietnam.
783	Senator Warren	And what it was like for my mother every day to check the mailbox, had we heard from Don Reed, how’s he doing?
784	Senator Warren	And if there was a letter, she was brighter than the day.
785	Senator Warren	And if it wasn’t, she’d say, “Well, maybe tomorrow.” This is about building for our entire nation and I believe we should do that.
786	Senator Warren	I also believe we should have other service opportunities in this country.
787	Senator Warren	For example, what I want to do is for our federal lands, I want to bring in 10,000 people who want to be able to serve in our federal lands to be able to help rebuild our national forests and national parks as a way to express both their public service and their commitment to fighting back against climate change-
788	Rachel Maddow	Senator Warren.
789	Senator Warren	We can do this as a nation.
790	Rachel Maddow	Thank you, Senator.
791	Rachel Maddow	In president Trump’s first two years in office, the Pentagon budget ballooned.
792	Rachel Maddow	Mayor Buttigieg, would you cut military spending or would you keep it on the same upward trajectory?
793	Pete Buttigieg	We need to re-prioritize our budget as a whole and our military spending in particular.
794	Pete Buttigieg	It’s not just how much, although we certainly need to look at the runaway in military spending, it’s also where.
795	Pete Buttigieg	Right now we are spending a fraction of the intention and resources on things like the artificial intelligence research that China is doing right now.
796	Pete Buttigieg	If we fall behind on artificial intelligence, the most expensive ships that the United States is building just turn into bigger targets.
797	Pete Buttigieg	We do not have a 21st century security strategy coming from this president.
798	Pete Buttigieg	After all, he’s relying on 17th century security technologies like a moat full of alligators or a big wall.
799	Pete Buttigieg	There is no concept of strategic planning for how civilian diplomatic and military security work needs to take place for the future.
800	Senator Booker	Can I respond to Buttigieg?
801	Rachel Maddow	Thank you.
802	Senator Warren	Can I respond on this?
803	Rachel Maddow	Coming up we will have much more from the candidates.
804	Rachel Maddow	We’re going to take a quick break, just a moment, stay with us.
805	Kristen Welker	Welcome back everyone to the fifth Democratic Debate.
806	Kristen Welker	Let’s move now to the issue of race in America.
807	Kristen Welker	FBI Director, Christopher Wray, recently told Congress, “The majority of the domestic terrorism cases that we’ve investigated are motivated by white supremacist violence.” Congresswoman Gabbard, to you.
808	Kristen Welker	As president, would you direct the federal government to do something about this problem that it is not currently doing?
809	Tulsi Gabbard	Yes, I would.
810	Tulsi Gabbard	We have seen for far too long the kind of racial bigotry, divisiveness and attacks that have unfortunately taken the lives of our fellow Americans.
811	Tulsi Gabbard	Leadership starts at the top.
812	Tulsi Gabbard	It’s important that we set the record straight and correct the racial injustices that exist in a very institutional way in our country.
813	Tulsi Gabbard	Beginning with things that have to do with our criminal justice system, where predominantly the failed war on drugs that has been continuing to be waged in this country has disproportionately impacted people of color and people in poverty.
814	Tulsi Gabbard	This is something that I’ll do as president and Commander-in-Chief, is to overhaul our criminal justice system working in a bipartisan way to do things like end the failed war on drugs and the money bail system.
815	Tulsi Gabbard	And that’s the kinds of prison reforms and sentencing reforms that we need to see that will correct the failures of the past.
816	Tulsi Gabbard	The most important thing here is that we recognize that we have to treat each other with respect, all of us as fellow Americans regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender orientation, and our politics.
817	Tulsi Gabbard	That kind of leadership starts at the top.
818	Tulsi Gabbard	As president, I will usher in a 21st century White House that actually represents the interests of all Americans, first and foremost.
819	Kristen Welker	Congresswoman Gabbard, thank you for that.
820	Kristen Welker	Mr. Yang, what would you do about the issue of white supremacist violence?
821	Andrew Yang	Well, first we have to designate white supremacist terrorism as domestic terrorism so that the Department of Justice can properly measure it.
822	Andrew Yang	I talked to an anti- hate activist named Christian Picciolini, who told me about how he was radicalized over a 10 year period.
823	Andrew Yang	He said he was a lonely 14-year-old and that he was reached out to by a hate group and he wound up joining it for a decade.
824	Andrew Yang	Now, he’s out and he’s helping convert people out of those hate groups and back into the rest of society.
825	Andrew Yang	But what he told me was that if anyone had reached out to him when he was that hurt, broken 14-year-old boy, he would have gone with them.
826	Andrew Yang	He said, “If it had been a coach I would have gone with him.
827	Andrew Yang	If it had been a mentor teacher, I would have gone with them, but instead it was a hate group.” What we have to do is we have to get into the roots of our communities and create paths forward for men in particular, who right now are falling through the cracks.
828	Andrew Yang	And when you look at gun violence in this country, 96 plus percent of the shooters we’re talking about are young boys and young men.
829	Andrew Yang	We have to as a country start finding ways to turn our boys into healthy, strong, young men who do not hate, but instead feel like they have paths forward in today’s economy.
830	Kristen Welker	Mr. Yang, thank you for that.
831	Kristen Welker	Vice President Biden.
832	Kristen Welker	The Me Too Movement, has forced a cultural reckoning around the issue of sexual violence and harassment against women in America.
833	Kristen Welker	Are there specific actions that you would take early in your administration to address this problem?
834	Joe Biden	Yes.
835	Joe Biden	And by the way, it’s one of the reasons.
836	Joe Biden	The first thing I would do is make sure we pass the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, which I wrote.
837	Joe Biden	The fact, I didn’t write the reauthorization, I wrote the original act.
838	Joe Biden	The fact is that what happens now is that we in fact, have to fundamentally change the culture, the culture of how women are treated.
839	Joe Biden	That’s why as Vice President, when I asked the President if I could start the movement on the college campuses to say, “It’s on us.” It’s everyone’s responsibility.
840	Joe Biden	We do not spend nearly enough time dealing with… I was stunned when I did a virtual town meeting that told me 30,000 people were on the call, young people between 15 and 25.
841	Joe Biden	And found out, “I said, what do you need to make you safer on college campuses and your schools?” You know what they said?
842	Joe Biden	“Get men involved, engage the rest of the community.” And that’s why we started this movement on the college campus is to fundamentally change the culture.
843	Joe Biden	No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs.
844	Joe Biden	We have to just change the culture, period, and keep punching at it and punching at it and punching it.
845	Joe Biden	It will be a big punch… no, I really mean it.
846	Joe Biden	It’s a gigantic issue and we have to make it clear from the top, from the President on down that we will not tolerate it.
847	Joe Biden	We will not tolerate this culture.
848	Kristen Welker	Mr. Vice President, thank you.
849	Kristen Welker	Senator Harris, this week you criticize Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s outreach to African American voters.
850	Kristen Welker	You said, “The Democratic nominee has got to be someone who has the experience of connecting with all of who we are as the diversity of the American people.” What exactly prompted you to say that, Senator Harris?
851	Kamala Harris	Well, I don’t know, that was a question that related to a stock photograph that his campaign published.
852	Kamala Harris	But listen, I think that it really speaks to a larger issue and I’ll speak to the larger issue.
853	Kamala Harris	I believe that the Mayor has made apologies for that.
854	Kamala Harris	The larger issue is that for too long, I think candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party and have overlooked those constituencies.
855	Kamala Harris	They show up when it’s close to election time and show up in a black church and want to get the vote, but just haven’t been there before.
856	Kamala Harris	I mean, there are plenty of people who applauded black women and for the success of the 2018 election, applauded black women for the election of a Senator from Alabama.
857	Kamala Harris	But at some point folks get tired of just saying, “Oh, thank me for showing up,” and say, “Well, show up for me.” Because when black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth in America.
858	Kamala Harris	When the sons of black women will die because of gun violence more than any other cause of death.
859	Kamala Harris	When black women make 61 cents on the dollar as compared to all women who tragically make 80 cents on the dollar, the question has to be where you been and what are you going to do?
860	Kamala Harris	And do you understand who the people are?
861	Kamala Harris	And I’m running for president because I believe that we have to have leadership in this country who has worked with and have the experience of working with all folks, and we’ve got to recreate the Obama coalition to win.
862	Kamala Harris	And that means about women, that’s people of color, that’s our LGBTQ community, that’s working people, that’s our labor unions.
863	Kamala Harris	But that is how we are going to win this election.
864	Kamala Harris	And I intend to win.
865	Kristen Welker	Senator Harris, thank you.
866	Kristen Welker	Mayor Buttigieg, your response to that.
867	Pete Buttigieg	My response is I completely agree.
868	Pete Buttigieg	And I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don’t yet know me.
869	Pete Buttigieg	And before I share what’s in my plans, let me talk about what’s in my heart and why this is so important.
870	Pete Buttigieg	As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income, for eight years I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built up over centuries, but then compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory.
871	Pete Buttigieg	I care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized and cast aside and oppressed in society.
872	Pete Buttigieg	And I care about this because while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country.
873	Pete Buttigieg	Turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate.
874	Pete Buttigieg	And seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me working side by side, shoulder to shoulder.
875	Pete Buttigieg	Making it possible for me to be standing here wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn’t have happened two elections ago, lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day even if they are nothing like me in their experience.
876	Kristen Welker	May Buttigieg, thank you very much.
877	Kristen Welker	Senator Harris, quick response?
878	Kamala Harris	Look, there is a lot at stake in this election.
879	Kamala Harris	And I’ve said it many times I think justice is on the ballot in 2020.
880	Kamala Harris	And it’s about economic justice, it’s about justice for children, it’s about justice for our teachers.
881	Kamala Harris	I could go on down the list.
882	Kamala Harris	The issue really is not what is the fight, the issue has to be how are we going to win.
883	Kamala Harris	And to win we have to build a coalition and rebuild the Obama coalition.
884	Kamala Harris	I keep referring to that because that’s the last time we won.
885	Kamala Harris	And the way that that election looked and what that coalition looked like was it was about having a leader who had worked in many communities, knows those communities and has the ability to bring people together and everyone is going to have to be judged on their experience and therefore ability to bring folks together around our commonalities of which I believe there are many.
886	Kristen Welker	Thank you, Senator.
887	Kristen Welker	Senator Warren, quickly.
888	Senator Warren	I think it is really important that we actually talk about what we’re willing to get in the fight for.
889	Senator Warren	And I just want to give one example around this.
890	Senator Warren	Senator Harris, rightly raised the question of economic justice.
891	Senator Warren	Let me give a specific example, and that is student loan debt.
892	Senator Warren	Right now African Americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college, borrow more money while they’re in college and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out.
893	Senator Warren	Today in America, a new study came out 20 years out.
894	Senator Warren	Whites borrowed money, 94% of them have paid off their student loan debt.
895	Senator Warren	5% of African Americans had paid it off.
896	Senator Warren	I believe that means everyone on the stage should be embracing student loan debt forgiveness.
897	Senator Warren	It will help close the black-white wealth gap.
898	Senator Warren	Let’s do something tangible and real to make change in this country.
899	Kristen Welker	Senator Warren, thank you.
900	Kristen Welker	Ashley?
901	Ashley Parker	Senator Warren, back to you.
902	Ashley Parker	You’ve said that the border wall that president Trump has proposed is, “A monument to hate and division.” Would you ask taxpayers to pay to take down any part of the wall on the nation’s Southern border?
903	Senator Warren	If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense, of course, we should do it.
904	Senator Warren	The real point here is that we need to stop this man-made crisis at the border.
905	Senator Warren	Trump is the one who has created this crisis and he has done it in no small part by helping destabilize the governments even further in Central America.
906	Senator Warren	He has withdrawn aid, that means that families have to flee for their lives, have to flee for any economic opportunity.
907	Senator Warren	You know what?
908	Senator Warren	I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families.
909	Senator Warren	I went down to the border, I went down there and immediately.
910	Senator Warren	I was in McAllen, Texas, and I just hope everyone remembers what this looks like.
911	Senator Warren	There was like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men and cages of little girls and little boys.
912	Senator Warren	I spoke to a woman who was in the cage of nursing mothers and she told me she’d given a drink to a police officer, and that the word had come down from the gangs that she was helping the police.
913	Senator Warren	She knew what that meant.
914	Senator Warren	She wrapped up her baby and she ran for the border.
915	Senator Warren	We need to treat the people who come here with dignity and with respect.
916	Senator Warren	A great nation does not separate children from their families.
917	Senator Warren	We need to live our values at the border every single day.
918	Ashley Parker	Thank you Senator.
919	Ashley Parker	Senator Booker, a quick response.
920	Senator Booker	Look, I want to be quick on this because I’d like to get back to something that I wasn’t included in, is…
921	Senator Warren	So would we all.
922	Senator Booker	Absolutely, if this is not effective, we see people cutting holes in this wall, his wall, the way he brags about it, it’s just wrong.
923	Senator Booker	We need to have policies that respect dignity, keep us safe and strong.
924	Senator Booker	I wanted to return back to this issue of black voters.
925	Senator Booker	I have a lifetime of experience with black voters, I’ve been one since I was 18.
926	Senator Booker	Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African American voters.
927	Senator Booker	Black voters are pissed off and they’re worried.
928	Senator Booker	They’re pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be really paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for their vote.
929	Senator Booker	And they’re worried because the Democratic Party, we don’t want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that isn’t trusted, doesn’t have authentic connection.
930	Senator Booker	That’s what’s on the ballot and issues do matter.
931	Senator Booker	I have a lot of respect for the Vice President.
932	Senator Booker	He has sworn me into my office as a hero.
933	Senator Booker	This week I hear him literally say that I don’t think we should legalize marijuana.
934	Senator Booker	I thought you might’ve been high when you said it.
935	Senator Booker	And let me tell you, because marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people.
936	Senator Booker	And it’s what the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people.
937	Senator Booker	And let me say this, there’s more African Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since 1850, do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children.
938	Senator Booker	Because there are people in Congress right now that admit to smoking marijuana, while there are people, our kids are in jail right now for those drug crimes.
939	Senator Booker	These are the kind of issues that mean a lot to our community and if we don’t have somebody authentically… we lost the last election.
940	Senator Booker	Let me just give you this data example-
941	Ashley Parker	Quickly, quickly.
942	Senator Booker	We lost in Wisconsin because of a massive dimunition, a lot of reasons, but there was a massive dimunition in the African American vote.
943	Senator Booker	We need to have someone that can inspire, as Kamala said, to inspire African Americans to the polls in record numbers.
944	Ashley Parker	Thank you, Senator Booker.
945	Ashley Parker	Vice President Biden, you can respond to that.
946	Joe Biden	I’ll be very brief.
947	Joe Biden	Number one, I think we should decriminalize marijuana, period.
948	Joe Biden	And I think anyone who has a record should be let out of jail, their records expunged and be completely zeroed out.
949	Joe Biden	But I do think it makes sense based on data that we should study what the long-term effects for the use of marijuana, that’s all it is.
950	Joe Biden	Number one, everybody gets out, record expunged.
951	Joe Biden	Secondly, I’m part of that Obama coalition.
952	Joe Biden	I come out of the black community in terms of my support.
953	Joe Biden	If you notice I have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced from me because they know me.
954	Joe Biden	They know who I am.
955	Joe Biden	Three former chairs of the Black Caucus, the only black African American woman that ever been elected to the United States Senate, a whole range of people.
956	Joe Biden	My point is-
957	Kamala Harris	That’s not true.
958	Senator Booker	That’s not true, not true.
959	Joe Biden	I said the first African American woman.
960	Joe Biden	My point is one of the reasons I was picked to be vice president was because of my relationship, longstanding relationship with the black community.
961	Joe Biden	I was part of that coalition.
962	Ashley Parker	Thank you, Kristen?
963	Kristen Welker	And we do have to take another quick break but we are going to hear much more from the candidates when we come right back here in Atlanta, Georgia.
964	Kristen Welker	Stay with us.
965	Rachel Maddow	Welcome back to the MSNBC/Washington Post Democratic candidates debate.
966	Rachel Maddow	Many states, including right here where we are tonight in Georgia, have passed laws that severely limit or outright ban abortion.
967	Rachel Maddow	Right now, Roe versus Wade protects a woman’s right to abortion nationwide, but if Roe gets overturned and abortion access disappears in some states, would you intervene as president to try to bring that access back?
968	Rachel Maddow	Senator Klobuchar.
969	Amy Klobuchar	Well, of course.
970	Amy Klobuchar	We should codify Roe V Wade into law.
971	Amy Klobuchar	That is what we should do.
972	Amy Klobuchar	This President indicated early on what he was going to do and he’s done it.
973	Amy Klobuchar	When he was running for office, he literally said, “Women should go to jail.” Then he dialed it back and said, “Doctors should go to jail.’ No surprise that we’re seeing these kinds of laws in Georgia, and Alabama, where his allies are passing these bills.
974	Amy Klobuchar	What we have to remember is that the people are with us.
975	Amy Klobuchar	I predict this will be a big election in issue in the general election.
976	Amy Klobuchar	I just can’t wait to stand across from Donald Trump and say this to him, “You know what?
977	Amy Klobuchar	The people are with us.
978	Amy Klobuchar	Over 70% of the people support Roe V Wade, over 90% of the people support funding for Planned Parenthood and making sure that women can get the healthcare they need.” He is off the track on this and he will hear from the women of America.
979	Amy Klobuchar	This is how we’re going to win this election.
980	Rachel Maddow	Just this weekend, Louisiana reelected a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards.
981	Rachel Maddow	He has signed one of the country’s toughest laws restricting abortion.
982	Rachel Maddow	Is there room in the Democratic Party for someone like him, someone who can win in a deep red state, but who does not support abortion rights?
983	Rachel Maddow	Senator Warren.
984	Senator Warren	Look, I believe that abortion rights are human rights.
985	Senator Warren	I believe that they are also economic rights.
986	Senator Warren	Protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party.
987	Senator Warren	Understand this.
988	Senator Warren	When someone makes abortion illegal in America, rich women will still get abortions.
989	Senator Warren	It’s just going to fall hard on poor women.
990	Senator Warren	It’s going to fall hard on girls.
991	Senator Warren	Women who don’t even know that they’re pregnant because they have been molested by an uncle.
992	Senator Warren	I want to be an America where everybody has a chance.
993	Senator Warren	I know it can be a hard decision for people, but here’s the thing, when it comes down to that decision, a woman should be able to call on her mother.
994	Senator Warren	She should be able to call on her partner.
995	Senator Warren	She should be able to call on her priest or her rabbi, but the one entity that should not be in the middle of that decision is the government.
996	Rachel Maddow	Senator Warren, I need to push you on this a little bit for a specific answer to the question.
997	Rachel Maddow	Governor John Bel Edwards in Louisiana, is an anti-abortion governor who has signed abortion restrictions in Louisiana.
998	Rachel Maddow	Is there room for him in the Democratic Party with those politics?
999	Senator Warren	I have made clear what I think the Democratic Party stands for.
1000	Senator Warren	I’m not here to try to drive anyone out of this party.
1001	Senator Warren	I’m not here to try to build fences, but I am here to say, “This is what I will fight for as President of the United States.” The women of America can count on me.
1002	Rachel Maddow	Senator Warren, thank you.
1003	Rachel Maddow	Senator Sanders, I’ll give you 30 seconds.
1004	Bernie Sanders	[crosstalk 01:42:32] mentioned that women feel troubling on it.
1005	Bernie Sanders	Well, let me just tell you that if there’s ever a time in American history where the men of this country must stand with the women, this is the moment.
1006	Bernie Sanders	I get very tired, very tired of hearing the hypocrisy from conservatives who say, “Get the government off our backs.
1007	Bernie Sanders	We want small government.” Well, if you want to get the government out of the backs of the American people, then understand that it is women who control their own bodies, not politicians.
1008	Rachel Maddow	Senator Sanders, thank you.
1009	Senator Booker	This is a voting issue.
1010	Rachel Maddow	Senator Booker.
1011	Senator Booker	This is a voting issue.
1012	Senator Booker	This is a voter suppression issue.
1013	Senator Booker	Right here in this great state of Georgia, it was the voter suppression, particularly of African American communities, that prevented us from having a Governor Stacey Abrams, right now.
1014	Senator Booker	That is, when you have undemocratic needs, when you suppress people’s votes to get elected, those are the very people you’re going to come after when you’re in office.
1015	Senator Booker	This bill opposed by over 70%.
1016	Senator Booker	The Heartbeat Bill here opposed by over 70% of Georgians, is the result from voter suppression.
1017	Senator Booker	This gets back to the issue about making sure we are fighting every single day, that whoever is the nominee, they can overcome the attempts to suppress the votes, particularly of low income and minority voters and particularly in the black community like we saw here in Georgia.
1018	Rachel Maddow	Senator, Senator Booker, thank you.
1019	Rachel Maddow	To that point, individual states, as you all know, set their own rules for voting and for elections.
1020	Rachel Maddow	Depending on where you live, you may be required to show ID or not.
1021	Rachel Maddow	You might have a lot of days for early voting or fewer days or none.
1022	Rachel Maddow	You might have a polling place in walking distance or you might have to drive or take a bus to the edge of town.
1023	Rachel Maddow	With that in mind, our next question comes from Jenna in Maryland who asks, “What will you do at the executive level to ensure that every American has equal access to the ballot box?” Mayor Buttigieg.
1024	Pete Buttigieg	Well, we need federal leadership to establish voting rights for the 21st century because this affects every other issue that we care about.
1025	Pete Buttigieg	Now, the House of Representatives passed a pro democracy anti-corruption bill, which is one of many good bills to die in Mitch McConnell’s hands in the United States Senate.
1026	Pete Buttigieg	We know that with the White House in the right hands, we can make, for example, election days a federal holiday.
1027	Pete Buttigieg	We can use carrots and sticks to induce states to do the right thing with automatic voter registration, same day voter registration, making it easier for people to vote and in particular, recognizing that we cannot allow the kind of racially motivated or partisan voter suppression or gerrymandering that often dictates the outcome of election before the voting even begins.
1028	Pete Buttigieg	Right now we have politicians picking out their voters rather than the other way around.
1029	Pete Buttigieg	That compounding with what is being done to restrict the right to vote means that our democracy is not worthy of the name.
1030	Amy Klobuchar	I just, I want to … This-
1031	Pete Buttigieg	While these process issues are not always fashionable, we must act to reform our democracy itself, including when it comes to choosing our presidency.
1032	Pete Buttigieg	What we do in [crosstalk 01:45:48] election, giving it to the person who got the most votes.
1033	Rachel Maddow	Senator Klobuchar.
1034	Amy Klobuchar	I want to point out.
1035	Pete Buttigieg	Election, giving it to the person who got the most votes.
1036	Rachel Maddow	Forgive me, Mr. Mayor.
1037	Amy Klobuchar	I agree with what the mayor has just said, but this is a good example where he has said the right words, but I actually have the experience and in leading 11 of the bills that are in that house passed bill you just referred to.
1038	Amy Klobuchar	I think this kind of experience matters.
1039	Amy Klobuchar	I have been devoted to this from the time that I’ve got to the Senate.
1040	Amy Klobuchar	I think having that experience, knowing how you can get things done, leading the bills to take the social media companies to task a bipartisan bill to say, “Yeah, you have to say where these ads come from and how they’re paid for,” and stop the unbelievable practice where we still have 11 states that don’t have backup paper ballots.
1041	Amy Klobuchar	That is my bipartisan bill and I am so close to getting it done.
1042	Amy Klobuchar	The way I get it done is if I’m president.
1043	Amy Klobuchar	Just like I have won statewide, and Mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official and you did not when you tried, I also have actually done this work.
1044	Amy Klobuchar	I think experience should matter.
1045	Rachel Maddow	Mayor Buttigieg, I’ll let you respond to that.
1046	Pete Buttigieg	First of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters.
1047	Pete Buttigieg	There’s more than a hundred years of Washington experience on this stage and where are we right now as a country?
1048	Pete Buttigieg	I have the experience of bringing people together to get something done.
1049	Pete Buttigieg	I have the experience of being commanded into a war zone by an American president.
1050	Pete Buttigieg	I have the experience of knowing what is at stake as the decisions made in those big white buildings come into our lives, our homes, our families, our workplaces and our marriages.
1051	Pete Buttigieg	I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it before it is too late.
1052	Rachel Maddow	Mr. Mayor, thank you.
1053	Tulsi Gabbard	I need to jump in here.
1054	Tulsi Gabbard	Thank you.
1055	Rachel Maddow	[crosstalk 01:47:41] on the original question of voting rights, please.
1056	Tulsi Gabbard	I mean, voting rights are essential for our democracy.
1057	Tulsi Gabbard	Securing our elections is essential for our democracy.
1058	Tulsi Gabbard	I’ve introduced legislation called the Securing America’s Elections Act that mandates paper ballots to make sure that every single voter’s voice is heard, but I want to get back to Pete Buttigieg and his comment about experience.
1059	Tulsi Gabbard	Pete, you’ll agree that the service that we both have provided to our country as veterans by itself does not qualify us to serve as commander in chief.
1060	Tulsi Gabbard	I think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels.
1061	Tulsi Gabbard	As commander in chief, leader of our armed forces, I bring extensive experience serving for seven years in Congress on the Foreign Affairs Committee, on the Armed Services Committee, on the Homeland Security Committee, meeting with leaders of countries around the world, working with military commanders of different commands-
1062	Rachel Maddow	Congresswoman.
1063	Tulsi Gabbard	-dealing with high level national security briefings, understanding what’s necessary, the preparation that I’ve gotten to walk in on day one to serve as commander in chief.
1064	Rachel Maddow	Congresswoman, thank you.
1065	Rachel Maddow	Mr. Mayor, I’ll allow you to respond.
1066	Pete Buttigieg	I know that it’s par for the course in Washington to take remarks out of context, but that is outlandish even by the standards of today’s politics.
1067	Tulsi Gabbard	Are you saying that you didn’t say that?
1068	Pete Buttigieg	I was talking about U.S., Mexico, cooperation.
1069	Pete Buttigieg	We’ve been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships for example.
1070	Pete Buttigieg	Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?
1071	Tulsi Gabbard	That’s not what I said.
1072	Tulsi Gabbard	That’s not what I said.
1073	Tulsi Gabbard	That’s not what I said.
1074	Pete Buttigieg	I’m talking about building up alliances.
1075	Pete Buttigieg	If your question is about experience, let’s also talk about judgment.
1076	Pete Buttigieg	One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad.
1077	Pete Buttigieg	I have in my experience, such as it is, whether you think it counts or not, since it wasn’t accumulated in Washington, enough judgment that I would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that.
1078	Rachel Maddow	Congresswoman Gabbard, let me allow you to respond.
1079	Tulsi Gabbard	Thank you.
1080	Tulsi Gabbard	You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels and your answer was, yes.
1081	Tulsi Gabbard	The fact checkers can check this out, but your point about judgment is absolutely correct.
1082	Tulsi Gabbard	Our commander in chief does need to have good judgment and what you’ve just pointed out is that you would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends to ensure the peace and national security of our nation.
1083	Tulsi Gabbard	I take the example of those leaders who have come before us, leaders like JFK, who met with Khrushchev, like Roosevelt, who met with Stalin.
1084	Pete Buttigieg	Like Donald Trump, who met with Kim.
1085	Tulsi Gabbard	Like Reagan, who met and worked with Gorbachev.
1086	Tulsi Gabbard	These issues of national security are incredibly important.
1087	Tulsi Gabbard	I will meet with and do what is necessary to make sure that no more of our brothers and sisters in uniform are needlessly sent into harm’s way fighting regime change wars that undermine our national security.
1088	Tulsi Gabbard	I’ll bring real leadership and experience to the White House.
1089	Rachel Maddow	Congresswoman, [crosstalk 00:12:07].
1090	Pete Buttigieg	[crosstalk 01:51:07] respond to this.
1091	Pete Buttigieg	This is a [crosstalk 01:51:09].
1092	Rachel Maddow	Senator Sanders, I’m going to have you respond.
1093	Bernie Sanders	[crosstalk 01:51:09] right to the point.
1094	Bernie Sanders	The American people understand that the political system we have today is corrupt and it is not just voter suppression, which cost the Democratic Party a governorship here in this state, not just denying black people and people of color, the right to vote, but we also have a system through Citizens United, which allows a billionaires to buy elections.
1095	Bernie Sanders	What we need to do, simple and straight forward, in every state in this country through the federal government, if you are 18 you have a right to vote, end of discussion.
1096	Bernie Sanders	We have to overturn Citizens United.
1097	Bernie Sanders	We need to move toward public funding of elections.
1098	Rachel Maddow	On this last point, Mr. Steyer.
1099	Tom Steyer	Well, I agree with exactly what Bernie said, but I want to talk about how we’re going to win in 2020.
1100	Tom Steyer	I don’t mean to change the subject, but I think it’s sort of important that the Democratic Party not only beat Donald Trump in 2020, but have a sweeping victory across the country.
1101	Tom Steyer	What that’s going to mean is turnout.
1102	Tom Steyer	In the United States of America, the Democratic Party keeps talking about trying to persuade a few people who are Republicans to like us, when up to half the people don’t vote at all because they think neither party tells the truth, no one deals with my issues, the system is broken, why would we vote, but what we’ve found at NextGen America, is that is the start of a conversation about why votes are so important.
1103	Tom Steyer	If you look at 2018, and flipping the house, what really happened was Democratic voting went up by three quarters in the 38 congressional districts where NextGen America was turning out young people.
1104	Tom Steyer	The turnout went up by more than a hundred percent, more than double.
1105	Rachel Maddow	Thank you, Mr. Steyer.
1106	Tom Steyer	For us to win, for everybody on this stage, for whoever’s the candidate to have a Senate that’s Democratic, for us to have the sweeping victory that we absolutely are going to have next year,-
1107	Rachel Maddow	Mr. Steyer, thank you.
1108	Tom Steyer	-it’s a turnout question.
1109	Tom Steyer	We’re going to have to tell the truth-
1110	Rachel Maddow	Sir.
1111	Tom Steyer	-and we’re going to have to organize across this country.
1112	Rachel Maddow	Thank you very much.
1113	Rachel Maddow	It is time at this point, it is well past time if I’m honest, to start closing statements.
1114	Rachel Maddow	We are going to start tonight with Senator Booker.
1115	Rachel Maddow	The floor is yours.
1116	Senator Booker	Thank you, Rachel.
1117	Senator Booker	It’s an honor to be here tonight.
1118	Senator Booker	I have not yet qualified for the December stage.
1119	Senator Booker	I need your help to do that.
1120	Senator Booker	If you believe in my voice and that I should be up here, please go to CoryBooker.com, please help.
1121	Senator Booker	I had a closing statement prepared, but I saw in the audience during the break, a man named John Lewis.
1122	Senator Booker	Perhaps it’s interesting and important for me to mention why I’m so grateful to him.
1123	Senator Booker	I’ve been calling in this whole election for our need to fight and fight the right way by bringing people together to create transformative change, not just beat Donald Trump.
1124	Senator Booker	That’s the floor.
1125	Senator Booker	We need to go to the ceiling.
1126	Senator Booker	We need to go to the mountaintop.
1127	Senator Booker	I am literally here on this stage right now because 50 years ago, there was a lawyer on a couch who changed his life, changed his mind to get up and start representing families, one of them, mine, who are discriminated against.
1128	Senator Booker	The house I grew up in is because of that lawyer’s activity.
1129	Senator Booker	When I asked him why, why he did what he did, he told me that on March 7th, 1965, he was watching a movie called Judgment at Nuremberg on TV.
1130	Senator Booker	They interrupted that movie to show a bridge in Alabama called the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
1131	Senator Booker	There he saw John Lewis and other marchers who were beaten viciously by Alabama state troopers.
1132	Senator Booker	We all owe a debt that we cannot repay.
1133	Senator Booker	We all drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not dig.
1134	Senator Booker	This is the moment in America where we need a leader that can inspire us to get up and fight again, that we have truly a moral moment in America like it was back in 1965.
1135	Senator Booker	If you give me a chance to lead, I will cause what John Lewis says is good trouble.
1136	Senator Booker	I will challenge us.
1137	Senator Booker	I will ask more from you than any other president has ever asked before,-
1138	Rachel Maddow	Thank you, Senator.
1139	Senator Booker	-because we need to mobilize a new American movement.
1140	Senator Booker	Keep me on this stage.
1141	Senator Booker	Keep me on this race.
1142	Senator Booker	It is time we fight and fight together.
1143	Senator Booker	Please go to CoryBooker.com.
1144	Rachel Maddow	Senator Booker, thank you very much.
1145	Speaker 1	Mr. Steyer, your closing statement.
1146	Tom Steyer	I started by saying that everybody here is more patriotic and more competent than the criminal in the White House.
1147	Tom Steyer	I stand by that statement, but I’m different from everybody else on this stage.
1148	Tom Steyer	I know that the government in Washington D.C., is broken.
1149	Tom Steyer	I know that it’s been purchased by corporations and I’ve spent a decade putting together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to beat those corporations.
1150	Tom Steyer	I’m the only one on this stage who’s willing to talk about structural change in Washington itself, term limits, that if we’re going to make bold changes, we’re going to need new and different people in charge.
1151	Tom Steyer	I’m the only person on this stage who’s spent decades building an international business.
1152	Tom Steyer	Whoever of us is the Democratic nominee is going to have to face Mr. Trump or the Republican and talk about the economy, talk about growth, understand that we can make Mr. Trump what he is, a fraud and a failure on the economy, which is his strong point.
1153	Tom Steyer	I’m the only person on this stage who will say that climate is my first priority, that it’s our biggest challenge, but it’s our biggest opportunity to recreate this country.
1154	Tom Steyer	If you want to beat Mr. Trump, if you want to break the corporate stranglehold on this government, if you want to pass all of the progressive policies that everyone on this stage wants, I’m the person who can do it.
1155	Speaker 1	Thank you, Mr. Steyer.
1156	Tom Steyer	I have spent a decade trusting the American people.
1157	Speaker 1	Thank you, Mr. Steyer.
1158	Tom Steyer	I’m asking you to trust me.
1159	Speaker 1	Thank you.
1160	Speaker 2	Congresswoman Gabbard, go ahead.
1161	Tulsi Gabbard	My personal commitment to you, to all of my fellow Americans, is to treat you with respect and compassion, something that we in Hawaii call Aloha.
1162	Tulsi Gabbard	Every single person deserves to be treated with respect, regardless of race, religion, or gender, or even your politics.
1163	Tulsi Gabbard	Inclusion, unity, respect, Aloha, these will be the operating principles for my administration.
1164	Tulsi Gabbard	Now, Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii first back in 1959, where he expressed his appreciation for what we call the Aloha spirit.
1165	Tulsi Gabbard	He said, “We look to you for inspiration as a bold example for what you have already succeeded in the areas of racial harmony and racial justice, where we are still struggling to achieve in other sections of the country.” He later went on to say, “As I looked out at the various faces in various colors mingled together like the waters of the sea, I see only one face, the face of the future.” Working side by side, let’s defeat the divisiveness of Donald Trump.
1166	Tulsi Gabbard	Come together and usher in a 21st century of racial harmony, of racial justice, peace inclusion, and true equality, working side by side.
1167	Tulsi Gabbard	Let’s make Dr. King’s dream a reality.
1168	Speaker 2	Thank you, Congresswoman.
1169	Speaker 3	Mr. Yang, your turn.
1170	Andrew Yang	I’m here with my wife Evelyn, tonight.
1171	Andrew Yang	We have two young boys, Christopher and Damian.
1172	Andrew Yang	How many of you all are parents like us here in the room?
1173	Andrew Yang	If you’re a parent, you’ve had this thought.
1174	Andrew Yang	Maybe you’ve been afraid to express it, and it is this, our kids are not all right.
1175	Andrew Yang	They’re not all right because we’re leaving them a future that is far darker than the lives that we have led as their parents.
1176	Andrew Yang	We are going through the greatest economic transformation in our country’s history, the fourth industrial revolution, and it is pushing more and more of our people to the side.
1177	Andrew Yang	We talk as if Donald Trump is a cause of all of our problems.
1178	Andrew Yang	He is not.
1179	Andrew Yang	He is a symptom and we need to cure the disease.
1180	Andrew Yang	Now, my first move was not to run for president of the United States because I am not insane.
1181	Andrew Yang	My first move was to go to D.C., talk to our leaders and say, “Technology is ripping us apart.
1182	Andrew Yang	Immigrants are being scapegoated, our kids are being left behind and the American dream that my parents came here to find is dying before our eyes.” The people in Washington D.C. had nothing for this.
1183	Andrew Yang	They don’t want to touch it.
1184	Andrew Yang	They don’t want to talk about an issue they don’t think they have a solution for.
1185	Andrew Yang	I’m not running for president because I fantasized about being president.
1186	Andrew Yang	I’m running for president because like many of you here in this room tonight, I’m a parent and a patriot and I have seen the future that we’re leaving for our kids.
1187	Andrew Yang	It is not something I’m willing to accept.
1188	Andrew Yang	We need to create a new way forward for our people.
1189	Andrew Yang	If you want to join us in rewriting the rules of the 21st century economy, go to Yang2020.com, and make it so that we can look our kids in the eyes and say to them and believe it, “Your country loves you, your country values you and you will be all right.”
1190	Speaker 3	Thank you, Mr. Yang.
1191	Rachel Maddow	Senator Klobuchar.
1192	Amy Klobuchar	The nation was riveted this week by the testimony in Washington.
1193	Amy Klobuchar	One of the people we heard from yesterday was Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.
1194	Amy Klobuchar	What he said was this, he spoke to his immigrant father and he said, “In this country, you can tell the truth and it’s going to be fine.” It reminded me of a army council years and years ago in the McCarthy hearing, someone from Iowa, actually, Mr. Welch, who said, “Have you no sense of decency, sir?” I want us to remember that this election is, yes, an economic check on this President.
1195	Amy Klobuchar	I have bold ideas that we can do to go forward as a country to make college more affordable and bring down the costs of healthcare, yes.
1196	Amy Klobuchar	This is also a patriotism check, a value check, a decency check.
1197	Amy Klobuchar	When you look at the people that turned out in Kentucky, and turned out in Virginia, people turned out that didn’t vote in 2016.
1198	Amy Klobuchar	The African Americans are turning out like we didn’t see before, but we also, and they must be with us and we must get our fired up Democratic base with us.
1199	Amy Klobuchar	We also, let’s get those independents and moderate Republicans who cannot stomach this guy anymore.
1200	Amy Klobuchar	This is how we build the coalition.
1201	Amy Klobuchar	We don’t just beat Donald Trump, we bring the U.S. Senate to some sense.
1202	Amy Klobuchar	We send Mitch McConnell packing.
1203	Amy Klobuchar	This is how we win.
1204	Amy Klobuchar	If you want to join us and remember that this won’t be for me, a personal victory, it’ll be a national victory of someone that wins in red districts and suburban purple districts and bright blue districts every single time, if you want to join us and if you believe that our work doesn’t end on election day, but begins on inauguration day, join us AmyKlobuchar.com.
1205	Amy Klobuchar	Thank you.
1206	Rachel Maddow	Senator Klobuchar, thank you.
1207	Speaker 1	Senator Harris.
1208	Kamala Harris	We’re in a fight.
1209	Kamala Harris	This is a fight for our rule of law, for our democracy and for our system of justice, and it’s a fight we need to win.
1210	Kamala Harris	To fight this fight, I believe we have to have the ability to not only have a nominee who can go toe to toe with Donald Trump.
1211	Kamala Harris	I have taken on Jeff [Session 00:23:44], I have taken on Bill Barr, I have taken on Brett Kavanaugh.
1212	Kamala Harris	I know I have the ability to do that.
1213	Kamala Harris	We also need someone who can unify the party and the country and who has the experience of having done that.
1214	Kamala Harris	I’ve done that work.
1215	Kamala Harris	I believe we need someone who has the ability to speak to all the people regardless of their race, their gender, their party affiliation, where they live geographically or the language their grandmother speaks.
1216	Kamala Harris	My entire career has been spent having one client and one client only, the people.
1217	Kamala Harris	I have never represented a corporation.
1218	Kamala Harris	I have never represented a special interest.
1219	Kamala Harris	In this election, justice and the various injustices people are facing regardless of where they live or their race or gender, are very much on the ballot, from economic justice to reproductive justice, to health care justice, to educational justice.
1220	Kamala Harris	I truly believe that when we overcome these injustices, we will then unlock the potential of the American people and the promise of America.
1221	Kamala Harris	That’s the America I believe in.
1222	Kamala Harris	That’s the America I see.
1223	Kamala Harris	That is why I’m running for president.
1224	Speaker 1	Thank you.
1225	Speaker 1	Senator Harris.
1226	Speaker 3	Mayor Buttigieg, go ahead.
1227	Pete Buttigieg	Well, first of all, I want to remark that we’re in the city of Atlanta, a city where a great local leader, Maynard Jackson, helped create the black middle class that Atlanta is known by, by ensuring that taxpayer dollars were spent in a way that reflected the need to expand opportunity to those who were excluded.
1228	Pete Buttigieg	Just as local leaders have shown great leadership, we need to use the powers of the presidency on challenges like this, expanding opportunity and expanding a sense of belonging to those who have been excluded in this country.
1229	Pete Buttigieg	I’m not only running to defeat Donald Trump, I am running to prepare for the day that begins when Donald Trump has left office, to launch the era that must come after Trump.
1230	Pete Buttigieg	That era must be characterized not by exclusion, but by belonging, and so must our campaign.
1231	Pete Buttigieg	I am inviting progressives who have agreed on these issues we’ve been talking about tonight all along, moderates who are ready to be part of this coalition, and a lot of future former Republicans, who I know are watching this, disgusted by what is happening in their own party and in this country.
1232	Pete Buttigieg	I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we’re building and everybody is welcome in this future that we must create.
1233	Pete Buttigieg	I hope you go to PeteforAmerica.com, join this effort and help us create a better era for the American people, beginning in November, 2020.
1234	Speaker 3	Thank you.
1235	Speaker 2	Senator Sanders.
1236	Bernie Sanders	Thank you.
1237	Bernie Sanders	Let me say a word about myself, unusual as it may seem.
1238	Bernie Sanders	I am the son of an immigrant, young man of 17, who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket.
1239	Bernie Sanders	I have some sense of the immigrant experience.
1240	Bernie Sanders	I will stand with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country.
1241	Bernie Sanders	At the age of 21, as a member of a civil rights group at the University of Chicago, I was arrested, spent the night in jail, and I have been committed to the fight against all forms of discrimination, racial discrimination, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and religious bigotry.
1242	Bernie Sanders	I will lead an administration that will look like America, will end the divisiveness brought by Trump and bring us together.
1243	Bernie Sanders	During this campaign, I am proud to say that I have received more campaign contributions than any candidate at this point in an election in American history, over four million contributions averaging $18 a piece.
1244	Bernie Sanders	If you want to be part of a movement that is not only going to beat Trump, but transform America, that doesn’t have a super PAC, doesn’t do fundraisers at wealthy people’s home, please join us at berniesanders.com.
1245	Bernie Sanders	Thank you.
1246	Rachel Maddow	Senator Warren, the floor is yours.
1247	Senator Warren	Thank you.
1248	Senator Warren	I listened to this debate tonight and I hear a lot of really good ideas, but I take a look at the issues we’ve talked about.
1249	Senator Warren	We’ve talked about climate change, we’ve talked about defense spending, we’ve talked about private health insurance.
1250	Senator Warren	We should have talked about gun violence.
1251	Senator Warren	What do these issues have in common?
1252	Senator Warren	Well first, they touch people all over this country in their everyday lives.
1253	Senator Warren	What is the second thing they have in common?
1254	Senator Warren	We know what we need to do.
1255	Senator Warren	We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix it and the majority of Americans are with us on it and yet we don’t make change.
1256	Senator Warren	Why not?
1257	Senator Warren	Because of corruption, because we have a government that works better for big drug companies than it does for people trying to fill a prescription.
1258	Senator Warren	It works better for a giant defense industry than it does for everyone who worries about the money that goes into arms, instead of into our public schools.
1259	Senator Warren	We have a government that works for those at the top and not for anyone else.
1260	Senator Warren	I have the biggest anti corruption plan since Watergate.
1261	Senator Warren	It involves ending lobbying as we know it, blocking the revolving door between industry and Washington, making everyone who runs for federal office put their tax returns online.
1262	Senator Warren	We have to have the courage not to make just individual changes, not to fight for little pieces.
1263	Senator Warren	We want to make real progress on climate, then we have to start by attacking the corruption that gives the oil industry and other fossil fuel industries a stranglehold over this country.
1264	Senator Warren	I am so grateful to be here and I am grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher, a chance to become a college professor, a chance to become a United States Senator,-
1265	Rachel Maddow	Thank you, Senator.
1266	Senator Warren	-and a chance to become a candidate for President of the United States.
1267	Senator Warren	Thank you.
1268	Speaker 1	[crosstalk 00:30:10].
1269	Speaker 1	Vice president Biden, your closing statement,
1270	Joe Biden	I assume when we’re talking about the corruption of the federal government, we weren’t talking about Barack Obama and his spotless administration who made so much progress.
1271	Joe Biden	One thing we haven’t talked about here today.
1272	Joe Biden	We’ve talked about everything.
1273	Joe Biden	We haven’t talked about the one thing I think is most consequential.
1274	Joe Biden	The American people have an enormous opportunity.
1275	Joe Biden	There’s incredible … I’ve never been more optimistic about our prospects in my entire career and I got elected as a 29 year old kid to the United States Senate.
1276	Joe Biden	Folks, we are in a position where we’re the wealthiest nation in the world.
1277	Joe Biden	Our workers are more productive than the workers around the world, three times as productive as workers in Asia.
1278	Joe Biden	We have more great research universities that the people own than all the rest of the world combined.
1279	Joe Biden	We’re in a position where we’ve led not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.
1280	Joe Biden	I’m so tired of everybody walking around like, woe is me.
1281	Joe Biden	What are we going to do?
1282	Joe Biden	Let’s remember, this is the United States of America.
1283	Joe Biden	There has never, ever, ever been a time when we set our mind to do something, we’ve been able to do it.
1284	Joe Biden	Never, never, never.
1285	Joe Biden	It’s time to remember who we are.
1286	Joe Biden	Get up.
1287	Joe Biden	Let’s take back this country and lead the world again.
1288	Joe Biden	It’s within our power to do it.
