(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWas the cosmetic really once banned under British law? We wanted to find out.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s accurate that during the 16th century (and beyond) people had very strong opinions about makeup and its ability to deceive the eye. One 1711 letter written to British newspaper The Spectator about the use of makeup said that men who had married women who didn\u2019t \"let their husbands see their faces until they are married\" were \"injured gentlemen.\"\nHowever maligned some men may have felt about the deception of painted lips, we could find no evidence that a lipstick ban ever made its way through Parliament at any time.\nA 2017 article by Racked, Vox\u2019s now defunct fashion-focused website, dove into the rumors that a law passed in England in 1770, supposedly called the \"Hoops and Heels Act,\" that made it legal for a man to divorce his wife if she had tricked him into marriage using \"witchcraft\" to enhance her looks. The story says:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Called the Hoops and Heels Act, it stated that any woman who tried to \u2018seduce and betray into matrimony\u2019 a man using \u2018scents, paints, cosmetic washes, artificial teeth, false hair, Spanish wool, iron stays, hoops, high-heeled shoes, [or] bolstered hips\u2019 would be tried for witchcraft and have her marriage voided if found guilty.\n\"Except it never happened. But generations of researchers have been fooled, some stating that the law was passed in 1774, others saying that it was voted down by Parliament, and another group claiming that under the counsel of their mistresses and wives, members of Parliament decided not to vote on it at all.\"\nSo despite iterations of the claim proliferating the internet for years, there was no British law that instituted a lipstick ban.\nFact-checking website Africa Check found that the closest thing to such a law came in a June 7, 1650, entry in the House of Commons Journal under the heading \"Immodest Dress.\"\u00a0\nThat entry says: \"An Act against the Vice of Painting, and wearing black Patches, and immodest Dresses of Women, be read on Friday Morning next.\"\nBut officials with the United Kingdom\u2019s National Archives told PolitiFact in an email that the bill never had a full reading, as far as they could see, and because of that \"it was likely introduced at the behest of a Puritan MP (member of parliament) but the Council of State chose not to pursue it.\"\nWhile 1770s society may have considered painted lips and makeup in general to be unladylike witchcraft, a law banning it never succeeded.\nFeminine trickery marches on.
