Debra Rodman \"opposes adoption as an alternative to abortion in event of unplanned pregnancies.\"", "truth_label": "false", "date": "stated on September 30, 2019 in a campaign mailer.:", "title": "Dunnavant doesn't prove claim Rodman favors abortion over adoption", "text": "State Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R- Henrico is denouncing her challenger, Democrat Debra Rodman, as a \"liberal activist\" who has shown a \"lack of judgement\" during her two years in the House of Delegates.\nDunnavant made the charges in a Sept. 30 mailer that criticizes Rodman on six issues. One particularly caught our attention.\u00a0She said Rodman \"opposes adoption as an alternative to abortion in unplanned pregnancies.\" We fact-checked her statement.\nDunnavant\u2019s mailer cites an unsuccessful 2018 bill Rodman co-sponsored that would have\u00a0changed state mandates for family life education in public schools. It would have abolished what many Democrats said were biased standards calling\u00a0for \"teaching the social, psychological and health gains to be realized by teenagers\u2019 abstaining from sexual activity before marriage.\"\nThe bill also would have removed the requirement to teach \"the benefits of adoption as a positive choice in the event of an unwanted pregnancy.\"\nIn place of the mandates was a requirement that students get teaching \"that is medically accurate.\"\u00a0\nThe bill died in a partisan 12-10 vote in the House Education Committee on Feb. 5, 2018. Rodman voted in the minority with Democrats for the measure.\nMarshall Moreau, Dunnavant\u2019s campaign manager, says Rodman\u2019s support of the bill justifies the mailer claim. \"The only inference to be drawn is that Rodman is opposed to adoption as an alternative to abortion in the event of unplanned pregnancies,\" he wrote in an email.\nDunnavant saidin the email, \"For Delegate Rodman to say she doesn't oppose adoption but doesn\u2019t want to teach about it, is like saying \u2018I want you to get out of the burning building but I\u2019m not going to tell you where the fire escape is.\u2019\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill Rodman backed was silent about adoption. Rodman and other Democrats say the bill wouldn\u2019t have barred instruction about adoption; it\u00a0would have required that if taught, it be\u00a0in a neutral, factual way when discussing pregnancy,\nRodman says her position has been contorted by Dunnavant.\u00a0\"I believe in a woman\u2019s right to choose,\" Rodman said in an email. \"Adoption is a wonderful choice women can and should make if it\u2019s right for them. Politicians should not interfere in this personal choice.\"\nOur ruling\nDunnavant says Rodman \"opposes adoption as an alternative to abortion in event of unplanned pregnancies.\"\u00a0\nShe cites Rodman\u2019s support of a bill that would have changed state mandates for family life courses in schools to ensure what Democrats said would be neutral and scientific teaching. It wouldn\u2019t have ended instruction about adoption; it would have erased a requirement for teaching its \"benefits\" as a \"positive choice in the event of an unwanted pregnancy.\"\u00a0\nDunnavant wrenches that position on teaching to the sensational claim that Rodman supports abortion over adoption. Rodman says she backs choice on adoption and abortion. Dunnavant\u2019s statement goes well beyond that, and she fails to credibly back it up.\nWe rate Dunnavant\u2019s statement False.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this fact check gave the wrong date the family life education bill died in the House Education Committee.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00085"}
