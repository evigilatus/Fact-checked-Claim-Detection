The clear objective of the amulet, based on the items and associated costs, is to discredit the Republicans and Trump. Here's the cost breakdown, according to Facebook December 9: \"The cost of Mueller's investigation: $3,200,000 from Benghazi: \"Investigation: $7 million from Trump's golf trips: $83 million from a new public tax bill: $1 million.\" The Mim adds: \"Dear Republicans, please spare us your selective anger over the cost of the investigation between Trump and Russia.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The mima includes accurate information, but it ignores critical facts and details. Muller's investigation, $3.2 million? Special Adviser Robert Mueller is investigating Russia &apos; s intervention in the 2016 elections and whether the Trump campaign has supported those efforts. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. It is unclear when the MIM started trading, but it was shared on Facebook shortly on 9 December 2018. The first expenditure report of the investigation came in December 2017 and showed that between May 2017 and the end of September 2017, the Mueller office incurred $3.2 million in direct expenditure and $3.5 million in indirect expenditure, totalling $6.7 million. If the Mimi relied only on that report, then it was deleted from the calculation of indirect expenditure costs. Also, spending did not stop there. The Mueller office issued additional expenditure reports in May 2018 and again in December 2018. The latest information released on 14 December shows that from the start of the investigation in May 2017 until 30 September 2018, direct expenditure amounted to $12.3 million and indirect expenditure amounted to $12.9 million, or a total of $25.2 million. This significantly exceeds the $3.2 million claimed by the MIM. The Benghazi investigation, $7 million? In May 2014, legislators began investigating the 2012 terrorist attack on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" The investigations were concluded in 2016, at a cost of approximately $7 million. The investigations did not indicate that Clinton was personally responsible for the attack or could have prevented it. This claim in the Mim is more in line with the facts than the one about the Mueller probe. Trump golf trips, $83 million? Trump routinely criticized his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the time he spent playing golf. Trump was a regular head of the golf course, and he pushed the monitors to track his trips to the golf course. We have our Trump golf tracker. The 83 million-dollar Mimi source is unclear. But Sophie Germain, who described herself as a data addict, runs the Fralgolfcount.com website, which updates his record after Tramp's visit. The website relies on reports of the White House press complex. According to Frapergolfcount.com, Trump has made 154 day visits to golf clubs since his inauguration, \"with evidence of at least 70 golf games,\" which cost taxpayers $84 million. (The last on-site picnic was 25 November 2018) It states that the cost estimates are based on: (a) flights to Tramp property; (b) the protection of Mar-Lago Coast Guard (a Trump property in Florida); (c) the stay of Trump in his club and the rental of luxury vehicles in Turnberry, Scotland, in July 2018; and (c) \"an additional $6.4 million per year, pro rata per day, based on the amount paid to date, allocated to Palm Beach and Biedminster for \"unusually costs for law enforcement personnel.\" Although the site has been cited by multiple outlets, our fact-finding friends found in the Washington Post that some of its estimates, particularly the cost of the first flights, may be very high. The fact-checker in Washington also questioned whether it was fair to attribute all the costs of presidential travel and support to the golf picnic, since this logistical support follows the President wherever he goes. The fact-finding exercise conducted by Washington Post in July 2018 also warned that the site then used a specific figure of dollars to cover the cost of Tramp golf trips, as it did not know exactly how many times Trump played golf or the exact costs. The fact-checking of the facts on its website was addressed by Trambolf Count.com, who said: \"At the time of publication of his article, our estimated cost was $72,251,706, but (Gline Washington Post) Kessler correctly pointed out that since our estimates have a great deal of uncertainty, they should not be mentioned exactly in dollars. We have updated our site accordingly, and our total cost is now close to the nearest million.\" The idea is that it's known how much Tramp's golf trips cost, but this number is uncertain. New debt from the Republic's tax bill, $1.5 trillion? In December 2017, President Donald Trump signed a new tax bill containing significant corporate tax cuts as well as temporary individual tax cuts. Changes in the tax law are expected to increase the federal deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The deficit is the difference between annual government expenditure and government revenue. The debt is the total amount owed by the Government. We have estimated the false claim by Larry Codlow, First Economic Adviser to President Donald Trump, that \"a total tax reduction of $1.5 trillion is paid from higher revenues and better nominal GDP. \"The cost of Mueller's investigation: $3,200,000; \"The investigation\" Benghazi: $7 million; Tramp golf trips: $83 million; new debt from the Republic's tax bill: $1,500,000,000,000. The idea includes a combination of accurate, incomplete and questionable information. Anyway, we're assessing the claim half right.
