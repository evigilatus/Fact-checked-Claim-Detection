This article about Rafieya Husain, the Miss Universe Guyana 2017, is bogus and recycles previous similar phony stories about other beauty queens.\nWe found similar fake articles on the same website about Miss Figi and Miss United Continents and on other websites about Miss Namibia and Miss Universe Malta. None of the accounts are accurate. \nOne of the beauty queens, Miss Universe contestant Martha Fenech, told the Times of Malta that such a report can be harmful.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People who know me immediately laughed it off, but several other contacted me to know if I'm okay,\" she said. \"Other 'girls' apparently were only happy to share the fake news item.
