Is that right?", "text": "In an effort to make Democrats agree to finance a border wall with Mexico, President Donald Trump said that there were tragic consequences of illegal migration. For example, he provided statistics on women who had sexually abused them on their trip to the United States. \"One in three women sexually assaulted on a dangerous journey north,\" said Trump Jan 19. \"In fact, many loving mothers give their young daughters birth control pills for the long journey to the United States because they know they may be raped or sexually abused.\" Trump noticed number 1 in 3 during a television show to end the government closure. Trump is looking for $5.7 billion for a border wall. In contrast, he offered to continue to provide temporary protection against deportation to so-called dreamers, young immigrants in the country illegally and migrants whose temporary protected status expired. Bolivi Vac asked about the accuracy of Trump &apos; s statement on the number of women sexually abused. Migrants &apos; rights defenders have long stressed that migrants arriving illegally in the United States face risks throughout the journey, including sexual abuse. It is difficult to identify a specific number or percentage of women who have been abused; not all people report abuse, no interviews with all women travelling, and data are generally limited. \"The percentage of women who have been sexually abused or sexually abused is widespread throughout the region, where there is no single representative sample of all women crossing Mexico to reach the United States,\" N\u00e9stor P. Rodr\u00edguez, a sociology professor and research assistant at the Population Research Centre of the University of Texas. Rodr\u00edguez said that he had heard from immigrants and refugees lawyers a higher percentage of women who had been abused or abused, but those figures were not based on a representative sample of all women crossing Mexico. The White House did not respond to Poletti &apos; s request for information. However, we found a similar claim posted on the White House website citing the report of M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res 2017. According to a May 2017 report by M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res, 31.4 per cent of women have been sexually abused while transiting through Mexico, out of more than 400 people surveyed in Mexico in facilities that assist migrants. (The majority of the migrants interviewed were men). According to the report, the results provided a \"timely gunshot\" from a population accessible to the medical community, which was not necessarily representative of all immigrants travelling through Mexico to the United States. The MSF report provides medical and mental health care to migrants and refugees fleeing violence in Central America and travel through Mexico. The group stated that \"migrants and refugees are pursued by criminal organizations, sometimes with the tacit consent or complicity of national authorities, and are subjected to violence and other attacks,\" including abduction, theft, extortion, torture and rape. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2219 By Miriam Valverdi: 3 February 2021 for the 2017 report, M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res reviewed medical data from 2015 to December 2016, and a 2015 survey of 467 people encountered in \"Albergis,\" care homes, clinics and mobile health centres where migrants seek food, shelter, information and health care. The report stated that a large number of migrants reported sexual violence, unwanted sex and sex as being treated in exchange for shelter, protection or money. \"In view of a comprehensive definition of these groups, of the 429 migrants and refugees who answered questions (sexual and gender-based violence), 31.4 per cent of women and 17.2 per cent of men were sexually abused while transiting Mexico,\" the report said. \"In view of rape and other forms of direct sexual violence only, 10.7 per cent of women and 4.4 per cent of men were affected while transiting Mexico,\" she added, \"10.7 per cent of women and 4.4 per cent of men were affected while transiting Mexico.\" (Medicals without Borders did not use the term sexual assault, as did Tramp; the term sexual assault was used to describe various types of sexual violence against women and men.) The report stated that doctors without borders/doctors without borders \"take comprehensive conclusions; however, the survey provides valuable information on the facts that many people have seen along this path, within a specified time period, as reported to the teams of doctors without borders.\" In a speech delivered in December at the Migration Conference in Morocco, Dr. Joan Leo, International President of M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res/Medicals sans fronti\u00e8res, said that one third of women reported having been sexually abused while in transit to the United States. The people in Mexico and Central America \"know the suffering they will suffer while on the road. But even knowing such risks does not deter them, \"Leo said. \"Women and girls are looking for contraceptives because they simply expect to be raped on their journeys,\" said Leo. \"People are forced to choose between domestic violence and the distant possibility of a future with hope.\" Our verdict, Trump, said, \"One in three women is sexually abused on a dangerous journey north.\" According to a 2017 report by M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res, 31.4 per cent of women have been sexually abused as they pass through Mexico. This is based on a survey conducted in 2015 of more than 400 migrants interviewed in facilities where migrants seek assistance. (The majority of the migrants interviewed were men). M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res said that its report provided a brief overview of the risks faced by migrants, but that it was not necessarily representative of the entire migrant population travelling through Mexico. The Trump statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or leaves things out of context. We value it half right.
