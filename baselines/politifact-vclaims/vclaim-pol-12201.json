Paul used his turn to attack Cain.\n\nThe former Godfather\u2019s Pizza CEO \"belittled\" him and his followers, who want the Federal Reserve to undergo a major audit, Paul said.\n\n\"You said -- you've used pretty strong terms -- that we were ignorant and that we didn't know what we were doing, and therefore there is no need for an audit anyway because if you had one you're not going to find out everything because everybody knows everything about the Fed,\" Paul said during the Oct. 11 debate at Dartmouth College.\n\n\"I did not call you or any of your people \u2018ignorant,\" Cain fired back. \"I don't know where that came from.\"\n\nDid too, Paul shot back: \"I\u2019ll get it for you.\"\n\nPaul\u2019s supporters rose to the challenge. Within hours after the debate\u2019s end, the Internet swirled with what they said was proof that Cain called them \"ignorant.\"\n\nCain\u2019s denial caught our attention. Did Cain really call Paul and his followers \"ignorant\"?\n\nThe Fed is a touchy issue among many Republicans, especially Paul supporters, who think it conducts too much business behind closed doors. Congress created the central bank of the United States to give the nation a more stable financial system, but Paul thinks the Fed brought about the current economic troubles through backroom dealings and bad policy. He wants the organization audited and abolished.\n\nPaul and Cain both consider themselves strict Constitutionalists and enemies of big government, but Cain is a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. For Paul supporters, that\u2019s like having a giant bull\u2019s-eye painted on your back.\n\nEven before Cain announced his run for president, Paul supporters were dogging him at campaign stops, asking him to back a full audit of the Fed. (Cain\u2019s position on auditing the Federal Reserve is the subject of a separate PolitiFact item.)\n\nWe contacted Paul\u2019s camp so it could give us its best evidence against Cain, but it didn\u2019t get back to us. In its absence, we sifted through news accounts, news databases, Internet videos and websites where backers posted what they called key evidence of Cain\u2019s name-calling.\n\nWe found that Cain isn\u2019t shy about his disdain for Paul\u2019s criticisms. He\u2019s not above calling someone ignorant, either. Last month, he said President Barack Obama showed \"ignorance of basic economics.\"\n\nBut we found no record that Cain ever called Paul or his backers \"ignorant.\"\n\nBloggers and news accounts repeatedly referred to two sources as proof against Cain: his recently released book \"This is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House\" and a 2010 clip from Neal Boortz\u2019s radio show. Cain frequently subbed in for Boortz when he was a talk show host on radio AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the book. Near the end of the chapter \"The Cain Doctrine,\" Cain wrote that Paul supporters stretch the truth whenever they attend his appearances and say he does not want an audit of the Federal Reserve. \u00a0\n\nInstead of calling Paul backers \"ignorant,\" Cain wrote this: \"I get the same stupid question at almost every one of these events. I know it\u2019s a deliberate strategy. How can a person randomly show up at a hundred events and ask the same stupid question to try to nail me on the Federal Reserve? \"\n\nAnd this: \"But I\u2019ve got news for the Paulites: It\u2019s not going to work, because the American people are a lot smarter than they are.\"\n\nCain did call some people stupid, but not Paul\u2019s supporters: \"[T]here are stupid people out there -- the people who are running this country, and I\u2019m worried about them,\" Cain wrote.\n\nNow for Cain\u2019s radio statement, which Paul backers posted online.\n\n\"I think a lot of people are calling for this audit of the Federal Reserve because they don\u2019t know enough about it,\" Cain said, according to their online post. \"There\u2019s no hidden secrets going on in the Federal Reserve to my knowledge.\"\n\nOnce again, Cain did not use the word \"ignorant.\" He did say backers of a Fed audit need to understand the bank better.\n\nHow do we rule?\n\nCain said plenty of disparaging things about Paul\u2019s backers. He called their questions \"stupid.\" He said Fed audit backers \"don\u2019t know enough about it.\" \u00a0He said the American people are are \"a lot smarter than they are.\"\n\nYou could even say that Cain \"belittled\" Paul\u2019s followers, as the Texan claimed during the debate.\n\nBut Paul was very specific that one of the \"strong terms\" Cain used against his backers was the word \"ignorant.\" Paul said he\u2019d produce proof, but neither he nor his supporters have done so. We couldn\u2019t find any, either.\n\nPaul earns a False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNathan Deal\n\n\nstated on July 30, 2010 in a press release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican candidate for governor \"Karen Handel has run a 100 percent negative campaign.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 August 4, 2010", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12201"}
