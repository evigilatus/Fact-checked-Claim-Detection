We need to focus on creating big, structural change to tackle this climate crisis and the Washington corruption head-on. #ClimateTownHall A post shared by  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethwarren) on Sep 4, 2019 at 8:20pm PDT \nWe wondered which three industries the Democratic presidential candidate had in mind.\nWarren\u2019s campaign directed us to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The agency\u2019s page on the sources of greenhouse gas emissions shows that three sectors \u2014transportation, electricity production and industry \u2014 account for 78% of the American total.\nBut those are activities, not industries in themselves. Transportation, the biggest of the three, includes the cars people drive and the flights they take for business and pleasure.\n\"It is strange, obviously, to say \u2018three industries\u2019 with one of them being \u2018industry,\u2019\" said the co-director of MIT\u2019s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change John Reilly.\n\nThe focus on industry, Reilly said, shifts attention away from the broader ways that energy consumption is woven into the fabric of American life.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This may lead to the implication that the cost of reducing these emissions will fall on industry,\" he said. \"To the extent that myth is perpetuated, that is a problem. One way or another, we will all bear the cost of doing things differently.\"\u00a0\nThe climate researchers we reached said Warren\u2019s term was off the mark. Where they differed was on the significance. In contrast to Reilly, Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said he didn\u2019t find it to be a major issue.\nAs it turns out, Warren has used the 70% figure in a couple of ways that are more accurate, without saying \"industries.\"\nEarlier during the town hall, Warren said she wanted to focus on \"the three areas where we get the most carbon pollution in America right now.\"\n\"They're in our buildings and homes, right? What we're burning. It's our cars and light-duty trucks that we drive. And it's the generation of electricity where we're still using a lot of carbon-based fuel to make that happen.\"\u00a0\nEliminating the carbon footprint in all three by 2035 would, she said, \"cut 70% of the carbon that we are currently spewing into the air.\"\nThat\u2019s a slightly different mix of sources, and based on the EPA numbers, they add up to the reduction Warren claimed.\nIn her $1 trillion clean energy plan that Warren posted a day before the town hall, she was fully accurate.\u00a0\n\"Electricity, transportation, buildings, and related commercial activity are responsible for nearly 70% of all U.S. carbon emissions,\" she wrote.\nOur ruling\nWarren said that three industries account for 70% of the carbon that goes into the air. That\u2019s imprecise. It is accurate to say that transportation, producing electricity and industry writ large are the three largest sources of greenhouse gases and represent more than 70% of the problem. But those are activities, not industries. Individual Americans as well as companies contribute to the situation in ways that are often intertwined.\nWarren herself has been more accurate in her energy plan and even during the town hall itself. But she pushed the focus on industry on social media, and climate change researchers say that word doesn\u2019t fit with the 70% figure she used.\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00188"}
