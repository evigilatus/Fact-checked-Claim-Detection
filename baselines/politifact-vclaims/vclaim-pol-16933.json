The order, described as a \"temporary requirement to suspend activities that are not necessary to sustain or protect life,\" does not mention flags. It does direct people to stay home, with exceptions, and requires businesses that remain open for in-person sales to follow rules including limiting how many people can be in a store at the same time.\u00a0\nThe order also requires businesses to close areas of the store \u2014\u00a0\"by cordoning them off, placing signs in aisles, posting prominent signs, removing goods from shelves, or other appropriate means\" \u2014 that are dedicated to carpet, flooring, furniture, garden center and plant nurseries and paint. Flags are not listed, but they\u2019re addressed at the top of a \"frequently asked questions\" page on the governor\u2019s website.\nQ. Does Executive Order 2020-42 prohibit buying an American flag?\u00a0\nA: No. While the order places certain limits on how goods are sold, it does not ban Michiganders from buying any item, including flags.\u00a0\nShelter-in-place orders around the country have disrupted daily life and in some cases made it more difficult to obtain everything from toilet paper to appliances. It\u2019s possible that it could be harder for someone in Michigan, or other states, to buy an American flag. But that\u2019s different from the governor banning residents from making such a purchase.\u00a0\nWe rate this blog post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16933"}
