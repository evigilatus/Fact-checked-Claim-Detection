Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., made the same claim in a tweet. We wondered whether Kavanaugh had indeed ruled the CFPB was unconstitutional. Largely, yes.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\nThe bureau has stirred controversy from the start.\nWarren was an early advocate for the CFPB and was considered the likely first head until a potential appointment was opposed by Republicans in Congress. Obama\u2019s second choice, Richard Cordray, was also kept from taking office, until Obama sidestepped GOP lawmakers by making a recess appointment. Cordray was later confirmed with some bipartisan support in 2013. (Cordray is now running for governor in Ohio.)\nUnlike most federal agencies, the bureau does not rely on appropriations for its funding. The bureau\u2019s operating budget comes from the Federal Reserve and does not require congressional approval.\nThe CFPB is headed by a single director with a five-year term who cannot be fired at will. The president may only remove the director for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,\" according to the law that established it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Kavanaugh said\nAfter CFPB imposed a $109 million fine on PHH Corp., the New Jersey mortgage service provider sued, challenging the constitutionality of the CFPB.\nIn 2016, the D.C. Court of Appeals sided with the company and cleared the fine. Kavanaugh, one of the three judges, wrote the opinion. Kavanaugh wrote that the CFPB is \"unconstitutionally structured.\"\nThe structure, Kavanaugh argued, gives the CFPB director more unilateral authority than anyone in the government besides the president.\nIn order to remedy the constitutional flaw, Kavanaugh wrote, Supreme Court precedent dictates a \"narrower remedy\" than shutting down the entire CFPB. Kavanaugh suggested allowing the president to supervise, direct and fire the director at will. That\u2019s not exactly the same thing as finding the CFPB itself to be unconstitutional, but it\u2019s close, law experts told us.\nA later decision by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld CFPB\u2019s constitutionality. The question could still come to the Supreme Court.\nAaron Klein, the policy director at Brookings Institution\u2019s Center on Regulations and Markets, said that tying CFPB directly to the president, and thus election cycles, could curb its intended independence.\n\"Reducing the independence of any financial regulator is likely to make them pursue less politically unpopular activities, like reining in credit practices during good times,\" \u00a0he said. \"That\u2019s why financial regulation tends to only pass Congress after crises, and as the memory of the crisis fades, deregulation comes in.\"\nOur ruling\nKlobuchar said Kavanaugh \"ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional (reversed by full Circuit Court).\"\nIn 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a three judge panel of the D.C. Circuit finding the CFPB structurally unconstitutional. The issue lay in the bureau\u2019s leadership structure, not the bureau itself. That said, a change to its leadership structure could rein in the regulatory activities CFPB performs.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01809"}
