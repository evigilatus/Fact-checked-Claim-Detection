He claims that Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, his gubernatorial primary opponent, \u00a0has raised \"the garbage tax\" by \"as much as $200 for some residents.\" \nBlock raised the issue during a debate with Fung on Rhode Island Public Radio on July 15, 2014. \nWhen it was Block\u2019s turn to ask Fung a question, he said, \u00a0\"You know, I\u2019ve heard from a number of Cranston residents, including a few CPAs, that the increase in the garbage tax that you\u2019ve imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200 dollars. And for a number of people in Cranston, that\u2019s equivalent to what is in effect a five-percent increase in their property tax \u2026\n\"So my question to you is: When you talk about not increasing taxes but you\u2019re charging some people the equivalent of 5 percent increase in property taxes, with $200 to collect garbage where they paid much less than the year before, how do you explain that, and do you think that\u2019s acceptable? I hear from a ton of people we talked to in Cranston; they\u2019re very unhappy with this.\"\nIn response, Fung said he\u2019d heard from many residents that they\u2019re happy with the new system. \n\"I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re talking about a garbage tax,\" he said. \"We haven\u2019t raised taxes.\"\nGarbage tax? $200 increase? Equivalent to 5-percent tax increase? \nIs this just a lot of trash talk?\nHere are the facts, according to the city\u2019s website and the mayor\u2019s office:\nCranston\u2019s new automated trash pickup system,which started in June, is intended to boost the city\u2019s recycling rate from 23 percent to the state\u2019s goal of 35 percent and potentially earn rebates; keep the city cleaner by using closed containers; and reduce the rodent population by using the largely chew-proof barrels.\nAll in all, it should make for a cleaner, sweeter-smelling Cranston with an eased \"critter\" problem. \nAs part of the program, Cranston residents have received two new, free \u00a065-gallon rolling barrels, one for trash, the other for recyclables. Residents can opt for smaller, 35-gallon bins if the larger ones are too unwieldy. \nResidents who want a third barrel must pay $150 per year. There\u2019s another change: the city no longer removes bulky items and appliances for free. Residents must pay $18 per bulky item, and $25 per mattress or box spring. \u00a0\nThe bottom line: There is no new \"garbage tax,\" but there new fees for services that were free before.\nNow let\u2019s examine Block\u2019s claim. \nWhen we asked the Block campaign what he was talking about, they emailed us a five-page response, contending that he was referring to the charge for the optional extra barrels, and the new removal fees for bulky items.\nWe should note that, in his back-and-forth with Fung, Block at one point said: \"You don\u2019t want to call it a tax - let\u2019s call it a fee. They\u2019re now paying a fee \u2026\" But he also used the words \"tax\" or \"taxes\" six times in roughly 30 seconds.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his email, Block explained his math.\n\"The fact of the matter is that the citizens of Cranston are paying much more for trash removal than they were in the prior year when it was already done as a service paid for by their tax dollars,\" Block wrote.\n\"Collectively every household that has an extra bin ($150), plus any household that has a large curbside item ($18 per item) adds up to a sum of money that Cranston taxpayers are collectively paying for out of pocket that they didn\u2019t pay for the year before -- call it a fee, call it a tax, call it whatever, but many Cranston residents are now paying more for trash service than they were a year ago.\"\nAs for the five percent: \"If a homeowner has an annual property tax bill of $4,000 and he/she needs to purchase an extra bin, and also pay for three curbside items, \"then he /she is paying approximately $300 in new fees, which is a 5% increase over their $4,000 tax bill.\"\nOK, but just a second.\nHow many is \"many\" when we\u2019re talking about people paying for additional bins?\nBlock cites 2008 Environmental Protection Agency estimates that each person in the U.S. \"creates a daily average of 4.5 pounds of solid waste.\" From that, Block extrapolates that \"each person creates approximately 30 pounds of solid waste per week\" in concluding that \"larger families will need an extra bin or bins.\"\nBlock also noted that the 65-gallon barrels provided in Cranston are smaller than the 90-gallon barrels provided in nearby Warwick. And he noted that residents who previously could discard bulky items such as sofas, carpets and mattresses will now have to pay extra fees. \nIt\u2019s a little early to predict how many people in Cranston will be paying extra for bulky waste or renting extra bins. \nBut to date, out of 28,600 residential units that have received barrels, only 80 have requested an additional trash bin - or 0.3 percent, the mayor says. \nFung also called Block\u2019s statement \"false in a number of respects\" and noted that there hasn\u2019t been an increase in property taxes for three years.\n\"So even if a portion of the regular property tax were to be segregated or designated as paying for refuse removal services, the statement that there has been an \u2018increase\u2019 is false, because the overall tax rate has stayed constant for three consecutive years,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nDuring a radio debate, Ken Block said, \"The increase in the garbage tax that [Mayor Allan Fung] imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200.\"\nHe then mentioned the word \"tax or taxes\" five more times.\nBut there is no garbage tax. And only those who request an extra barrel or are discarding bulky items and mattresses will pay any extra fees.\nIn fairness, Block later used the word \"fee,\" and \"additional fee.\" But we believe the average listener \u00a0would conclude that Block was talking about a hike in -- or extra fee beyond -- an existing \"garbage tax.\"\nIn addition, Block\u2019s claim that \"many Cranston residents are now paying more for trash service than they were a year ago,\" is sweeping generalization. Only 80 residents have so far requested an extra barrel. \nWe won\u2019t say that Block\u2019s claim is a whole lot of garbage. But it certainly misleads and exaggerates. \nWe rule his statement False. \n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email\u00a0protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07541"}
