John Cornyn offered an amendment to exempt former military personnel from the law. Cornyn said that veterans should be allowed to own assault weapons as they are most highly-trained and qualified individuals. He also explained that disarming these people\u00a0prevents veterans of a way to protect their families and communities.\nHe said, \"Members and veterans of the Armed Forces are the most highly-trained and qualified individuals to own these weapons for self-defense purposes. We should think long and hard before disarming these heroes, preventing them from protecting their families and communities.\"\nFeinstein oppposed the amendment. Part of her rationale was that some veterans could suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\"If I understand this, this (amendment) adds an exemption of retired military. As I understand our bill, no issue has arose (sic)\u00a0in this regard during the 10 years the expired ban was in effect and what we did in the other bill was exempt possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States. So that included active military. The problem with expanding this is that, you know, with the advent of PTSD, which I think is a new phenomenon as a product of the Iraq War, it\u2019s not clear how the seller or transferrer of a firearm covered by this bill would verify that an individual was a member, or a veteran, and that there was no impairment of that individual with respect to having a weapon like this. So, you know, I would be happy to sit down with you again and see if we could work something out but I think we have to \u2014 if you\u2019re going to do this, find a way that veterans who are incapacitated for one reason or another mentally don\u2019t have access to this kind of weapon.\"\u00a0(See the discussion via C-Span\u00a0starting from 1:30:00.)\nFeinstein never said that \"all vets are mentally ill\" or the \"government should prevent them from owning firearms.\"\nHowever, that false quote was fabricated and spread throughout the internet, especially across different political forums. The story has been recycling since 2013 and most of them cite Los Angeles Times columnist Burt Prelutsky as the initial source in order to gain credibility.\nAccording to Snopes.com, Burt Prelutsky is not a Los Angeles Times columnist.\nFeinstein's words were mangled beyond what she said.
