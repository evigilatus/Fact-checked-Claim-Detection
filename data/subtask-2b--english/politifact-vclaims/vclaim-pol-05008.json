Rick Scott is not on board with the minimum wage increase in the sunny, oceanside state \u2014 of California.\nAs Scott toured the West Coast for the second time attempting to attract businesses, Enterprise Florida (the state\u2019s public-private economic development arm) ran radio ads in San Francisco and Los Angeles attacking California\u2019s $15 wage and trumpeting Florida\u2019s superior job prospects.\n\"Seven hundred thousand. That\u2019s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage,\" the ad says, as the Miami Herald reports. \"Ready to leave California? Go to Florida instead \u2014 no state income tax, and Gov. Scott has cut regulations. Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them.\"\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown didn\u2019t take this lying down, penning a letter welcoming Scott back to California, \"a state that in the last year has added more jobs than Florida and Texas combined,\" and not-so-subtly suggested Scott worry about more pressing matters back home.\n\"Rick, a fact you\u2019d like to ignore: California is the 7th largest economic power in the world. We\u2019re competing with nations like Brazil and France, not states like Florida,\" Brown wrote on May 2. \"If you\u2019re truly serious about Florida\u2019s economic well-being, it\u2019s time to stop the silly political stunts and start doing something about climate change \u2013 two words you won\u2019t even let state officials say. The threat is real and so too will be the devastating impacts.\"\nHere, we\u2019ll look at Scott\u2019s claim that California will lose almost as many jobs as Florida will gain.\nThe ad is comparing\u00a0California's projected employment with Florida's past performance \u2014 an apples-to-oranges comparison.\u00a0It\u00a0also distorts what the 700,000 jobs-lost figure actually refers to. Even with the wage hike, California is expected to gain more jobs than Florida over the next decade, albeit not as many as without it. Furthermore, all the economists we spoke with cautioned against pinning a figure to the minimum wage hike\u2019s impact on employment in California.\nAll that glitters in Golden State jobs\nA spokesperson for Scott cited a post by American Action Forum, a self-described center-right policy institute, as the source of the 700,000 lost jobs. But the figure doesn\u2019t refer to a decline in the total number jobs in the state, as the ad suggests. Rather, it\u2019s the difference between the number of jobs that California could have gained without and with the wage hike.\nCalifornia will gradually increase the current $10 hourly minimum wage to $15 by 2022. According to the institute's labor market policy director, Ben Gitis, that will lead to a 3.5 percent decrease in employment growth or about 692,235 jobs by 2026 that could have been added if the wage did not increase.\nGitis walked us through his math. He used the California Employment Development Department\u2019s latest 10-year forecast, which projects that the state will add 14.9 percent or 2.3 million more jobs from 2012 to 2022.\nGitis then calculated the impact of the minimum wage hike; he concluded that California would see its projected 2026 jobs numbers reduced by 3.5 percent.\nIn other words, California would have added about 3.4 million new jobs from 2012 to 2026 without the hike, but 2.7 million with it. So the state isn\u2019t so much \"losing\" 700,000 jobs as \"forgoing\" them, said Jeremy West, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who co-authored the Journal of Human Resources study Gitis used for his calculations.\nBright employment outlook in Sunshine State\nScott\u2019s office forwarded us a press release that says Florida has added more than a million jobs since 2010, a claim that PolitiFact Florida rated Mostly True. But Scott was talking about future projections for California, so we\u2019ll look instead at the number of jobs Florida will gain in the same time frame as Gitis\u2019 analysis.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2012 to 2026, Florida is actually projected to add more than a million jobs. The increase, however, will still be less than California\u2019s.\n(We would be remiss to not mention that California\u2019s cost of living is higher\u00a0than Florida's and its population size is almost twice as big.\u00a0But as Enterprise Florida touted raw employment numbers, we\u2019ll follow suit.)\nFlorida added about 552,000 jobs from Dec. 2012 to Dec. 2015. According to the Florida Dept. of Economic Opportunity, the state will gain 1.1 million more jobs from 2015 to 2023. That\u2019s a compounded annual growth rate of 1.5 percent, equal to about 445,000\u00a0new jobs from 2023 to 2026.\nPut it all together, Florida will add 2.1\u00a0million jobs from 2012 to 2026. That\u2019s still 600,000 fewer\u00a0jobs than California will add in the same time frame with the $15 wage.\nWaging in uncharted waters\nAs we have previously reported, there\u2019s a great amount of debate over the effect that minimum wage hikes have job growth. A spokesperson for Brown forwarded us\u00a0academic and think-tank studies showing that past increases have had little or no effect on employment.\nCalifornia\u2019s hike, however, is so unprecedented that past research may be less relevant. All the experts we spoke with suspect it will reduce employment.\n\"An increase the size of California\u2019s is outside of the experience of any state over the last four decades,\" said Jonathan Meer, a Texas A&M University economist and co-author of the study Gitis cited. \"A dramatic increase in the minimum wage like California\u2019s will undoubtedly reduce employment. However, I would be very cautious about putting any precise figures on the amount.\"\nTwo home-state economists \u2014 Jeffrey Clemens of the University of California, San Diego and David Neumark of the University of California, Irvine \u2014 agreed that the huge wage hike will likely cause job losses, but the magnitude is uncertain. \u00a0\n\"The recently passed minimum wage increases are sufficiently beyond the range of historical experience that I do not think it is possible to predict their effects on employment with any precision,\" Clemens said.\nNeumark added that Scott\u2019s job-poaching mission is nonetheless ill-fated, given that the flow of jobs into or out of California is typically miniscule and the jobs most affected by hike (low-skill jobs in the service and agricultural sectors) are hard to move out of state.\n\"Maybe a few low-wage manufacturers will move. But there's no reason to expect they'd go to Florida more than many other low-wage states or overseas, so I suspect the employment growth in Florida from California\u2019s minimum wage increase would be negligible, and statistically undetectable,\" Neumark said. \"So Gov. Scott is probably wasting his and his Florida taxpayers' time.\"\nOur ruling\nA radio ad by Enterprise Florida said, \"Seven hundred thousand. That\u2019s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage\u2026.Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them.\"\nThis is misleading. The 700,000 figure refers to the number of jobs California could have added by 2026 if it didn\u2019t increase the minimum wage, not a decline in net employment. Based on projections, California will still gain more jobs with the minimum wage increase than Florida during the same time frame.\nWhile experts agreed that a $15 wage will reduce employment in California, they said it\u2019s near impossible to pin a number on the impact given how unprecedented the hike is.\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/22054202-4acc-431a-9397-5400fc73d984", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05008"}
