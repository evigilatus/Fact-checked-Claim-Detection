You weren't allowed to own a cannon during the Revolutionary War as an individual.\"\n\nScreenshot from Biden's video\nA reader suggested we look at Biden\u2019s assertion on Revolutionary War cannons. The historians we reached out to were dubious.\nTo confirm Biden\u2019s point, \"you would need to point to something \u2014 a law, or a tradition, or a case where someone was not allowed to possess a cannon,\" said University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt.\nBut the Biden campaign was unable to point to a specific law. \"The vice president's point is that to help end the tragic epidemic of mass shootings that is taking so many American lives, we need to ban weapons of war from our streets,\" the campaign told PolitiFact.\nHistorians say they are doubtful that there were laws to bar individual ownership of cannons during the Revolutionary War period.\n\"It seems highly unlikely that there were restrictions on the private ownership\" of cannons, said Julie Anne Sweet, a historian and director of military studies at Baylor University.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Says Joe Biden \u201chas issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Kopel, the research director and Second Amendment project director at the free-market Independence Institute, agreed. \"I am not aware of a ban on any arm in colonial America,\" he said. \"There were controls on people or locations, but not bans on types of arms.\"\nThe legal framework in the colonies was haphazard during the Revolutionary War period.\n\"At that time, there was no United States, just a bunch of very confused former colonies trying to cooperate, and often failing, to defeat the British military,\" Sweet said. \"Any sort of gun regulations would have been at the local level, and therefore incredibly difficult and tedious to chase down. The new states were still writing new constitutions and probably did not take this matter into consideration.\"\nThere is at least one group of private citizens that owned cannons during the period: privateers.\nPrivateers were privately owned and operated ships that in wartime captured enemy ships for profit. While privateers received a license from the government that allowed them to avoid being prosecuted for piracy, they were not a part of the official navy. So any cannons they set sail with (or that they seized from the enemy) would be private property, not the property of the government or the regular military.\nThe 1899 book \"A History of American Privateers\" by Edgar Stanton Maclay notes several cases in which privateers during the Revolutionary War set sail using cannons.\nOur ruling\nBiden said, \"You weren't allowed to own a cannon during the Revolutionary War as an individual.\"\nThe campaign was unable to come up with an example of a law banning private ownership of cannons, and historians of the period doubt that any existed. To the contrary, there are documented instances of privateers, or privately owned vessels, setting sail with cannons during the period.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18009"}
