Steven J. King, the corporation\u2019s managing director, was on WPRI\u2019s \"Newsmakers\" show Jan. 5 touting the progress he said had been made at Quonset.\nDuring the interview, WPRI\u2019s Tim White noted that the federal and Rhode Island state governments had spent more than $600 million on improvements to the property. White asked how King how he\u2019d explain that generosity to taxpayers who might think \"that\u2019s a lot of taxpayer money that went, essentially, to the private sector.\"\nKing balked at White\u2019s description of the money the federal and state governments spent rehabilitating the site as a private industry handout. He said private businesses put their own money in, too.\n\"We\u2019ve had the private sector more than double the investment that was made by the public sector on the property,\" he said.\nAccording to the Quonset Development Corporation, $666.4 million in federal and state government money has been spent since 1974 on the 3,207-acre park: $460.3 million from the federal government and $206.1 million from the state.\nNearly half went to transportation improvements: $160 million for upgrading freight rail lines and $159 million to improve state Route 403 and its access to state Route 4. Hazardous waste cleanups, which are ongoing on some parcels, cost $100 million.\nSo, if state and federal investment comes to $666.4 million, for King to be right the private sector would have to have contributed $1.3 billion. Do the locals measure up?\nQuonset Business Park\u2019s 170-plus tenants cover a range of businesses from warehouses for Ocean State Job Lot and Sally Beauty Supply to high-technology manufacturers Toray Plastics and submarine builder Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics Corp.\nQuonset spokesman David Preston said the corporation doesn\u2019t have precise figures on all private investment because some tenants chose to keep confidential how much they\u2019ve spent on their facilities.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we checked with some of the bigger tenants.\nElectric Boat employs 2,767 people at its 140-acre plus complex, where workers build submarine sections, called \"supermodules,\" which are then shipped to either Groton, Conn., or Newport News, Va., to be welded together to form a new submarine.\nSince it opened its Quonset factory in 1974, EB spokesman Robert A. Hamilton said the company has spent about $900 million on its facilities. Last week, Jeffrey S. Geiger, the new president of General Dynamics/Electric Boat, announced the company plans to invest $150 million more there over the next four years.\nToray Plastics America Inc. is the next biggest firm in the park, occupying about 70 acres and employing approximately 680 people. The firm makes extremely thin plastic films for use in manufacturing.\nIn July 2010, Shigeru Osada, Toray America\u2019s senior vice president for engineering and maintenance, appeared before the state Public Utilities Commission and said that as of that date, the company had invested $750 million in its facilities at Quonset. Toray vice president for human resources Lisa Ahart said last week that number was still valid.\nThey aren\u2019t alone. Besides high-technology firms like Toray and EB, the Quonset has attracted business like All American Foods Inc., which supplies meat, fish and produce to supermarkets throughout the region. All American vice president Steven Savastano said the company has had a warehouse operation there for about 15 years, and invested more than $6 million in the site.\nAdd Toray\u2019s $750 million to EB\u2019s $900 million and you get $1.65 billion.\nOur ruling\nSteven King said private companies have invested twice what taxpayers have spent on developing Quonset Park.\nWith federal and state government putting up $666.4 million, that would be at least $1.3 billion in private investment.\nJust the two largest tenants combined spent $300 million more than that.\nWe rate his claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08372"}
