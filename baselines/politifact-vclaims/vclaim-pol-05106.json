We looked at Trump\u2019s numbers against Clinton rather than against her fellow Democrat Bernie Sanders because Sanders leads Trump by even larger margins than Clinton does. (Trump\u2019s press staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)\nComparing Trump vs. Clinton to Reagan vs. Carter\nWe\u2019ll start off by noting that the 1980 general election was different than the 2016 race -- at least so far -- because the earlier race had three major candidates. Carter, the incumbent president, faced Reagan, the Republican nominee, as well as John Anderson, running as an independent.\nTo focus as closely as we could on the Carter-Reagan race, we set aside Anderson\u2019s vote share and looked instead at the shares taken by Carter and Reagan. Here\u2019s a summary of polls, from the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. We have included all polls we could find that were taken in March and April of 1980.\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nPollster\n\n\nCarter\n\n\nReagan\n\n\nAnderson\n\n\nCarter-Reagan margin\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1980\n\n\nTime/Yankelovich\n\n\n39\n\n\n32\n\n\n20\n\n\nCarter +7\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1980\n\n\nABC/Harris\n\n\n38\n\n\n38\n\n\n22\n\n\nTie\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1980\n\n\nGallup\n\n\n44\n\n\n36\n\n\n20\n\n\nCarter +8\n\n\n\n\nApril 1980\n\n\nWashington Post\n\n\n42\n\n\n33\n\n\n16\n\n\nCarter +9\n\n\n\n\nApril 1980\n\n\nGallup\n\n\n45\n\n\n36\n\n\n19\n\n\nCarter +9\n\n\n\n\nApril 1980\n\n\nABC/Harris\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n42\n\n\n19\n\n\nReagan +9\n\n\n\n\nApril 1980\n\n\nABC\n\n\n38\n\n\n35\n\n\n19\n\n\nCarter +3\n\n\n\n\nApril 1980\n\n\nRoper\n\n\n39\n\n\n27\n\n\n16\n\n\nCarter +12\n\n\n\n\nAverage\n\n\u00a0\n\n40\n\n\n35\n\n\n17\n\n\nCarter +5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo, Carter did lead in seven of the eight polls, by an average of five percentage points.\nWhat about the potential Trump-Clinton contest? Here are the polls released since March 1, 2016, that were publicly released by the time of Trump\u2019s comment, according to realclearpolitics.com:\n\n\nIf you take the average of all these polls, Clinton leads Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent. That\u2019s an 11-point advantage -- more than twice the size of Carter\u2019s lead over Reagan in 1980 at the same point in the campaign.\nSo Trump\u2019s numbers are not, contrary to his assertion, \"better right now than Ronald Reagan's numbers were with Jimmy Carter.\" They are worse.\nWe should note that there was a period during the 1980 campaign when Carter actually was far ahead of Reagan in head-to-head polling, but it was brief and it was winding down -- if not gone entirely -- by this point in the campaign. After American hostages were taken in Iran in November 1979, Carter\u2019s approval ratings initially spiked, in what historians sometimes call a \"rally round the flag\" effect.\nThis can be seen in Gallup\u2019s job approval ratings below:\n\nBy January 1980, Carter\u2019s job approval rating in the Gallup poll had risen to 58\u00a0percent. But by late March, it was back down again, to 39 percent. And that decline -- combined with the emergence of Anderson\u2019s independent bid -- made the Carter-Reagan head-to-head contest much closer.\nThis trend can be seen in 1980 polling data from political scientists Christopher Wlezien and Robert S. Erikson:\n\nComparing Reagan and Trump on favorability ratings\nTrump is also off-base on favorability ratings.\nWe didn\u2019t find many questions on favorability in the Roper database, but one April 1980 poll from Cambridge Reports found Reagan at 39 percent favorable, 44 percent unfavorable. That\u2019s five percentage points \"under water\" -- favorable minus unfavorable.\nBy contrast, Trump\u2019s poll averages for favorability in 2015 and 2016 have -- at their best -- been 17 points under water. Currently, they are at 64 percent unfavorable, 30 percent favorable, according to HuffPost Pollster. That\u2019s 34 points under water, far worse than Reagan\u2019s in the spring of 1980.\n\nThere are other indications that Reagan, despite being considered too conservative by many in 1980, was not as polarizing a figure then as Trump is today.\nIn May 1980, Gallup asked respondents to place Reagan on a rating scale between +5 (very favorable) and -5 (very unfavorable). About 70 percent placed him on the positive (favorable) side of that scale, compared to just 27 percent who placed him on the negative (unfavorable) side of that scale.\nAnd a CBS News/New York Times poll in April 1980 asked, \"Are there any candidates -- Carter, Reagan or Anderson -- you would refuse to vote for under any circumstances?\" Only 13 percent said they would definitely shun Reagan.\nTrump\u2019s recent \"never-vote-for\" percentages are much higher. In two polls, a full 54 percent of those polled said they would definitely not vote for Trump -- an Associated Press/GfK poll in February 2016 and a Quinnipiac poll in March 2016.\n\"Reagan never had the high unfavorables that Trump does now,\" said Reagan biographer Lou Cannon.\nDid people say Reagan\u2019s candidacy would be \u2018a disaster\u2019?\nNot in the national media coverage we found on Nexis, at least.\nDavid Broder, the legendary political reporter with the Washington Post, wrote a piece on March 12, 1980, that was headlined, \"Despite Primary Triumphs, Carter Could Be Vulnerable.\"\nOn April 7, Newsweek concluded its article this way: \"The politics of discontent has already propelled Ronald Reagan nearly to the Republican nomination, enticed John Anderson to the brink of a third-line candidacy -- and now brought home the message that Jimmy Carter is once again in trouble.\"\nAnd on May 8, 1980, the Post published an article headlined, \"Poll Shows Reagan Now Likely Winner.\"\nWe asked Craig Shirley, who has written several books on Reagan, what he thought of of Trump\u2019s comparison.\n\"There are just too many personal and ideological and cultural differences between Trump and Reagan and their times to draw anything resembling a parallel,\" Shirley said.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"My numbers are better right now than Ronald Reagan's numbers were with Jimmy Carter. ... Ronald Reagan had a 30 (percent) favorability and he was behind Jimmy Carter by so much everybody said, 'Oh this is going to be a disaster.' \"\nWe found that Trump\u2019s deficit against Clinton during March and April 2016 was twice the size of Reagan\u2019s deficit against Carter in March and April 1980. We also found that Trump\u2019s favorable/unfavorable ratings are much worse than Reagan\u2019s were during that same period. We rate his claim False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cac5ce8d-56aa-4356-94eb-377725ecb8fe", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05106"}
