They're our brothers.\u2019 \"\nFaith and Freedom Coalition founder Ralph Reed told Raddatz he doesn\u2019t support gay couples raising adopted children.\n\"This is about what's best for children here in the United States. And the social science is irrefutable,\" Reed said. \"And it is that a child who grows up in a home without the mother and father present and they both play very unique procreative, nurturing and socializing role, they're nine times more likely to end up dropping out of high school. They're five times more likely to end up in poverty. And they're three times more likely to end up addicted to drugs and alcohol.\"\nPunditFact wanted to know what social science has to say about the effects gay parents have on children compared to straight parents.\nThe social science statistics Reed called \"irrefutable\" actually have nothing to do with gay couples raising kids. Instead, they\u2019re focused on the effects of children who grow up without a father in a one-parent household. Put another way, the studies focus on the quantity of parents and not their\u00a0gender.\nReed\u2019s office pointed us to his book, as well as a Brookings Institution report that says parents who graduate from high school and bear children within marriage have a 2 percent chance of living in poverty. But neither the study nor his book draws any comparison between gay and straight marriages. In fact, it makes no mention of gay marriages.\nOther research often cited by gay parenting critics, like Sara McLanahan\u2019s Growing Up With a Single Parent, similarly doesn\u2019t include any information on gay parenting, specifically.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the critique is focused on having one parent present versus two. We decided not to investigate further the specific stats Reed cited once we realized they weren\u2019t measuring what he said they were.\nComparisons like Reed\u2019s are \"a complete misuse of the research,\" said Judith Stacey, a New York University sociologist.\nWe did find one study funded by conservative organizations as showing gay parents are worse than straight ones, but it\u2019s been denounced by the American Sociological Association, the researcher\u2019s own university and many reputable sociologists. In conducting the study, Mark Regnerus loosely defined same-sex couples and, in doing so, only spoke with two children who were actually raised by gay parents.\nResearch is still limited, but many reputable studies so far have concluded that children of gay parents, generally speaking, are just as well off as children of straight parents. What\u2019s more important is the number of parents a child has, experts told us.\n\"Kids are better off with two parents,\" said Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University. \"But we don't have much evidence that those parents must be of the opposite gender.\"\nOur ruling\nReed said there\u2019s \"irrefutable\" social science to show that children are better off being parented by a mother and father. That\u2019s not right. What studies really show is that children are better off with two parents. Those studies do not focus on gender.\nAll reputable research so far indicates that children brought up by gay parents are just well off as those brought up by straight parents.\nWe rate Reed\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07961"}
