But the actual level of support in the poll was 39 percent -- not the 30 percent listed in the Facebook post. The error cut the amount of support by about one-quarter -- not a trivial amount.\nAs it turned out, the error was simply a typo; the supporting material cited in the RNC\u2019s Facebook post had the correct number -- 39 percent.\nWhen we brought this to the RNC\u2019s attention, spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski wrote back, \"Yes, this was a typo and we are fixing it right now.\" True to her word, the Facebook post was corrected within an hour or so. (We\u2019ve posted a before-and-after look at right.)\nSo the 57 percent in opposition was correct, but the actual level of support was 39 percent. Once we notified the RNC of this error, they quickly fixed it. Because one number was wrong in the original post and one was right, we rate the claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08481"}
