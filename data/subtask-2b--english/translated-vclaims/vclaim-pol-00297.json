Verification of Bill Clinton &apos; s claim", "text": "It is one of the most controversial policies in the area of firearms control: the ban on offensive weapons and large magazines that allow shooters to continue firing longer without reloading. While it is difficult to define what is or is not an offensive weapon, this term does not refer to a broad category of firearms. In the wake of the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, Dayton, Ohio, former President Bill Clinton protested against the embargo he had been under. \"How many more people have to die before we re-ban offensive weapons, limit high-capacity magazines and pass global background checks?\" Clinton tweeted 5 August. \"After their death in 1994, there was a significant reduction in mass shooting deaths. When the embargo ended, it rose again. We must act now.\" How many people have to die before we re-ban offensive weapons and limit high-capacity magazines? After they died in 1994, there was a significant reduction in the number of deaths caused by large-scale shooting. When the embargo ended, it rose again. We must act now. Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) August 5, 2019 Clinton took the direction in the opinion article on time on August 8th. So we wanted to check it out. We have already considered the general issue of the impact of the 1994 Act. This is the first time that we have examined its specific link with mass shooting deaths and whether the number of deaths increased after the embargo ended. (The Clinton tweet assumes that the existence or absence of the ban has changed the number of deaths caused by large-scale shooting.) The proof of cause and effect is a heavy lifting.) The subject is full of difficult data challenges. The Act prohibits only certain types of semi-automatic firearms along with stores containing more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Should attacks using other types of weapons using the method of attack be calculated? In addition, mass shooting occurs much less frequently than other weapons crimes, placing any scientific analysis at a disadvantage. However, evidence shows that deaths from large-scale gunfire have increased in the years following the embargo. The decline during the embargo is less pronounced. It discusses the impact of the law, but some researchers say that data and logic show that restrictions on high-capacity magazines and offensive weapons help to reduce mortality. :: A limited law prohibiting the 1994 Act \"manufacture, transfer and possession\" of approximately 118 types of firearm and all magazines carrying more than 10 rounds. People who have such weapons can keep them. When the embargo entered into force, there were approximately 1 million offensive weapons in private hands. An estimated 25 million weapons have been equipped with highly capable magazines. The ban ended in 2004. In a 2004 major study commissioned by the United States Department of Justice, researcher Christopher Cooper wrote: \"The exemption of the embargo from millions of offensive weapons before the embargo and large magazines from capabilities ensures that the effects of the law will occur only gradually.\" Cooper wrote: \"If the ban is renewed, the effects of the ban on weapon violence are likely to be too small at best and perhaps too small to be reliably measured.\" The new Clinton office cited studies in 2012 from the School of Medicine of the University of New York. An epidemiological-led group (Charles DiMaggio) is sheltered in mass shootings. (Other research tracked the number of times a mass shooting occurred, which is not the same.) Researchers are familiar with mass shootings in different ways. After defining the FBI, the DiMaggio Group looked into incidents in which at least four people died. They found in large numbers that deaths from large-scale gunfire had decreased during the years of the embargo, and subsequently increased. DiMaggio shared his data. \"During the period of the embargo, there were fewer bodies,\" said DiMaggio. The death toll from mass shootings rose from 4.8 per year during the embargo years to 23.8 per year thereafter. Many factors drive gun deaths. In order to assist in the calculation of these cases, the DiMaggio team has developed mass shooting deaths in terms of the total number of firearms killings. In this way, they found that between 1994 and 2004, the annual rate decreased by 7-9 persons per 10,000 firearms homicides. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for security purposes in her installation, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, there is room for debate about what happened to the death rates, unlike the raw figures, before and during the ban. DiMaggio said, \"There is some evidence that has already been rejected - or at least did not continue to increase during the period of the embargo.\" Epidemiologists talk about risks, that is, the likelihood of something bad happening. The DiMaggio study concluded that the number of deaths caused by large-scale shooting was 70 per cent lower during the embargo. The impact of the embargo remains unclear on the key policy issue of whether the embargo has led to a decline, and Dimaggio urges caution. He said, \"It's very impossible to prove cause and effect.\" This is the consensus among a number of researchers. Philip Cooke at Duke University said the death toll was real, but it's complicated. \"The rates of violence during that period were generally very volatile for reasons unrelated to the regulation of weapons,\" said Cook. \"This does not mean that the ban was ineffective - but we do not know the answer and we may not be able to determine it since the result of interest (collective shooting) is very rare.\" The reduction in the number of deaths caused by large-scale shooting from 15 pre-embargo to pre-embargo is a slight difference on which definitive conclusions can be drawn. The economists Rosana Smart in RAND, a non-profit research advisory group, agreed that collective shooting rose after the embargo ended, but noted, \"I do not think that Dimaggio's methods are well suited to determine the causal effect of the offensive arms embargo.\" In an article in 2018, Smart reviewed two studies on the impact of the embargo. She only said in terms of statistical methods, the results were \"uncritical.\" Although one report found that the State-wide ban was effective in reducing the rate of deaths caused by large-scale shooting. The debate on the value of the offensive arms embargo and large magazines often involves Christopher Cooper at George Mason University. Cooper wrote the 2004 study, which gave both sides in the weapons control material to rely on. More recently, Cooper spent more time evaluating the role of large-capacity magazines, which hold more than 10 rounds. In an article written by Cooper that more than the semi-automatic weapons themselves, the latest information links the larger magazines to an increasing number of dead. \"In view of the fact that mass shootings with high semi-mechanical capabilities are much more lethal and harmful than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to say that the federal ban could have prevented some recent increase in the number of people killed and injured in mass shootings had it been maintained,\" Cooper wrote in an article that will be published within a few months. Democrats have introduced legislation to prevent people from buying large-capacity magazines. Symiotomatic rifles account for a small percentage of deaths, but there are many. According to the Industrial Trade Group, annual sales averaged around 200,000 during the embargo years. In the eight years following the end of the embargo, sales averaged about 700,000 per year. Our rule, Clinton, has urged legislators to re-establish a ban on offensive weapons and high-capacity magazines. \"After their death in 1994, there was a significant reduction in mass shooting deaths. When the ban ended, they rose again,\" he said. Clinton spoke strongly about the landing. In simple numbers, deaths from large-scale shootings decreased during the years of the embargo - 15 deaths over the decade. But statistically, this number is too small to allow for strong conclusions. Even the author of the report on which Clinton relied said that the mortality rate might have fallen - or stabilized. The rise after the embargo is over is supported by evidence, although the definitions of mass shootings will vary. The role of the embargo remains unclear, but the Clinton Statement did not specifically state that the embargo was the main factor. Clinton's too low, but he was right about the height.
