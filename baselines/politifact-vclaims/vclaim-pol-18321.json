(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But in this case, the Facebook post has some truth to it.\nWe found that the number of 13,000 pounds was correct, however it would have been more accurate to refer to the materials as \"garbage\" rather than \"litter\" because some of it was found in trash bins. Also, it was a reference to one specific beach in the state, as explained in the story.\nThe Facebook post cites a May 9 article by Florida Today about the amount of garbage found on Cocoa Beach once restrictions were lifted.\nStarting in late March and then April, the city of Cocoa Beach posted rules that significantly limited use of the beach including the hours, parking and group sizes. But in recent weeks those rules were loosened -- and that\u2019s when the garbage piled up.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe city has a contract with Keep Brevard Beautiful to pick up litter on about a five-mile stretch of Cocoa Beach. Typically, they collect\u00a0 between 30 and 50 bags per day, executive director Bryan Bobbitt told PolitiFact. Each bag weighs 40 to 50 pounds.\nOn Friday, May 1, the organization collected about 33 bags. That grew to 122 bags on Saturday and 142 on Sunday.\u00a0\nIn total over that weekend, about 13,560 pounds of garbage was removed, City Manager James McKnight told PolitiFact. Most of the trash was in trash cans or bagged next to trash cans, he said, however a significant amount was picked up directly from the beach itself.\u00a0\nThe police department announced it would fine violators $250 for littering.\nOur ruling\nA headline said \"beachgoers trash Florida beaches with 13,000 pounds of litter after beaches reopen.\"\u00a0\nThat referred to the amount of garbage collected during the first weekend in May at Cocoa Beach. It was the amount of garbage collected from trash bins as well as from the beach, which means it wasn\u2019t all improperly discarded litter.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18321"}
