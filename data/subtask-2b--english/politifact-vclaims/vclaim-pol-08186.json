With military action on no one\u2019s wish-list, diplomacy and economic sanctions are the only moves effectively in play.\nSecretary of State John Kerry said on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation that he had been on the phone with his counterparts among the G-8 nations.\n\"Every single one of them are prepared to go to the hilt in order to isolate Russia with respect to this invasion,\" Kerry said. \"They\u2019re prepared to put sanctions in place, they\u2019re prepared to isolate Russia economically, the ruble is already going down. Russia has major economic challenges.\"\nThis fact-check zeros in on the value of the Russian ruble. It has declined but partly because that\u2019s what the Russians wanted.\nA big drop\nIn the early part of 2013, the ruble was worth 3.3 U.S. cents. Today, its value has tumbled by 15 percent, to 2.8 cents. A little less than half of that fall came in January as the situation in Ukraine deteriorated.\nHere\u2019s the picture over the past year, taken from the currency exchange service XE.com:\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no question that the violence and political turmoil in Ukraine took a toll on the ruble. Russian banks have about $28 billion in loans in the country. Before the Russian troops moved in, investors were already worried. Last week, two of the largest banks in Russia said they would suspend any new lending in Ukraine.\nBut the ruble\u2019s decline has deeper roots. In 2010, the Russian Central Bank announced it wanted to get out of the business of setting the ruble\u2019s value on the international market. It had in mind a gradual glide path for the currency\u2019s fall, and in October, it gave the ruble even more leeway to drop further. The country\u2019s economy grew less than 2 percent last year, and it has struggled to keep inflation in check.\n\"The ruble got pretty over-valued in the big energy boom from 2001-08,\" said Mark Adomanis, a management consultant and contributor to Forbes. That hurt Russian manufacturing and letting the ruble fall potentially could help.\n\"With a weaker ruble Russian goods become more competitive on international markets,\" Adomanis said.\nThat said, a free fall is not what the Russian Central Bank has in mind. In January, the bank signaled that it would step in to prop up the ruble. But the overall policy remains the same.\nOur ruling\nKerry said the ruble is going down, and it is. The Russian currency has lost about 15 percent of its value against the dollar since early 2013. It is not all because of the situation in Ukraine, however, a fact that viewers may not have picked up on by hearing Kerry's statement. The currency\u2019s decline is also part of Russian policy to reduce inflation and make domestic manufacturers more competitive.\nThere\u2019s a little more going on here than Kerry\u2019s statement would suggest.
