Specifically, the General Democratic Party was critical of Cecilin &apos; s endorsement of the 2012 budget proposal for a democratic budget, which was defeated by the Republican Council 166 to 259 on 15 April. Similar contacts were made in 22 other provinces of Congress where the World Democratic Party considers the current Democratic Party to be weak. \"With Washington's addiction to spending, the federal government now borrows $4 billion a day,\" said the recorded voice. \"This gives us $14 trillion in debt. And David Ceceline is making it worse. I voted for another Belusi budget that would strangle our economy with more spending, more debt and more borrowing from China.\" Apart from the vote of the junior congressman on the budget proposed by the Democrats - a matter of public record - we asked about this figure of $4 billion, which Republicans across the country mention in their budget battles with Democrats. If Rod Island borrows this amount, it will pay in just two days the full proposed State budget of $7.7 billion for the coming year. Or she could pay for the new Sacunt River Bridge and replace Route 95 in Bautoket with $3 billion for a change in the pocket. Does the United States borrow this amount every day? When we requested evidence of the allegation, the National Reconciliation Commission referred us to a report from our friends in Politi Fact Florida. A similar claim was also considered by Poletti Fact Georgia. First, a guide, courtesy of Polyte Fact Florida. Let's start with the difference between \"national deficit\" and \"national debt.\" The deficit is the result of Government spending in one budget year more than it absorbs as revenue from taxes and other sources. The deficit in 2010 was $1.3 trillion, according to the position of the United States Bureau of Management and Budget. We have had a deficit every year since 2002. Before that, from 1998 to 2001, for a short time at the end of President Bill Clinton's term and at the beginning of President George W. Bush's administration, the Federal Government was already operating with a surplus, according to the report of the Congressional Research Service. At the same time, the national debt is the total amount of money owed by the Federal Government to creditors who have lent government funds. This amount amounted to $14.25 trillion on 6 April, according to the Politi Vakt of Georgia. Its research has found that debt has increased by an average of over $4 billion a day since 2009. In 2010, the average was $4.7 billion a day. However, it fell to about $2.45 billion a day this year. However, between the end of 2009 and 6 April 2011, public debt rose by an average of just over $4 billion a day. These figures were sufficient to convince Poletti Fact Georgia that the claim to borrow $4 billion a day was mostly true. In going into a similar matter, Polyte Fact Florida questioned the idea of the federal government borrowing billions every day to stay floating. \"Actual borrowing does not happen every day,\" Sean Sneath, Director of the Central University of Florida Institute of Economic Competitiveness, said Politi Fact Florida. \"The periodic auction of bonds, that's when the money is collected.\" However, Polyte Fact Florida found the figure of $4 billion reasonable and also went with a mostly valid judgement. It makes sense to us. That's why we're gonna borrow ourselves, and we're gonna go with our colleagues at Polyte Vac. We're assessing this mostly right too. On January 17, 2012, Barry Hinkley showed YouTube \"Sheldon Whitehouse's failure to drive, adding approximately $8 trillion in debt in his first full term, is shameful.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13151"}
