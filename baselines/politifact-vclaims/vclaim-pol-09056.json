(Sequestration refers to the mandatory, across-the-board cuts in every federal agency that took effect earlier this year.)\nThe Ohio Republican was citing a pair of messages Obama released in June called Statements of Administration Policy. SAPs, as they are known, are used to officially convey whether an administration will support or oppose a particular bill pending in Congress.\nWe located the two statements in question, both of which addressed annual bills to fund parts of the federal government: \u00a0H.R. 2216 (the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2014) and H.R. 2217 (the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2014).\nBoth SAPs were released on June 3, and they had nearly identical language in an underlined section, the usual signal of the document\u2019s main point.\n\"Unless this bill passes the Congress in the context of an overall budget framework that supports our recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and national security for our economy to compete in the future, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend that he veto (the bill) and any other legislation that implements the House Republican Budget framework.\"\nWe decided to check two elements of Boehner\u2019s claim. Did Obama really say he \"would not sign\" the bills? And did Obama\u2019s potential veto hinge on \"sequestration spending cuts (being) eliminated\"?\nVeto threat kabuki\nAn almost Talmudic hierarchy of veto-threat language has developed over the years, remaining much the same regardless of who is in the White House.\nKeith Hennessey, who spent several years as a senior aide to President George W. Bush and is now a lecturer at Stanford University, has developed a handy primer for the linguistic nuances of SAPs. The first three of his examples involve gradations of approval for pending bills. From there, the language proceeds, with increasing degrees of opposition, to:\n\u2022 The administration opposes the bill.\n\u2022 The administration strongly opposes the bill.\n\u2022 If the president were presented this bill for signature, a particular administration official would recommend that he veto it.\n\u2022 If the president were presented this bill for signature, the president\u2019s senior advisers would recommend he veto it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 If the president were presented this bill for signature, he would veto it.\n\u2022 If the president is presented this bill for signature, he will veto it.\n\u2022 If this bill makes it to my desk, I will veto it. (This one is more commonly used in a public appearance than in a Statement of Administration Policy.)\nSo the statements that Boehner referred to used language that was about half-way up the hierarchy of presidential opposition.\nWe asked several experts in the back-and-forth between the White House and Congress whether they thought it was reasonable for Boehner to call Obama\u2019s language a sign that he \"would not sign\" the bills in question. Most took a middle ground, saying Boehner was right to suggest strong opposition by Obama but wrong to imply that Obama had closed the door to negotiation.\nObama\u2019s wording \"is customary for a veto threat communicated through OMB -- they always leave enough wiggle room for compromise,\" said Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee who currently directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\nRoy T. Meyers, a political scientist and budget expert at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, agreed, saying that Obama\u2019s wording is usually \"meant as a strong \u2018no\u2019 \u2026 but a \u2018no\u2019 that is meant to say he is firm in his position and that it's time to negotiate.\"\nDoes Obama\u2019s threat hinge on sequestration?\nObama\u2019s SAPs don\u2019t explicitly say the restoration of sequestration cuts would trigger a veto, mentioning instead \"legislation that implements the House Republican Budget framework.\"\nIn his statement, then, Boehner makes a reasonable point: Obama opposes the House Republican budget framework, which doesn\u2019t envision restoration of past sequestration cuts. In fact, it would make even deeper cuts.\nThe White House has \"made very clear that their idea of a budget framework does away with sequestration,\" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Boehner. \"So he\u2019s saying he won\u2019t sign these bills absent a plan to do away with sequestration.\"\nHowever, budget experts say Boehner went too far by suggesting that sequestration is Obama\u2019s specific line in the sand. The experts say that while Obama strongly opposes the current design of the House Republicans\u2019 budget, he left vague exactly what provisions he would agree to. Obama didn\u2019t say that restoration of sequestration cuts was non-negotiable.\n\"The president said only that he would veto bills unless it was part of a budget agreement, but he absolutely did not say what that agreement should be,\" said Stan Collender, a former Democratic staff member of the House and Senate Budget Committees who is now a partner at the lobbying and consulting firm Qorvis. \"He did not insist that sequestration not happen or that taxes be raised.\"\nOur ruling\nBoehner said that Obama has \"announced that he would not sign ANY spending bills this year unless sequestration spending cuts are eliminated.\"\nObama did issue a strongly worded statement opposing two spending bills backed by House Republicans, but Boehner exaggerated how firm a veto threat it was and underplayed the president\u2019s openness to negotiation. Meanwhile, Obama did say he opposed bills enacting the House Republican budget, but he didn\u2019t make restoration of sequestration cuts a non-negotiable demand in any negotiated deal.
