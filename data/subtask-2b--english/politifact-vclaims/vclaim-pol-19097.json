AF1 is in the top photo complete with seal. The bottom plane is a Boeing C-40 the one Joe flew on \u2026 used for high profile government officials to fly on but NOT the President. President flies on AF1 or Marine 1. Notice the little things... and you\u2019ll catch them in their lies!\"\u00a0\nThese posts imply that Biden is not flying on Air Force One because he is not the real commander-in-chief, furthering a baseless conspiracy theory that the November election was not legitimate.\nThis theory is not based in fact, and it rests on a flawed understanding of Air Force One.\u00a0\nAir Force One isn\u2019t the name of a particular plane. It\u2019s the air traffic control sign designating any Air Force aircraft carrying the president. In other words, any Air Force plane carrying the president is called Air Force One.\u00a0\nThere are two types of planes typically designated for carrying the president: a Boeing VC-25A and a Boeing C-32. The VC-25A is the iconic military plane most commonly associated with Air Force One, while the C-32 is typically used for shorter domestic flights and flights to small airports that can\u2019t support the much larger VC-25A.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Images from Feb. 5 show him disembarking from the plane at Wilmington Airport.\u00a0\nFormer President Donald Trump was frequently filmed and photographed taking the C-32 plane as well. So was President Barack Obama.\u00a0\nJoe Biden is the president of the United States. He was duly inaugurated as the 46th U.S. president on Jan. 20. The day\u2019s events were witnessed and documented by elected officials, former presidents, military members, reporters, photographers and performers. They were also broadcast and live-streamed by several outlets including ABC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, NBC and PBS.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nPosts claim that \"Biden\u2019s Air Force One is not the same as Trump\u2019s Air Force One,\" which means that Biden is not the real president.\u00a0\nAny Air Force plane transporting the president is designated with the Air Force One call sign.\u00a0\nOn a trip to Delaware, Biden took a small plane the president uses for short domestic flights and flights to small airports. Trump also took that plane when he was president.\nThese posts are inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\nRELATED: Biden took a private plane to his inauguration.
