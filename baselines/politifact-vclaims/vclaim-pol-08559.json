Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., offered some specific numbers to outline the problems, courtesy of his Twitter account.\n\"Only 536 Georgians are signed up for Obamacare while 400,000 in the state lost their health insurance,\" said a tweet posted from his account.\nThe tweet ended with the hashtag: \"trainwreck.\"\nSome of us wondered about the accuracy of the tweet, particularly how many Georgians have lost their health insurance.\nRegarding the first part of the tweet, the White House announced on Nov. 13 that about 106,000 Americans had selected a health care plan through the federal government\u2019s marketplace accounts. The number was far below federal projections. In Georgia, 1,390 people had selected a marketplace plan, but only 536 actually completed enrollment, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\nWestmoreland\u2019s tweet was sent the morning after the White House announced the enrollment numbers.\nPresident Barack Obama sold the health care act to Americans, in part, on the pledge that individuals who like their insurance could keep their plans. However, many Americans learned their plans did not meet the requirements of the health care law when the marketplaces premiered on October 1. Some told harrowing stories that their plans were being cancelled.\nObama held a news conference on Nov. 14 in which he offered to let insurance companies sell existing plans for at least one more year, even if they do not meet the standards of the health care law.\nProblem solved? Not exactly.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome states said it was too late to make such an allowance and they would not let insurance companies extend their policies. Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens said the day after the president\u2019s announcement that he lacks the authority to enforce the stop-gap measure.\nAccording to some news accounts, an estimated 11 million Americans buy their own health insurance. In Georgia, 404,669 people have health insurance through individual accounts, according to Hudgens\u2019 office. Most of these Georgians are self-employed, work at companies that don\u2019t provide insurance or are early retirees. Individual plans represent about 6 percent of the total insurance market in Georgia, the AJC has reported.\nThe Associated Press recently reported that 400,000 Georgians had received health insurance policy cancellation notices. Westmoreland\u2019s office cited that report as the basis for the congressman\u2019s claim. Westmoreland\u2019s spokeswoman, Leslie Shedd, said she wrote the tweet and sent it from the congressman\u2019s Twitter account.\nSo have all of these Georgians lost their health insurance? Not exactly, some say.\nGlenn Allen, a spokesman for Hudgens, said because the health insurance policies of those 400,000 or so Georgians does not comply with federal law, their policies could be cancelled, thus the notices to those folks in the mail.\nSome of those customers will still have healthcare coverage through their insurance company. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia sent letters to individual policyholders stating that their plans can no longer be offered through the health care law. The letters offer help with finding plans compliant with the law. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia has about 150,000 people who receive insurance through the individual plans, more than any healthcare provider in the state.\nThe AJC and other news outlets -- including the Associated Press -- have reported that although a policy doesn't comply with the law doesn't mean consumers will get cancellation letters. One AP article noted that it is unclear how many individual plans are being canceled.\nShedd said she probably should had mentioned \"cancellations\" in the tweet, as opposed to writing that 400,000 Georgians have lost their health insurance. The consequences of packaging a message into 140 characters, she said.\nShedd made the argument that those customers still face the prospect of either changing their policies or losing their insurance.\n\"I think if you are talking to people who\u2019ve received notices, they look at it as \u2018I\u2019ve lost my health insurance,\u2019 \" she said.\nTo sum up, Westmoreland\u2019s tweet said \"only 536 Georgians are signed up for Obamacare while 400,000 in the state lost their health insurance.\" The number of Georgians signed up was correct. The number of Georgians who have lost their insurance needs some clarity. About 400,000 Georgians have received notices warning their policies could be cancelled because they are not compliant with the federal law. Not all of them will go without insurance, officials explained.\nWestmoreland\u2019s claim, like many concerning the health care law, is complicated. There\u2019s some context that\u2019s necessary to fully understand the situation some Georgians face as a result of the controversial law. Our rating: Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08559"}
