In February, Trump declared a national emergency at the border to reach the billions of dollars that Congress had refused to grant for the construction of the wall. We have drawn our attention to one of the recent attacks by Harris: she claimed that the Trump administration was \"the theft of money\" from the military pensions of members of the service to pay for the barrier. Our army members have given so much. The theft of funds from their pensions to finance the President &apos; s wasteful project is outrageous. Our service members deserve the best,\" said Harris on March 8 on Twitter and Facebook. Does the Trump administration really plan to raid military pensions? Vichek.org, along with some social media users who commented on Harris' articles, described her claim as misleading or false. We decided to check her provocative statement ourselves. Democratic leaders have described the emergency Trump Declaration as the emergency Trump Declaration as the seizure of power, and some Republicans have also said it constitutes a dangerous precedent. This step allows the President to transfer $3.6 billion of military construction projects to the wall, according to the White House. It also gives him the capacity to benefit from $2.5 billion in drug prevention programmes and $600 million in the Treasury Asset Forfeiture Fund. In a joint statement issued in February, Nancy Belusi, of the Democratic Party, and the minority leader of the Senate, Chuck Schommer, of the Democratic Party, said: \"The Congress will defend our constitutional powers in Congress, in the courts, and in the public, using all available remedies.\" The House and Senate voted this month to block the announcement. Trump reversed the joint decision shortly thereafter. An offer to override the veto this week failed in the House of Representatives. Sixteen states, including California, have filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Trump Authority for the transfer of funds to the border wall. On March 7, Harris referred in her social media articles to the article Associated Press, which she published on March 7, 2006. Reading the headline -- \"Pentagon may benefit from military wages, border wall pensions\" -- Harris' claim appears to be mostly accurate. However, the first paragraph describes money as \"remaining funds,\" receiving a different light. The Pentagon plans to make use of the remaining $1 billion in military wage and pension accounts to help President Donald Trump pay for his long-sought border wall, and the President of the Democratic Senate said on Thursday. The money is available because the army has not achieved a target of recruitment by 6,500 recruits. In addition, fewer soldiers have opted for financial incentives for voluntary early retirement, in accordance with the article. The Pentagon plans to transfer the additional funds to its drug prevention account, freeing it from spending on border barriers, reported by AP. Experts say the prosecution misses the mark to assess Harris' claim to an attack on pensions, and we talked to three experts in federal defense budgets. Both said that the senator &apos; s statement was inaccurate. Todd Harrison, a senior colleague at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a two-party non-profit research organization, said. He said the money was left in some army accounts. On February 3, 2021, Kevin McCarthy stated at a press conference \"I don't even know what it is (Cannon). By Noah Y. Kim \u2022 on February 4, 2021 \"It is a separate issue that deserves to be discussed whether those funds should be used in the border wall or be used for other purposes within the army. However, the transfer of funds from these accounts does not indicate that any person reduces military wages, benefits or pension payments. That's not the case.\" He would not reduce the pension of any member of the military service. Mark Kansyan, who worked with the White House Bureau of Management and Budget on the defence budget strategy during the Obama administration, agreed that Harris' statement was wrong. Kansyan said: \"The answer is, \"No. They don't break into military pensions.\" \"I'm sure the army has some places they'd rather send that money. But they don't take any pension money.\" Kansyan is now a senior adviser to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. Travis Sharp manages the budget programme at the Strategic Evaluation and Budget Centre, which provides an independent analysis of the defence budget. He also said that Harris' testimony was flawed. \"This is another example of a lot of confusion about what it means to cut something in the budget,\" said Sharp. The transfer of funds after an agency overestimated the cost of something was not the same reduction. \"The Ministry of Defence has a budget in advance for things that are unpredictable,\" said Sharp. \"The remaining money is what Tramp's administration is trying to reallocate. Is that a wound? In my opinion, no. This isn't a cut.\" When the Pentagon has funds left in one account, it can \"reprogramme\" funds to others, such as health care or fuel accounts with budget deficits, as Kansyan said. If not, Congress \"will cancel that money and use it for other purposes,\" as Harrison said, from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The Ministry of Defence did not respond to the request for suspension. A spokesman for the Harris campaign made a written statement: \"Amnesty International reported that funds were being transferred from a special pension fund for members of the armed service. The President is trying to circumvent Congress, which refused to give him funding for this wall by diverting resources from other military funds.\" The speaker will not say whether the Senator has upheld the original claim. Our classification is X. Kamala Harris claims that Trump's administration was \"the theft of money\" from the military pensions of members of the service to pay for the wall. In fact, the Pentagon is planning to transfer the remaining salaries and retirement funds available because fewer soldiers have opted for an early retirement programme and because the army has not achieved the recruitment target of 6,500 recruits. No member of the service will lose pay or retirement benefits as a result of the move, according to experts in the federal defence budgets. The headline in the article on which Harris relied did not make this clear. But it is important for anyone, especially a public official, to read beyond the headline before making such an allegation. The discussion on whether the Trump administration should benefit from these funds is a separate issue. And Harris' claim wasn't well. We assess it wrong. - The statement is not accurate.
