Meet the Press host Chuck Todd played a portion of the ad on the June 19 show as an example of the kind of ads Trump can expect to face in the general election.\nIt starts with MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski asking Trump, \"Who are you consulting with consistently so that you are ready on day one?\"\n\"I\u2019m speaking with myself, number one,\" he responds.\nThen the ad cuts to four more of Trump\u2019s comments:\n\"This is the Trump theory on war\u2026 I\u2019m really good at war. \u00a0I love war in a certain way.\"\n\"Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.\"\n\"I want to be unpredictable, I\u2019m not going to tell you right now what I\u2019m gonna do.\"\n\"I know more about ISIS than the generals. Believe me.\"\nThe \"nukes\" comment in particular caught our attention. It\u2019s clear that it\u2019s separate from the preceding comment \u2014 \"I love war in a certain way\" \u2014 but the implication seems to be that Trump is a warmonger who isn\u2019t afraid to use nuclear weapons.\nWe decided to check out the context of both of those comments and see if the ad is fairly representing Trump's\u00a0position. We also looked at Trump\u2019s overall views on nuclear policy.\n\u2018I love war in a certain way.\u2019\nThis comment comes from a 90-minute\u00a0speech in Iowa on Nov. 12, 2015. In the speech, Trump theorized that former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein feigned having weapons of mass destruction to scare neighboring Iran, before briefly sidetracking into his feelings on war generally.\n\"This is the Trump theory on war,\" he said. \"But I'm good at war. I've had a lot of wars of my own. I'm really good at war. I love war in a certain way. But only when we win.\"\nHe then moved on to talking about veterans. Earlier in his speech, he railed against the decision to invade Iraq.\n\u2018Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.\u2019\nTrump made his comments about \"nukes\" in an April 3 interview with Fox News Sunday\u2019s Chris Wallace. Wallace was asking Trump about his suggestion that Japan might be better off with nuclear weapons.\nWallace: \"You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump: \"In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.\"\nWallace: \"Understood.\"\nTrump: \"It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea.\" \u00a0\nWallace: \"With nukes?\"\nTrump: \"Maybe they would be better off \u2014 including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.\"\nSo Trump was saying Japan might do well to defend itself with its own nuclear weapons, rather than talking about what he would do as president with the United States\u2019 own nuclear arsenal.\nThe way the ad splices Trump's comments together, a reasonable person would think Trump \"loves war,\" including \"with nukes.\"\nPriorities USA spokesman Justin Barasky told us that the fact Trump is open to more countries having nuclear weapons supports the ad\u2019s overarching argument \u2014 that Trump would be too dangerous.\nOther comments\nTrump has offered somewhat conflicting views on using nuclear weapons throughout the campaign.\nHe has said he \"wouldn\u2019t rule out\" using tactical nuclear weapons against ISIS, but adding in the same interview: \"Definitely nuclear weapons are a last resort.\"\nNor would he rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe, if a conflict ever were to arise.\n\"You don\u2019t want to, say, take everything off the table,\" he said.\nHe also told the New York Times, \"It\u2019s a very scary nuclear world. Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation.\"\nOur ruling\nAn ad by Priorities USA says Trump says he loves war, \"including with nukes.\"\nTrump did say the phrase \"I love war in a certain way.\"\nAnd Trump has said he wouldn't rule out using nuclear weapons.\u00a0But that doesn\u2019t mean he is enthusiastic about them.\u00a0He says they would be the weapon of last resort and that he believes nuclear proliferation to be the \"biggest problem, to me, in the world.\"\nIt's worth noting that the Trump comment used in the ad wasn\u2019t about the United States using nuclear weapons, but about his belief that Japan might be better off if it had nuclear weapons. \u00a0\nReaders can decide for themselves if Trump\u2019s positions are dangerous. But Priorities USA\u2019s ad is missing a bit of context, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04814"}
