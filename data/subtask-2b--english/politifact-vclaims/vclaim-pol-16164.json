Barack Obama chose a less than celebratory topic: the absence of men in the lives of many children, especially black children.\n\n\n\"More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled \u2014 doubled \u2014 since we were children.\"\n\n\nHe went on to say that these absent fathers don't realize that \"responsibility does not end at conception\" and are \"acting like boys instead of men.\"\n\n\nThe\n\nNew York Times\n\nnoted that Obama sounded like comedian Bill Cosby, who has blamed fatherlessness in the black community, among other things, for African-Americans' overrepresentation in jail and underrepresentation among the educated.\n\n\nBy using the term \"we,\" we will assume Obama is speaking to people roughly his age, 46. And by that measure, his claim is backed up by data from the U.S. Census Bureau. In 1960, the year before Obama was born, 22 percent of black children lived with single parents. In 1968, the number rose to 31.4 percent. By 2006, the 1960 percentage had more than doubled to 56 percent.\n\n\nAnd the single parents are overwhelmingly women.\n\n\nIn 2006, 91.4 percent of single parents of black children were mothers. That figure hasn't changed over the years. In 1960, it was a shade lower at 91 percent.\n\n\nThe figures for single-parent families show a rosier picture among other races. About 28 percent of children of all races lived with a single parent in 2006. In 1960, only about 9 percent of American children lived with a single parent.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

We're ruling on his claim that, \"More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled \u2014 doubled \u2014 since we were children,\" which U.S. Census numbers substantiate.
