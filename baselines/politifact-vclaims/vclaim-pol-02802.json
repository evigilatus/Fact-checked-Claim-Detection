It sounds too good to be true, because it is.\"\nThey went on to list a number of associations opposing the ballot initiative because they \"believe it could increase drug costs for millions of Ohioans.\"\nIf approved on Nov. 7, Issue 2 would require all drugs bought by the state -- whether for Medicaid or other state programs -- to match Veterans Affairs prices, which receive a 24 percent discount off market price in addition to sometimes undisclosed rebates. The idea is that it would lower the state\u2019s health care costs.\nWhether or not the ballot initiative can achieve its goal -- or the opposite -- is contested, as we wrote about in\u00a0another fact-check.\nFor this check, we wanted to know if the person behind the initiative was indeed a health care CEO. His title is complicated, but the ad\u2019s message is misleading.\nNotably, the video failed to mention that the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association representing drugmakers, was behind the opposition campaign.\nThe ad attacks Michael Weinstein, the president and co-founder of the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the biggest AIDS-fighting organization in the world. And he\u2019s behind both this ballot initiative and a similar one in California.\n\"Both the New York Times and the LA Times have referred to Mr. Weinstein as the CEO of his organization \u2014 AHF \u2014 which is clearly a health care organization,\" Dale Butland, a spokesman for the opposition campaign, told us. \"Indeed, the New York Times Magazine profile of Mr. Weinstein was titled 'The CEO of HIV.' \"\nChristopher Glazek, the author of the New York Times Magazine story, said the title of the piece was intended as \"arch.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a nonprofit, and his official title isn't CEO,\" Glazek said.\nThe organization derives its revenues from a network of pharmacies and clinics that provide care to mostly government-insured patients. The excess income goes to provide free care to more than 773,000 H.I.V. patients worldwide.\nWeinstein\u2019s annual report showed a salary of $400,000, which Glazek characterized as \"low for directors of similarly sized nonprofits.\"\nChristine Mai-Duc, who co-wrote the Los Angeles Times article, said, \"He is referred to as the \u2018chief executive\u2019 in a photo caption in our story, not in the story itself.\"\nHowever, she noted that a follow-up story referred to him as the foundation\u2019s \"top executive.\"\nThe group that favors the initiative said the description of Glazek is just wrong, and it\u2019s politically motivated.\n\"I think calling him a health care CEO would be disingenuous if it were banal, but considering they are in the process of character assassination, then it is wrong that drug company CEOs are spending money from excessive profits to try to label him as one of them,\" said Dennis Willard, a spokesman for Ohio Taxpayers for Lower Drug Prices.\nThe drug lobby PhRMA has so far outspent the AIDS Foundation roughly 5 to 1, according to the Columbus Dispatch.\nOur ruling\nAn ad against Ohio\u2019s Issue 2 ballot initiative said, \"A California health care CEO is promising to reduce our prescription drug costs.\"\nWeinstein is the president and co-founder of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a nonprofit funding Issue 2, but the articles cited by the campaign referred to Weinstein as a CEO either in jest or in a photo caption.\nHis\u00a0organization deals with health care and he is indeed its top executive, but the ad makes it seem as though he represents the drug industry, which is actually true of the ad makers. It\u2019s the national association for pharmaceutical companies that opposes the ballot measure.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-10-13 14:10:18 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"A California health care CEO is promising to reduce our prescription drug costs.\"    Ohioans Against Deceptive Rx Ballot Issue Ohio Issue 2 opponents https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sAtgT9jGNs   campaign video Tuesday, May 23, 2017 2017-05-23    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02802"}
