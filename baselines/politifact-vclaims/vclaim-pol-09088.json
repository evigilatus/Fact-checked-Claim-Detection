Scott Walker over ending residency rules for government workers, one episode in the endgame escaped with little notice.\n\n\nTen days before Walker signed the 2013-\u201915 state budget, which included a provision prohibiting local governments from enforcing residency, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to oppose the change.\n\n\nBut Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele declined to back the effort, returning the resolution unsigned, and not until 10 days after Walker approved the budget on June 30.\n\n\nCounty supervisors were surprised, saying that Abele had favored the lobbying effort, which dovetailed with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett\u2019s fight to retain the rules.\n\n\nThis is a case for the Flip-O-Meter. \n\n\nThat\u2019s what we use to determine if a public official has changed position on an issue. An important note: We\u2019re not rating the political or policy merits of any switch. We\u2019re looking at whether the candidate has been consistent.\n\n\nWalker says residency rules, long opposed by unions, scare off some would-be job applicants. Barrett, who hopes to overturn the state\u2019s action in court, says there\u2019s no shortage of qualified applicants, and that public employees should contribute toward their publicly funded benefits by paying local property taxes.\n\n\nWhere has Abele stood?\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarch 2011: \n\n\nIn the special election to replace Walker as Milwaukee County Executive, Abele differed on residency rules with opponent Jeff Stone, a Republican state representative.\n\n\nAsked about legislation being discussed in the Legislature to free Milwaukee teachers, police officers and firefighters from residency rules, Stone said he would vote to lift the rules. \n\n\nAbele said the rules should stay. \n\n\nHe agreed with Barrett, who raised concerns at the time that Milwaukee could be harmed as Detroit was when public workers left following the lifting of residency. \n\n\nHiring from the broadest possible pool of potential employees is desirable, Abele told WISN-TV\u2019s Mike Gousha, but \"there\u2019s a reason to be concerned\" in the short run about the impact of workers leaving the city.\n\n\nIn the end, state lawmakers did not act on the residency issue.\n\n\nJune 2012:\n\n\nAbele, at this point in office for more than a year, expressed \"mixed feelings\" about Milwaukee County\u2019s own residency rules as he defended giving one of his top appointees a four-year waiver on moving into the county under the county\u2019s residency rules. \n\n\nCounty Board supervisors said they were blindsided by the waiver that Abele\u2019s administration gave to economic development director Brian Taffora. \n\n\nJuly 2012:\n\n\nWhen the County Board moved to give itself authority to approve such waivers, Abele vetoed the measure.\n\n\nHe fleshed out his \"mixed feelings\" on the issue, saying that having the board more involved would make it harder to \"hire and retain outstanding employees from across the state and country.\" \n\n\nBut Abele\u2019s spokesman, Brendan Conway, told a reporter that Abele wasn\u2019t trying to \"overthrow\" the county\u2019s residency policy.\n\n\nNovember 2012:\n\n\nA month before Taffora resigned rather than face a renomination fight, Abele told WTMJ radio\u2019s John Mercure he was \"kind of agnostic\" on residency requirements.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, he expressed mixed feelings, decrying \"artificial limits\" that can harm recruiting, but also saying that Taffora still intended to move to the county and comply with the rule if he could sell his house in Ozaukee County.\n\n\nFebruary 2013:\n\n\u00a0\n\nShortly after Walker put a broad provision in the budget blocking municipalities statewide from enforcing residency, Barrett began his pushback campaign.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbele joined in, doing an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Feb. 21, 2013. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe mayor saw it as a \"public indication he had supported our efforts,\" spokeswoman Jodie Tabak told PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe story did not detail Abele\u2019s reasoning.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJune 2013:\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith Abele\u2019s apparent blessing, a County Board committee on June 14, 2013 approved the resolution opposing the state move to prohibit local units of government, including Milwaukee County, from requiring residency requirements.\n\n\nMilwaukee County, as well as all other local units of government, \"should retain the right to determine residency restrictions as deemed most effective for each particular community,\" the resolution stated.\n\n\nAbele \"has no issues with this resolution,\" his deputy chief of staff, John Zapfel, told the committee before its vote.\n\n\nAsked by County Supervisor David Cullen if that meant Abele would sign it, Zapfel said: \"That is my understanding, correct.\"\n\n\nCullen told us Abele \"had a chance to lend his voice to those who were asking Scott Walker to veto it. He chose not to. It was disappointing.\"\n\n\nAbele returned the resolution unsigned on July 9, 2013, catching Barrett by surprise, the mayor\u2019s spokeswoman, Jodie Tabak, told us. \n\n\nThe county executive\u2019s message to the County Board did not discuss the merits of Walker\u2019s move; rather, it said he was returning it unsigned because the state budget was complete and the prohibition was taking effect.\n\n\nWe asked Abele why he didn\u2019t sign the resolution after his aide assured supervisors he would.\n\n\nAbele said Zapfel may not have been given a clear idea of his position. \n\n\nAbele told us he spoke out in support of retaining residency only in the context of public safety workers in Milwaukee. He said he was responding to the passionate stance taken by political ally Barrett and Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn.\n\n\nWe found no record of Abele parsing the issue that way during the five-month lobbying campaign by Barrett. Walker\u2019s proposal was to eliminate the rules statewide, not just for Milwaukee.\n\n\nOur rating\n\n\nAbele\u2019s statements and actions don\u2019t constitute a full flip-flop, in our view. He clearly has some misgivings about residency rules for Milwaukee County government, so leaving the file unsigned is not a major reversal. \n\n\nStill, his actions and words have been inconsistent, to the point where both his political friends and his frequent foes on the County Board were taken aback by his withdrawal from the fight as the legislative battle drew to a close in June. \n\n\nIndeed, if Abele had the nuanced position he says he did, it was so closely held that even one of his top aides apparently was completely unaware of it.\n\n\nThe Flip-O-Meter defines a half Flip as a partial change of position or inconsistent statements. That\u2019s what we rate this one.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09088"}
