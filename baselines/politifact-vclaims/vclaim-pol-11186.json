It says Romney once criticized Obama for \"vowing to strike al-Qaida targets inside Pakistan if necessary.\"\n\nThen it shows a clip of CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer quoting Romney as saying in April 2007, \"It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person.\"\n\nBy using that quote, the ad indicates that Romney would not have pursued the al-Qaida leader. Indeed, that's how headlines described the April 27, 2012, ad.\n\nA conservative blogger\u00a0pounced on the ad's implication, saying it took Romney\u2019s \"heaven and earth\" quote out of context. (That charge was also levied back in 2007 about the Associated Press story that quoted Romney in the first place.) Fox News followed, saying \"Obama campaign's bin Laden ad omits Romney clarification on key quote.\"\n\nWe wondered:\u00a0Did the ad accurately characterize Romney\u2019s \"heaven and earth\" quote? Was he really lukewarm \u2014 or even opposed \u2014 to the effort to get bin Laden?\n\nThe AP interview\n\nThere\u2019s no dispute that Romney said about bin Laden, \"It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person.\"\n\nBut was he saying he wouldn\u2019t pursue the terrorist?\n\nThe quote comes from an Associated Press story on April 26, 2007, about a Romney interview with reporter Liz Sidoti that covered a range of topics. Here\u2019s the related passage:\n\nIn the interview, Romney also:\n\nSaid the country would be safer by only \"a small percentage\" and would see \"a very insignificant increase in safety\" if al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was caught because another terrorist would rise to power. \"It's not worth moving heaven and earth spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person,\" Romney said. Instead, he said he supports a broader strategy to defeat the Islamic jihad movement.\n\nAt the time, Democrats such as Obama were criticizing President George W. Bush for failing to find bin Laden. Republicans, in turn, were critical of Obama's focus on capturing or killing the terrorist leader.\n\nA post from the conservative site Townhall.com in 2007 says it got a transcript from Romney\u2019s campaign at the time that shows he followed the \"heaven and earth\" line with the sentence: \"It is worth fashioning and executing an effective strategy to defeat global, violent Jihad and I have a plan for doing that.\"\n\nLater, he explains, \"Global jihad \u2026 involves millions of people and is going to require a far more comprehensive strategy than a targeted approach for bin Laden or a few of his associates.\"\n\nSidoti, now AP\u2019s political editor, couldn\u2019t confirm the accuracy of the transcript for us, and Romney\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to our inquiry. Lucky for us, Romney himself had a chance to clarify his words just days after he spoke them, in a May 4, 2007, Republican presidential debate.\n\nThe moderator of the MSNBC debate, which featured nine Republicans, brought up Romney\u2019s \"heaven and earth\" quote, which rival Arizona Sen. John McCain had called \"naive.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.

Romney, respond to the mentioned reference to you ... by Sen. McCain.\"\n\nROMNEY: \"Thank you. Of course we get Osama bin Laden and track him wherever he has to go, and make sure he pays for the outrage he exacted upon America.\"\n\nMODERATOR: \"Can we move heaven and earth to do it?\"\n\nROMNEY: \"We'll move everything to get him. But I don't want to buy into the Democratic pitch that this is all about one person \u2014 Osama bin Laden \u2014 because after we get him, there's going to be another and another. This is about Shia and Sunni. This is about Hezbollah and Hamas and al-Qaida and the Muslim Brotherhood. This is a worldwide jihadist effort to try and cause the collapse of all moderate Islamic governments and replace them with a caliphate.\n\n\"They ultimately want to bring down the United States of America.\n\n\"This is a global effort we're going to have to lead to overcome this jihadist effort. It's more than Osama bin Laden.\n\n\"But he is going to pay, and he will die.\"\n\nThat suggests Romney was criticizing Democrats for focusing too much on the al-Qaida leader rather than the full organization and would have aggressively pursued bin Laden in the context of a larger antiterror strategy.\n\nStill, Romney suggested just a few months later that he wouldn\u2019t do what Obama ultimately did \u2014 call for a secret, unilateral Navy SEALs strike inside Pakistan. In 2007, Obama had said that if he were elected president, he would be willing to launch strikes against al-Qaida targets in Pakistan with or without Pakistan\u2019s approval.\n\nAn Aug. 4, 2007, headline from Reuters \u2014 an article cited by Obama\u2019s ad \u2014 says, \"Romney attacks Obama over Pakistan warning.\"\n\nRomney called Obama's comments \u2018ill-timed\u2019 and \u2018ill-considered,\u2019\" Reuters reported, along with other news services.\n\n\"There is a war being waged by terrorists of different types and nature across the world,\" Romney said, according to Reuters. \"We want, as a civilized world, to participate with other nations in this civilized effort to help those nations reject the extreme with them.\"\n\nRomney \"said U.S. troops \u2018shouldn't be sent all over the world.'\"\n\nOther Republicans (and Democrat Hillary Clinton) had the same complaint, with some going so far as to say Obama \"wants to bomb Pakistan,\" a statement we rated Pants on Fire.\n\nThe Obama campaign, on the other hand, had issued a memo that the United States had deferred to the Pakistani president\u2019s judgment long enough, and that, \"Barack Obama wants to turn the page,\" Reuters reported.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAn Obama campaign ad suggested Mitt Romney wouldn\u2019t have agressively pursued Osama bin Laden by citing Romney's statement that, \"It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign is right that Romney used those words, but by cherry-picking them, it glosses over comments describing his broader approach. Romney said he wanted to pursue all of al-Qaida, not just its leaders.\n\nThe reporter quoting him in April 2007 said he instead \"endorsed a broader strategy to defeat the Islamic jihad movement.\" And he said just over a week later that he would \"get Osama bin Laden and track him wherever he has to go, and make sure he pays for the outrage he exacted upon America \u2026 he is going to pay, and he will die.\"\n\nStill, Romney was clear later that summer that he would prefer to participate with allies rather than take unilateral action to kill terrorists as Obama supported \u2014 and later did. The ad takes Romney\u2019s words out of context, but gets part of the story right. We rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11186"}
