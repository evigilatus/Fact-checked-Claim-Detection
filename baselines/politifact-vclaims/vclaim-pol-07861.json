Opponents, led by Royal Caribbean Cruises, created the Miami Seaport Alliance and took out ads on television, radio and in newspapers arguing that a stadium threatens the port\u2019s livelihood.\nA full-page ad in the Miami Herald in April stated, \"A soccer stadium is being proposed at PortMiami. The Miami Seaport Alliance opposes any development that threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries. All jobs are important for the future of Miami, but we cannot risk full-time, well-paying PortMiami jobs like crane operators, truckers and cargo loaders, for a few, part-time concession jobs like peanut sellers and ticket takers.\"\nBeckham\u2019s investors responded with their own full-page ad in the Herald, vowing that a soccer stadium would achieve the port\u2019s goals of creating jobs and revenue.\nAt PolitiFact Florida, we are quite familiar with half truths about stadiums. It is a challenge to fact-check a prediction, but we decided to explore the evidence about whether a soccer stadium at the port would threaten the existing 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact. Is the Alliance bending the truth about Beckham?\nRoyal Caribbean leads opposition\nBeckham wants to rent a county-owned 12-acre site near the port to build a 25,000 seat stadium with an open roof. Beckham has said he will privately finance the construction and apply for a state sales tax subsidy, hoping to open the stadium in 2018.\nPort officials had planned to build a new 7 million square foot commercial district on the site, because it\u2019s too shallow to accommodate ships. Beckham\u2019s group says the stadium would still leave room for about a 1 million square foot commercial development.\nThe port site isn\u2019t the only one under consideration, though it appears to be one of Beckham\u2019s favorites. At Mayor Carlos Gimenez\u2019 request, Beckham is also considering filling in a boat slip in downtown, though that site also has challenges.\nMany of jobs \u2018tied\u2019 to the port aren\u2019t at the port\nThe spin in the ad begins with the number of jobs cited.\nThe number cited -- 207,000 jobs -- comes from a study done for the port to measure its current economic impact. Martin Associates, a Pennsylvania-based firm, interviewed 485 cruise-related businesses in the Miami-Dade County area in 2012 and released the report last year.\nThe report adds up various types of jobs, including direct port workers and suppliers. The study also accounts for \"induced jobs,\" which includes jobs generated by spending by port workers.\nThe largest category of jobs, though, is what the study calls \"user jobs,\" which are importers or exporters in Florida that ship or receive cargo through the port.\nFor example, if an Orange grove in Orlando ships a portion of their oranges through Miami, then the study translates that portion of the grove\u2019s business -- including orange pickers in Orlando -- into a number of user jobs connected to PortMiami.\nThe study concluded that port activity \"supported\" 207,804 jobs in the state of Florida. The vast majority -- 80 percent -- were \"user jobs.\"\nThe user jobs wouldn\u2019t disappear from Florida if PortMiami wasn\u2019t available. \"These importers/exporters would divert their cargo through other ports,\" the study states.\nSimilarly, most of the $27 billion in economic activity includes a lot of business that takes place far away from the port site in Miami.\nSo hypothetically speaking, if the soccer stadium were to create such a morass that cargo and cruise companies jumped ship and fled Miami, those jobs and economic impact dollars wouldn\u2019t vanish into thin air -- much of it would just move to other ports in Florida.\nWill stadium threaten existing port jobs?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sent the port report to a few economists, and several raised concerns about the jobs number in the context of the ad opposing the soccer stadium.\nTemple University economics professor Michael Leeds said that the \"user jobs\" category is a red herring.\n\"It essentially counts a lot of people and money that will never come anywhere near Miami,\" he said.\nThose user jobs and the user income number leads to an exaggeration of the total numbers, said Holy Cross economics professor Victor Matheson.\n\"That being said, in this case it doesn't matter whether the report is correct or not,\" said Matheson, a critic of public financing of stadiums. \"Whether the port generates 20,000 jobs or 200,000 jobs, the question is whether Beckham will interfere with those jobs, and I just don't see a significant disruption.\"\nCruise officials said the stadium could hurt the port, though. John Fox, president of the Miami Seaport Alliance, who lobbies on behalf of Royal Caribbean, pointed to a Moody\u2019s report which downgraded the port\u2019s credit rating in May. But the report didn\u2019t mention the soccer stadium as a factor.\nFox said that the stadium could scare away carriers who now operate out of Miami, sending them to other ports.\nAny other port could \"sell their port over the Port of Miami due to real perceptions that delays will be a common issue and that this community is not serious about being in the commercial port business of being a port,\" Fox said.\nBruce Rubin, a spokesman for Beckham, says the port\u2019s plan for 7 million square feet of commercial development \"would create far more traffic conflicts with cargo and cruise operations than would our plan for a professional soccer stadium\" and the smaller adjacent commercial development.\nRubin said the stadium will host about 25 large events per year and \"a number of other activities.\" The 17 home games largely would occur on Saturday evenings which doesn\u2019t coincide with the typical times for the arrival and departure of cruise passengers or cargo operators.\nStadium supporters haven\u2019t yet finished their study about projected jobs, but Rubin estimated that it would include 2,000 to 3,000 construction jobs.\nEconomic experts weigh in on impact of stadium at port\nWe sent a summary of the soccer battle to professors who study the economics of stadiums.\nRick Eckstein, a sociology Professor at Villanova University who has studied stadium financing and criticized deals, told PolitiFact Florida, \"Both groups are wildly exaggerating the economic impact of their respective plans.\"\n\"Sports stadiums have a lousy record of spurring economic impact. Soccer stadiums, with but 19 games a year drawing about 20,000 visitors each, might be the least able to spur development. Conversely, I don\u2019t think a soccer stadium would hurt development in that area. It would simply have no effect,\" he said.\nMatheson, a major critic of subsidies for sports stadiums, \u00a0said that the stadium will cause some traffic disruptions during matches, but they would likely be minor.\n\"It is hard to see how 20 days of extra traffic, most which will be on weekends, will have any significant impact on the port, especially if some decent traffic management is utilized,\" he said. \"I don't find the port's objections particularly convincing. Do be concerned about traffic. Do be concerned about hidden costs of a privately financed stadium. But don't reflexively torpedo any type (of economic development) just because one industry doesn't like it.\"\nBruce Seaman, a Georgia State University economist, said that the arguments by cargo and cruise industries \"are nearly absurd. \u00a0Even given the self-serving perspective they clearly represent, it is hard to imagine even pure rent-seekers bothering to make such weak arguments opposing that project.\"\nOne professor we interviewed -- University of South Florida economics professor Philip Porter, a major critic of financing of sports stadiums -- said the anti-stadium side has a point.\n\"If the soccer stadium project means the 7 million square foot commercial development would be compromised, Miami loses,\" Porter said. \"One thing we\u2019ve come to realize is that sports -- with such infrequent activity -- cannot compete with commercial activity in creating jobs and generating income.\"\nOur ruling\nThe ad said that David Beckham\u2019s proposed soccer stadium at Miami\u2019s port \"threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries.\"\nThe numbers come from a study which states that the jobs related to the port are all over Florida. The ad is somewhat careful in the wording about the jobs because it states the jobs are \"tied\" to cargo and cruise industries, but then it talks about jobs at PortMiami such as crane operators who could be replaced by stadium peanut sellers -- which could create the impression that these are all direct jobs at the port, and that\u2019s not the case.\nA soccer stadium at the port would certainly lead to some changes at the port -- and cruise operators are concerned about how that could change their operations. But at this point, there isn\u2019t evidence that a stadium would threaten the port jobs or economic activity.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07861"}
