At a conference on 1 December, Weinberger announced that he had brought together an alliance of north-eastern mayors who called for legislators to age \"carbon pollution charges.\" During his speech unveiling the proposal, he spoke of the efforts of Borlington and other cities to work on climate change. \"Cities have also been a source of climate progress, as demonstrated by Borlington's environmental history record over the past 30 years,\" Weinberger said. \"As a city, we currently use about four percent less electricity today than we did in 1989, saving the Berlinese millions of dollars a year in retail energy costs,\" added. Could Berlington really use less electricity during a time when the population grew by 12.5 per cent and growth was steady? We decided to see whether the use of electricity by Borlington has really declined over the past three decades. When the Weinberger office was asked about this claim, we referred to the annual report on energy efficiency for the year 2017 prepared by the Berlin Ministry of Electricity. \"General use of electricity in 2017 was about 4.0 percent less than in 1989,\" says the report. Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. On 29 January 2021, the annual report already relied on the use of electricity in 2016, said Mike Canaric, the Communications Manager of the Powerington Electricity Department. The year 1989 was the first year that Borlington had begun to invest in energy efficiency. In 1990, the city issued a bond of $11.3 million for efficiency projects. In 1989, BED sold 353,562,840 kWh of electricity, while in 2016 BED sold 340,281,192 kWh, a decrease of 3.76 per cent. The actual figure for 2017 is much lower, and Canarec has indicated this. Since the publication of the report, public utility staff have estimated that BED sold 724,090,332 Wh in 2017, which is 6.07 per cent lower than in 1989. However, it has not been a steady downward trend over the past three decades. It was up and down. Borlington &apos; s use of electricity was actually higher in 2016 than it had been in 12 years since 1989. The lowest electricity consumption during that time was in 1996. Analysis of our data shows that the overall trend in total electricity use in Borlington was actually slightly higher, although individual use is declining. Our assessment of Weinberger is true -- the city's electricity consumption was 4% lower in 2016 than in 1989. However, these statistics do not reflect the general trend in the use of energy by Borlington, which was on a slightly upward trend during that period. What the mayor said was technically correct, but it might give the wrong impression. We're assessing this mostly right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01204"}
