Let\u2019s take them one by one.\nTroops on the border\nAs the ad says in type displayed on screen, Van de Putte said in a July 21, 2014, campaign press release that Texas Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s decision to dispatch up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the border was the \"wrong way to go.\" In her release, she said a better approach would be to provide local and state law enforcement agencies with resources they request and need.\nVan de Putte, referring to the uptick in unaccompanied children crossing the Rio Grande, conceded National Guard members are prepared for many missions. \"But to strictly militarize the border won\u2019t help us meet this unique humanitarian challenge,\" she said.\nSo, the Democrat opposed the troop deployment.\nIn-state tuition for undocumented immigrants\nVan de Putte also played a major role in presenting the 2001 legislation affording in-state college tuition rates to some immigrants unauthorized to live in the U.S., though contrary to Patrick\u2019s ad, Van de Putte wasn\u2019t the proposal\u2019s author -- as in original sponsor. The lead author was then-Rep. Ric Noriega, D-Houston.\nShe was darned close, however, by serving as the Senate sponsor of the House-approved proposal that came to the Senate before later making it to Perry to be signed into law, legislative records show; indeed, no other senators co-sponsored the act. Under the law, which Perry has long defended, children of Texas residents who entered the country without legal permission may qualify for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. In the 2001 legislative session, Perry has accurately said, very few legislators opposed the action.\nMillions to Central America\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what of Patrick\u2019s third dart -- that Van de Putte favors sending government aid to countries in Central America instead of putting Texas troops on the border?\nPatrick\u2019s ad lists a June 14, 2014, news report by KGBT-TV, Channel 4 in Harlingen, as his basis for the government-aid claim. We watched the report and read a story posted with the station\u2019s news video and didn\u2019t notice Van de Putte directly saying she would prefer to send millions of dollars to such countries.\nAccording to the news report, Van de Putte told a station reporter after visiting a U.S. Border Patrol facility in Brownsville holding thousands of mothers and children that it\u2019s time for Congress to embark on immigration reform. According to the station\u2019s online write-up, Van de Putte also asked Congress to strongly consider accepting President Barack Obama\u2019s $3.7 billion request to deal with the border crisis (though this described message for Congress wasn\u2019t part of KGBT-TV\u2019s video report).\nWith a nudge from Alejandro Garcia, Patrick\u2019s campaign spokesman, we spotted references to Obama\u2019s proposal touching on money for border security and other needs in countries in Central America. When Obama unsuccessfully sought the $3.7 billion in July 2014, he said the government needed the spending to pay for new detention facilities to house the additional border-crossers coming from Central America and to conduct more aerial surveillance and hire immigration judges and Border Patrol agents.\nThe Central America angle: Garcia pointed out a July 2014 breakdown of Obama\u2019s $3.7 billion request by USA Today stating $295 million of his requested aid would go to the State Department and other international programs to \"support efforts to repatriate and reintegrate migrants to Central America, to help regional governments better control their borders and to address the underlying root causes driving migration, i.e. creating the economic, social, governance and citizen security conditions. Beyond initial assistance, continued funding for repatriation and reintegration activities will be contingent on sustained progress and cooperation by the Central American countries,\" the paper said. We saw the same dollar figure and explanation in a July 8, 2014, White House \"fact sheet.\"\nThen again, Patrick\u2019s camp didn\u2019t provide nor did we spot evidence Van de Putte said that instead of Texas paying to station troops near the Texas-Mexico border, state dollars should go to countries in Central America. It\u2019s worth noting, too, that she talked up Obama\u2019s $3.7 billion request about five weeks before Perry revealed he was considering dispatching troops to the border. Perry issued the deployment order July 21, 2014.\nOur ruling\nPatrick said Van de Putte \"opposed putting National Guard troops on the border, would send millions to Central American governments instead and wrote the law giving in-state tuition to illegal immigrants.\"\nVan de Putte was the Senate sponsor of the House-originated 2001 proposal authorizing in-state tuition for immigrants not living here with legal permission.\nShe also opposed this summer's National Guard deployment. However, she didn\u2019t say that instead of placing\u00a0 troops near the border, the state should aid countries in Central America. Rather, Van de Putte earlier and separately urged congressional approval of an Obama request that included federal aid to such countries. Suggesting she conflated spending on the Texas troops with the sought federal funding amounts to a misleading stretch.\nOn balance, we rate Patrick's statement Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07174"}
