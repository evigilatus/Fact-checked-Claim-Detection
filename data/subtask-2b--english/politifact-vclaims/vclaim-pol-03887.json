Tom Price, R-Ga., has a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. But a Democratic website says he wants to go further and nix Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors and the disabled. \u00a0\n\"Trump\u2019s Health Secretary Pick Wants a Medicare Phase Out by Summer 2017,\" reads a headline on a Winning Democrats article posted Dec. 1. Over the next week the post generated 14,000 likes.\nThe Winning Democrats article frames Price\u2019s position as ending Medicare.\n\n\"In short, Americans can expect Republicans in Congress to begin their effort to wipe out Medicare in one swoop, which would harm millions of Americans immediately and millions more in the years to come as Medicare no longer exists to help older Americans pay for health care without having to deal with all the bulls--- private insurance companies do,\" reads an excerpt from the piece.\nDemocratic claims that Republicans wanted to end\u00a0Medicare were pervasive in previous years, so much so that the claim \"Republicans voted to end Medicare\"\u00a0won the 2011 Lie of the Year.\nPrice\u2019s alleged position is significant since Trump promised to leave Medicare alone as president. More recently, however, Trump\u2019s transition website says he wants to \"modernize Medicare so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation -- and beyond.\"\nDoes Trump\u2019s HHS pick actually want to discontinue Medicare?\n\nWe found that Price does favor changing Medicare, but it\u2019s wrong to say he wants to end it.\nPrice\u2019s plan does not equal phasing out Medicare\nPrice\u2019s spokesperson sent PolitiFact the Fiscal Year 2017 Budget Resolution as a basis for Price\u2019s plan. The resolution was prepared by the House budget committee, of which Price is chairman.\nThe plans does not include ending Medicare.\nThe suggested plan would be similar to the Medicare Advantage program. Beneficiaries would pick from a list of government-approved plans and the government would make a payment to the insurers to help cover the cost of the plan.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Ginsburg, a public policy professor at the University of Southern California, called the \"phase out\" claim false.\n\"The FY17 budget resolution says some things about Medicare, but they appear to be along the lines of more private-plan alternatives to traditional Medicare,\" Ginsburg said. \"However, it is not at all clear how these would differ from Medicare Advantage plans, which have attracted more than 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries.\"\nGinsburg wasn\u2019t alone. None of the experts we interviewed said Price\u2019s plan amounts to getting rid of Medicare. Experts did agree, however, that Price\u2019s plan would dramatically change how Medicare works.\n\"I do not equate Price\u2019s plan to \u2018phasing out Medicare,\u2019 though the plan would significantly change how Medicare works, converting it from a defined benefit program (beneficiaries guaranteed a certain level of coverage) into a defined contribution program (beneficiaries given a fixed dollar amount with which to buy coverage),\" said Michael Spearer, a health policy and management professor at Columbia University.\nThat\u2019s a serious change, but the Winning Democrats story makes it sound as if Price is referring to phasing out Medicare.\nHere\u2019s how the remark appears in the story:\n\nThat quote originally appeared in a Nov. 17 Talking Points Memo article, \"Rep. Tom Price Reveals Republicans Eyeing Medicare Overhaul In 2017.\"\nSo the Winning Democrats frames Price\u2019s quote to refer to phasing out Medicare, when the remark was in reference to a Medicare overhaul.\nOur ruling\nWinning Democrats said Price wants to phase out Medicare by summer 2017.\nPrice favors an overhaul of Medicare, but the phrase \"phase out\" is too strong and gives readers the specific impression Medicare won\u2019t exist under Price. Medicare will exist, and Price\u2019s preferred plan for its future is laid out in detail in the 2017 Fiscal Year Budget Resolution.\nIn addition, the article offers little to no evidence to support the idea that Price wants to end Medicare. We rate this claim False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b8e4ba6d-18c4-476c-8bea-eb10ec254d13", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03887"}
