President Barack Obama is certainly fond of them. His recent speech on economic issues, in which he backed a minimum wage increase, included more than 6,500.\nBut what about a point Obama made in the speech about how the income gap\u00a0affects young children?\n\"By the time she turns 3 years old, a child born into a low-income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well-off family, which means by the time she starts school, she\u2019s already behind,\" he said.\nJust for comparison\u2019s sake, 30 million words would be equivalent to 4,615 Obama speeches.\nBut did he get his fact right? We\u2019d never heard of this finding before, so we took a closer look.\nWhen we asked the White House for a source, a spokesman pointed us to research from the mid\u00a01990s and early 2000s by child psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley.\nThey published their findings in a book, Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children. Over several years, the pair observed families of different socioeconomic statuses, based on education and income levels, and found that better-off families engaged their children more frequently with language.\nThey found a 30 million \"word gap\" by age 3 between students of divergent socioeconomic classes. That\u2019s one piece of evidence, they argued, to explain the \"achievement gap,\" a term educators and researchers have used to explain why lower-income students start kindergarten on worse footing.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe word gap, along with other issues, leaves preschool educators to fix existing educational shortfalls, said Dana Suskind, a doctor and researcher at the University of Chicago. She\u2019s also the director of Thirty Million Words Initiative, one of many advocacy and research groups whose work revolves around the Hart and Risley research.\n\"This early language and vocabulary gap are really the beginnings of the achievement gap that we see continuing on through the end of high school and through life,\" Suskind said.\nObama and others often bring up the concept of 30 million words because early childhood exposure to language comes at a crucial time in brain development, said Samuel Odom, a child development researcher at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.\nWhen asked if any scientist has called the 30 million word gap into question, Suskind told us it\u2019s \"pretty well-accepted\" as the norm in the field. In addition, she and two other experts agreed that Obama had summed up the research accurately.\nSuskind offered just one caveat: While Obama described the norm, there\u2019s variation from family to family. Some low-income families speak to and interact with their kids more, and some more affluent families don\u2019t.\n\"No socioeconomic group has cornered the market on loving their kids and wanting their kids to succeed,\" she said. \"You can\u2019t generalize economic groups.\"\nOur ruling\nObama said that less-affluent children are behind by the time they start school because they have heard about 30 million fewer words than peers from higher-income families. Experts say studies clearly support Obama\u2019s point. We rate Obama\u2019s statement True.\nEditor's note: This item was edited after initial publication to clarify that researchers studied the word gap of children up to age 3, not age 5.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08535"}
