Will it?", "text": "House Republicans have touted their tax bill as a plus for typical American families.\nIn a constituent email forwarded to us by a reader, Georgia Rep. Drew Ferguson wrote, \"This week the House released our tax reform legislation to help American families and level the playing field for the American worker. With this plan, the average family of four earning median income ($59,000/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year. Who wouldn't want American families to have more money in their pockets?\"\n\n\u00a0\nThe statement is exaggerating how long the average family of four will enjoy those tax savings.\nHow the House Republican math works\nFerguson\u2019s office said that he had been citing comment from House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose office told us in a related check that the speaker had been referring to a House Ways and Means Committee analysis. That analysis calculated several scenarios for how the proposal\u2019s changes could affect different types of taxpayers.\nThe key elements of the Ways and Means calculation involved tax brackets, the standard deduction and the child tax credit.\nCurrently, there are seven brackets; these would be consolidated into four -- 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent.\nIn the meantime, the standard deduction would be raised from $12,000 to $24,000. And the child tax credit would be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, bolstered by a new $300 credit for parents and other dependents.\nThe example refers to a \"family of four making $59,000 per year.\" Here\u2019s the scenario outlined in the House\u2019s fact sheet, using the fictional example of \"Steve and Melinda\" with two middle school-aged children:\n\"As a result of lower tax rates, a significantly larger standard deduction, and an enhanced Child Tax Credit and Family Flexibility Credit, Steve and Melinda will pay over $1,182 less in taxes than last year, reducing their total tax bill from $1,582 to only $400. \"That\u2019s more money they can use for whatever is important to them, whether it\u2019s paying bills, purchasing a new refrigerator, or putting away savings for the future.\"\nThe Ways and Means Committee told PolitiFact that they chose a household income of $59,000 because it\u2019s the median household income nationally.\nFor that amount of income, a family today would get $12,700 from the standard deduction, $16,200 in personal exemptions, leaving $30,100 in taxable income. Of that, $18,650 would be taxed at 10 percent and $11,450 would be taxed at 15 percent, meaning the preliminary tax liability would be $3,582.50. That would be adjusted with $2,000 in child tax credits, producing a final tax liability of $1,582.50.\nUnder the new tax bill, the family would take a larger $24,000 standard deduction (the proposal eliminates personal exemptions), leaving $35,000 in taxable income. At the 12 percent rate, that would mean $4,200 in preliminary liability. This would be offset by $3,200 in child tax credits and $600 in family credits, leaving a final tax liability of $400. That\u2019s a $1,182.50 tax cut.\nSo Ferguson has some mathematical detail to back up the figure. But that\u2019s not the end of the story. Here are the two clearest caveats.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduction of itemized deductions\nThe GOP bill eliminates or shrinks a number of widely used itemized deductions, and those factors aren\u2019t taken into account in the figure Ryan cited.\nThe deductions eliminated or pared back in the bill include the mortgage interest deduction (for future mortgages, it would be capped at half its previous maximum); the state and local tax deduction (only $10,000 in property tax deductions would be allowed); the medical expense deduction; the casualty loss deduction; and the student loan interest deduction.\nExchanging these changes for a higher standard deduction may benefit many taxpayers, particularly those who choose not to itemize today. For households earning around $59,000 a year, more taxpayers do take the standard deduction than take itemized deductions -- but a significant minority, about one-third, do itemize.\nFor many itemizing taxpayers, those deductions are important -- and under the tax bill, they\u2019re likely to end up worse off if the bill is passed as is, even with the higher standard deduction.\nFor this type of taxpayer, the loss of even one of those deductions could conceivably wipe out that $1,182 gain for certain types of families.\nThis specific amount of tax savings is good for just the first year\nFerguson\u2019s statement explicitly said that the $1,182 income boost would happen \"every year.\"\nThe problem is that the benefits of the tax proposal shrink, slowly but surely, over the next decade for this family.\n\"The tax cut definitely dissipates over time,\" David Kamin, a tax and budget specialist at the New York University law school, told PolitiFact.\nKamin cited a combination of factors, including the sunsetting of the $300 per parent tax credit; the lack of inflation adjustments for the child tax credit, which effectively replace personal exemptions that were indexed to inflation; and the new use of an inflation adjustment measure known as chained CPI, which grows more slowly than the yardstick in current use.\nAccording to Kamin\u2019s calculations, the initial tax cut for the family making $59,000 becomes a $500 tax increase by 2024 compared to the status quo. Here\u2019s the graph he put together:\n\nThe way Ferguson described the cut was actually stronger than Ryan\u2019s tax cut of \"$1,182 a year.\"\nAmy Timmerman, Ferguson\u2019s communications director, said that \"the congressman misspoke last week when he cited Speaker Ryan\u2019s example.\"\nOur ruling\nFerguson said that under the House Republican tax proposal, \"the average family of four earning median income ($59,000/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year.\"\nThis is based on a plausible and transparent calculation, but Ferguson glossed over some context. The calculation doesn\u2019t factor in several itemized deductions that would disappear under the proposal and that could have a significant impact on at least some \"typical\" families around that income level. And the statement is misleading when it says the family will save $1,182 \"every year,\" since that\u2019s the case in the first year only; after that, the benefit starts to shrink and eventually turns into a tax hike.\nWe rate the statement Half True.\nEDITORS' NOTE, Nov. 6, 2017: We updated this story to remove a reference to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center of the tax plan.
