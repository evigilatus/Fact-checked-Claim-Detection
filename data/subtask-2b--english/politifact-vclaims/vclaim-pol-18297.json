Some cities, like Columbia and St. Louis, have extended their stay-at-home regulations.\n\n\nIn\u00a0a reflection of how the state\u00a0has been responding to the pandemic, state House Rep. Louis Riggs, R-Hannibal, said on April 21: \"Thankfully, we have seen success to date, as nearly half of our counties have not reported positive cases.\"\n\n\nRiggs\u2019 estimate was more than a little off.\n\n\nCases by county\nData from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on that day show 20 counties without any positive cases, or 18% of 114 counties. The state passed the halfway mark three weeks earlier, on March 30.\u00a0\n\n\nRiggs admitted that his error resulted from a quick glance over the department\u2019s map showing the breakdown of cases by county. If a county has between one and six cases it has a light tan color, easy to confuse with the white color of the counties without any cases.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRiggs said what he should have said was, \"nearly 20% with zero cases and half with less than 10,\" which would be accurate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAs of May 11, 15 counties have not reported any cases of COVID-19.\u00a0\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nRiggs said on April 21, \"nearly half of our counties have not reported positive cases.\" Half would be a sharp rounding up from 18%.\u00a0\n\n\nBecause Riggs\u2019 estimate included counties that did not fall into the correct category we rate his claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18297"}
