Our farmers and states cannot continue to be harmed by such huge payments, and little appreciation!\" The best thing that happened to Puerto Rico was President Donald Trump. A lot of wonderful people, but with bad island leadership and a lot of money wasted. We cannot continue to harm our farmers and our countries with these huge payments, and very little appreciation! - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 2 April 2019 found Trump wrong about the dollar amount that the land received and wrong when he said it was a record. His comments on aid for the hurricane follow other misleading statements made in connection with Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017. Trump misdescribed the death toll, saying that the estimate \"was made by Democrats,\" and overestimated the poor state of Puerto Rico's electrical system before the hurricanes. The future of Puerto Rico &apos; s aid began to emerge after the Senate failed to move forward with legislation. The parties have charged each other because no agreement has been reached after months of proposals. While proposals from both parties included $600 million for food assistance to Puerto Rico, Democrats wanted millions more of other needs in Puerto Rico, including for the electrical grid, and reimbursement for the Union &apos; s water projects. Puerto Rico had not received $91 billion, and the federal government website showed that $40.7 billion had been allocated (the Congress approved expenditure) until December 2018. Of this amount, $19.4 billion was committed (the Government promised to spend funds) and $11.2 billion was spent. The funds come from various agencies and funds, including the United States Housing and Urban Development Fund, the Community Development Fund and the Disaster Relief Fund. A senior management told Poletti Fuckett that Trump had reached $91 billion by combining the approximately $41 billion already allocated with the estimated additional costs in the future to be incurred by the Foundation in the amount of $50 billion. (The fact-checker in the Washington Post wrote that the $50 billion was a high estimate of what needed to be committed under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act 1988. On September 5, 2014, Joe Garcia mentioned in an online announcement that US House candidate Carlos Corbello \"support the raising of flood insurance prices.\" By Amy Sherman: September 16, 2014, which means that $50 billion is a guess, Steve Ellis, Vice-President of the taxpayers said to the general sense. \"It may be spent, it may not be, and some of it will be far in the future,\" he said. How far into the future? A look at Katrina's spending shows that it can last for more than a decade after the storm. Ellis said that funds from the Disaster Relief Fund were still being disbursed in respect of Katrina (Woretta and Wilma, also in the 2005 storms), for approximately $200 million this year. It's hard to determine how much the federal government spent after a disaster. Some hurricanes hit more than one state, and some States receive money to cope with multiple disasters. Comparing the number of different jurisdictions that have received various disasters is not a comparison between apples and trailers because some disasters cause further damage. Comparisons of disaster aid in Puerto Rico with other storms ignore inflation and it is more costly to deliver disaster supplies to Puerto Rico, which is located about 1,000 nautical miles from the mainland of the United States. \"It is clear that Puerto Rico is not in the continental United States, so all supplies must be sent by ship or aircraft, which increases costs,\" Elise said. \"You can ship supplies to Louisiana, Texas and Florida. Inflation is a factor -- a billion dollars in 2005 equals more than a billion dollars in 2017.\" Federal officials did not answer our questions, wondering how Trump concluded that the figure of $91 billion was more than any other disaster. But federal reports show that the government has already spent more on Hurricane Katrina -- and this has not been treated as inflation. The Congressional Research Service estimated in 2014 that \"the conference provided approximately $120 billion to Hurricane Katrina.\" In his attack on spending on the Puerto Rican disaster, Trump said, \"We cannot continue to hurt our farmers and our countries with these huge payments, and very little appreciation!\" The federal Government pays for disasters in various states and in Puerto Rican territory, which is part of the United States. (This is despite comments by White House spokesman Hogan Gedley on MSNBC, who referred to Puerto Rico as \"that country.\" He called it a slip. The Governor Trump wrote, \"Puerto Rico's got $91 billion for the hurricane, more than ever I've got the money for the hurricane before.\" Trump reached this figure by combining the already allocated $41 billion with the estimated future additional cost of $50 billion to the Federation over the lifetime of the disaster. But that future payment is a guess, and it'll be years before we know how much of it comes true. Even if the $91 billion is the final cost on the road, the Federal Government has already estimated that it spent $120 billion on Hurricane Katrina. We value this allegation wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/23122e776-885c-4010-89e5-b1b5d4d6bfe", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00806"}
