One of them is that the U.S. government somehow planned the pandemic.\nAn April 26 Facebook post sought to prove its case by showing a screenshot of a Wikipedia-like page describing the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, more commonly known as the CARES Act.\u00a0\nThe $2.2 trillion act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, included direct payments to most Americans, enhanced unemployment aid, loans for small business and other relief measures.\nThe page captured in the screenshot lists the bill as having been introduced on Jan. 24, 2017. That\u2019s more than three years before the novel coronavirus was declared a pandemic, which the post cites as evidence that the pandemic was a long-planned event.\nThe poster added the comment, \"Clearly a PLAN-DEMIC. Guess what they have planned next for you. Hint \u2014 None of it is in your best interest. Hint 2 \u2014 It's much worse than you could ever imagine.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nIn reality, there\u2019s a mundane explanation for why the bill was introduced well before the pandemic itself, and it has nothing to do with a government plot. But explaining it requires a short lesson in constitutional law and how Congress works.\nArticle I, Section 7 of the Constitution says that bills related to raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives before moving to the Senate for consideration.\nSometimes, lawmakers decide that revenue-related legislation must pass urgently, and the shortest path is to skip the normal House-to-Senate process.\nThat was the case with the CARES Act.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Democratic House majority did offer a version of the bill, negotiators from the White House and the Senate were already deep into talks about what should be in the bill. When the Senate came up with a version of the bill that the leaders in both parties could support, they drew up the legislative text to be voted on.\nHowever, because of the constitutional rule on tax-related bills, the senators didn\u2019t create a new Senate bill. Instead, they took an existing bill that had been passed by the House but not by the Senate. The Senate stripped out the language, inserted the new CARES Act wording into the shell, and voted on it. It passed unanimously, and was later passed by the House and signed by President Donald Trump.\nWhat the Senate did is a \"commonly used workaround,\" said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist who specializes in legislative procedure.\nThe original House bill had been to repeal the \"Cadillac tax\" on high-cost insurance plans, which was part of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. It was introduced on Jan. 24, 2019, (not 2017, as the image in the post says) and easily passed the House on July 17, 2019, 419-6.\nThe bill never made it to a vote in the Senate, making the measure ripe for the picking when Senate leaders went looking for a House-passed measure where the CARES Act language could be swapped in. The bill that passed the Senate \"bears zero resemblance to the original bill,\" Koger said. And the introduction date signifies nothing about when the government knew of the coronavirus.\nThis same tactic was used in the subsequent coronavirus response bill that added more funding for small-business loans, said Donald R. Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\nThe process used to enact the CARES Act, Koger said, shows that \"the modern Congress often bears little resemblance to the \u2018How a Bill Becomes a Law\u2019 lessons\" people learn in school.\nOur ruling\nFacebook posts said the government must have planned the coronavirus pandemic because the coronavirus relief bill had been introduced three years earlier.\nThe introduction date cited in the post was off by two years, and the post is a misunderstanding of how the bill moved through Congress.\u00a0\nBecause of a constitutional requirement that tax-related bills originate in the House, the senators who drew up the CARES Act used a common workaround, stripping an existing House-passed bill of its old text and inserting the new text into it.\u00a0\nSo there\u2019s nothing fishy about a coronavirus relief bill having been introduced prior to the pandemic\u2019s emergence. The original text of the bill that eventually became the CARES Act was on an entirely different topic.\nWe rate the statement Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17016"}
