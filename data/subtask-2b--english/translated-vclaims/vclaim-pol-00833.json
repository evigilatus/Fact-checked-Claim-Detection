For example, Michael Flynn, former National Security Adviser in Trump, pleaded guilty to making deliberately false statements to the FBI. But Trump claimed that the FBI actually found his campaign assistant who didn't lie to clients. \"General Flynn, the man who had an incredible record in the army, did you see what happened to him,\" said Trump Fox News Sean Hannetti. \"The FBI said he wasn't lying, as I understand it, and if Mueller's group said he was lying, you know what he went through, and what many others went through.\" In the weak days of his presidency, Barack Obama responded on 29 December 2016 to Russia &apos; s intervention in the elections by expelling 35 Russian diplomats and issuing new sanctions. After Obama's move against Russia, Flynn spoke to Russian Ambassador Sergei Kiseljak. The Special Adviser has proven that Flynn has asked Kessljak to \"refrain the situation.\" Kiseljak later said that Russia had \"chosen to ease its response to those sanctions as a result of his request.\" The following day, Putin announced that he would not respond to the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration - a step that Trump commended later that day on Twitter: \"Great move on the delay (by V. Putin), Trape tweeted. \"I always knew he was so smart!\" The following month, Flynn, who was at this stage the National Security Adviser at Trump, spoke to FBI agents. At that time, according to the Special Adviser, Flynn falsely stated that he had never discussed Russian sanctions imposed by the Obama administration with Kiseljak. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to install security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021, but Flynn clearly didn't seem to be volatile or nervous when he lied to the FBI. The partially revised FBI memorandum - known as 302 - states that FBI agents said Flynn \"didn't give any signs of deception.\" During the sentencing phase of Michael Flynn, the Special Counsel reiterated the impression of agents. This appears to be the basis of Tramp &apos; s claim. But reading Tramp's selectivity makes the wrong impression. According to the lawyers of the Office of the Special Counsel, Flynn &apos; s seemingly unskilled behaviour did not change the fact that he was lying, which Flynn himself admitted. They wrote: \"These abuses do not change the fact - as the defendant admitted in the right-wing testimony before this district court - that he was already lying, and he knowingly made false statements to FBI agents in an investigation of national security.\" In addition to lying to his discussions with Kiseljak on the Obama sanctions, Flynn also admitted lying to FBI agents when he falsely told them that he had not discussed helping Russia delay or frustrate the vote on a United Nations Security Council resolution. Our verdict, Trump, told former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, \"The FBI said he wasn't lying.\" Trump takes the impression that FBI agents are completely out of context. The clients who met Flynn said about his contacts with the Russian ambassador before Trump became president that he did not seem to be lying - in the sense that he did not seem nervous or showed the usual qualities of deception. This is quite different from their factual conclusion: Flynn lied to them. Flynn has pleaded guilty to making false statements and is waiting to be sentenced. We're assessing this wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00833"}
