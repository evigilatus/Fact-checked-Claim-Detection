John Kasich says job training programs will be his seminal issue of 2012.\n\nBut as Ohio continues to push for new jobs and retaining the ones it has, a problem has emerged. Employers say Ohio has too few skilled workers, which in turn makes companies leery about moving their business here from outside the state.\n\nThe governor doesn\u2019t dispute that notion completely, but asserts that Ohio is trying.\n\nOhio currently has 77 workforce job training programs across 13 state agencies, Kasich said Jan. 10, 2012, in a boardroom interview with editors at The Plain Dealer. Kasich views that as a weak spot in the state\u2019s economic development plans and wants to reorganize the programs.\n\nPolitifact Ohio double-checked to see if the governor had his figures correct.\n\nAccording to the state, to be defined as a state workforce training program the service has to:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive state and/or federal resources to operate;\n\n\n\nHelp people identify, prepare or attain employment or assist and employer with training or retaining its workforce; and\n\n\n\nNot be a program used by a state agency to train its own staff.\n\n\n\nBy that criteria, \u00a0the state has exactly 77 workforce training programs, according to the Ohio Department of Development.\n\nThe programs are spread across 13 state entities:\n\nBoard or Regents \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Department of Aging\n\nDepartment of Alcohol and Addictive Services \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Department of Commerce \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDepartment of Development\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Department of Education\n\nDepartment of Health \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Department of Jobs and Family Services\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDepartment of Rehabilitation and Correction \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Rehabilitative Services Commission\n\nDepartment of Transportation \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Department of Veteran Services\n\nDepartment of Youth Services\n\nSome, for example, at the Board of Regents, are college scholarship programs but are considered workforce development because they assist students with pursuing education degrees in certain high need fields, like nursing, science or math.\n\nTo put the governor\u2019s thoughts in sharper focus, while Ohio has a wealth of workforce training programs, Kasich doesn\u2019t think much of the state\u2019s efforts or efficiency in linking participants in these programs to actual jobs.\n\n\"If you have 77 and 13 it means you have zero. That\u2019s how I add that up,\" Kasich told The Plain Dealer. \"Nobody knows what anyone\u2019s doing.\"\n\nThe point the governor is arguing is that the state does not have a strategic plan for how to address workforce training, instead it has a bunch of individual programs working in isolation. The administration is working to change that approach.\n\nOur point here is not to argue which job training approach is best, but rather to check the governor\u2019s claim that there are 77 programs spread through 13 agencies.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the governor\u2019s comment as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11703"}
