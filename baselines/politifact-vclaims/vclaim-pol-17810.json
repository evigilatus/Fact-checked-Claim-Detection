And maybe, and I\u2019m not saying you could, but you get 25 cents an hour more. People who are hourly workers are required to sign noncompete: \u2018I will not go anywhere to any business like the one I\u2019m in to get a raise.\u2019\"\nLine employees at McDonald\u2019s franchises don\u2019t command high wages, but Biden was wrong about the use of noncompete contracts.\u00a0\nFactcheck.org found several problems with this claim. Biden campaign spokesman Micheal Gwin said that Biden was making the larger point that low-wage workers face barriers to moving to better paid work.\u00a0\nMixing clauses: noncompete and no-poach\u00a0\nBiden said McDonald\u2019s workers sign employment contracts with language that blocks them for working for a competing fast food chain such as Burger King.\nThey don\u2019t. A noncompete agreement prevents someone from working for a competitor. That was not the case. Any McDonald\u2019s worker who quit to work at a Burger King is free to do that.\nThere was a time when they faced a different hurdle. They were blocked from moving from one McDonald\u2019s franchise to another McDonald\u2019s franchise. That is what economists have dubbed a no-poaching clause, and it applies only among franchises within the same chain.\nUntil 2017, that was part of the agreement between the local franchise owners and McDonald\u2019s Corp., the franchiser. The local owners could not lure workers away from each other.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

In March that year, McDonald\u2019s announced it would no longer enforce that part of its franchise agreement and would no longer include it in future agreements.\nFor other chains, the change took longer.\nIn January 2018, the Washington state attorney general\u2019s office began investigating the no-poach practice among a wide range of franchise companies. The investigation drew heavily on research by two Princeton University economists who found that 58% of franchise operations used this strategy and it likely kept wages down.\nBy July 2018, more chains had agreed to drop the practice, both in Washington state and nationally. The list included Arby\u2019s, Cinnabon, Buffalo Wild Wings and others.\nBurger King, Pizza Hut, Denny\u2019s and five other chains signed similar agreements by September 2018.\nIn the October of 2019, Washington\u2019s assistant attorney general told Congress that 155 corporate chains representing 160,000 locations nationwide had dropped the practice.\nThe International Franchise Association, a trade group, said in a statement that there\u2019s no question that the \"clear trend is the franchise business is moving away from the use of these no-poach contracts.\"\nThe Biden campaign said the situation with no-poach clauses has moved in the right direction, but it's hard to say that the practice no longer exists.\nOur ruling\nBiden said that McDonald\u2019s workers sign a noncompete agreement that bars them from taking a better paying job with a competing chain. Until three years ago, McDonald\u2019s did have a clause in its franchise agreements between the corporation and local owners that blocked them from hiring away staff from each other. McDonald\u2019s ended that practice in March 2017, and since then, over 150 national chains have followed suit.\nThat practice involves a no-poach clause, not a noncompete clause, which has to do with working for a competitor. McDonald\u2019s workers do not sign a noncompete agreement.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17810"}
