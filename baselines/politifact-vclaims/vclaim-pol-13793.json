Atkinson Ave. Holloway had been cited for 116 violations ranging from rodent and roach infestations to loose window trim and moldy walls, according to city officials and inspection records.\n\nSome of the violations have been fixed. According to a Dec. 2, 2010 Journal Sentinel article only 63 of the 116 violations were part of the case sent to court. And inspection notes indicated some of the remaining 63 already had been addressed.\n\nThe violations date back to 2009, and have been subject to monthly re-inspections -- many at a cost of $350 per visit. His problems with code violations stretch back years, according to city records and news reports.\n\nIn his swearing-in speech, Holloway didn\u2019t say much about his violations, but took this unscripted swipe at City Hall: \"We know that the city uses the building inspection area as a revenue base.\"\n\nIs Holloway right on that point? Is the city raking in building inspection fees to help balance the budget?\n\nWe called Holloway spokesman Harold Mester to ask what the acting executive -- and candidate for the full-time job in the April election -- was basing his statement on.\n\nMester responded that Holloway might talk -- if we first made some calls. He said we should contact Crown Hardware, Door City and Home Depot and find out what their customers said about building inspection fees.\n\nWe tried, but the responses led to unlisted phone numbers and shrugs as to why Holloway wanted a reporter to contact the business.\n\nMester then told us Holloway was not willing to discuss his comments further.\n\nHe did tell us Holloway received advice and data about the city\u2019s building inspection department from another landlord -- and occasional political foe -- Orville Seymer, a founder of the Citizens for Responsible Government.\n\nAfter hearing about Holloway\u2019s latest court date last month, Seymer said he called Holloway and \"invited myself\" to meet Holloway at the apartments for a visit from city inspectors.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think that Lee Holloway is the problem here,\" said Seymer. \"I think it\u2019s the Department of Neighborhood Services. They\u2019re out to get Holloway and they\u2019re out to get landlords in general.\"\n\nSeymer said he shared with Holloway budget data that he has collected that he argues shows building inspectors are padding city coffers.\n\nHe prepared a spreadsheet showing the growth in recent years in \"special charges\" on the city tax rolls -- money added to property tax bills that is owed to the city for services provided.\n\nThose numbers are growing, according to the city. Those \"special charges\" were $6.9 million in 2010, compared with $4 million in 2006. \u00a0\n\nBut those charges take in much more than building inspection fees. They also include boarded-up buildings, abandoned cars, litter and snow and ice removal.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, city officials say the increases have come as a tidal wave of foreclosed properties have hit the city -- and as the city has taken numerous steps to keep those buildings from falling into disrepair. Last year there were 6,427 foreclosures in Milwaukee County, and the vast majority of those were in the city of Milwaukee.\n\nFor instance: Records show that last year the city had nearly four times as many properties that needed boarding up and spent about twice as much on litter removal compared with five years ago.\n\nSo, what about the fees Holloway is being charged to cover inspections of his properties?\n\nIn 2010, the city collected about $4 million in fees for re-inspections of 5,939 properties. That compares with $2.53 million for 6,091 properties in 2006.\n\nThe amount taken in was up, officials said, because the city increased re-inspection fees for property owners who received repeated visits. The fees increase from $50 to $350 for the fourth visit -- viewed as an added incentive for landlords to make repairs in a timely fashion.\n\nCity Budget Director Mark Nicolini said the fees help fund the operation of the city\u2019s Department of Neighborhood Services. That department had a $14 million budget for 2010, with that amount being paid by various fees generated by department services.\n\nUnder state law, the city cannot use fees to cover anything more than the service provided.\n\n\"These aren\u2019t additional revenues,\" said Nicolini. \"We can\u2019t use them to go fund garbage collection.\"\n\nPatrick Curley, chief of staff to Mayor Tom Barrett, was even stronger on this point.\n\n\"Mr. Holloway does not have the facts on the city budget,\" Curley said. \"Mr. Holloway is dead wrong.\"\n\nOK, we\u2019ve finished our inspection of Holloway\u2019s building inspection statement. No charge.\n\nHolloway, who is due in court Jan. 27, 2011, for the building inspection fees, said the city is using such charges to balance its budget. The city has had more re-inspections and other unpaid charges in recent years. But there\u2019s no evidence that the city uses them as a revenue source or to otherwise pad the budget -- indeed, it\u2019s against state law to use fees for anything beyond paying for the service provided.\n\nWe\u2019ll add this to that summation: False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13793"}
