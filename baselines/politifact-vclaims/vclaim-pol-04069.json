Moreover, the goal of the ad and its methods have been widely criticized, so we\u2019ll examine the relationship between Trump and Jolly.\nThe evidence linking Trump and Jolly\u2019s stances on abortion is hard to pinpoint, given the fact both have talked about abortion in different ways. What\u2019s not hard to pinpoint is the relationship between Trump and Jolly, which just doesn\u2019t exist. Jolly has never met Trump, nor is he supporting him for president.\nTrump and Jolly on abortion\nTrump and Jolly are are on the same side of the abortion spectrum, but their views are hard to lump together as one and the same.\nJolly\u2019s campaign told PolitiFact Florida he calls himself pro-life, but has never supported or voted to outlaw abortion entirely.\nAt the congressional debate on Sept. 19, Jolly was asked if it's right for a woman to abort her baby if she finds out she has Zika in the early stages of pregnancy.\nJolly responded: \"I think that is her choice, but for the health of the mother or the health of the baby, or the life of the mother, I think there should be exceptions permitted to terminate the pregnancy. Yes, I do.\"\nThere are other exceptions Jolly embraces, too, including instances of rape or incest.\nJolly may say he doesn\u2019t support outlawing abortion, but what does his voting record say?\nThe DCCC points to the \"Life at Conception Act\" (H.R. 1091) that Jolly co-sponsored in 2014. This act would give a fetus the same rights as a human beings from the moment of fertilization.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRick Scott\n\n\nstated on June 8, 2010 in a campaign mail piece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bill McCollum holds the same position on (embryonic stem cell research) as Barack Obama.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 June 11, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is clearly an anti-abortion\u00a0rights bill, but as PolitiFact concluded in 2014, there\u2019s a lot of murkiness that courts would have to sort through before it would be clear if abortion would be outlawed.\nWhether or not Trump wants to outlaw abortion is hard to determine.\nIn March, Trump stated women should be punished for having an abortion. (You can read the whole remark in context here.) But he backed off saying women should specifically be punished to stating general opposition to abortion. \u00a0\n\"If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,\" the Trump statement says. \"The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed \u2014\u00a0like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.\"\nRecently at the third presidential debate, Trump was asked if he wants the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, which would essentially dissolve a woman\u2019s right to abortions. \u00a0\nTrump said: \"Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.\"\nJolly does not support Trump\nThis ad has been highly criticized for its bogus images showing Trump and Jolly photoshopped together. Like the claim, the ad attempts to paint Trump and Jolly as one in the same \u2014 and allies if both Jolly and Trump win.\nThis association is not accurate.\nAt the congressional debate, Jolly said he doesn\u2019t support Trump and told the Tampa Bay Times he\u00a0never met him. Jolly\u2019s spokesperson reiterated that point to PolitiFact Florida on Oct. 20 and said Jolly will not be supporting Trump in this election.\nJolly called on Trump to drop out of the presidential race in December after Trump called for a temporary ban on Muslims. At the time of the press release, Jolly was running for Marco Rubio\u2019s seat in the U.S. Senate.\n\"While ISIS is beheading innocent people for their religious practices, Trump is betraying our freedoms,\" Jolly said in a statement. \"His brutal, bullying bigotry runs contrary to the very principles our forefathers fought so hard to defend. We are either a party of protecting the constitution and religious liberties or we're not. America should insist on a security test but never a religious test.\"\nOur ruling\nAn ad from the DCCC said, \"Just like Donald Trump, David Jolly wants to outlaw a woman's right to choose.\"\nTrump and Jolly both favor restrictions on abortion, but their views cannot be directly equated to outlawing all instances of abortion. Moreover, the claim, and the overall theme of the ad \u2014 that Jolly would be an ally to Trump \u2014 is highly misleading. Jolly does not support Trump.\nWe rate the DCCC\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04069"}
