In a recent ad in the Catholic Sentinel, the group tells readers that making a difference (i.e. donating) is \"free\" and \"easy.\"\n\n\"Announcing an amazing no-cost way to fight abortion,\" the ad says.\n\nWe love seeing \"free\" and \"no cost.\" Mostly in conjunction with sales, but also here because it\u2019s a tell-tale sign of a good fact check.\n\nThe ad urges people \"to use some of your taxes to help prevent abortion\" and says the group uses the money \"to help elect pro-life candidates in Oregon.\" According to the ad, individual Oregonians can make a $50 political donation ($100 for couples) to Oregon Right to Life and get a tax credit back in the very same amount. Amazing! But is it true?\n\nWe did some googling and found ourselves on the Oregon Department of Revenue\u2019s website. Lo and behold, there it was, under a list of possible tax credits: \"Political contributions.\"\n\n\"Oregon law allows a tax credit for political contributions,\" according to the site.\n\nIt makes sense, we suppose, why wouldn\u2019t politicians pass a tax break that has the potential to help them?\n\nHere are the details: Under Oregon tax law, an individual can donate up to $50 (again, $100 for a couple jointly filing) to a candidate or their principal campaign committee, a political action committee or a political party (national, state or local) and claim an equal credit on their return. Read more here.\n\nThe ruling is pretty evident; weird as it may seem, Oregon does allow you to make a small political contribution \u2018for free\u2019 by giving you a tax credit of up to $50. We rate this claim True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13893"}
