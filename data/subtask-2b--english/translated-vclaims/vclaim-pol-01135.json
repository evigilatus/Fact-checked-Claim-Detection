He also referred to a series of statistics that supported the issue of strengthening border security. \"I wonder if Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, will tell these families who lost loved ones that this is not actually real data, that this is a manufacturing crisis,\" Hanetti said. He noted that last year, \"17,000 people with criminal records were arrested in an attempt to cross the border.\" The format cited by Hannity is essentially correct. However, it is important to place his claim in a broader context, namely, that many of these persons have criminal records of previous attempts to enter the United States illegally, or other non-violent crimes. The majority of these people were trying to cross at legal entry points, so the Trump Wall wouldn't make a difference. The United States Customs and Border Protection data show that 17,000 persons with criminal records were arrested last year. This is out of a total of more than 566,000 persons arrested between ports of entry and stopped entering ports of entry and other enforcement actions, or 3 per cent. Border security officers can determine the criminal history of a non-United States person by checking their records on the CBP database of the indictment information. Those who record a hit on the system are considered \"foreign criminals.\" The Customs and Border Protection Office defines these persons as being convicted of an offence, whether in the United States or abroad - as long as a conviction in a foreign court also constitutes a crime under the United States Criminal Code. The current data cover fiscal year 2018, except for the last month of September. (The location of the Customs and Border Protection Office will not be renovated during the closure of the Government). Therefore, the final figure for 2018 is likely to be higher than the current figure of 17,000. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2021, Bill McCarthy frequently uses his platforms to draw attention to cases where illegal immigrants commit crimes against Americans. Therefore, it may be assumed that violent criminals who infiltrate across borders make up a large proportion of illegal immigrants. Some certainly fit that description. However, the vast majority of the 17,000 foreign criminals who committed crimes did not attempt to evade the border authorities. Instead, they were stopped after arriving at ports of entry. It should be noted that in these cases the border wall would have had no effect. The other 37 per cent of foreign criminals were arrested by the United States Border Patrol. Of this sub-group, perpetrators of violent crimes make up a small share. Approximately half of the convictions were due to previous attempts to enter the United States illegally. Among other so-called crimes, drug-related crimes and drug-induced driving were the following largest percentages. (The Central Bureau of Statistics only states that the word \"other\" includes any conviction not included in the above categories. Here are the breakdown of the types of crimes behind their previous convictions: \"17,000 persons with criminal records were arrested while trying to cross the border\" in 2018. In general, Hannetti's statistics include people with criminal backgrounds who stopped coming to the United States. It is important to note, however, that persons other than the United States who have violent criminal records make up a small proportion of this population, and that many of these persons were trying to enter the country through legal entry points. They didn't try to sneak across the border. We value this half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01135"}
