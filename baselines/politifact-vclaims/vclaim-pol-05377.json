He said the Republican National Committee offers debate tickets to the big donors for each presidential candidate and, as such, Trump supporters are shut out.\n\"As you know, Mr. Trump is self-financing his campaign, so we don\u2019t have any donors,\" Lewandowski said.\nSeconds later, Lewandowski added: \"We have only one donor to the campaign, so we can submit only one name. His name is Donald Trump, and he already has a spot on that stage, and he\u2019s always at the center of that stage because he\u2019s the front runner.\"\nLet\u2019s start by noting the RNC disputes Lewandowski\u2019s claim that debate tickets are reserved for the highest donors, saying each of the five campaigns participating in the South Carolina event - including Trump\u2019s - were given 107 passes to distribute as they pleased.\nThe subject of this fact-check is not debate tickets but Lewandowski\u2019s repeated claim that the billionaire Trump is the \"only\" contributor to his campaign. Trump often says he\u2019s \"self-financing\" his campaign, a statement our colleagues at PolitiFact National recently rated Half-True. Lewandowski\u2019s assertion that there are no outside donors to the campaign, however, takes Trump\u2019s claim to a new level and deserves a separate look.\nWe asked Trump\u2019s campaign for an explanation of Lewandowski\u2019s comments but did not get a response.\nContributions\nTrump\u2019s campaign brought in about $19.4 million by the end of 2015, according to the latest Federal Election Commission records. Trump put in $12.8 million of that himself. The remaining $6.6 million came from individual contributions, which federal law caps at $2,700 per candidate per election.\nTrump has invested far more of his personal money into his campaign than any other presidential contender. The only other candidates endowing their own campaigns are:\n\u2022Republican Jeb Bush, $388,720, or 1.2 percent of $31.9 million he raised;\n\u2022Democrat Hillary Clinton, $368,147, or 0.3 percent of the $115.6 million she raised; and\n\u2022Republican Ben Carson, $25,000, or 0.05 percent of the $54 million he raised.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump, by contrast, has put in 66 percent of the money his campaign has raised. But the remaining 34 percent, contrary to Lewandowski\u2019s claim, has come from donors.\nFEC rules require candidates to disclose the names of donors who have contributed an aggregate $200 or more to their campaigns. Through the end of 2015, Trump listed about 3,200 such patrons who donated a collective $1.6 million.\nA far greater number of people made small donations to the campaign, but we can\u2019t tell you how many because these names and contributions are not itemized. What we do know is that Trump, at year\u2019s end, raised almost $5 million from people who sent in less than $200 apiece.\nAlthough a significant portion of his campaign fund comes from individuals, Trump doesn\u2019t appear to be actively soliciting these donations with high-profile fundraising events. The Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for transparency in money in politics, tracks political fundraisers with its Political Party Time tool. It has no record of any events to benefit Trump.\nIn contrast, Political Party Time has recorded more than 280 fundraisers for Clinton and more than 150 for Bush since the start of 2015.\nThere is, however, a \"donate\" button on Trump\u2019s website.\nLastly, any conversation about Trump\u2019s \"self-financed\" campaign also should include two caveats:\n\u2022Of the personal money he\u2019s put into his campaign, Trump lists $200,000 as a contribution and $12.6 million as loans. That means he may expect to recoup those funds.\n\u2022Trump ramped up his self-financing in the final quarter of 2015, when he made $10.8 million of his loans to his campaign.\nOur ruling\n\"Mr. Trump is self-financing his campaign, so we don\u2019t have any donors,\" Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, told a Virginia radio audience. Seconds later, he virtually repeated the claim.\nTrump is certainly his own greatest benefactor, having endowed his campaign with $12.8 million of the $19.4 million it raised through the end of last year - or 66 percent of its funds. Trump lists almost all of his investments in his campaign as a loan, not a donation, so he may be expecting to get some of his money back.\nIn any case, Lewandowski is flat-out wrong by insisting the campaign has no donors other than Trump. He ignores thousands of supporters who contributed $6.6 million through the end of last year, or 34 percent of the campaign\u2019s resources.\nSo we rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05377"}
