The leaders of both the city and the police said at the time they had no idea what the future president was talking about. That incident came to mind recently when the new mayor, Laurie Lightfoot, spoke during a cable interview about another spasm of violence during the anniversary weekend. In her remarks, Lightfoot sought to link the massacre with the difficulties she was expected to face in negotiating a new police contract with the Chicago Police Order, which represents thousands of rank and file officers. \"You know, there were rumors about -- and I didn't check it -- but rumors about they were telling their officers, \"don't do anything. During the commemorative weekend, do not interfere, Lightfoot said in Can-TV \"Chicago News Room.\" \"If you see some criminal activity, just lie down, do nothing. 'I hope that wasn't true because, man, if that happens, there will be an account.\" Lightfoot's got her reputation destroyed by law enforcement, so it's clear that she and Trump came from very different places when it came to fighting crime. However, the parallels between their inflammatory claims were likely. While we're not used to going into a claim that was a rumor, the proposal of the new mayor who told the union officers that the police didn't ask the police to take a closer look. We weren't alone in retracting the assurance that we didn't miss out. And a few moments later, Ken Davis, the host of the program, asked the mayor if she had bought the rumors. \"Do you have any reason to believe that it happened?\" Davis asked. Without a direct response, Lightfoot alleged that the former police union leadership had previously pressed for something similar. She said: \"On working day in 2016, when we had this catastrophic level of violence, the then (Federal) administration - and there were some transfers - published a note telling the officers that they should not come to work, that they should not do their job, and that they should not be the police.\" That overestimates the record. According to the Chicago Tribune story of August 2016, the union called on the officers not to accept requests for overtime during the weekend - but said nothing about the regular work of the officers, as proposed by Laytvut. On January 30, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers wrote in a blog entitled \"The assassination of Trump, the deep state in panic!\" by Sira Aurourke on February 4, 2021, and more than that, this example does not support the claim made by Lightfoot about the memorial weekend, which she admitted was not verified but she chose to repeat publicly, however. Like her predecessor, former Mayor Ram Emmanuel, Lightfoot chose to reinforce patrols in an attempt to stop the violence on the weekend, and assigned overtime to an additional 1,200 police officers. Its plan also includes the provision of free programming activities targeting young people and partnerships with religious leaders to assist in peacekeeping. One unfortunate comment on the chronic situation of violence in Chicago is that the magnitude of the shootings and deaths this weekend has changed little from that of recent years. At the same time, the absence of a surge in chaos goes beyond previous levels and argues about any effort by the Attorney General &apos; s Office to induce officers not to perform their functions. We followed up with Lightfoot's office to see if the mayor had confirmed what she said about the weekend of Memorial Day since her appearance on television. \"All we can say about this is that the mayor heard it from someone in a position to know and hear it from a law enforcement source,\" she told us about Anil Ruiz in a telephone interview. We also studied the claim of Lightfoot by Kevin Graham, the union leader, who said he didn't know what Lightfoot was talking about. He said, \"That's ridiculous.\" \"I don't know anyone who says no one to do his job.\" We checked with Ald. Chris Talaifero (29 years old), who chaired the City Council Committee on Public Safety and served as a police officer in Chicago for more than 20 years. He told us he didn't hear any rumors, much less confirmed information, for that purpose. The Governor Lightfoot stated in a cable interview that she heard a rumor about city police officials \"saying to their officers, \"Don't do anything. Over the weekend of Memorial Day, don't mediate. Although it was acknowledged that the allegation it shared had not been verified, it chose Laytvut as mayor to inflate it anyway. And when we followed up, the mayor's office didn't tell us who I heard without saying it came from a law enforcement person. We also consulted with the leader of the union and the senator of Chicago who chairs the city's public safety committee, and both said that they had no idea what she was referring to. Since the office of Lightfoot and our independent report were unable to verify the rumor presented by the mayor in the public address, we assess her false claim.
