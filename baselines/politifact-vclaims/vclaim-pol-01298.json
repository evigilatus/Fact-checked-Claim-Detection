Claire McCaskill has been a supporter of the Affordable Care Act, especially when it comes to protecting pre-existing conditions.\nHer opponent, Attorney General Josh Hawley, is part of a lawsuit that is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would take away mandatory coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Hawley says he\u2019s for protecting this coverage, just not through the current law.\nDuring their second debate, Hawley mentioned a bill on reinsurance as a way to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The measure is sponsored by Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Susan Collins, R-Maine.\nMcCaskill\u2019s rebuttal was quite clear:\n\"The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions. It has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions,\" she said.\nSo who is right?\nWe reached out to the McCaskill campaign for evidence, which pointed to a CNBC article. We decided to check out the bill for ourselves. \u00a0\nWhat the bill would do\nWhen Collins introduced the bill, she said it was \"a bill that would allow states to protect people with pre-existing conditions while lowering premiums through the use of these high-risk pools.\"\nBut the bill doesn\u2019t actually contain the words \"pre-existing conditions\" \u2014 more on that in a second.\nThe bill\u2019s actual name is the Lower Premiums Through Reinsurance Act of 2017. It\u2019s intended to \"reinsure\" insurance companies for taking on high-risk individuals. The bill would allow states to design their own reinsurance programs, which would then allow them to be eligible for federal funding.\nThe bill would allocate $4.5 billion over two years, and states could use the federal funding to provide the reinsurance in a way that is up to them.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt issue is the role of high-risk pools. That\u2019s where people who have high premiums would be grouped, regardless of whether they have pre-existing conditions.\nThe phrase \"pre-existing conditions\" doesn\u2019t show up anywhere in the bill. Instead the bill uses \"high-risk\" as a qualifier for funding.\nExperts in health care whom we reached disagreed with McCaskill that pre-existing conditions would have nothing to do with the bill.\nAnup Malani, professor of law and medicine at the University of Chicago, said that many pre-existing conditions would qualify as a high-risk of using medical care.\nAlan B. Cohen, research professor at Boston University, believes there is no straight-forward answer, as reinsurance programs just shift the risk from one entity to another.\nCohen brought up an interesting point that the bill does not mention in the definition of \"high-risk\" individuals. \"It is plausible that a state could define high-risk individuals as those with pre-existing medical conditions, but there is no guarantee that will be the case.\"\nStates would be in charge of making their own definitions of high-risk pools, and deciding whether to guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions through this bill.\nSo although the Collins referenced pre-existing conditions when speaking on the bill, there is no guarantee that states will be able to protect everyone with a pre-existing condition. Also, this approach relies on adequate funding. States have tried high-risk pools before and they often fell short because they didn\u2019t have enough money.\nThe bill is an incentive for states to reinsure insurance companies to cover individuals who are high-risk. If the government covers the costs of high risk people, then insurance companies could keep low-risk individuals\u2019 rates low, so the logic goes.\nOur ruling\nMcCaskill said, \"The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions. It has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions.\"\nThe bill would help insurance companies cover individuals who are high-risk, which is a category that many pre-existing conditions fall into. While the bill allows the states to make their own decisions -- meaning there\u2019s no guarantee that pre-existing conditions will be protected across the board -- it is an exaggeration to say it has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-11-05 19:42:31 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions.
