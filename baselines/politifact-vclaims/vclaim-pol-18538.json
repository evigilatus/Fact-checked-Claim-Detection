Michigan just refused to certify the election results.\" Trump said in a Nov. 17 tweet. \"Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!\"\nHe was wrong. Michigan didn\u2019t refuse to certify its election results. In fact, the Board of State Canvassers, which is tasked with certifying the results, has not yet met to do so. The meeting is scheduled for Nov. 23.\nTrump appeared to have confused the state board with the Board of Canvassers in Wayne County, the state\u2019s largest. On Nov. 17, the four-member county board briefly deadlocked when its two Republican members initially voted against certifying the results. They later joined their Democratic colleagues to unanimously certify the results.\nWhat happened at the Wayne County Board of Canvassers Meeting\nThe Wayne County board met Nov. 17 to consider the election results for the county\u2019s 43 jurisdictions, which include Detroit.\nThe Republican members of the board \u2014 chairperson Monica Palmer and William Hartmann \u2014 initially voted against certifying the county\u2019s results, pointing to discrepancies in some Detroit precincts and absent-voter counting boards between the number of ballots recorded as cast and the number of ballots counted. Precincts with such discrepancies are considered \"out of balance,\" unless the gaps are accounted for and explained in polling records.\nOf Detroit's 503 Election Day precincts, 85 were out of balance, as were 94 of the city's 134 absent-voter counting boards. Most of them recorded discrepancies of three votes or fewer; 10 Election Day precincts and 43 counting boards had larger discrepancies.\nThe discrepancies amounted to roughly 400 votes, out of the roughly 250,000 votes cast in Detroit, according to unofficial election results.\nDuring the meeting, Palmer said she would be open to certifying the election results for jurisdictions outside Detroit, even though some of them also had precincts that were out of balance.\nThe Republican votes drew a strong public outcry. Commenters weighing in on the Zoom call accused the the two Republicans of racism for suggesting excluding votes from Detroit, the state\u2019s largest city, which is nearly 80% Black.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

The court has not ruled on the case yet. The lawsuit largely bases its claims on hundreds of affidavits filed by Republican election challengers present at TCF Center, where Detroit election workers counted absentee ballots cast by the city\u2019s voters.\nClaims of election fraud in Detroit have so far been rejected in court.\nSteven Liedel, a Lansing attorney specializing in state constitutional law, said state board members are obligated to certify the statewide results. \"They have taken an oath to uphold the U.S. and Michigan Constitution, and they have a clear legal duty to certify the results if they have results presented to them,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nTrump claimed that Michigan \"refused to certify the election results.\" That\u2019s not true.\nThe State Board of Canvassers that certifies the statewide results has not met yet. The board is scheduled to meet Nov. 23 to vote on certification.\nIn Wayne County, two Republican members of the county canvassing board initially voted against certifying the results but later changed their votes.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim False.\u00a0\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18538"}
