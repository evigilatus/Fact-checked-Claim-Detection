If you were a Muslim, you could come in, if you were a Christian, it was impossible.\"\nThis is a claim we heard from Trump during the 2016 election, and it\u2019s inaccurate. Christians make up a very small fraction of Syrians admitted under the refugee program, but they have been able to enter the United States. There is no evidence that this is an outcome of discriminatory policy.\u00a0Refugee admissions skew in favor of Christians in other countries.\nAdmissions numbers\nFrom Jan. 1, 2012 (the year the first Syrian refugees began arriving) to Jan. 29, 2017, the United States admitted 19,324 refugees from Syria.\nAccording to federal data, this included 19,025 Muslims and 199 Christians. (Another 86 belonged to other religions or no religion at all.)\nSo, right off the bat, Trump is wrong that it was \"impossible\" to enter the United States as a Christian. \u00a0\nChristians do make up a small fraction of refugee admissions compared with their makeup in the overall population of Syria. (We\u2019ll explain why that may be later.) But they did come in; it was not \"impossible,\" as Trump said.\nMuslims made up about 98 percent of Syrian refugees, compared with about 87 percent of Syria\u2019s population, as of Jan. 12, 2017, according to the CIA World Factbook. Christians, meanwhile, were 10 percent of the population but just 1 percent of refugees. (The Pew Research Center meanwhile says about 5 percent of Syrians are Christians.)\nThis pattern, however, doesn\u2019t exist for the other countries targeted by Trump\u2019s ban. In some cases, the reverse is true: The proportion of Christian\u00a0refugee admissions are greater than the proportion of Christians living the country.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of refugee admissions by country and religion in the time frame (Jan. 1, 2012 to Jan. 29, 2017):\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nChristian refugees\n\n\nChristian population\n\n\nMuslim refugees\n\n\nMuslim population\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyria\n\n\n1%\n\n\n10%\n\n\n98%\n\n\n87%\n\n\n\n\nIran\n\n\n49%\n\n\n0.9%*\n\n\n9%\n\n\n99%*\n\n\n\n\nIraq\n\n\n26%\n\n\n0.8%\n\n\n71%\n\n\n99%\n\n\n\n\nSudan\n\n\n13%\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5%*\n\n\n79%\n\n\n91%*\n\n\n\n\nSomalia\n\n\n0.2%\n\n\n0.2%*\n\n\n99.8%\n\n\n99.8%*\n\n\n\n\nLibya\n\n\n0%**\n\n\n2.7%\n\n\n100%**\n\n\n97%\n\n\n\n\nYemen\n\n\n27%\n\n\n0.2%*\n\n\n60%\n\n\n99.1%*\n\n\n\n\n*These figures come from the Pew Research Center\u2019s 2015 Religion and Public Life Project, given incomplete data from the CIA World Fact Book.\n**The United States has accepted a total of 10 Libyan refugees from Jan. 1, 2012 to Jan. 29, 2017.\n\u00a0\nExperts say no evidence of religious discrimination\nWhen we looked into Trump\u2019s claim in July 2015, all the experts we spoke with said Trump\u2019s accusation is off base. A year and half later, there\u2019s still no evidence that Christians have a higher bar to clear for entry.\nDavid Martin, an immigration law expert at the University of Virginia who previously held posts at the Departments of State, Justice and Homeland Security, acknowledged that Christian Syrians make up a smaller number of admissions than they do the overall population.\nBut he said, \"there are many possible explanations and this certainly doesn\u2019t reflect a general hostility to Christians.\"\nOne possible explanation for the few number of Christian Syrians admitted, the Washington Post\u2019s Fact-Checker reported, is an initial religious disparity at the United Nations\u2019 refugee programs. (The long vetting process for refugees seeking entry to the United States begins with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee.)\nThe UNHCR reports that 1.5 percent of the nearly 5 million Syrian refugees it has registered are Christian. Agency spokespeople have warned against speculation but suggested this may be because Syrian Christians have the means to move without seeking assistance from the United Nations.\nIn October 2015, then-U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and current U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres offered a few other theories.\nChristians in Syria \"have been less systematically victimized than they were in Iraq,\" he said. \"Most of the Syrian Christians have moved to Lebanon. And in Lebanon, the first thing that happened to me when I met with the Lebanese president ... when I asked him to start a resettlement program from Lebanon, (he said), don\u2019t resettle Christians because they are vital for us.\"\nAnn Richard, then-assistant secretary of state for population refugees and migration, suggested in a congressional hearing in December 2015 that Christian Syrians aren\u2019t looking to move out of the country.\n\"A disproportionate number of Syrians staying in the country are Christian. Now why is this? It\u2019s because a higher percentage of them support Assad and feel safer with him there,\" she said (around 2:23:50 mark).\nRegardless of the disparity in Syria, experts did not agree with Trump\u2019s suggestion that Christians face additional hurdles.\n\"The U.S. government does not discriminate on the basis of religion in refugee admission or resettlement, and if you look at refugee admissions by religion over the past 10 years, rather than just at the Syrian refugees in the past few years, there are likely more Christians than Muslims,\" Karen Jacobsen, a professor at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy, told us previously.\nMartin pointed out that since 2004, Christians have made up about 46 percent of refugee admissions from Iraq. That\u2019s disportionate to the country\u2019s total Christian population by a factor of about 58.\nGeoffrey Mock, a Middle East specialist for Amnesty International USA, said Amnesty has documented a myriad of human rights violations in the refugee resettlement process, but not religious discrimination \"because we haven\u2019t see any of it from the U.S. side.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"If you were a Muslim, you could come in, if you were a Christian, it was impossible.\"\nHundreds of Syrian Christians have entered the United States through the refugee admissions program. Thousands more Christians from other countries targeted by Trump\u2019s ban have also entered.\nDuring former President Barack Obama's tenure, there was no formal policy that discriminated against Christians. People who watch the refugee process closely said there was no actual discrimination against Christians, either.\nWith nothing to support this claim, we rate it False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e1da0489-11fc-4450-bf0d-6d8317cfd7a4", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03744"}
