This long-awaited announcement was met with a surge of attacks from potential opponents in the conservative race, including the former Chief Executive of Chicago Public Schools, Paul Vallas. Mendoza criticized her for calling her opposition to increasing the prices of car posters in 2011 during her term as a writer for the city of Chicago as part of her campaign. \"Susana Mendoza's assertion that she fought Ram Emmanuel's efforts to radically raise the prices of city posters is ridiculous,\" said Vallas in a statement sent by his campaign. \"As the stories of the news earlier this year by WBEZ and ProPublica are painful, Mendoza pushed the hard city poster punishment program that led to the financial devastation of thousands of families most in need in Chicago.\" His press release was linked to a July story by ProPublica Illinois and WBEZ, in which Mendoza regretted supporting the increased cost of violations of city posters, a policy revealed by ProPublica and WBEZ, which caused painful financial losses to thousands of the poorest people of Chicago, particularly African Americans. However, as clearly as it was documented, Mendoza openly opposed the increase in poster prices proposed by Emmanuel in his first budget as Mayor. It seemed like Vallas was mixing these two pieces of political mystery. We therefore asked for clarification. \"I think it's a very clear statement,\" said Vallas in a telephone interview. \"I knew what I meant and what I meant was that these harsh fines were bankruptcy of families. I gave a specific example of what Mendoza did was so terrible and what the effect was.\" After several hours, a spokesman followed Vallas to explain the statement that his candidate described as \"very clear\" and needed some clarification. John Holden said: \"There has been an unintended change of speech,\" explaining that the original project called for Mendoza's ridiculous assertion that she fought Emmanuel over the poster policy rather than specifically the poster prices. However, this was not discriminatory and Vallas tried to draw it when he discussed the matter with Politi Fruitte. While acknowledging the lack of clarity in the initial statement by the name of Vallas, Holden said that the campaign did not plan to issue a corrigendum. On March 5, 2019, Lori Lightfoot stated in tweet that the proportion of officers expelled by the Chicago Police Board after hearing their cases or who chose to resign before a hearing by the Council almost doubled during her tenure. \u2022 On 10 March 2019, it remains worth mentioning that while the Vallas public statement attempts to select the part of Mendoza's poster record that he throws in the worst light, Mendoza chose her own cherry when she referred to the poster being issued in the announcement of her campaign. In 2011, Emmanuel dominated the prices of posters, although he reformulated his plan in response to Mendoza's criticism, and chose to distribute a smaller increase among all drivers rather than dramatically picnic rates to large passenger vehicles alone. The city has also adopted some tightening of the penalties for sticker tickets that Mendoza had put in place as an alternative to increasing the prices of posters. It jumped from $120 to $200 in quotations for not getting a required car poster. In the announcement that Vallas had mocked him, Mendoza only highlighted her opposition to the rise in the prices of posters, while she did not mention the corresponding increase in the penalties that she supported. :: Procosta Illinois and WBEZ found that the debt from postage tickets had risen sharply and had been compounded by the delayed penalties and collection fees, with the number of drivers collectively increasing by $275 million owed to the city in exchange for tickets issued since 2012. We contacted Mendoza's campaign to hear how she reconciled with her actions in the city's poster policy. Rebecca Evans sent us a response, including a statement from the candidate. \"I said long before I announced my candidacy that the city must reconsider these sanctions and how they are enforced, which burden our low-income inhabitants,\" said Mendoza. \"As mayor, I plan to do so.\" Evans explained in detail the description of the comparison of the two issues with the \"false equation,\" saying that Mendoza's efforts to stop the rise in poster prices and how the city's revenue management imposed poster sanctions were separate issues. Our governor, Wallace, said, \"Mindoza's assertion that she fought Ram Emmanuel's efforts to radically raise the prices of city posters is ridiculous. It is true that Mendoza supported picnic tickets to violate the requirements of the city's posters during her tenure as a city writer, a policy that has burdened thousands of low-income people in Chicago financially. But outside the base, he questioned Mendoza's well-documented opposition to the increase in poster prices. We're partially evaluating his accurate statement half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01251"}
