John Cornyn says Americans rate getting back to work as national priority", "text": "U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, heartily welcomed Republican Scott Brown\u2019s upset win Tuesday of a Senate seat in Massachusetts \u2014 a victory that\u2019ll soon give the GOP the 41\u00a0Senate seats needed to filibuster legislation to foil\u00a0the Democratic majority.  Cornyn, who doubles as chairman of a political committee devoted to electing GOP senators, was asked by the Fox News Channel on Wednesday what Republicans should do with the message sent by Massachusetts voters.  Cornyn initially mentioned public concern about Democrats\u2019 closed-door rewrites of a health care overhaul. But, Cornyn continued, this \"is a matter also of misplaced priorities and the No. 1 issue that the American people care about is getting America back to work.\"  We wondered if Cornyn correctly pegged Americans' priority issue.  Indeed, a recent national poll places the economy at the top of voter concerns. In the poll taken Jan. 12-15 for The Washington Post and ABC News, 42 percent of respondents identified the economy as the most important problem they\u2019d like to see President Obama and Congress address this year.\u00a0 Among those economy-focused respondents, 26 percent singled out jobs/employment as a priority.  The second-highest-rated issue was health care, named as the first concern of 24 percent.  Similarly, a poll taken Jan. 10-14 by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News found jobs topping Americans\u2019 concerns. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said job creation and economic growth was the top priority. Thirteen percent chose national security/terrorism and 13 percent said the deficit and government spending.  So the senator got it right. Americans consider jobs the No. 1 issue right now. We rate Cornyn\u2019s statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15382"}
