And he\u2019s taken leave from his job as an ironworker, collecting more than $6 million in campaign contributions along the way.\nBut what about another Democrat running for the House \u2014 wealthy Dan Kohl, the nephew of multimillionaire and former 24-year U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl? He is seeking the east-central Wisconsin seat held by Republican Glenn Grothman.\nIn not one, not two, but three TV ads released Sept. 4, 2018, Dan Kohl declares: \"I'm not a politician.\"\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee actually said in ripping one of the ads that Kohl is correct in saying he\u2019s not a politician.
