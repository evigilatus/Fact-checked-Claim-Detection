Armond Budish says pending legislation would limit or eliminate 'time-and-a-half' overtime pay", "text": "Ohio House Democratic Leader Armond Budish has vowed to \"fight like hell\" against the plan to narrow public workers\u2019 collective bargaining rights, known as Senate Bill 5.\n\nBehind the tough talk is a strategy to enlist more than the union workers who have become the face of the SB 5 opposition. Budish and Democrats want all middle-class, working Ohioans to join the fight.\n\nBudish\u2019s message to recruits: Republicans are engaged in a full-scale war against the middle class. The Beachwood Democrat issued a warning in a letter to The Plain Dealer published March 17.\n\n\"For example, legislation pending in the House would effectively limit or eliminate \u2018time-and-a-half\u2019 for people who work overtime.\"\n\nBudish\u2019s claim piqued PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s interest because time-and-a-half has been a standard pay scale for overtime work for decades.\n\nThe legislation Budish referenced is House Bill 61, which two Republicans introduced in January. A House committee recommended the bill for approval earlier this month, although all Democrats on the committee voted against it. The bill has not been up for a full floor vote yet.\n\nThe pending legislation would allow certain workers to receive one hour of compensatory time \u2013 paid time off \u2013 rather than overtime wages for each hour worked exceeding 40 in a week.\n\nFederal and state labor laws require most employers pay time-and-a-half for overtime.\nHB 61 would allow workers to accumulate up to 240 hours of comp time. At the end of a year, employers would have to pay overtime wages for any unused comp time.\n\nThere are two key issues in Budish\u2019s claim.\n\u00a0\n\n\nDoes the bill allow employers to abuse their authority and force workers to take comp time instead of overtime wages?\n\n\n\nHow many Ohio workers would HB 61 affect?\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with the second issue.\n\nHB61 would cover private employers (with some exceptions) with annual gross sales between $150,000 and $500,000, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission.\n\nAbout 10,000 members of the Ohio chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business have self-reported gross receipts between $100,000 and $500,000, said Chris Ferruso, legislative director for the organization.\n\nBusinesses with sales above $500,000 already must comply with federal overtime laws.\n\n\"A lot of this is aimed at very small businesses,\" said Tony Seegers, director of Labor and Human Resources Policy for the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. \"It\u2019s not going to be a lot of employers, but it\u2019s going to be some of the smaller ones.\"\n\nThe Ohio Chamber of Commerce and the Ohio NFIB support HB 61.\n\nAs \u00a0for the first issue, HB 61 supporters note that workers would get to chose between comp time and overtime pay. The bill says employers cannot require workers to take comp time. And workers are supposed to initiate the exchange for comp time. The bill also bars employers from threatening, intimidating or firing workers who want overtime wages.\n\nColumbus attorney Fred Gittes called the voluntary nature of the bill \"a charade.\"\nGittes\u2019 argument speaks to the core of Budish\u2019s claim that the bill \"would effectively limit or eliminate\" time-and-a-half pay for overtime work.\n\nGittes argues that employers could force their workers to take comp time instead of overtime because the bill lacks teeth to discourage the from doing so. He testified against the bill on behalf of the Ohio Employment Lawyers Association.\n\nEmployers would have a financial motivation to press workers to take comp time. Comp time would be awarded on a one-to-one ratio for extra hours worked. An employee who worked two extra hours, for example, would get two hours of comp time. That\u2019s a cheaper arrangement than paying time-and-a-half for each overtime hour worked.\n\nGittes argues that the penalties are too weak for employers who break the rules.\n\nThe bill has no provisions to help a worker get his job back or to recover lost wages. Instead, employers who force workers to take comp time would be fined double the worker\u2019s hourly wage for the number of comp time hours involved in the violation, plus attorney fees and court costs.\n\nFederal overtime laws include employer penalties that allow a worker to regain their job and wages lost from the time of their firing. Gittes said he has discussed with the bill\u2019s sponsors the inclusion of such language, but it has not been added.\n\nThe monetary difference resulting from stiffer penalties could be vast.\n\nTake, for example, the case of a worker with a $10 per hour wage who was fired for refusing to accept 200 hours in comp time.\n\nIf the worker prevailed in court, under HB 61, he would be awarded about $4,000.\n\nIf the same worker won a lawsuit under federal labor laws, he could win his job back and wages covering those that were lost from the point of termination.\n\n\"What employer will continue to pay time-and-a-half for each hour of overtime if they can effectively force employees to agree to take comp time at their normal rate of pay?\" Gittes said in his testimony to the House Small Business and Economic Development Committee.\n\nSo where does Budish\u2019s claim rate on the Truth-O-Meter?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBudish is correct that the bill would provide a means to limit time-and-a-half pay. And while Gittes\u2019 conclusion is tinged with cynicism, unscrupulous businesses do exist. But voluntary choices made by employees also could limit time-and-a-half.\n\n\n\nBudish\u2019s statement simply describes the affected group as people who work overtime, but the changes in HB 61 would only have an impact on smaller businesses. That\u2019s information that provides clarification.\n\n\n\n\nWe rate Budish\u2019s statement as Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13367"}
