It then lists several taxes it says the Obama plan will increase.\n\n\nHere we're checking the claim that \"they've even proposed a tax for not having health insurance.\"\n\n\nThe ad then flashes to video of Obama and George Stephanopoulos arguing over the meaning of the word tax on\n\nThis Week with George Stephanopoulos\n\n, with Stephanopolous reading the dictionary definition. Obama said the measure is necessary to make sure that everyone takes responsibility for having health insurance. He also said that a tax penalty is not the same thing as raising people's taxes.\n\n\nThe tax in the Democrats' bills won't affect anyone who has insurance. But if health care reform passes, it will be an issue for those who don't have insurance.\n\n\nThe tax is the mechanism that Democrats want to use to prod people to get health coverage. If they fail to get insurance, they would have to pay it.\n\n\nWe've studied the health reform proposals being considered in Congress right now, and the main Democratic versions propose a tax penalty on people who don't carry health insurance. Policymakers usually call this provision the \"individual mandate.\"\n\n\nAmong Democrats, there is much consensus that an individual mandate is needed to make sure everyone is covered, especially when coupled with other measures to make affordable coverage more widely available.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObama opposed the individual mandate when he was a candidate, but he has since\n\nchanged his mind\n\nand now supports it, as long as it contains a hardship exemption for individuals who are truly unable to find affordable coverage.\n\n\nThe proposals in Congress each handle the individual mandate differently.\n\n\nIn the bills in the House of Representatives, a person who failed to get coverage would face a penalty of 2.5 percent of their modified adjusted gross income up to the cost of basic health insurance, as defined by the new national health insurance exchange. The House grants exemptions for dependents, religious objections and financial hardship.\n\n\nIn the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee caps the penalty at $750. It exempts residents of states that don't establish health insurance exchanges, those for whom affordable coverage is not available, and those without coverage for fewer than 90 days.\n\n\nThe Senate Finance Comittee specifies a tax penalty of $950 for an individual and a maximum penalty of $1,900 per family. The penalties are a little lower if the person's income is below 300 percent of the poverty level. People are exempt from the mandate if they live below the poverty level, if the lowest cost insurance exceeds 10 percent of their income, or if there is financial hardship or religious objections.\n\n\nWe should note that the bills tend to leave the definitions of financial hardship up to other officials, such as the secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\n\nWe're going to duck, for now, the question asked by Stephanopolous, about whether Obama is breaking his promise on raising taxes. If health reform passes, then we'll evaluate the mandate with respect to our Obameter campaign\n\npromises database\n\n. Promise No. 515, \"No family making less than $250,000 will see 'any form of tax increase,'\" is currently rated\n\nCompromise\n\n.\n\n\nThe details for these mandates are very much a work in progress, and Congress will ultimately have to vote on one set of standards for the mandate. But all of the Democratic plans include the mandate, which is a tax penalty on those who don't have insurance. The RNC called it \"a tax for not having health insurance,\" and there's no doubt that it is a form of tax. There are provisions for those who face hardship, but absent special circumstances, everyone will have to have coverage. We rate the RNC's statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15558"}
