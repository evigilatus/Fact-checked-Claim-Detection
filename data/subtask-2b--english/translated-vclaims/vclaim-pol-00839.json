Recently, travelers looked at the conspiracy theory of the United States Republic of America, Adam Schiff, a democracy representing the 28th Congressional Region of California, and recently assumed the chairmanship of the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives. On March 21, Facebook showed a picture of Shiv with broad eyes and said: \"Adam Shiv used taxpayers' money to reach a sexual harassment settlement with a 19-year-old male. Retweet if you are sick of this shameful hypocrite that destroys our boss.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There's no evidence that Chef paid anyone for allegations of sexual harassment, let alone using taxpayers' money to do it. We found rumors all over Twitter, and on 9 December 2018 on Twitter in particular from QAnon's account conspiracy theory, which simply claimed that the information came from \"Congressian sources,\" tens of thousands of times were picked up and retweeted. It appears that rumours arose when Congress passed a bi-party bill requiring members to pay for their sexual misconduct settlements. To date, rumours have spread that they were found in a letter to the editor of the Washington Times on 13 December 2018. Nor did this account provide any sources of support for the allegation. The spokesman for Shiv told Bolivi Vakt that the conspiracy theory was completely wrong: \"This false stain arose four months ago at the expense of a plot against Kennon. It is clearly and categorically incorrect.\" On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021, a little back, we discovered a story about a supposed \"gay lover\" from Shiv on the junk news website TeNetSpies of February 2018. The site is full of questionable contents, and its \"on us\" page states that its content comes in \"a form of OP-ED dizzy, hard-nose investigative press, and a little laughter.\" The story claimed that she had an exclusive interview with the former assistant editor of the Los Angeles Times, Christina Belantone (who misread it in the name of Christina Belatori). In a supposed Skype interview, it was said that Pelantoni told the site that a man named Will Botum claimed to be in a relationship with Shiv. Nitsbes published a photo of the assaulted man, but the picture is actually Taj Paterson, the Brooklyn man who was beaten in 2013. Pelantoni got the wind of the story months later (in the near future rumors were spreading over Twitter) and called it a sham on Twitter. \"Thanks for letting you know. This is very false news, written by Pelantone. \"The Blue Line No. 1. A website that has never been heard of a story that does not exist.\" Thank you for letting you know. This is very false news. No. 1. A website where you have never heard of a story that does not exist at present. https://t.co/FMUSft3ilx - Christina Pilantoni (@cbellantoni) 18 December 2018 Despite the rapid spread of the rumour, no reliable news source picked up the story. The account can only be found in separate and non-exported social media bulletins, and in part in a junk news site using a fabricated interview and a false image. This conspiracy theory is on fire. 2019-03-27 18:47:33 UTC Politic Fact 1 1 7 PoliticFact Dating: Facebook bulletins on the Internet on Thursday, 21 March 2019 2019 - 03-21 Read more information", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00839"}
