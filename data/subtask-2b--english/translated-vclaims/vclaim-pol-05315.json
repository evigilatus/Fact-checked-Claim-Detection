Bernie Sanders and former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton, the presidential democratic debate was in Flint, Mich. Clinton, after showing how it would promote industrial jobs in America, in part by pursuing companies that aim to transfer production overseas, accused her of finding \"debt in this case, but a little too late.\" \"Minister Clinton supported almost every one of the catastrophic trade agreements written by American companies,\" said Sanders. \"Nafta, with the support of the Secretary, cost us 800,000 jobs across the country, tens of thousands of jobs in the Middle West.\" The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. Trade tariffs among the United States, Mexico and Canada have been significantly reduced. It is clear that Hillary Clinton didn't have a vote on the deal, but in 1996, during her husband's presidency, she said, \"I think Nafta is proving its value.\" Since then, she has said \"not delivered\" and should be reformed. Our focus is whether the business transaction caused the loss of 800,000 American jobs. The Sanders campaign refers to work by the Institute of Economic Policy, a research team that receives about a quarter of its funding from unions. A 2014 Group report found that the United States trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17 billion (billions of dollars) to $177.2 billion from 1993 to 2013, resulting in the displacement of 851,700 jobs in the United States. All the net jobs removed were due to the growing trade deficit with Mexico.\" The author of that study, Robert Scott, said that he went to industry by industry and about the trade deficit and surpluses to an estimated number of jobs. As the United States has a trade deficit with Mexico, it has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs to Mexico. However, other analyses suggest that the effects were much less dramatic. It helped us raise $15,000 to hide some of the things from the congressional research circle, the non-partisan political arm of Congress, which summarized a number of studies on the legacy of the North American Free Trade Agreement. That report said that it was difficult to trigger the effects of the trade transaction per se. Factors such as economic growth, inflation and exchange rate changes obscure water. However, the report struck a record tone. On January 13, 2021, in a story, General David Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of Marines for security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, the report said, \"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has not caused massive job losses that are feared by critics or the huge economic gains that supporters expect.\" \"The overall net impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement on the United States economy appears to have been relatively modest.\" A similar review published by the International Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reached the same conclusion. \"The net effect of employment was relatively small, although there were adjustments across sectors that displaced workers,\" the report said. In other words, employment opportunities in some industries, such as cars and electronics, may have suffered, but the impact on jobs has generally been nominal. The economist Martin Bailey at the Brookings Institution said that Sanders' number \"seems to be high,\" and noted that it was possible that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) did not cost the country any job. In 2014, a couple of researchers, Lorenzo Kalendu at Yale University and Fernando Barrow at the Federal Reserve, dug up to study not only the exchanges between the United States, Mexico and Canada, but also how the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) affected trade worldwide. In its model, if industry exports more at a higher real price, then winning, or using its terms, has a positive effect on welfare. With this criterion, NAFTA made more gains to Mexico than the United States, but the two countries were slightly better off. China &apos; s economies are highly complex systems and economists can draw different conclusions based on the factors they consider and the assumptions they make. Part of what makes the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) legacy difficult to assess is that in the last year of its presidency, Bill Clinton signed legislation granting China permanent normal trade relations. Since 2000, this has had a tremendous impact on trade between the two countries. This overlaps with about half of the period during which analysts attempted to measure the impact of NAFTA. A 2014 Federal Reserve Board report linked this change to significant job losses in the United States. Authors wrote \"Reduction of overall employment growth by -19.5 percentage points from 1997 to 2007 versus the previous decade.\" The impact on productive workers has been almost twice as high on non-productive workers, but for both groups, legislation has reduced job growth. Our rule, Sanders, said that the North American Free Trade Agreement, supported by Clinton, cost the American economy 800,000 jobs. There is a report from the leftist policy group that came to that conclusion. On the other hand, many other non-partisan reports found that the business transaction did not result in significant job losses or job gains. This is the result of competing economic models and the challenges of removing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) from all that has happened in the economy. The report cited by Sanders is an anomaly, and its use of its findings ignores important facts that give a different impression. We're mostly assessing his statement wrong.
