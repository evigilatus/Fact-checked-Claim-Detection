Renachi discussed the need to tighten the belt in a video published on YouTube on March 29, entitled \"Congressman Renachi undertakes financial responsibility.\" \"The United States is currently over $14 trillion in red, meaning that our debt is now roughly equal to the size of our entire economy,\" says Renachi in the video. \"To put it in context, every child born today inherits $45,000 of the national debt before taking his first breath.\" Therefore, Politi Fukte decided to verify Renachi &apos; s claim. According to the United States Department of the Treasury, the total outstanding public debt to the State currently stands at $14.3 trillion, an increase from $14.2 trillion on the day that Renachi filed his claim. He is right that the national debt exceeds $14 trillion. The United States Bureau of Economic Statistics estimates the country &apos; s gross domestic product (GDP) at $15 trillion in the first quarter of 2011, a figure that only slightly exceeds the State &apos; s debt. So Renachi is also right that the national debt is roughly equal to the size of the entire economy. To determine the share of the national debt to be allocated to each American, we have divided the national debt of $14.3 trillion from the current 2010 census figure of $308.7 million in the United States. This number amounts to $46,323.29 per person, a figure slightly higher than that of Renachi. Sherwood Brown mentioned on November 30, 2010, in an interview with MSNBC \"I understand, this is unemployment insurance. It's not welfare, as many of my Republican colleagues say. You pay for it when you work. You get help when you're not.\" On the basis of the information that has reached this point, we decided to correct this statement when we originally published this item in May 2011. Since then, many politicians have made similar statements, leading to further verification of the facts by our Politi Vac partners. Polyte Fact Texas added an additional dimension to the issue by exploring what constitutes national debt, and dividing it into parts. We will borrow from the explanation given by Polyte Factic Texas to explain: internal government debt refers to funds owed by agencies within the government to other agencies -- mainly an internal accounting case. Example: social security surpluses used by the Government in other federal operations. These funds will have to be repaid, as assumed, but demand is now less urgent and does not affect credit markets. On the contrary, public debt reflects money borrowed from external sources -- giving it more relevance to the economy, Josh Gordon, analyst with the Concord Disability Alliance, said Politi Fact Texas. \"If your problem with national debt is that you think it affects the economy or interest rates or something, the only part of the national debt that affects the economy is public debt. This is where the Treasury (United States) borrows money on the open market.\" So where does that leave us? Renachi's statement is accurate. The total debt that existed at the time of the statement, which was divided by the population at that time, supports its number. But today we know that public debt is what the Government already owes to those who have lent money, a little less than total debt. This is important information that puts Renachi &apos; s claim in perspective, and the O-Meter Fact Sheet, which often makes the statement valid.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13145"}
