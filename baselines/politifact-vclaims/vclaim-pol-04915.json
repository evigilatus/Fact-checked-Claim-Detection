He continued, \"This is Hillary Clinton's agenda, too, to release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released.\"\nWe think most observers would agree that releasing every\u00a0violent criminal in American prisons would amount to\u00a0political suicide, not to mention\u00a0bad policy. But we thought it was worth checking Clinton's actual policy prescriptions.\nWhat Trump said is far off-base. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)\nExisting criminal-justice reform efforts\nTrump said Clinton wants to continue Obama\u2019s release of \"thousands of dangerous drug trafficking felons and gang members.\" But Trump overreaches both on the substance of the policy and on Obama\u2019s personal role in enacting it.\nIn recent years, liberals and conservatives have increasingly found common ground over criminal justice reform. Many on the left, center and right -- including the libertarian Koch brothers and the generally more liberal American Civil Liberties Union -- have come to agree that many tough-on-crime policies instituted between the 1970s and the 1990s were misguided. They argue that policies such as mandatory minimum sentences and tough prosecution of low-level drug offenders have led to overcrowded prisons and exacerbated racial injustices.\nObama has taken some steps to unwind these policies. Using his pardon powers, Obama has commuted the sentences of more than 200 inmates who had been convicted of drug crimes, though it\u2019s important to note -- as Trump does not -- that all of them have been considered nonviolent under Justice Department guidelines.\nIn addition, during Obama\u2019s tenure, the Justice Department has approved the release of 6,000 federal inmates, about two-thirds of them to halfway houses or home confinement and about one-third who are expected to be deported.\nUnlike the commutations, these releases were prompted not by Obama but by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent body. In unanimously approving the changes, the panel estimated that the reduced sentencing guidelines could eventually qualify 46,000 of roughly 100,000 drug offenders in federal prisons for early release, according to the Washington Post. (It does not affect the larger pool of offenders in state prisons.) And federal judges must approve all early releases.\nThough applicants for early release typically have a connection to drug trafficking, the releases are not intended to free drug-traffickers and gang members who have a record of violence, as Trump contends. Obama\u2019s then-Attorney General Eric Holder actually proposed excluding convicts who had used weapons or had significant criminal histories, but the commission put its trust in judges to weigh those factors on a case-by-case basis, the Post reported.\nThe commission submitted the proposal to Congress in April 2014, and Congress did nothing to stop the proposal from taking effect six months later.\nWhat Clinton supports\nClinton does support criminal justice reform, but we found no evidence that her plan includes the release of \"violent criminals,\" much less \"all\" of them.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor starters, we should note that the Sentencing Commission\u2019s action is now a done deal. Short of calling on the commission to reverse itself -- which the panel, being independent, could simply ignore -- or passing a law through Congress, there isn\u2019t really anything Clinton (or Trump) could easily do to stop the forthcoming early releases. And of course, federal judges, not the president, are the ones who must sign off on applications for early release.\nMore broadly, we looked at Clinton\u2019s stated proposals for criminal justice policy and found that she focused her initiatives only on \"nonviolent\" offenders. The Clinton campaign said Trump\u2019s comment is a misrepresentation of her views.\nOn the criminal justice reform page of her website, Clinton summarizes her key proposals as follows:\n\u2022 \"End the era of mass incarceration, reform mandatory minimum sentences, and end private prisons.\"\n\u2022 \"Encourage the use of smart strategies \u2014 like police body cameras \u2014 and end racial profiling to rebuild trust between law enforcement and communities.\"\n\u2022 \"Help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully re-enter society.\"\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Clinton focuses more on what happens before prison (such as sentencing of people not currently incarcerated) and after prison (especially reintegrating ex-convicts into society after they are released) than actually releasing current inmates.\n\"Clinton has not focused on early release,\" said John H. Laub, a professor in criminology and criminal justice at the University of Maryland.\nFor a politician, this is a canny omission, because it sidesteps difficult questions about who should be released early.\n\"There is little consensus about releasing violent criminals from prison before their terms end,\" said Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. \"Then there is the question of who is \u2018violent.\u2019 Someone who has a prior record for a violent crime but whose current charge is for a nonviolent crime. or only those with a current charge for violence?\"\nBut even if Clinton is sidestepping a thorny issue by remaining largely silent on which, if any, inmates deserve early release, that position does throw a wrench into Trump\u2019s accusation that it\u2019s her stated \"agenda\" to \"release\" violent criminals.\nIf anything, Clinton\u2019s policy page bends over backward to focus her attention on \"nonviolent,\" rather than violent, offenders. Proposals specify\u00a0\"nonviolent\" offenders no fewer than seven times.\u00a0This\u00a0consistent focus on nonviolent offenders undermines the notion that Clinton wants to release violent offenders at all, much less to do so willy-nilly.\nOur ruling\nTrump said it \"is Hillary Clinton's agenda\" to \"release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released.\"\nIt would be preposterous for any politician who wants to win an election to propose freeing every violent criminal from jail.\u00a0Like many political figures today on the right, center and left, Clinton supports something much more modest \u2014\u00a0easing how the criminal justice system treats nonviolent offenders. That\u2019s a far cry from saying Clinton is poised to set free everyone from\u00a0Charles Manson to Unabomber Ted Kaczynski.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim Pants on Fire!\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b0b07924-eba6-416e-ae30-fb221f79ebbc", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04915"}
