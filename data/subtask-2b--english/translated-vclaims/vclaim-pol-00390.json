Warren, Dr. Mass. \"The Fed just reported that the manufacturing sector had a second consecutive quarter of the decline, and it landed without Wall Street's expectations.\" Warren has her correct numbers and a set of statistics that indicate a slowdown in manufacturing. The difference lies in what this refrigeration means, and whether the word \"R\" applies. \u2022 The technical definition of the general economic recession was met when the index of industrial production fell from the federal reserve to two quarters, respectively. \u2022 However, the number of manufacturing workers continues to rise. \u2022 Other indicators indicate that industrialization is growing, but slower than before. In July, the Federal Reserve Bank issued figures showing that industrial production fell at an annual rate of 1.2 per cent in the second quarter, higher than in the first quarter. Technically, the decline in growth in two consecutive chapters is a recession. The Warren site was linked to a article on market surveillance, where the chief economist of Panth\u00e9on Ian Sheppardson said, \"The sector is in recession.\" But the economist Barry Bosworth at the Brookings Institution said that Warren's formulation goes too far. On January 13, 2021, the special fact-checkers mentioned a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, said: \"Industrialization is now in the midst of a major slowdown, but it is too small today to be tied to terms such as economic stagnation.\" Bosworth said that manufacturing figures jumped around much more than the GDP of the United States, measuring the entire economy. The economy has been growing continuously every year since 2010. As this graph shows, industrial production has increased and declined throughout that time. And the last landing, as Bosworth said, is not unusually deep. Bosworth also noted that there was a significant difference between saying that the entire economy was stagnating and that one sector was suffering. It would be inappropriate to apply the same definition of quarts to manufacturing. Another measure widely used for the health of the manufacturing sector comes from the Supply Management Institute. It conducts company surveys and produces a monthly index for procurement managers, showing any degree above 50 degrees of growth. This number is declining, but remains at the level of 51.7 in June in a positive area. Steve Blitz, the chief economist of TS Lumbard, refers to this indicator as one sign that manufacturing is not in recession. And Blitz has others: orders in U.S. factories rose by a billion dollars in June, he said. \"The stagnation is not clear in profits, it remains positive, it is not clear in employment - flat to growth,\" said Blitz. In June, the number of manufacturing workers increased to 17,000, although it was essentially stable during the previous three months. Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell told legislators that American industrialization was being dragged because of weak demand around the world. In addition to these global trends, participants in the survey conducted by the Supply Management Institute said that the trade dispute between the United States and China and concerns regarding tariffs on Mexican goods had hampered activity. Our government Warren said the country is now in a state of artificial stagnation. The output fell by two quarters, respectively, and some economists apply the recession mark. But others do not; they say they need to see additional indicators of decline. It refers to other data showing that manufacturing has slowed down but continues to grow. It is important that the sector continues to employ more workers, and commodity demands rose by $1 billion in June. Warren has a point that manufacturing has weakened, but other information paints a more complex picture. We're assessing this claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00390"}
