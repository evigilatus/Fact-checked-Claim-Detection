Kelly Loeffler \u2014 that would overturn Obamacare. The case is awaiting a decision from the Supreme Court.\nNow Loeffler, campaigning in one of two Jan. 5 Georgia runoff elections that will determine which party controls the Senate, has advanced a new health care proposal \u2014 a \"framework\" she claims will \"ensure Americans with preexisting conditions are protected.\"\nPrevious GOP alternatives, including one from Georgia\u2019s other senator, David Perdue, have fallen short of Obamacare\u2019s protections for people with prior health problems.\u00a0\nLoeffler\u2019s thinly detailed plan does, too.\u00a0\n\"There is nothing in the Loeffler plan that indicates she would support the policies necessary to protect Americans against insurer discrimination,\" said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy and management, and of political science, at the University of North Carolina. \"The plan is short on details and substance, and long on political posturing.\"\nRELATED: PolitiFact fact-checks and articles about the Georgia runoffs\nLoeffler\u2019s plan\nThe existing Affordable Care Act was the first federal law to guarantee that people with health problems could buy their own insurance without paying more than healthier consumers.\u00a0\nThrough multiple provisions, it prevents insurance companies from excluding patients with preexisting conditions.\nThe ACA says carriers \"may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion.\" It backs that up with another section that says they \"may not establish rules for eligibility\" based on health status, medical condition, claims experience or medical history. Another provision limits the premiums that can be charged to older policyholders.\nThe Loeffler campaign did not provide us information to back up the senator\u2019s claim that her proposal would ensure these protections.\nLoeffler released her four-page \"Modernizing Americans\u2019 Health Care Plan\" on Nov. 13. As reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, it is a collection of more than one dozen new pieces of legislation sponsored or co-sponsored by Loeffler, along with three measures already signed into law.\u00a0\nThe health care experts we spoke with said the plan lacked so many details that they were forced to make assumptions about what it might or might not include.\u00a0\u00a0\nJoseph Antos, a health care scholar at the market-oriented American Enterprise Institute, said because Loeffler\u2019s plan does not mention repealing the ACA, \"the ACA's preexisting protections remain in place.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Linda Blumberg, a fellow at the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Policy Center, interpreted the plan differently. She said Loeffler\u2019s plan \"would make adequate, affordable insurance for people with problems far less accessible than it is under current law.\"\nBlumberg and other experts pointed to two provisions in Loeffler\u2019s plan in saying that it would provide less protection than the ACA.\u00a0\nOne provision would \"establish Guaranteed Coverage Plans to help cover patients with preexisting conditions.\" No details are provided, but guaranteed issue generally refers to requiring insurers to cover any applicant.\nBefore the ACA, such guaranteed coverage was sometimes provided through high-risk pools \u2014 non-group health coverage offered by states to customers who couldn\u2019t otherwise obtain individual coverage. Such pools likely covered just a fraction of the people with preexisting conditions who lacked insurance, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, and they charged far more than what a typical person would pay in the non-group market.\u00a0\nIf the Guaranteed Coverage Plans provision in Loeffler\u2019s plan is a high-risk pool, Larry Levitt, KFF\u2019s executive vice president for health policy wrote, \"it could provide help\" if it\u2019s adequately funded. But \"the history of high-risk pools is that benefits were limited and premiums were high.\" Other experts also said Loeffler\u2019s proposal appears to be proposing high-risk pools.\nHealth care consultant Robert Laszewski noted that Loeffler\u2019s proposal has a specific plan for those who want their preexisting conditions covered, whereas all individual plans in the ACA\u2019s exchanges cover preexisting conditions. Her Guaranteed Coverage Plans provision \"would seem to indicate she will have a plan that does not cover preexisting conditions, but then she will offer a special plan that will,\" Laszewski said, alluding to high-risk plans that \"tended to offer very limited and very expensive coverage.\"\nAnother provision in Loeffler\u2019s plan would give low-income families with preexisting conditions a one-time federal tax credit toward Health Savings Account contributions.\nThe fact that people with preexisting conditions would need separate plans \"sends a strong signal that they would no longer be guaranteed coverage or community rates in marketplace plans\" as they are under the ACA, and \"it seems likely that these plans would work like the high-risk pool plans,\" said law professor Wendy Netter Epstein, director of DePaul University\u2019s Health Law Institute.\u00a0\n\"If those with preexisting conditions will only be able to get plans with fewer benefits and higher costs,\" she added, \"that explains why her proposal tries to help out low-income families with preexisting conditions with a one-time tax credit.\"\u00a0\nSuch a credit \"is like giving a family one bag of sand to protect their home as a hurricane rushes in,\" given that families with preexisting conditions can spend thousands of dollars more a year on medical care, said Allison Hoffman, a health care law expert at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law.\n\"There\u2019s nothing substantive in Kelly Loeffler\u2019s framework that would protect people with preexisting conditions anywhere near to the degree the Affordable Care Act does,\" Hoffman said.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nLoeffler said her health care plan would \"ensure Americans with preexisting conditions are protected.\"\nThe plan lacks any detail to explain how it would provide protections that are at least as strong as the Affordable Care Act. Two of the plan\u2019s provisions indicate it would make adequate and affordable insurance less accessible for people with preexisting conditions, experts say.\nWithout evidence to back Loeffler\u2019s claim, we rate it False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.\nRELATED: 4 people want to be Georgia\u2019s next 2 senators.
