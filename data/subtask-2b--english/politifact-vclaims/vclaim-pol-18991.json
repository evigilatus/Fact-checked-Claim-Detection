That\u2019s what happens with mail-in ballots.\u2019 - AG Barr.\"\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to our email about Barr\u2019s statement.\u00a0\nBut here\u2019s what we know from media reports.\u00a0\nThe Justice Department did not indict someone in Texas for casting 1,700 ballots. A spokesperson for the department told the Washington Post that prior to his CNN interview, Barr was \"provided a memo prepared within the department that contained an inaccurate summary about the case which he relied upon when using the case as an example.\"\nIn 2017, prosecutors in Dallas County, in Texas, investigated suspected mail-in voter fraud after receiving a tip that voters who had not requested mail ballots received notices that they would receive them, according to the Washington Post.\u00a0\nThe name \"Jose Rodriguez\" appeared on about 700 ballots, indicating that this person helped fill them out. Andy Chatham, who was the assistant district attorney on the case at the time, said that when investigators approached the voters who were said to have cast the ballots, the voters generally said the ballots were legitimate and cast for the candidate they supported, the Post reported.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.
