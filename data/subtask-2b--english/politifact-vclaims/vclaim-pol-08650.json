But the existence of people in that situation struck many critics as contradicting his like-it, keep-it promise on its face.\nObama\u2019s speech on Nov. 4, 2013, at a meeting of Organizing for Action, his campaign organization, seemed to offer a new, and confusing, wrinkle.\n\"Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn\u2019t changed since the law passed,\" Obama said.\nThe way we read that comment -- and, judging by the contentious White House press briefing the following day, the way other Washington journalists read it -- was that Obama was saying that people had been misreporting the pledge he had made.\nIt wasn\u2019t that he said \"if you like your plan, you can keep it\" -- it was \"if your plan hasn\u2019t changed since the law passed,\" you can keep it.\nWe wondered whether there was any evidence that Obama had used this particular caveat in the past.\nSome background on \"grandfathering\"\nFirst, a brief reminder of why some Americans are getting cancellation notices.\nUnder the new law, policies must cover a comprehensive set of benefits, including emergency care, maternity care, mental health or prescription drugs. If they don\u2019t, they can be \"grandfathered\" in, but only if the plans have not been changed at all.\nTo be grandfathered, the plans must have operated continuously since before the law\u2019s enactment in 2010 and have made no significant changes. This means the insurer can keep the insurance plan essentially as is, without having to implement many (though not all) of the new law\u2019s requirements.\nBut the regulations defining what constitutes a significant change are tight -- and if it\u2019s breached, the plan is on the road to oblivion. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as HIPAA, says that if an insurer wants to end a policy, it needs to give policy holders 90 days notice, as well as information about alternative coverage plans that insurer is offering.\nThat\u2019s essentially the message that many individual-market policyholders are receiving in the mail.\nWe should note that Obama\u2019s comments often were aimed at the general public. And most people do get to keep their health plans under his law, especially those who get insurance through work or Medicare. His plan specifically left the existing health care system in place while reducing the ranks of the uninsured.\nHere at PolitiFact, we noticed last year that Obama\u2019s comments were too sweeping and that it was unlikely that all Americans would be able to keep their insurance through thick and thin. \u00a0\u00a0\nObama\u2019s comments before the law passed\nWe decided to look back from all the public statements we could find about people being allowed to keep their plans. We found at least 37 times where Obama made a variation of the pledge that if you like your plan, you can keep it. (See all 37 mentions.)\nObama used the phrase 26 times between his inauguration and when the law passed. Here are four representative samples.\n\u2022 Town hall in Green Bay, Wis., June 11, 2009: \"No matter how we reform health care, I intend to keep this promise: \u00a0If you like your doctor, you'll be able to keep your doctor; if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan.\"\n\u2022 Remarks at the American Medical Association, June 15, 2009: \"I know that there are millions of Americans who are content with their health care coverage -- they like their plan and, most importantly, they value their relationship with their doctor. They trust you. And that means that no matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.

Under our proposals, if you like your doctor, you keep your doctor. If you like your current insurance, you keep that insurance. Period, end of story.\"\n\u2022 Remarks in Fairfax, Va., March 19, 2010: \"If you like your doctor, you\u2019re going to be able to keep your doctor. If you like your plan, keep your plan. I don\u2019t believe we should give government or the insurance companies more control over health care in America. I think it\u2019s time to give you, the American people, more control over your health.\"\nObama\u2019s comments after the law was signed\nWe found 10 instances after the law was signed when Obama made the pledge again.\nIn remarks in Portland, Maine, on April 1, 2010, Obama said that \"if Americans like their doctor, they will keep their doctor. \u00a0And if you like your insurance plan, you will keep it. \u00a0No one will be able to take that away from you. \u00a0It hasn\u2019t happened yet. \u00a0It won\u2019t happen in the future.\"\nAfter the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations for the law on June 14, 2010, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius blogged: \"The bottom line is that under the Affordable Care Act, if you like your doctor and plan, you can keep them.\"\nObama then repeated the remarks during several campaign events in 2012, as well as at the first presidential debate in Denver on Oct. 3, 2012: \"If you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around.\"\nFinally, as recently as a few weeks ago, Obama was playing down the impact.\n\"Now, let\u2019s start with the fact that even before the Affordable Care Act fully takes effect, about 85 percent of Americans already have health insurance -\u2013 either through their job, or through Medicare, or through the individual market,\" he said in a speech in Largo, Md., on Sept. 26. \"So if you\u2019re one of these folks, it\u2019s reasonable that you might worry whether health care reform is going to create changes that are a problem for you -- especially when you\u2019re bombarded with all sorts of fear-mongering. So the first thing you need to know is this: If you already have health care, you don\u2019t have to do anything.\"\nOverall, we didn\u2019t find one instance in which Obama offered a caveat that it only applies to plans that hadn\u2019t changed after the law\u2019s passage.\nWhat the White House says\nThe day after Obama claimed that he\u2019d said \"you can keep it if it hasn\u2019t changed since the law passed,\" reporters grilled White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.\nCarney claimed Obama was referring to the rules that Sebelius issued in June 2010.\n\"When the rule was issued, Secretary Sebelius and others spoke to the press about it \u2026 if insurance companies changed their plans or canceled their plans, they would give up the opportunity to grandfather those plans in June of 2010. There was a fair amount of coverage of that in major newspapers.\"\nThe White House pointed us to a June 14, 2010, telephone news conference with Sebelius on the rules.\n\"If you have a plan that you like, you keep it, but if indeed insurers or employers decide to make dramatic shifts, to the detriment of employees, huge cost shifts, huge increases in deductibles, slashing benefits, whatever, they then no longer qualify for the grandfather status, because that's really a change in the plan, and that isn't a plan that most people like very much,\" she said.\nThe White House also offered several news articles published at the time that reported Sebelius\u2019 comments.\nOf these, the one that offered the most critical assessment of the grandfather provisions, in the Washington Post, got most of its ammunition from Republicans, quoting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying on the Senate floor, \"This is not only bad news for the vast majority of Americans who like the plans they have. It also flatly contradicts the president's repeated promises.\"\nBy contrast, what Sebelius told the Post focused on the positive rather than the negative aspects of the change. She said Obama \"wanted to make sure as much as possible that if people had plans that they liked they got to keep them and balance that with, you know, some overall protection for consumers,\" the Post reported.\nFinally, the White House provided a series of other comments in which the administration offered a more nuanced formulation of the like-it, keep-it policy, but they were all in the past month, during the time when such criticism was already emerging.\nOur ruling\nAccording to Obama, \"What we said was you can keep (your plan) if it hasn\u2019t changed since the law passed.\"\nBut we found at least 37 times since Obama\u2019s inauguration where he or a top administration official made a variation of the pledge that if you like your plan, you can keep it, and we never found an instance in which he offered the caveat that it only applies to plans that hadn\u2019t changed after the law\u2019s passage. And seven of those 37 cases came after the release of the HHS regulations that defined the \"grandfathering\" process, when the impact would be clear.\nWhile Sebelius\u2019 teleconference with reporters did provide that sort of caveat, in other instances, such as her blog post, she focused on the upside, not the downside. Her one mention of the extent to which grandfathered plans might be doomed strikes us as the equivalent of the fine print on a television commercial running in heavy rotation. Obama is ignoring the overwhelming majority of times he addressed the issue, where most people would have heard it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08650"}
