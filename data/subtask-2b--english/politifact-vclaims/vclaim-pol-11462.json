In comparison, the federal poverty level for a two-person household is $15,130. If we keep the minimum wage at the current level, then single-parent families earning the minimum wage at a full-time job will live in poverty in New Jersey. We can\u2019t sit idly by while parents raising their children cannot financially support themselves or pay the bare minimum of daily expenses while earning the minimum wage.\"\n\nIs the state\u2019s minimum wage too little to lift a single-parent family out of poverty, as DeAngelo suggests? PolitiFact New Jersey found the assemblyman is right.\n\nA plan to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $8.50 per hour, then adjust it annually based on any increase in the Consumer Price Index, is coursing its way through the state Legislature.\n\nBut currently, full-time workers with minimum-wage jobs earn roughly $15,080 annually in New Jersey before taxes if they work 40 hours a week, every week of the year.\n\nThe federal government releases two measures of poverty. The U.S. Census Bureau sets poverty thresholds using income before taxes, which are used primarily for statistical purposes such as estimating the number of Americans in poverty each year.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sets federal poverty guidelines that are used for more administrative reasons, such as determining eligibility for assistance programs. Agencies may apply different income measures -- before taxes or after taxes -- to the guidelines.\n\nA spokesman for the Assembly Democrats said DeAngelo based his statement on the federal health department\u2019s poverty measure. For a family of two, the measure tops off at $15,130. That\u2019s $50 more than the gross income of an individual working full-time at a minimum wage job. For comparison, the Census Bureau\u2019s poverty threshold is $15,504 for a two-person household with a parent and child.\n\nAs the size of a household grows, the poverty measure increases. For a family of four, the federal health department\u2019s guideline is $23,050. The Census Bureau\u2019s threshold, which changes depending on the number of children under 18 in the household, is $22,891 for a family of four, with one parent and three children.\n\nThere\u2019s debate about the overall economic benefits of an increase in the minimum wage. We\u2019re not wading into that argument in this Truth-O-Meter item.\n\nBut in the scenario DeAngelo highlights, the annual earnings for a full-time worker would increase to $17,680 if New Jersey increased its minimum wage to $8.50 per hour. That\u2019s $2,550 more than the health department\u2019s poverty guideline for a family of two, but still less than the guidelines for any other size household.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe assemblyman said: \"If we keep the minimum wage at the current level, then single-parent families earning the minimum wage at a full-time job will live in poverty in New Jersey. \"\n\nA New Jersey resident working full-time at a job paying the state\u2019s minimum wage of $7.25 per hour makes roughly $15,000 annually. For a family of two, the federal health department\u2019s poverty guideline is $15,130.\n\nWe rate the claim True.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's Note: A research fellow with the business-backed Employment Policies Institute took issue with this ruling.
