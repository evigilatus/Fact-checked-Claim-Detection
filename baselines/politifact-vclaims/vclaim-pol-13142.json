We\u2019re wondering about what Tovo adds in her mailers: \"And one of (Shade\u2019s) biggest contributors is the racetrack lobbyist.\"\n\nTovo\u2019s campaign manager, Mark Yznaga, told us in a telephone interview the lobbyist is Richard Suttle, a partner in the influential Austin law firm, Armbrust & Brown.\n\nYznaga conceded that Suttle has personally given Shade\u2019s campaign only $25, the maximum any lobbyist working City Hall can give per election. But, he said, lawyers and spouses connected to the Armbrust & Brown firm accounted for 51 firm-connected contributions, 45 for $350, six for $25, for a total $15,900 from late December through April 4, the end of the latest reporting period.\n\nNudged about Suttle\u2019s tiny donation, Yznaga replied: \"You\u2019re being silly. It\u2019s quite well known in the city that (Suttle) is the lobbyist who does a lot of Armbrust & Brown work.\"\n\nYznaga noted that 16 members of the firm, which lists 21 lawyers on its website, contributed the maximum allowed, $350. And he pointed out that David Armbrust, among the firm\u2019s founders, is listed on Shade\u2019s finance filings as a bundler, which the city defines as anyone who has solicited and obtained contributions for the candidate adding up to more than $5,000 during a finance reporting period. Armbrust, like Suttle a city-registered lobbyist, gave $25.\n\nSuttle is a familiar figure at City Hall, where he frequently represents real estate developers. He has reported 55 clients to the city, including Circuit of the Americas, which is building the racetrack.\n\nNext, we reached Suttle, who called the characterization of him as one of Shade\u2019s biggest contributors \"a stretch. It\u2019s old-school campaign lies.\" The city ordinance limiting individuals who lobby the city to $25 donations means he couldn\u2019t be a top donor.\n\n\"I have to chuckle,\" he said, adding that he told his wife, who also donated $25 to Shade\u2019s campaign: \"I guess 50 bucks gets us on the big contributors list now.\"\n\nIn a telephone interview, Shade\u2019s campaign manager, Katherine Haenschen, pointed out that the money donated by the Suttles accounted for a minuscule share of more than $168,000 Shade raised from November through April 4.\n\nShe said by email: \"By my calculations, our average donation is $208. Suttle's $25 is\nabout 1/8 of that. Furthermore, the last time I checked, there are only 10 individuals who have donated LESS than Richard Suttle!\"\n\nThat may be true. But donors connected to Armbrust & Brown accounted for 9 percent of Shade\u2019s contributions through April 4. Shade\u2019s finance reports show 9 bundlers other than Armbrust accounting for 15 percent of her campaign contributions through April 4. The next-most-successful single bundler raised about $6,300, less than half Armbrust\u2019s haul for Shade.\n\nArmbrust\u2019s bundling is surely appreciated by the incumbent and signals the firm\u2019s lawyers, including Suttle, want her to win a second term. But Tovo overshoots when she spears the racetrack lobbyist. Other members of his law firm are responsible for sending far more money Shade\u2019s way.
