Recently, we looked at an announcement in which Grimes said that McConnell, the current minority leader in the Senate, We've assessed this claim as mostly false. But this was only one of several allegations in the ad that attacked McConnell because he was out of control with ordinary Kentucky and biased towards the rich. Another allegation that caught our attention: McConnell's voice \"three times for tax exemptions for companies that send Kentucky jobs abroad.\" We have noted that this allegation - that a candidate voted for tax exemptions that send jobs abroad - is a talking point among democratic candidates, and we found that this allegation is often simplified and misleading. So we decided to see whether Grimes' claim about McConnell was piled up or not. The announcement makes it seem as if Maconel voted three times to approve tax exemptions for companies that specifically stimulate outsourcing. This is not the case. As evidence of her allegations, Grimes carried us information on their website. All three votes were \"no\" on legislation seeking to close tax cuts for already existing companies. These reductions were not specifically for outsourcing because, under the current law, there was no special provision granting companies a discount or any kind of tax exemption for the removal of employees from the country. The first vote for \"no\" by McConnell in 2010 was on the American Job Creation and End Displacement Act. The second and third \"no\" votes were on the Repatriation Act, which was proposed in 2012 and again in 2014. These votes, which were divided almost exclusively on the basis of parties, concerned procedural measures that ultimately prevented the draft laws from obtaining a final vote. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 11 January 2021, the two laws would have granted tax interest to companies contracting out for jobs and would have deprived outsourced companies of the tax exemption already in place. The tax exemptions that the law would have suspended are in fact uniform reductions in commercial expenditures. Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax deductible - including transportation. However, this is not only a special provision for businesses moving outside the United States. Business will get the same discounts for the money he spent from New York to California. The tax experts we talked to said that the law is almost entirely symbolic. The amount of funds associated with these standard discounts is small, compared to the general tax revenues of companies. In fact, the disposal of discounts for work expenses associated with outsourcing would not be nearly sufficient to influence the company &apos; s decision to engage in foreign activity. James Heinz, Professor of Law and Economics, University of Michigan, said. \"In view of the number of large multinational companies we have, it is impossible to have any impact on their behaviour.\" According to the estimates of the Joint Tax Commission, the elimination of standard discounts for outsourcing costs would result in an average income of $14.2 million per year. That's not much in the big scheme of things. From a perspective, the Internal Revenue Service took $273.5 billion in corporate income taxes in 2013 alone, according to the Centre for Tax Policy, a research group based on the data of the Office of Administrative and Budgetary Questions. Income from the cancellation of this deduction will be 0.005 per cent of total income. Among the reasons given by the Republicans against the Repatriation Act, this policy would have lost revenue and added to the deficit, according to the Congressional Joint Tax Commission. The Government would have spent more money on tax exemption for outsourcing than it would have spent by eliminating outsourcing discounts. Overall, this policy would have resulted in an estimated loss of $214 million over 10 years. The Governor Grimes said that McConnell voted \"three times for tax exemptions for companies sending jobs to Kentucky abroad.\" The announcement makes it look like McConnell voted to approve tax exemptions for companies that stimulate outsourcing. In fact, I voted \"no\" on legislation that would eliminate standard reductions in business expenditures - which exist for all businesses - for costs associated with outsourcing. (The current law does not contain any provision specifically dealing with outsourcing or outsourcing.) These invoices had little chance of passing, and were largely symbolic. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07311"}
