Connie Mack IV faced accusations of using public money for campaigning when he sent an office mailer about his \"Penny Plan\" beyond his southwest Florida congressional district in May. Mack, R-Fort Myers, is running statewide for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate.\n\nMack blamed the widespread mailing on the vendor who had also done campaign work for Mack. The vendor then reimbursed the government.\n\nWhile who received the mailer drew much scrutiny, what the mailer actually said drew less attention.\n\nMack\u2019s mailer was about a plan he introduced in May 2011 to balance the budget that he says is so basic it comes down to -- you guessed it -- a penny.\n\n\"The Mack Penny Plan is simple -- eliminate one penny out of every federal dollar spent,\" the mailer said. \"Doing this would balance our budget by 2019 and restore economic freedom by reducing spending and bringing fiscal discipline to Washington. The Penny Plan continues to gain support and now has 70 cosponsors in the House of Representatives, as well as support from key senators like Marco Rubio, Pat Toomey and Rand Paul. If Florida families can cut one penny, or more, out of every dollar in their budgets, so can Washington.\"\n\nWe had a few questions about Mack\u2019s plan:\n\n\u2022 Does the math work -- would it balance the budget in eight years?\n\n\u2022 How would Mack get to that 1 percent cut each year -- would it be across the board in every area, including Social Security and Medicare?\n\n\u2022 Is it really gaining support? Or is it stalled?\n\nBy the numbers\n\nMack has a fact sheet that shows the numbers for H.R. 1848, the One Percent Spending Reduction Act.\n\nMack got the idea from the One Cent Solution. The founder, Bruce Cook, is a businessman from Georgia and a graduate of Harvard Business School.\n\nThe math works like this: For six years, the federal government would reduce spending by 1 percent each year. In the seventh year, funding would be capped at 18 percent of gross domestic product, which measures the size of the overall economy. By the eighth year, the plan would balance the budget and save $7.5 trillion over 10 years.\n\nIf Congress and the president couldn\u2019t reach an agreement about what to cut, the plan would trigger automatic across-the-board spending cuts.\n\nMack\u2019s website shows the 1 percent reduction each year:\n\nFY 2012 \u2013 $3.382 trillion*, less 1 percent => $3.348 trillion cap\nFY 2013 \u2013 $3.348 trillion, less 1 percentt = > $3.315 trillion cap\nFY 2014 \u2013 $3.315 trillion, less 1 percent => $3.282 trillion cap\nFY 2015 \u2013 $3.282 trillion, less 1 percent => $3.249 trillion cap\nFY 2016 \u2013 $3.249 trillion, less 1 percent => $3.216 trillion cap\nFY 2017 \u2013 $3.216 trillion, less 1 percent => $3.184 trillion cap\n\nAt the beginning of fiscal year 2018, it sets an overall spending cap of 18 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nThe mailer says the plan would balance the budget by 2019, while a Mack congressional staffer told us based on the latest figures it would do the trick by 2017.\n\nTo give you an idea of how dramatic this is, Paul Ryan\u2019s budget plan wouldn\u2019t balance the budget for nearly three decades, until 2040.\n\nThe math isn\u2019t the hard part\n\nWe sent Mack\u2019s fact sheet to several federal budget experts and asked them if the math worked and their opinion of Mack\u2019s plan. Our experts included JD Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation; Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute; Josh Gordon of the centrist Concord Coalition; Jason Peuquet of the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget; and Michael Linden, of the left-leaning Center for American Progress.\n\nOur experts generally agreed that Mack\u2019s math is correct and would balance the budget. But no one we interviewed thought Mack\u2019s plan was a realistic way to balance the budget.\n\n\"One can always make the math work, as presented in this fashion it's a fairly straightforward exercise,\" Foster said. \u00a0\n\nThe straight math isn\u2019t the hard part. It\u2019s whether to cut everything by 1 percent or to target programs selectively.\n\n\"The numbers work, but they have to be made effective by policy changes,\" Foster said. \"The easiest part legislatively is the targets, and you have to have those, but then you still need to finish the job.\"\n\nRepublicans have programs they want to protect from cuts, just like the Democrats do, and the GOP can end up fighting amongst themselves about what to cut -- take for example the battle over whether to extend the Export-Import Bank.\n\n\"There are a lot Republicans in the House and Senate who fashion themselves as being for small government and supporting these overall caps, but when the rubber hits the road and they actually have to vote on cutting particular programs, they chicken out,\" Edwards said.\n\nMost notably, the bill doesn\u2019t explain how it would adjust Medicare and Social Security to make up for the expected growth as Baby Boomers retire.\n\nWe asked Mack\u2019s congressional office if Mack supports cutting peoples\u2019 Social Security 1 percent a year for six years. Their statement:\n\n\"The Penny Plan sets a framework for reducing spending. It will be up to Congress and the president to work together to determine how best to achieve those spending reductions.\"\n\n(The One Cent Solution states that some programs could be spared while others cut more than others, so theoretically that could mean Social Security wouldn\u2019t be cut though that would mean larger cuts elsewhere.)\n\nLinden, who called Mack\u2019s plan \"ridiculous\", noted that this plan could mean an even cut larger than 1 percent for each senior, since the number of seniors getting Social Security will increase. And if Social Security and Medicare were off the table, that would remove about 35 percent of non-interest spending from the chopping block, leaving bigger cuts elsewhere.\n\nMost proposals to control spending account for the fact that more people are going to be getting Social Security and Medicare benefits in the future, Peuquet said. That means making actual cuts to the programs is very difficult.\n\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities hasn\u2019t analyzed the Penny Plan but examined a 2011 plan by Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to limit total federal spending to no more than 20.6 percent of the gross domestic product -- slightly larger than Mack\u2019s proposal of 18 percent. The Center wrote that the cuts to entitlements would be massive:\n\n\"There is little possibility that Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security all would be exempted from these cuts. To do that would require cutting everything else \u2014 including defense, veterans\u2019 programs, education, scientific research, and the like \u2014 by unthinkable amounts.\n...and the cuts would have to be even larger if the economy faltered.\"\n\nSocial Security and Medicare aren\u2019t the only programs that our experts raised concerns about.\n\nLinden raised questions about whether Mack would cut veterans\u2019 benefits although their needs are growing.\n\n\"You have to think not just compared to what we spend today, but what we have to spend based on underlying demographics,\" he said.\n\nGaining support?\n\nMack introduced his bill in the House on May 11, 2011. It was referred to committees and introduced in the Senate on June 30. Since then, it\u2019s seen no official action, according to the Library of Congress website. All 70 cosponsors in the House signed on in 2011.\n\nIn the Senate, there is one sponsor plus 13 cosponsors and about half of the cosponsors signed on in 2012. Mack\u2019s office also points to this April 2012 article in the conservative Washington Times cowritten by a Treasury official who worked under President George W. Bush. Mack also spoke about his plan at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center in April 2012.\n\nWe agree that the Penny Plan is still getting some attention, but even Mack\u2019s own website largely links to endorsements and news coverage from 2011.\n\nOur ruling\n\nMack\u2019s plan calls for reducing federal spending 1 percent a year for six years and then capping spending at 18 percent of GDP. Our experts agreed that the math works to balance the budget.\n\nBut Mack has not provided a detailed road map on how to achieve cuts -- he simply says if Congress and the president can\u2019t work it out, there will be across-the-board cuts, with no explanation about what that means for programs serving an increased number of people. We\u2019d like to hear him provide details about whether older Americans should expect lower Social Security checks and to pay more for Medicare, or if they\u2019ll be spared and in turn other departments will face much larger cuts.\n\nAnd we don\u2019t see evidence that the plan is gaining support. The lack of action in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives is a sign that balancing the budget requires broader policy discussions and debates about spending priorities.\n\nWe rate this claim Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on March 30, 2011 in an opinion article in the 'Wall Street Journal'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo pay for government growth, leaders of both parties \"borrowed $4 billion a day, leaving us with today's $14 trillion debt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Laura Figueroa \u2022 April 15, 2011", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10816"}
