Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,\u00a0has attracted a ton of attention since her swearing-in earlier this month,\u00a0with fake\u00a0quotes being attributed\u00a0or criticism for her dance moves in college.\nNow, after securing a seat on the House\u00a0Financial Services Committee, the internet is calling her personal money management into question.\nA Facebook post, which appeared on Jan. 16, has been shared over 28,000 times and generated nearly 2,000 comments. We also found that several other versions of the claim have been spread across the internet with no sourcing or any sort of evidence.\nThe post\u00a0in full says: \"Congresswoman Cortez, from New York City, has been selected to be on the house finance committee, her credit score is 430 and has had two checking accounts closed, along with two sheriff evictions.\"\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

From\u00a0many in-depth profiles written about her over the past year, we know she helped support her family by working multiple jobs, and that she has been criticized by some for not having significant-enough savings, but nothing comes close to this rumor.\nMoreover, a person\u2019s credit score cannot be obtained without their written consent, according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, so it is unlikely the rumor\u2019s originator was granted access to that information.\nOur search of public records databases turned up no mention of an eviction, or any other property or housing problems involving law enforcement (nor were there any judgments, liens or bankruptcies).\nAccording to her April 2018 financial disclosure report, the only liability listed was one federal student loan.\n\"No this is not true, no her credit score is not 430 and she does not have any sheriff evictions,\" Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s spokesperson told us. \u00a0\nWhile Ocasio-Cortez has had to work two jobs in the past to help support her family and currently has one student loan, there is no evidence to support she has ever been evicted, has had bank accounts closed or has a low credit score.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2019-01-23 16:55:42 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  U.S. Rep.
