I KNOW that any votes cast after 8 on election day are not valid. We had our machines tabulated and results in to our clerk by 10PM. Any votes counted after midnight are fraud. Please fight for Michigan! Trump crushed it in our State...until mysteriously 3:30 in the morning\u2026\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe post is wrong. There\u2019s nothing fraudulent about ballots being counted after midnight in Michigan \u2014 as long as they\u2019re received by 8 p.m. Election Day. In-person voters who are in line by 8 p.m. that day also have the right to vote.\nIn fact, we\u2019ve known for weeks before Election Day that counting ballots and reporting results would take longer than in previous years. As the federal Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency recently noted, \"this does not indicate that there is any problem with the counting process or results. Official results are not certified until all validly cast ballots have been counted, including ballots that are counted on election night.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on February 5, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNewly discovered video shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Clara Hendrickson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore people across the country opted to use a mail-in ballot because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in Michigan, a 2018 state constitutional amendment allowed all voters to cast an absentee ballot for any reason. A record of more than 5.2 million Michigan voters cast a ballot in the 2020 election, including about 3.26 million absentee ballots. In 2016, about 4.87 million people cast a ballot in the presidential election, including about 1.27 million absentee ballots.\u00a0\nMail ballots take more time and resources to process than ballots cast at the polls. Most states allow election officials to start processing mail-in ballots in the weeks leading up to Election Day, but officials in Michigan couldn\u2019t begin that work until Nov. 2, under\u00a0a new law\u00a0that allotted officials in larger juristictions a 10-hour early window to process such ballots. They were still barred from counting any ballots until Election Day, so even with that extra time to start processing, officials warned that final election results wouldn\u2019t be known on Nov. 3.\u00a0\nThe morning after Election Day, Secretary of State Joceyln Benson told CNN that absentee ballots in the state\u2019s biggest cities were still being counted. \"Workers who have been counting them throughout the night continue to count them today,\" she said.\u00a0\nBy about 8 p.m. that day, all of Michigan\u2019s votes had been tabulated, Benson said, and counties were in the final stages of reporting them out for the canvassing process to begin, the Detroit Free Press reported.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18470"}
