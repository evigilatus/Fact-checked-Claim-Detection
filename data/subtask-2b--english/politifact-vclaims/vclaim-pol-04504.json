Half of all NC legislative candidates are unopposed because of gerrymandering. Gerrymandering deprives voters of a voice and a choice in our elections. Help us end gerrymandering now.\"\nThat seemed pretty stunning to us. North Carolina is a swing state in presidential elections, with Barack Obama barely winning here in 2008 and then barely losing in 2012. So are we really supposed to believe that half of all the candidates for the North Carolina General Assembly are running unopposed?\nWe wanted to check not only if that was true, but also if gerrymandering is to blame \u2013 or if there\u2019s some other culprit.\nWhat is gerrymandering? \nThe practice is named after Elbridge Gerry, a 19th century Massachusetts governor who signed a law redrawing political districts for political gain. A local newspaper said one district looked like a twisting salamander, and ever since then \u2018gerrymander\u2019 has stuck.\nNorth Carolina has long been literally a textbook example of gerrymandering. The Washington Post analyzed all 435 U.S. House of Representatives districts in 2014 and said North Carolina tied Maryland for the title of most gerrymandered state in the country.\n\"Overall, the North Carolina GOP's efforts paid off handsomely,\" the Washington Post analysis said. \"Based on their statewide vote share you'd expect North Carolina Democrats to hold about seven seats. But they won only four.\"\nA federal court recently forced North Carolina to redraw its U.S. House districts since two were too reliant on race. But it\u2019s not just at the federal level in North Carolina that election districts have been overturned. Even local county and school boards have had their redrawn district lines thrown out.\nGerrymandering is a bipartisan issue. The districts overturned recently were drawn by Republicans, but North Carolina Democrats also used gerrymandering when they held power.\nUncontested races\nBut while courts have ruled on districts at the local and federal levels, the district lines for the N.C. House and N.C. Senate are intact so far. And it\u2019s those districts that the Common Cause video is focused on.\nSince the districts are all roughly the same size in terms of population, the group is basically saying that half of North Carolinians don\u2019t have a choice whether a Republican or Democrat will represent them in the state legislature.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we crunched the numbers. In the N.C. House, 55 of the 120 seats will be uncontested in November. That\u2019s not half, but it\u2019s very close. In the N.C. Senate, though, the number is lower. Of the 50 Senate races, only 15 have just one candidate. That\u2019s about 30 percent.\nIn total, of the 170 state legislative seats, 70 of them (or 41 percent) were decided in the primaries or even before: Of the Senate\u2019s 15 uncontested candidates, 13 also had no primary opponent. Of the 55 uncontested House candidates, 40 had no primary opponent.\nBob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause\u2019s North Carolina chapter, acknowledged the number was slightly under half. He said there are also a number of races that are contested by candidates who lose by double digits. But we\u2019ll recognize those quixotic efforts and give the candidates credit \u2013 they did, after all, at least run a campaign.\nSo while Common Cause missed the mark on the number of uncontested races, it wasn\u2019t too far off. But what about the second part of the claim, that gerrymandering is to blame?\nA mix of issues\nThere\u2019s no way we could interview the people who decided not to run against these 70 uncontested candidates because, well, we don\u2019t know who they are. But from talking to some political experts and reading academic and legal papers, we found agreement that gerrymandering is to blame for some uncompetitive races.\nIt\u2019s not the only reason. Name recognition or a strong fundraising operation could be why some people aren\u2019t challenged, said UNC-Charlotte political science professor Martha Kropf, a past president of the North Carolina Political Science Association. She said that\u2019s especially true \"if you\u2019re looking at someone who\u2019s been in office for a while.\"\nThat\u2019s arguably the case for people like N.C. House Speaker Tim Moore and N.C. Senate leader Phil Berger \u2013 the two most powerful legislators in the state \u2013 who both faced no opponent in either the primary or general elections, despite the sometimes controversial nature of legislation they\u2019ve backed.\nAnd even someone with ties to Common Cause, Ted Arrington, said it\u2019s not accurate to blame every single vacancy on gerrymandering \u2013 although it can certainly have an effect. Arrington is an expert witness on voting rights who has testified in several dozen court cases in the U.S. and Canada.\n\"If all the districts were 50-50 chance of winning by party (registration), there would still be cases where the party failed to find a candidate or the incumbent is just so well-liked no one is going to run against him,\" said Arrington, a retired political science professor.\nArrington is also a former vice chairman of the Mecklenburg County GOP, in which role he helped Republicans win power in the Charlotte area. He said both parties sometimes don\u2019t run candidates for races they think they\u2019ll lose no matter what, since doing so could encourage the other side to turn out in greater numbers \u2013 which could affect more competitive races elsewhere in the county or the state.\nBut that strategy alone can\u2019t explain why half the General Assembly races have only one candidate. Arrington said in a \"perfect\" system he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one in every five races was uncontested, \"but it shouldn\u2019t be half. Not in a presidential election year.\"\nOur ruling\nCommon Cause claimed that half of all races for the state legislature will be uncontested this year because of gerrymandering.\nIt\u2019s actually a bit less than half, but not too far off. And experts agree that while gerrymandering isn\u2019t wholly to blame, it does contribute significantly to the high number of uncontested races.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True. The premise is accurate, although it\u2019s slightly exaggerated.\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/61ac38d9-04a2-42ec-b98d-2e3aae4b8f4a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04504"}
