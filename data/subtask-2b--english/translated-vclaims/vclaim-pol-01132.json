According to a recent article published on a conservative news site, the Columbia Post of the United States Republic of America, Rashida Tlaip (D-Mich), has links to Siraj and Hajj, a prominent but controversial imam in New York and has attracted the attention of the authorities in the past. The headline of the story says: \"The Democratic Congresswoman is linked to an unknown terrorist!\" It was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So let's just get this part out of the way: we checked this claim and found that while the wooing of the prominent speakers at the November event in California, this seems to be the extent of any so-called \"link.\" Is that a \"link\"? In his weakest form, perhaps. With regard to Bohag: Although he was not charged with any offence, he was included in the list of persons likely to be involved in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre. While the headline acknowledges that Hagg has never been charged, it still makes him a terrorist. The headline also expands any telegraph society. Let's take a closer look. More about Suraj, Hagg Siraj and Haj, 68 years old, born Jeffrey Kirs, an African-American imam from the Tagua Mosque in Brooklyn, New York, and leader of the North American Islamic Alliance. He's got a history that's been blocked. As we mentioned earlier, his name was included in the list of persons who were \"proclaimed to be conspirators\" in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. He was never charged and denied any involvement in the bombing. He also witnessed Wag as a personal witness to Sheikh Omar Abdurrahman, the famous blind Sheikh who was convicted in 1995 for planning terrorist attacks in the United States. In August 2018, the son of Wagg (also known as Suraj and Haj) was arrested, along with his two daughters, the daughter-in-law and the son-in-law, for assaulting children in a New Mexico complex for 11 crimes. It is also important to note that Sheikh Waj was one of the people who led the authorities to the compound after receiving a call from his daughter saying that they were starving. Although the glow is incredibly controversial, he is still a prominent clergyman in the Muslim community who writes speeches throughout the country and has assumed executive roles in influential Islamic organizations over the years. On January 22, 2021, Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen mentioned an article on Facebook in which the Paiden administration said that she was a liberal terrorist. \u2022 On January 22, 2012, what about this alleged link? Starting with the Colombian post story, we eventually followed an article on FMsharter.com, a conservative blog originally established to focus on promoting \"free market economies and responsible arms ownership.\" The title of this story goes a little further: \"Rashidestroying the Reindeer Democracy, which is linked to the front, and which considers homosexuality to be \"ill,\" is read before the first four paragraphs of the story that refer to the use of diarrhea as it is pledged at a reception after swearing to accuse President Donald Trump. \"The solution is deeper,\" the story goes on, \"We find that the synthesis - more than two months ago - was a prominent speaker in the CAIR event with Siraj and Hagg.\" It then presents a picture of a CAIR promotional bulletin for the event. This allegation has been verified. The Council for American-Islamic Relations is a Muslim civil rights and advocacy group that often sponsors events such as those referred to in the article. In November, Whagg was a prominent speaker at the organization &apos; s 16th Annual Bank at Sacramento campus, California State University. \"My appearance in an event that does not indicate that I support the views of someone else who just happened to talk there as well,\" said the recitation in a statement for PoliticFact. It is the first Palestinian American woman elected to Congress and one of the first two Muslim women. \"I have always been and continue to be committed to fighting for the acceptance of every individual regardless of who he or she is or who he or she loves. Throughout my life, I have spoken about the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, and I will continue to do so, adding, with regard to the title of the second story. In addition to that rhetorical engagement, we were unable to find any other connection between the two and the congresswoman, who said that she might have seen an irritant in other events, but she did not remember any other connection with him. Our verdict for a story entitled \"The Democratic Congresswoman is linked to an unknown terrorist.\" It is published on the Internet about the new American Republic Rashida Talib. Sarraj and Hajj were certainly a controversial personality, and according to the documents, he was considered by the authorities to be a person who might have been involved in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre. However, he has never been charged and remains an important figure in Islamic society. The only link we found between Wagg and Lip is that they were prominent speakers at a banquet in November 2018 in California. While the story of Colombia's postage contains some truth about its past and its irritant, the headlines of the clicking - especially with regard to the supposed 'link' between Hagg and the avoidance - are exaggerated and make it look even more evil. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, so we often assess it wrong.
