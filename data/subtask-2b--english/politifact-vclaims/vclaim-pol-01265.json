Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens https://t.co/8HiObPLeeM via @nbc6\u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 12, 2018\n\n\nThe tweet drew more than 28,000 likes in less than 24 hours. But it isn't accurate. It\u00a0is based on a cherry-picked number from a headline that didn\u2019t tell the full story back in 2012.\nAt the outset of the state\u2019s effort to purge noncitizens from the voter rolls, state officials came up with the list of about 182,000 names. But Trump Jr. omits that the final number of noncitizens purged was a tiny speck of that original number.\nWhen examined in the context of all the registered voters \u2014 or even ballots cast \u2014 in Florida or the nation, proven voter fraud by noncitizens is rare.\nHistory of noncitizen purge\nFlorida engaged in a controversial attempt to search for noncitizen voters leading up to the 2012 election. The search was rife with errors, and was ultimately dropped after few were found.\nShortly after Republican Gov. Rick Scott took office in 2011, he asked his top election official at the time to look into removing noncitizens from the voter rolls.\nBy 2012, the Division of Elections put together a list of potential noncitizens based on driver\u2019s license data.\nTrump cited a headline from early in that process. He linked to a May 2012 story on NBC Miami\u2019s website headlined: \"2012Election: Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens.\" The story was written by the Associated Press.\nWhy was the president\u2019s son sharing a six-year-old story?\nMatthew Gertz of the liberal Media Matters website noted that before Trump Jr.\u2019s tweet, conservative pundits publicized the 2012 story. David Wohl, the father of conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl, tweeted a link to the story on Nov. 10, as did Harlan Hill and Charlie Kirk.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Nov. 12 before Trump Jr.\u2019s tweet, NBC Miami included an editor\u2019s note on top of the original story. First, it reminded readers that the story was published in 2012. Then, it went over the history lesson of how the state\u2019s list contained errors:\n\nThe AP had reported that the initial list turned up nearly 182,000 people who may not be U.S. citizens, based on the driver\u2019s license data. Of that group, the state sent an initial list of more than 2,600 voters\u2019 names to county election supervisors.\nAs we have reported and the NBC editor\u2019s note points out, the state ultimately whitted the list and removed 85 voters because they were \"not a U.S. citizen.\"\nSupervisors had noted all sorts of errors and later used words such as \"sloppy\" and \"embarrassing\" to describe the state initiative, PolitiFact found. One of the problems was that the driver\u2019s license data doesn\u2019t get updated when a legal resident later becomes a citizen.\nBy September 2012, when the Division of Elections produced a new list of about 200 ineligible voters, supervisors were fed up, and the effort appeared to fizzle as the presidential election drew near.\nThe state said it would launch yet another effort to purge noncitizens from the voter rolls almost a year later, but scrapped it.\nWe were unable to find any other sort of comprehensive data on noncitizen voters removed in Florida. We reached out to the state Division of Elections but did not hear back by deadline.\nJason Snead tracks proven instances of election fraud in the U.S. for the conservative Heritage Foundation, which includes cases that resulted in criminal convictions, fines or an official finding of fraud. He said the database shows 13 entries from Florida involving a noncitizen who successfully registered and/or voted in an election. These cases were from 2003-06.\nA May 2017 report by New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice found that election officials in 42 jurisdictions referred an estimated 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting for further investigation or prosecution out of more than 23 million votes.\n\"The kind of instances in which an individual voter tries to pretend to be somebody else or votes when he or she isn\u2019t eligible are not the statistically meaningful events that we need to be worried about,\" Myrna P\u00e9rez, director of the center\u2019s Voting Rights and Elections project and co-author of the study,\u00a0said\u00a0to the Austin American-Statesman.\nOur ruling\nAs Florida underwent a recount of three key races, Trump Jr. tweeted a headline that said \"nearly 200,000 Florida voters may not be citizens.\" He said it was \"amazing, but not shocking at all anymore.\"\nIt\u2019s actually not true, and years old.\nThe story itself provides a more complete picture \u2014 and an editor\u2019s note with clarifications that Trump overlooked. The state\u2019s 2012 voter purge started with a list of potentially 182,000 noncitizens on the voter rolls. State officials whittled that list to more than 2,600 names sent to county election supervisors. Ultimately 85 noncitizens were removed.\nWe rate this claim False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/52ee7474-bb55-41c4-a7c7-aeffdc759a67", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01265"}
