What is my real aim?\u201d pic.twitter.com/pNPfzirGjO\u2014 Trump War Room - Text TRUMP to 88022 (@TrumpWarRoom) October 27, 2020 \nBiden did say those words during a campaign stop in Warm Springs, Ga., on Oct. 27 \u2014 but he was quoting something he said Pope Francis said, not expressing confusion about his own campaign.\nBiden said that throughout history, there have been \"charlatans, the con men, the phony populist, who sought the play on our fears, appeal to our worst appetites, and pick at the oldest scabs we have for their own political gain.\"\nBiden, a practicing Catholic, went on to say that Pope Francis recently said people who want to lead should reflect on their purpose. He was referring to Pope Francis\u2019 Oct. 3 encyclical letter.\nBelow is what Biden said, in bold is what the Trump campaign featured in its tweet:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In a recent encyclical, Pope Francis warns us against this phony populism that appeals to \u2018the basest and most selfish instincts.\u2019 He goes on to say, \u2018Politics is something more noble than posturing, marketing, and media spin. These sow nothing but division, conflict, and a bleak cynicism.\u2019 He said, for those who seek to lead, we do well to ask ourselves, 'why am I doing this? Why? What is my real aim?\u2019 Pope Francis asked questions that anyone who seeks to lead this great nation should be able to answer. And my answer is this: I run to unite this nation and to heal this nation. I've said that from the beginning. It is badly necessary.\"\nBiden\u2019s recap closely mirrored what Pope Francis said.\nTrump and some Fox News pundits, such as Brit Hume, have falsely called Biden \"senile.\" Senility is not a precise medical term, but is often used in place of the more precise and accepted medical term of \"dementia.\" Geriatric experts have told PolitiFact that Biden does not exhibit signs of dementia, which is defined as cognitive decline that is severe enough to cause someone to lose the ability to function independently in daily life.\nOur ruling\nTrump\u2019s campaign tweeted a video claiming Biden said, \"Why am I doing this? Why? What is my real aim?\"\nThe snippet gives the wrong impression of Biden\u2019s remarks. Biden was quoting part of Pope Francis\u2019 Oct. 3 encyclical letter.\nWe rate it False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18782"}
