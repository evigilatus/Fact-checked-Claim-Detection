Yes, fewer days, Foreign Minister Kurt Browning wrote on 23 May 2011, the guest column of the St. Petersburg Times. But the hours are longer in those days. \u2219 HB 1355, signed by Scott into law 19 May, reduced the number of days of early voting from 14 to 8, making it difficult for third-party voter registration groups to register potential voters, and requiring voters who change their address from one province to another on election day to cast their provisional votes, which are then reviewed by the Provincial Inspectorate. Browning and Republicans who support the law say that changes will better protect the state voting system from fraud. Democrats say that changes are an attempt to suppress voter turnout. \"To combat voter fraud, reduce the burden on polling personnel and provide the necessary flexibility for local election supervisors, the number of days still open for polls has been reduced from 14 possible days to eight, even though the total number of hours available for early voting remains the same,\" Browning wrote in a column entitled \"Florida's early voting remains in 96 hours.\" \"The result is that active voters will be able to vote before or after work, something they couldn't do in the past,\" books. \"That additional flexibility will enable more people than ever before to benefit from early voting. If the election supervisor finds that it is not absolutely necessary to keep all polling stations open for 12 hours a day, which is unusual for rural areas, \"The critics of the new electoral law indicate that there will be less time to vote. But that's not the case. Now more than ever, voters have more options to choose than him in order to benefit from early voting.\" In conclusion, Browning wrote: \"Today, the following remains true: early voting remains at 96 hours, with more flexibility for the provinces...\" We wanted to see whether Browning is right. Before HB 1355 becomes law, laws require that early voting begin 15 days and end two days before the elections, or 14 days in total. Furthermore, the regulations require supervisors to provide eight hours of early voting during the week between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., and a total of eight hours during both weekends. Over the 14 days preceding the Tuesday elections - two weekly holidays and 10 working days - supervisors were required to vote early for at least 96 hours. The law signed by Scott changes several of the requirements for early voting. The new version requires that early voting begin 10 days before the elections and that it be completed three days before the elections, or eight days before the elections as a whole. The new law provides that early voting shall be available for six hours each of the eight days, and shall not exceed 12 hours per day at each polling site. We will repeat that - under the new law, early voting must be available for six hours a day for eight days, or a total of 48 hours, and may be available for up to 12 hours a day for eight days, or 96 hours. In other words, local electoral supervisors will be able to halve the number of early voting hours. However, it will have to increase the number of early voting hours on weekends from 16 to 18 hours. What will local supervisors choose to do? For many, it's too early to say that. In the province of Benillas, the President &apos; s election supervisor Deborah Clarke said that the longer early voting days would be more suitable for those who wish to vote before or after work. But Clark was also critical of the early vote, saying in 2008 that early voting \"doesn't increase voter turnout\" only \"election costs\" The spokesman for Clark Nancy Whitlock said that she was not opposed to extending early voting hours as permitted by the new law, but that she had not yet adopted a timetable for early voting for the 2012 elections. But in Jacksonville and Duval County in north-east Florida, Republican Superintendent Jerry Holland told voters not to expect 12 hours of early voting, according to the Florida Times Union. \"The 12 hours are not practical for us,\" said the Netherlands. Another point around Browning's column. He wrote that the result of the new law is that \"active voters will be able to vote before or after work, something they have not been able to do in the past.\" But that was already happening, at least in Miami-Dade County. During the 2008 elections, the supervisor exceeded the eight-hour window of early voting between the first week and the second week. In the first week, early voting sites were opened at 7 a.m. (as soon as the law permitted). In the second week, early voting sites were opened later so that they would not be closed until 7 p.m. (the last of which could remain open). (Joff) In the end, Charlie Christ issued an executive order in 2008 requiring all early voting sites to remain open for 12 hours per week. The spokesman for Browning Chris Kate said that Browning would work to ensure that almost all of Florida &apos; s medium and large districts use every 96 hours of early voting available to them. \"Every province expects a large number of voters during early voting, which applies to every medium-to-large district in the state, will be used every 96 hours of early voting available. The voters can be sure of this fact, \"Kate sent an e-mail to Polyte Fact Florida. \"Minister Browning can also say this with confidence because he will work with the appropriate election supervisors to make sure of it. \"The only sites where early voting sites can be open for less than 12 hours a day will be in rural districts, where voters do not need every 12 hours a day to vote,\" Kate followed. It would be a waste of local taxpayers' dollars to force election supervisors to keep early voting sites open where no one tries to vote. In a follow-up e-mail, Kate was more explicit, saying that he doubted that \"the new law book considered that the electoral supervisor of a large district (e.g. Duval) might lack insight so that they would not open their early voting sites for 12 full hours.\" Kate indicated that supervisors were required to inform Browning's office of their plans 30 days ahead of schedule, which would give them an opportunity to convince them to change their schedule if necessary. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, the new law also allows Browning to provide \"written guidance and opinions to election supervisors on the performance of their official duties.\" This flexibility in law may provide some small jurisdictions with taxpayers &apos; dollars, but it is also the root cause of the problem when considering Browning &apos; s claim. While an op-ed article of 23 May indicated that rural provinces might set dates less than the current 96 hours of voting, it did not note that the same option was available for each district in Florida, regardless of size. In fact, local supervisors can reduce the total number of early voting hours from 96 to 48 if they choose because this is what the new law allows. However, they have the ability to maintain 96 hours of early voting by increasing voting to 12 hours a day. Therefore, the requirement of 96 hours of early voting was replaced by the option of 96 hours. We're barely evaluating this claim. :: Editor &apos; s note: This statement was estimated to be barely correct when it was published.
