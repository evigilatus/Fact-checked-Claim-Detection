Citizens for Fairness, an electioneering communications organization based in Melbourne, produced the ad. Efforts to reach the group's chairperson, Carmella K. Falcone, were unsuccessful.\nWe can't rate whether Murphy is trustworthy \"with our money\" on the Truth-O-Meter, but voters may find her financial disclosures informative.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Division of Elections\u00a0reports indicate she earned $176,047 last year as an investment adviser at Raymond James Financial.\nShe earns well more than the average Pasco resident. Her income is roughly three times higher than the $51,000 median family income in Pasco, according to U.S. Census data.\nHer biggest asset is her house in New Port Richey, valued at $157,480. Based on August sales data, her home is worth about 65 percent more than the average New Port Richey home valued at about $95,000.\nHere's where the ad veers from the truth: Murphy's net worth is listed as $243,817 and includes a $12,900 timeshare in a Cocoa Beach condominium and half a timeshare worth $7,362 in a condo in Cabo San Lucas on Mexico's Baja California peninsula.\nA time share \u2014 which typically entitles the owner to a week or two of use of the space each year \u2014 is hardly comparable to owning a second (or third) home in a pricey vacation spot.\nSo the claim she has \"two vacation homes around the world,\" including in Cancun, is misleading. It suggests Murphy owns the homes when in fact she owns a time share in a Florida condo and half a share in a condo in Cabo San Lucas \u2014 not in Cancun, which is on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula about 1,480 miles to the east.\nElsewhere, the ad calls Murphy a \"Wall Street broker,\" suggesting she works among the financial giants far removed the problems of Pasco voters. It's true Raymond James is a brokerage, but it's a regional brokerage based in St. Petersburg, not in New York City. Murphy works out of the company's Tampa office.\nThe ad attempts to portray Murphy as an out-of-touch millionaire but uses flimsy evidence to support that picture.\nWe rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08768"}
