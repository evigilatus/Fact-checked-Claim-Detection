That's a fact!\"\n\nDemocrats in individual states, and nationally, have sought to discredit voter-identification initiatives, \u00a0charging they are part of a Republican strategy to make it harder for people who have historically favored Democrats to get the paperwork they need.\n\nAs Coulter\u2019s counterpunch showed, Rhode Island\u2019s voter identification law, passed last year, \u00a0has emerged as a Republican talking point to dispute accusations of partisanship.\n\nIn this item, we will check Coulter\u2019s claim that Rhode Island was a leader in voter-identification legislation. We will examine the second part of her statement in a separate item.\n\nRhode Island, \u00a0where 83.5 percent of the state\u2019s legislators are Democrats, is an exception to the national trend on voter-identification, but, despite what Coulter claimed, it is far from being \"one of the first\" states to pass such legislation.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, as of Sept. 5, \u00a02012, \u00a031 states had enacted some form of voter identification law. At least 12 did so between 2003-2010, well before Governor Lincoln Chafee signed Rhode Island\u2019s law in July 2011.\n\nWhich state actually was the first is unclear. For the modern era, it appears the first state to require voters to verify their identity appears to be South Carolina, in 1950, said Jennie Bower, a senior fellow who researches the issue for the council. Rhode Island isn\u2019t even the first state in New England to require identification; Connecticut did it in 1993.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAnn Coulter said Rhode Island was one of the first states to enact voter-identification laws. It isn\u2019t. \u00a0At least a dozen states had such laws earlier, making Rhode Island closer to the middle of the pack.\n\nWe rule her statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10272"}
