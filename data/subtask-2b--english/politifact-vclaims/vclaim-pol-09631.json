Rick Scott defended his record on the economy and the state\u2019s fiscal condition during his first two years in office.\n\n\"Our Florida Families First budget\" represents \"responsible stewardship of taxpayer money,\" Scott, a Republican, said in the address. \"Washington, D.C., could learn a few budget lessons from Florida. The contrast between our state and the nation\u2019s capital is remarkable. Now is not the time to turn back to the legacy of taxing and borrowing that crippled the economy we inherited two years ago. We must stay the course for economic growth and job creation.\"\n\nWe wondered whether Scott was justified in saying that a \"legacy of taxing and borrowing \u2026 crippled the economy\" he inherited in 2010.\n\nWe should note that we are analyzing this claim using the assumption that Scott is referring to the state\u2019s economy when he talks about the \"legacy of taxing and borrowing.\" His office confirmed that he was referring to Florida's economy as the one he \"inherited\" in January 2011, not the nation\u2019s. As evidence, they pointed us to statistics showing Florida's debt levels increased through 2010 but then declined.\n\nTo check Scott's claim, we contacted a half dozen experts on the Florida economy, primarily academic economists and analysts with financial firms. These experts were unanimous: Problems of taxing and borrowing weren\u2019t the major causes of the severe recession the Sunshine State is still struggling out of. Real estate was, exacerbated by the reach of the national recession.\n\nFlorida real estate values appreciated by 4.1 percent annually from 1995 to 2000, and then by 11.3 percent annually between 2000 and 2003. But when the bust came, it hit hard. By 2010, nearly 14 percent of Florida home loans were in foreclosure, edging out Nevada for the highest in the nation. The serious delinquency rate for home loans in Florida peaked in the third quarter of 2010 at nearly 20 percent -- almost twice the rate of Arizona and California, two of the other hardest-hit states.\n\n\"Most economists -- maybe all economists -- think that the bursting of the housing bubble and the global financial crisis were far and away the largest factors crippling the Florida economy,\" said Bill Seyfried, professor of economics at Rollins College in Winter Park. \"State economic policy played a minimal role.\"\n\nChris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics, agreed. \"Florida\u2019s severe housing collapse, the seeds of which were sown during Jeb Bush\u2019s governorship, combined with the national recession to deliver the Florida economy a devastating one-two punch from 2007 to 2009,\" he said. \"Tax revenues obviously fell during the recession, which you would expect to happen in any state, but there was not a substantial erosion in the state\u2019s fiscal position sufficient to cause a downgrade in the state\u2019s credit rating.\"\n\nSean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida\u2019s Institute for Economic Competitiveness, said the combination of the severe national recession, a housing bust and a financial crisis amounted to a perfect storm for the state.\n\n\"As 401(k)s \u00a0turned into 201(k)s,\" fewer retirees could move to Florida, Snaith said. This, in turn, dealt a body blow to the construction and real estate sectors. \"This tied the Florida economy\u2019s hands behind its back,\" Snaith said. \"Those factors, more than anything, made the recession harder to recover from. \u2026 The source of the state\u2019s woes certainly was not borrowing and spending.\"\n\nMeanwhile, tourism, a backbone of Florida\u2019s economy, couldn\u2019t last for long in this economic environment, said Paul M. Mason, an economist at the University of North Florida. The decline in housing values -- exacerbated by investors shifting money from housing to oil funds when petroleum prices surged in the summer of 2008 -- \"made people feel less wealthy, putting a major damper on tourism from both inside and outside the state,\" he said.\n\nOne lesson of the last recession is that the Florida economy is deeply intertwined with the national economy, experts say. \"Whatever factors contributed to the last national recession and its aftermath also contributed to the state\u2019s recession and its aftermath,\" said Joseph DeSalvo, an economist at the University of South Florida.\n\nAs for tax rates, they would be \"an extremely low-rated cause of economic decline,\" said Elizabeth Strom, an urban and regional planning professor at the University of South Florida. \"For Florida, the national recession coupled with our economic dependence on real estate development and the huge speculative bubble that popped alongside national economic recession would have far stronger explanatory power.\"\n\nThere may be one silver lining for Florida, said Scott J. Brown, senior vice president and chief economist at Raymond James Financial, based in St. Petersburg. \"Areas of the country that had larger housing bubbles, such as Florida, were going to have larger corrections,\" Brown said. \"However, with housing recovering in most areas of the country, Florida has more room for improvement in housing than most other states. Bigger bubble, bigger bust, bigger (eventual) recovery.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nScott blamed a \"legacy of taxing and borrowing\" for the poor state economy he inherited. But the experts we contacted said that fiscal matters were a small factor, if at all. Real estate, the national recession, and their impacts on such key sectors as construction and tourism were the overwhelming causes. We rate Scott\u2019s claim False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Shortly after we published this fact-check, we received a response from Scott's office.
