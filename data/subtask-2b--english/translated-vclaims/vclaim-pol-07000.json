The girl &apos; s organization cited Trans Canada &apos; s estimates for a total of 9,000 positions, and Radz responded to the United States Department of State &apos; s estimates, which were mandated to recommend the project to President Barack Obama because he crossed international borders. \"There are others who say that jobs wouldn't be too big, going to less than 4,000 jobs, and that jobs would only be here for two years,\" said Radz. \"The Department of State, according to the Department of State, says that once the proposed project enters service, operations will require about 50 of the total personnel in the United States.\" With reference to the same report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs mentioned by Radz, Girling highlighted its findings in support of the project for 42,000 \"direct and indirect\" jobs. \"For about two years,\" cut Radz in. \"No,\" said a girl, \"42,000 jobs are in continuing, permanent jobs.\" The girl made it seem as if the Foreign Ministry's assessment related to permanent - or at least long-term - jobs, with her described as \"continuing, permanent.\" However, this is an inaccurate method of assessing these job creation estimates. The January 2014 Department of State report, which assessed the environmental and economic impact of the project on the country, concluded that \"a total of 42,100 jobs across the United States will be supported by the construction of the proposed project.\" These posts are measured on an \"annual average\" basis, which means that one post has been filled for one year. This total reflects both jobs created directly as a result of the construction and manufacturing of the pipeline, as well as casual jobs supported by construction workers who buy materials for the project or spend their wages in the economy. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 12 January 2021, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, construction will require approximately 10,400 seasonal workers for periods of either four or eight months. This work operates in 3,900 \"annual average\" jobs over one year of construction, or 1,950 jobs per year if it takes two years to complete the project. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates that 26,100 indirect and induced jobs will be supported by the construction of the proposed project during the construction phase. The functions are to provide the supply chain to Keystone as well as staff spending on housing, food, recreation, health care, etc. It is important, as Radez said, that these posts will be supported only during the construction phase, which is expected to take one to two years. After construction, the pipeline will employ approximately 50 people, mainly for maintenance. A spokesman for Trans Canada told us that \"the girl crossed herself\" as he described the benefits of the project for the economy, and that only 42,000 jobs were during the two-year construction period. \"The point here is that many seem to devalue construction functions because they are simply 'partial',\" said James Miller, highlighting the thousands of workers paid by Trans Canada to build the Keystone pipeline base in 2010 and the south leg that opened in January 2014. \"That's how the profession works.\" \"This is one of the largest infrastructure projects on books in the United States right now, a $8 billion project so saying that it won't benefit American workers and the American economy is ridiculous,\" said Miller. \"The ruling girl to whom we belong has moved away from Radz' point that an estimated 42,000 jobs supported by the Keystone XL pipeline will last for only two years, saying, \"No, the 42,000 jobs in continuing and permanent jobs.\" This description does not apply to 99 per cent of the direct, indirect and induced posts supported by the proposed Keystone XL project, which are temporary and will last for more than two years. A spokesman for \"girl\" admitted this fact. We're assessing his statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07000"}
