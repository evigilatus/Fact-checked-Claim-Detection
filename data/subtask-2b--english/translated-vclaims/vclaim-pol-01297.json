A recent suggestion on this theory suggests that immigrants fleeing Central America are coming to pick you up. \"All we want is a better life in your country,\" begins the Facebook article one that appeared in November. \"So we're gonna throw rocks and try to kill you.\" The text depicts about two dozen men in what appears to be a dusty spoon. Some guys have their guns in the air, and many of them seem to throw something. \"Dixon Diaz 2018\" appears to be written in the lower left corner. \"For liberal, it's fine for the poor who seek refuge from violence to throw rocks at you,\" said Governor Snarky 2, who posted the picture, According to news reports, some members of the migrant convoy threw stones at the border between Guatemala and Mexico. They also threw sticks during a confrontation with the Mexican police on 28 October, according to Associated Press, a clash left a dead immigrant with a head wound, although the cause was unclear. In November 1, President Donald Trump said that he had told the army that troops should respond to any rocks thrown at them by immigrants as if they were guns. However, AP reports, \"while some immigrants have collided with the Mexican police on a bridge on Guatemala's border, most of those travelling with convoys have been peaceful and say they are fleeing violence and poverty at home.\" \"We're not killers,\" communications agency quote Stephanie Lopez, a 21-year-old Salvadoran woman, he says. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in the Facebook newspaper Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Butterman (January 12, 2021).

In an examination of the facts in 2016, Snoops observed that \"prefect Snarky\" was the creation of blogger Dixon Diaz - the name apparently signed on the photo with 2018. However, the reverse search for Google shows results related to the first uprising in 1987, when Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip rioted following the death of four Palestinian workers. Because the Palestinians were largely unarmed, the BBC stated 20 years after the revolution, \"The permanent image of the uprising is one of young men and boys throwing stones and stones at Israeli forces.\" In an article of the NSIA magazine in 2017, Jeremy Bartmann wrote that throwing rocks was the focus of the identity and definition of the intifada. \"The shooting was the most visible tactic used by Palestinians in the first intifada.\" The picture appears on many blogs, although information about the image, including the name of the photographer, is missing. A site called Torahcode.us contains the picture in an undated site about the intifada with the title: \"Palestinian youth throw rocks during the intifada.\" An undated schedule of the Arab-Israeli conflict published on Timittoast.com, which allows users to set up Internet schedules, uses the picture to illustrate the \"first uprising\" in 1987. Other websites where the picture is published also show that it precedes the history of the migration convoy. It was included in a presentation of images attributed to the intifada on WordPress - \"Palestina en el curazon,\" by Maria Landi - December 2017. The reverse image search on TinEye.com shows that the first time the web site was found was in 2008, when it was used as part of an entrance to Inciclopedia.wikia.com, a free Spanish encyclopedia on the Internet such as Wikipedia. The title of that photograph, when translated from Spanish, is: \"Squadron 202 of the Mexican Army Special Forces using Soviet weapons.\" But when you press the history of the image file, it says that the picture is called \"Palestinian Youth 2www.jpg\" and was created in March 2007. Although the picture is widely used in connection with the uprising, we have not been able to find any news reports or ex post facto reports showing the image with an official address or attributed to a photographer or a publication. But it's obviously been there since at least the middle of the first decade of the 20th century, and her shitty quality suggests she was older. Moreover, there are no reliable outlets linked to Central American immigrants seeking asylum in the United States.
