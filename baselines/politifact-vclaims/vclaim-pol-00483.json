She added, \"This is some modern expression attributed to Franklin. The man was more eloquent and pithy.\"\nA search though the volumes of Franklin\u2019s collected works on the database produced no results for any portion of the quote. As well, a list of famous quotes from the inventor on the Franklin Institute website, a science museum that houses the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial, also did not include the quote.\u00a0\u00a0\nEtymologist Barry Popik also researched the quote in 2013 and found no evidence Franklin said or wrote it. Popik reported that the phrase \"has been cited in print since only about 1999 \u2013 far removed from Franklin\u2019s lifetime.\"\u00a0\nThis \"quote\" is Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00483"}
