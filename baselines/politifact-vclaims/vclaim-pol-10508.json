Jeb Bush, who is bilingual and met his wife in Mexico, has warned his fellow Republicans they need to watch their tone on the immigration issue. He repeated that warning in an interview on Meet the Press the weekend before the convention.\n\n\"My personal view is that we need to get beyond where we are,\" Bush said. \"We need to create a climate of border control. And that\u2019s begun to happen, if you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it\u2019s net zero. It\u2019s been that way now for almost two years. And if you say, well, we\u2019ve gotten a much better grasp on the number of people just coming in without papers, then you could develop a strategy that\u2019s part of economic growth. \u2026\"\n\nFor this fact-check, we will research \u00a0whether Bush was correct when he said the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country is net zero, and that it\u2019s been that way for two years.\n\nPew Hispanic Center studies\n\nWe turned to the Pew Hispanic Center for an answer. The center is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues.\n\nIts 2012 report about Mexican immigration concluded, \"After four decades that brought 12 million current immigrants -- most of whom came illegally -- the net migration flow from Mexico to the United States has stopped and may have reversed.\" The report was based on the center\u2019s analysis of federal census data.\n\nWe interviewed Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew and an expert on Hispanic immigration. He said that Bush\u2019s claim is true. Passel said that we can infer that the outflow of unauthorized immigrants exceeded inflows between 2007 and 2009 because the overall size of the unauthorized population living in the U.S. decreased between 2007 and 2009 from 12 million to 11.1 million.\n\nThere are four ways the number of unauthorized immigrants changes: the inflow of new unauthorized immigrants, the outflow of those leaving the U.S., deaths and unauthorized immigrants gaining legal status.\n\nThose last three categories -- outflow out of the U.S., deaths and conversion to legal status -- exceeded the first category of new inflows \u00a0of unauthorized immigrants by about 900,000 between 2007 and 2009. But deaths and conversion to legal status are not large figures. Therefore, Passel said, \"the major source of the decline is almost certainly an excess of outflow of unauthorized over inflow.\"\n\nYou can read about Pew\u2019s reports about net migration from Mexico here and in general about trends in the illegal immigration population here and here.\n\nWe also sent Bush\u2019s claim to groups with opposing views on immigration and all agreed that Bush\u2019s statement was correct.\n\n\"I think you will find everybody agrees with it being zero or close to it,\" said Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA, which advocates for low immigration.\n\nA spokeswoman for The National Immigration Forum, which advocates for immigrants, sent us a New York Times op-ed piece co-written by two professors, one a former foreign minister of Mexico and the other co-director \u00a0of the Mexican Migration Project at Princeton. That op-ed piece also stated that the rate of undocumented immigration is nearing zero.\n\n Our ruling\n\nBush said \"If you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it is net zero. It's been that way now for almost two years.\"\n\nIt is difficult to get a precise figure on the \u00a0population of illegal immigrants. But data from Pew Hispanic Center, a widely respected source referred to by those of different political viewpoints on immigration, supports Bush\u2019s claim.\n\nWe rate this claim True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10508"}
