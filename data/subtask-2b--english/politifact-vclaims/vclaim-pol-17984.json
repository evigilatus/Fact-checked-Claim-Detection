Get them out of here. They have no place for them.\"\u00a0\nAlso on June 10, Bob Pockrass, FOX Sports\u2019 NASCAR reporter, tweeted that NASCAR removed the rule that previously required drivers to stand for the national anthem. There were no changes prohibiting playing \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" however.\u00a0\nIn fact, on June 14, the Dixie Vodka 400 from Homestead-Miami Speedway included a pre-race prayer, the playing of the national anthem and a military flyover. The prayer was delivered by former NFL player Tony Boselli, the national anthem was performed by Grammy-award winning artist Jon Secada and, following the song, four F-16 fighter wings conducted the military flyover from the Homestead Air Force base in Homestead, Fla.\nOur ruling\nFacebook posts have claimed that NASCAR has removed the pre-race prayer, military flyover and the singing of the national anthem from races for being too controversial. NASCAR has only removed the presence of the confederate flag at races, but has not removed any of the listed pre-race traditions. Also, drivers are not required to stand for the national anthem, allowing them peaceful protests to occur per the drivers\u2019 discretion.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17984"}
