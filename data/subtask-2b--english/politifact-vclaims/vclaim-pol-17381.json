(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nTrump did accept African Americans and Jews at Mar-a-Lago at a time when most private clubs in Palm Beach, Fla., were not open to them.\u00a0\nBut it was a business move, not a crusade, and he did not sue in court to do so.\nReviewing history\nHere\u2019s what happened, based on reports from the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, Vanity Fair and other media.\nMar-a-Lago (in Spanish, sea-to-lake) was a mansion built by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post in 1927. Trump bought the 128-room, 20-acre estate and its furnishings in 1985, for $9 million.\u00a0\nTrump used Mar-a-Lago as a private residence until 1995, when he turned it into a private club, open to anyone who could afford the $100,000 initiation fee.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat made his club different from other Palm Beach clubs (only one was open to Jews). Trump\u2019s club was the first to accept African Americans and openly gay couples, according to the Washington Post.\nTrump lawyer Paul Rampell eventually persuaded Trump of the business value of wider membership by arguing that Palm Beach had many Jewish residents but they had no real club of their own, Laurence Leamer wrote in his book, \"Mar-a-Lago: Inside the Gates of Power at Donald Trump\u2019s Presidential Palace.\"\nSo, what about a lawsuit?\nBefore making Mar-a-Lago a private club, Trump originally wanted to subdivide the land and sell mansions on it. After a year of meetings and hearings, the Palm Beach Town Council voted down the project.\u00a0\nAfter Trump sued the town for $50 million, the town approved the club (the lawsuit was settled), but with restrictions to limit traffic and noise.\nTrump didn\u2019t invoke African Americans and Jews until he tried to get those restrictions lifted. In December 1996, when the town council refused, he sued, alleging that the town was discriminating against Mar-a-Lago, in part because it was open to Jews and African Americans. The town denied the allegation, saying it was merely deciding a zoning matter.\nIn any case, the lawsuit was not about opening the club to Jews and African Americans; it was already open to them.\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook post claims: \"Donald Trump sued the City of Palm Beach when he bought a segregated club, Mar A Lago, to open it to Jews & Blacks.\"\nTrump used Mar-a-Lago for a private residence for a decade before opening it as a private club. He was a pioneer, of sorts, in Palm Beach by opening it to Jewish people and African Americans. But he did so on his own, for business reasons, and he didn\u2019t have to go to court.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17381"}
