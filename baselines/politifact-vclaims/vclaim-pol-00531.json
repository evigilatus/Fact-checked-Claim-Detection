But now he is being accused of benefiting from it.\nMcCready\u2019s opponent in the do-over election, Republican Dan Bishop, called him out in a May 31\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0for receiving support from dark money organizations, citing an\u00a0article\u00a0by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative political journalism website.\n\"Turns out \u2018Wrong Dan\u2019 (McCready) got nearly $1 million in support from a Nancy Pelosi aligned dark money org in the 2018 election cycle right after he tweeted, \u2018Dark money has no place in our politics,\u2019.\" Bishop\u2019s post says.\nPolitiFact North Carolina found this claim particularly interesting because McCready has been outspoken about his opposition to dark money. When we contacted his campaign, it released a statement from McCready saying he believes that \"money is corrupting our politics and that we\u2019ve got to take on special interests and the status quo, which is why if elected to Congress I will advocate for the mandatory disclosure of all donors to dark money groups.\"\n\"Federal election law expressly prohibits candidates from coordinating with a political nonprofit on its independent expenditure spending, and the McCready campaign fully complied with the law,\" Amanda Sherman, a spokesperson for McCready\u2019s campaign, said in an email.\nSherman also said McCready has been endorsed by End Citizens United, a group dedicated to reversing the Supreme Court decision that allowed dark money groups to grow in influence, Citizens United v. FEC. So, we decided to investigate further.\nIt turns out McCready indeed got support from a dark money group. As for the connection to Pelosi, the truth is a little more complicated.\nWHAT IS DARK MONEY?\nThe\u00a0Center for Responsive Politics\u00a0defines dark money as \"political spending meant to influence the decision of a voter, where the donor is not disclosed and the source of the money is unknown.\"\nDark money groups are usually either political nonprofits that are not required to disclose their donors or super PACs, which are allowed to accept unlimited donations from political nonprofits and other corporations that may or may not have disclosed their donors. Dark money organizations exist on both sides of the political spectrum -- some examples of 501(c) political nonprofits are Planned Parenthood and the National Rifle Association.\n\"If you look at the overall amount spent on elections, (dark money) is a relatively small part, but when you look at the most contested races, it\u2019s when you see dark money playing a big role,\" Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at the Campaign Legal Center, said. \"Dark money and outside money, generally, tend to gravitate towards the most competitive races.\"\nMcCready\u2019s 2018 congressional race against Republican Mark Harris was one of those tight elections that drew outside spending.\nDID MCCREADY GET SUPPORT FROM DARK MONEY?\nPatriot Majority USA is a lesser known, liberal-leaning dark money nonprofit. We found that, as Bishop said, the group supported McCready in 2018.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatriot Majority spent $944,060 against Harris. However, Patriot Majority did not send money directly to McCready\u2019s campaign. Instead, it ran\u00a0TV ads\u00a0attacking Harris\u2019 campaign for being \"out of step\" with North Carolina families and alleging that Harris wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare. The ads did not say anything about McCready.\n\u00a0\nAnna Massoglia, a researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics who specializes in dark money, said this is a common tactic used by these organizations.\n\"In many cases, the spending that we do see on political ads by dark money is more common actually against a candidate than in support of one,\" Massoglia said. \"...They aren\u2019t necessarily \u2018using\u2019 dark money, I wouldn\u2019t use that term. I would say that they benefit from dark money whether they like it or not.\"\nIf a dark money organization decides to use their money against a candidate, there is really not much a campaign can do, said Robin Kolodny, a professor of political science at Temple University who specializes in political consultants and campaign finances.\n\"(Patriot Majority USA) is entirely independent of the campaign and there is nothing either candidate could do to stop the spending even if they wanted to,\" Kolodny said. \"The Supreme Court has held time and again that people may exercise their free speech in whatever amounts they wish.\"\nIS PATRIOT MAJORITY USA ALIGNED WITH NANCY PELOSI?\nThe claim that McCready is in cahoots with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was actually the subject of\u00a0another fact-check\u00a0by PolitiFact, based on a claim made by Harris in 2018 that was found Half True.\n\"It\u2019s certainly true that Patriot Majority is a dark money group, and that they support Democrats, and that they\u2019re aligned with Democrats,\" Fischer said. \"I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s enough to say that they\u2019re specifically aligned with Nancy Pelosi, unless they\u2019re using Nancy Pelosi as a stand-in for all Democrats.\"\nWhile we know that Patriot Majority USA spent almost all of its money in support of Democratic House candidates, we couldn\u2019t find a record of Patriot Majority USA being connected to Pelosi.\nThe McCready campaign also received support from the House Majority PAC \u2014 a super PAC that is not considered dark money because it discloses its sponsors, according to Massoglia. House Majority PAC is known to be aligned with Pelosi. She raised money for it in 2011, when it first started. In 2018, the House Majority PAC spent $340,018 against Harris, benefiting McCready.\n\u00a0\nOUR RULING\nBishop is correct that McCready received support from a dark money group. The McCready campaign did not take money from the group and cannot control the independent expenditures of outside organizations, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the campaign benefited.\nWhile we know that Patriot Majority USA is aligned with the Democratic Party and spent most of its money on House Democrats, we didn\u2019t find evidence that Pelosi is aligned with Patriot Majority USA. And while the Pelosi-aligned House Majority PAC did support the McCready campaign by spending money against Harris, it is not considered a dark money group because it discloses its donors.\nTherefore, we rate Bishop\u2019s statement Mostly True.\nUPDATE: This story was updated after publication to add McCready's position on changing campaign disclosure laws. This does not change our ruling.\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
