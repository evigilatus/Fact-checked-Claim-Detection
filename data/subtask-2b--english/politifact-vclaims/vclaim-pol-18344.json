Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., that affects your primary residence \u2014 whether you rent or own.\nHad it become law, H.R. 6515, also called the Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act, would have meant that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development would have cut you a check for any rent or mortgage payment you had made for April (or later months, if you\u2019re someone who pays ahead).\nAlso, you would not owe any rent or mortgage payments until 30 days after the end date of the COVID-19 emergency declaration signed by President Donald Trump.\u00a0\nAs it is, though, no action has yet been taken on the bill, other than it being referred to the House Committee on Financial Service. A service used by GovTrack.us, which tracks legislation, says the bill has a 4% chance of being passed.\nThis post makes it sound like it\u2019s a done deal.
