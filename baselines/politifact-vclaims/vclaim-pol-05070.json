Jackson\u2019s appearance on the bill has stirred up controversy as of late, especially because Jackson, a populist and a war hero, presided over the removal of approximately 46,000 Native Americans from their land.\nWe wondered if Carson had his historical facts straight. We took Carson\u2019s statement to mean that Jackson was the last president to do both things: balance the budget and eliminate debt.\nA lot of presidents have presided over balanced budgets, which is when the government takes in more revenue than it spends, leading to no net borrowing in that year. But a balanced budget doesn\u2019t necessarily mean no debt, because old debt can carry over from previous years. Jackson was, in fact, the only president to preside over a total elimination of all remaining debt while having a balanced budget.\nHowever, this wasn\u2019t nearly as dramatic of an accomplishment as it would be today. Experts told us to take this factoid with a grain of salt because the debt was already on its way down, and by the time Jackson took office, the amount of debt was trivial.\nThe history\nJackson, who served from 1829-37, was an ardent supporter of keeping banks and government separated. He believed that banks would have undue influence on government, and he was hell-bent on eliminating the debt.\n(Jackson was also deeply skeptical of paper currency, which adds some irony to the current debate over his position on the $20 bill.)\nIn January 1829, the debt was about $58 million. (Jackson took office that March.) In today\u2019s dollars, that amounts to about $1.4 billion. The total public debt outstanding today is higher by many orders of magnitude: $19.2 trillion.\nJackson watched that debt scale down to zero in 1835. According to the Treasury Department, the debt remained close to zero when Jackson left office.\nBut Jackson didn\u2019t have to take much action to make this happen. Since the end of the War of 1812, which racked up a lot of debt, Congress required debt reductions of at least $10 million per year under under Jackson\u2019s two predecessors, James Monroe and John Quincy Adams. So all Jackson really had to do was maintain the status quo, said Daniel Feller, a Jackson expert at the University of Tennessee.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The policy of paying off the debt happened before Jackson, and he happened to be president\" when the debt hit zero, Feller said.\nIn addition to continuing the already-established debt-reduction policy, Jackson vetoed some infrastructure bills that would have spent money on things like building roads.\nHe also liquidated the Second Bank of the United States, a precursor to the Federal Reserve, resulting in a massive surplus of government money that was used to pay off the last of the debt, said Neil Buchanan, an expert in federal spending patterns at George Washington University Law School.\nImmediately following Jackson\u2019s departure, the country experienced a financial crisis, the Panic of 1837. The panic resulted from several factors, including the collapse of a speculative land bubble and international capital flows, but some economists believe Jackson\u2019s fiscal policies should carry some of the blame.\n\"The country did eventually have the good sense to borrow again, to finance the country's enormous economic expansion throughout the 19th and 20th centuries,\" Buchanan said, noting that it is not always desirable to bring debt down to zero.\nWhile the only president to see a national debt of zero, Jackson certainly wasn\u2019t the only president who presided over a balanced budget.\nIn today\u2019s world, it\u2019s rare for the federal government to balance its budget, meaning revenue is higher than expenditures. Since the 1960s, only five years have had balanced federal budgets: 1969 under President Richard Nixon; 1998, 1999 and 2000 under Bill Clinton; and 2001 under George W. Bush.\nBut in earlier years, balanced budgets were much more regular. From 1900 to 1960, about 25 years had balanced budgets, according to government historical tables. Before that, we don\u2019t have \u00a0year-to-year budget breakdowns. But we do know that there was an overall budget surplus from 1800 through 1850, so balanced budgets were a fairly regular occurrence around the time Jackson was in office. Fuller backed up that point.\n\"Carson is merely applauding Jackson for having paid off the debt through a one-time gimmick,\" as opposed to adjusting policy to keep the debt low for the long run, Buchanan said.\nOur ruling\nCarson said, \"Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt.\"\nExperts say this feat doesn\u2019t really deserve the plaudits Carson is giving it, but Carson has his facts basically right. Jackson was the last \u2014 and only \u2014 president to bring the national debt to zero on top of having a balanced budget.\nThe statement is accurate but needs added context, which is our definition of Mostly True.\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/72b86490-26c7-4af9-81a5-736827d02e19", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05070"}
