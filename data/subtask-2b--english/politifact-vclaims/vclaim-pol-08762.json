Here's the real story", "text": "To political operatives, campaign mailers are often considered the most effective way to target voters, particularly in local elections.\nTo fact-checkers, they\u2019re often home to glaring distortions.\nToday\u2019s example: A flier in the St. Petersburg mayor race that links incumbent Bill Foster, a $10 million fire fee and Republican Gov. Rick Scott.\nA headline on the mailer reads, \"Bill Foster's $10 million Rick Scott-inspired fire fee.\"\n\"Foster\u2019s $10 million fire fee would have charged you for services you already pay for. Sound familiar?\" the text continues. \"Instead of taking leadership by cutting fluff out of the budget, Bill Foster took a page out of Rick Scott\u2019s Tallahassee playbook and tried to charge us millions of dollars in \u2018fees\u2019 that taxed you for services the government should have already been providing -- $10 million of them!\"\nThe flier comes from Fact Check Florida, an electioneering communication organization, or ECO, that supports liberal candidates and is run by Jacksonville resident Matthew Martz. As an ECO, Fact Check Florida (nice name, by the way) can pay for ads that attack candidates, but it cannot expressly advocate for a candidate\u2019s defeat or election. It can tell you why it thinks Foster is a bad guy but can\u2019t tell you to vote for Foster\u2019s opponent, Rick Kriseman.\nAbout the fire fee\nYes, Foster pitched a fire readiness assessment, or \"fire fee\" in 2012 as a way to plug the city\u2019s budget gap after another year of disappearing property tax revenues.\nBut the idea was not \"inspired\" by Scott in any way.\n\"It was funny because it was from Fact Check Florida,\" Foster told us, \"and there was nothing factual about it.\"\nIn Foster\u2019s first two years in office, the city made up for lost property tax revenues (a result of declining home values) by reducing positions and program spending. Foster criticized a potential fire fee as a \"backdoor tax increase\" in those years. But in 2012, he suggested that instead of more cuts, the City Council approve a new fire readiness fee that would total $9 million a year, which was about the amount needed to close its gap for 2013.\nThe latest version of the proposal called for property owners to pay $50 a year per parcel and $.21 per $1,000 of its appraised structural value annually, according to Tampa Bay Times archives.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome council members criticized the fire fee as disproportionately punishing low-income residents by asking them to pay the same amount as wealthier residents. The council rejected the idea and instead raised the city\u2019s property tax rate for the first time in two decades. \u00a0\nFoster recently tried to distance himself from the fire fee that he was linked to so closely in news coverage. With Kriseman using it as an example of failed leadership, Foster told the Tampa Bay Times that he did not come up with the proposal, pointing to records that showed council members asked the idea to be considered at a workshop eight months before they ultimately rejected it. (This revelation came after the mailpiece was distributed, so we don\u2019t hold it against the group for not including.)\nThe connection to Scott\nLet\u2019s go back to the ad. At its most generous reading, the ad implies Foster followed Scott\u2019s lead of raising fees for existing services. But that does not align with Scott\u2019s record in office, which has not seen major tax or fee increases beyond increases to tuition.\nThe state also has cut taxes and fees for Floridians since Scott took office. You can read about that here.\nFact Check Florida's Martz defended the mailer. While the fee was \"obviously\" not Scott\u2019s idea, he said, it\u2019s similar to Tallahassee Republicans who \"keep coming up with tiny ways to take money out of voters\u2019 pockets without them noticing.\"\n\"Under Rick Scott, it was with tuition rates,\" he said. \"And before he got there, the Republicans did it with driver\u2019s license renewals and things.\"\nMartz\u2019s last point refers to $2.2 billion in increased taxes and fees that Republican lawmakers passed in 2009 -- before Scott became governor.\nThe St. Petersburg mayor\u2019s race is nonpartisan, but the injection of Scott highlights the political differences between the two candidates. Foster is a Republican who has Scott\u2019s endorsement, while Kriseman is Democrat whose campaign is being partly financed by the Florida Democratic Party. Another third-party group led by Tallahassee lobbyist David Ramba is attacking Kriseman in a separate mailer for sharing partisan policies akin to the ones that brought about the government shutdown.\nThe evolution was inevitable after the city voted in 1993 to move to a strong mayor system, argues Darryl Paulson, University of South Florida St. Petersburg professor emeritus of government. In the case of this ad, tying Foster with an unpopular governor appeals to the emotions of voters, Paulson said.\n\"The Democrats are in essence trying to say that even though it\u2019s not a partisan race, look who is supporting Foster, and we as Democrats hate the governor,\" Paulson said. \"It\u2019s really designed as a get out the vote effort to get Democratic voters to to vote in a nonpartisan election.\"\nOur ruling\nA mailpiece attempts to connect Foster\u2019s rejected proposal for a fire readiness fee with Scott. This is junk mail.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08762"}
