On the list: One of Dewhurst\u2019s horses threw a shoe; Dewhurst, who is wealthy, was in Tokyo; his private jet broke down.\n\nWe fixed on reason No. 2: \"Come on, would you want to show up and have to defend your record promoting an income tax?\"\n\nTexas is one of nine states lacking a state income tax. The last statewide elected official to publicly suggest one, the late Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, left office in early 1999, nearly eight years after he briefly maintained that a state personal income tax made economic sense. The prospect proved so unpopular, Bullock later ushered in a constitutional amendment requiring voter approval before a personal income tax can become law.\n\nSo, we wondered about Cruz\u2019s claim.\n\nAt the debate, reporter Brad Watson of Dallas\u2019 WFAA-TV asked Cruz what proof he had of Dewhurst promoting an income tax. Cruz replied that in 2006, Dewhurst told The Associated Press, \"I think I\u2019d rather see a tax that is based on income.\"\n\nAlso, Cruz said, the Wall Street Journal editorialized in 2005 that Dewhurst was \"pushing what he called a wage tax.\" Cruz, quoting the editorial, continued: \"A wage tax is of course a fancy disguise for a personal income tax.\"\n\nIt\u2019s way-back time.\n\nTo assess Cruz\u2019s claim, we looked into the mid-decade efforts by state leaders to overhaul the state\u2019s tax system partly to drive down local school property taxes. Those debates culminated in a 2006 revision of the business franchise tax and other tax changes.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s plumb the articles offered by Cruz as proof of Dewhurst\u2019s actions.\n\nA March 30, 2006, AP news article, headlined \"Businesses studying proposed tax structure,\" indeed quotes Dewhurst as saying: \"I think I'd rather see a tax that's based on income \u2014 you earn money, you pay something, you don't earn money, you don't pay anything.\"\n\nWe can see why a critic would single out that comment, though the full AP story indicates that Dewhurst was speaking to the particulars of revamping the business franchise tax rather than advancing his desire to create a personal or business income tax.\n\nThe story initially points out that lawmakers had previously stumbled over how to restructure the business tax, which most corporations did not owe. \"They worried that proposals would not apply equally to different business structures,\" the article says. \"And business-friendly Republicans have been hesitant to levy a new tax that could be harmful to job creation and economic growth.\"\n\nAccording to the story, the consensus proposed fix -- which was a plan devised by a panel headed by John Sharp, a former Texas state comptroller -- would tax businesses on a percentage of their gross receipts, meaning the money a company brought in before expenses, with each company choosing between deductions for cost of goods sold or employee benefits like salary and health care. The story says sole proprietors and general partnerships would be exempt, along with companies that have annual gross receipts of $300,000 or less.\n\nFor more than 80 years, the story says, the state\u2019s main business tax had been based on a company\u2019s net assets, though lawmakers changed it in 1991 to make it more like a corporate income tax. Texas companies subsequently had the choice of paying either 0.25 percent of the value of their net assets or 4.5 percent of their net corporate income, whichever was greater, according to a 2003 report on Texas taxes by the nonpartisan House Research Organization.\n\nIn 2006, lawmakers revised the franchise tax along the lines of the Sharp proposal.\n\nThe March 2006 AP story, published before lawmakers acted, says two business groups seemed receptive to the proposed overhaul. But it quotes the president of the Texas Auto Dealers Association expressing concern that a gross receipts-based tax would be assessed against businesses even if they had not earned a profit.\n\nNext, the story quotes Dewhurst as saying that the Texas Senate, over which he presides, is sensitive to that concern. It then quotes him saying he\u2019d rather see a tax based on income so if you earn money, you \u00a0pay something and if you don\u2019t, you do not.\n\nDewhurst appears to have reconsidered his comment the next day -- or, perhaps, recognized how it might be taken as a politically risky, Bullock-like call for a state income tax. According to an April 1, 2006, Houston Chronicle news article, Dewhurst \"retreated from his statement a day earlier that he favored basing a business tax on a company's income, rather than its gross receipts.\" The story quotes Dewhurst saying: \"I have always opposed a business or personal income tax.\"\n\nCruz told us in a telephone interview that he reads Dewhurst\u2019s initial comment as noted by the AP as indicating he was for a business income tax.\n\nHe urged us to put stock as well in the May 10, 2005, Journal editorial, headlined \"Deep in the Heart of Texas,\" which takes Dewhurst to task for state budget and tax proposals then in circulation within the Republican-led Legislature. The editorial states that Texas\u2019 status as a state without an income tax is \"in serious peril,\" continuing: \"Both the state Senate and House have endorsed what Mr. Dewhurst -- whose post of lieutenant governor is nearly as powerful as governor in the state -- is calling a \u2018wage tax.\u2019 A wage tax is of course a fancy disguise for a personal income tax, and imposing one is a sure way to put a state on the path to slower growth.\"\n\nCruz told us: \"The wage tax that (Dewhurst) promoted is effectively the same thing as an income tax,\" though Dewhurst, he said, \"wasn\u2019t foolish enough to use the label \u2018income tax.\u2019\"\n\nThe Journal editorial airs concerns about possible tax increases to cover cuts in school property taxes, among them a new wage or payroll tax, which the editorial calls a toll on employers for hiring workers.\n\nFinally, Cruz suggested significance in Dewhurst\u2019s subsequent letter to the Journal regarding the editorial; the response talks up the Senate\u2019s tax plan, but is silent on the Journal\u2019s likening of a wage/payroll tax to a business income tax.\n\nWith Cruz\u2019s backup laid out, let\u2019s turn to other signs of an income tax plan being offered or endorsed by Dewhurst in 2005-06.\n\nA Nexis search for such news articles shows the House and Senate each explored numerous tax ideas.\n\nWe spotted no stories on Dewhurst or anyone in the Republican leadership promoting a personal or business income tax. But two conservative observers said payroll tax elements of proposed House and Senate franchise tax overhauls amounted to income taxes.\n\nSome nitty gritty: The House in March 2005 approved a revenue package that offered companies a choice of paying the existing franchise tax or a 1.15 percent payroll tax on salaries up to $90,000 a year.\n\nIn May 2005, the Senate answered with a plan allowing companies to choose the lower of two taxes, as long as they generate more money than a minimum tax of 0.25 percent of gross receipts. As described in a May 12, 2005, Austin American-Statesman news article, the first option for businesses was to pay 2.5 percent of the sum of their net taxable income plus payroll, though they could deduct from the tax base either half of their payrolls or $30,000 per employee plus the cost of some health benefits. The second option in the Senate plan would have required \u00a0companies to pay a 1.75 percent payroll tax, capped at $1,500 per employee.\n\nIn an opinion column published in the American-Statesman March 16, 2005, Matthew J. Griffing of the Young Conservatives of Texas said House Speaker Tom Craddick, a Republican, was to blame for the House advancing its payroll tax, which Griffing called a backdoor income tax. \"Of course, the Republican leadership does not have the courage to call this an income tax or assess it directly against the people. Instead, it calls it a \u2018payroll tax\u2019 and assesses it against employers rather than employees,\" Griffing wrote.\n\nAnd a May 21, 2005, AP news article quotes a former U.S. House Majority Leader, Dick Armey of Texas, as saying the payroll elements of the business tax proposals were the same as income taxes.\n\nThe AP article, foreshadowing that year\u2019s legislative failure to agree on how to fund cuts in school property taxes, points out that elements of measures approved by the House or Senate \"include some form of a tax on wages.\" Critics, including Armey, the story says, \"call the proposals a disguised income tax, which is illegal in Texas.\" It quotes Armey urging Gov. Rick Perry to stop the \"wage tax\" in its tracks but quotes Dewhurst as saying the proposed payroll tax was not an income tax.\n\nWas the lieutenant governor right about that?\n\nClose observers of the 2005-06 tax debate told us the payroll tax elements might have been objectionable, but they weren\u2019t generally taken as income tax schemes.\n\nBill Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business, said in a telephone interview the taxes would have been paid by employers on top of wages -- instead of being taken out of individual pay checks like an income tax. \"I don\u2019t think anyone in the Capitol thought of that as being an income tax. If they had, it wouldn\u2019t have gotten past the (committee) hearing stage,\" Hammond said.\n\nLaura Hoke, spokeswoman for the National Federation of Independent Business in Texas, said the group opposed the payroll tax proposals as job killers, but did not view them as income tax plans.\n\nDale Craymer, president of the business-membership Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, and tax analyst Dick Lavine of the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, each said the payroll tax elements were not income taxes.\n\nLavine, who has helped the center urge lawmakers to establish a state personal income tax since the mid-1990s, said he would not call the payroll tax elements income taxes partly because they failed to tap all forms of income -- such as capital gains.\n\nBroadly, Craymer said, \"there never was an income tax proposal\" from, or supported by, Dewhurst. Lavine agreed.\n\nFinally, we consulted two out-of-state tax experts who each said he wouldn\u2019t characterize payroll taxes, sometimes imposed by individual communities, as income taxes because they\u2019re levied as a percentage of an employer\u2019s payroll rather than being taken out of each employee\u2019s wages.\n\nSeen another way, payroll taxes are not based on a firm\u2019s income, Richard Pomp, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, said in a telephone interview. Instead, Pomp said, they\u2019re tied to the costs of doing business.\n\nAfter we described the payroll tax approaches considered in Texas, Michael McIntyre, a professor at the Wayne State University School of Law, saw significance in their not being based on all employees' wages, while he said income taxes are typically levied on all workers. \"I\u2019d probably say it\u2019s some other tax,\" McIntyre said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nContrary to Cruz\u2019s claim, Dewhurst has not promoted a personal or business income tax. It's even a stretch to say he edged in that direction in March 2006 with the comment he quickly forsook.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll told, the idea that Dewhurst has a record of promoting an income tax is so far from accurate, it\u2019s ridiculous.
