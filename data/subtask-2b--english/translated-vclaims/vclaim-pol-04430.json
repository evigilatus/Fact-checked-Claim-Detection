On the same day, the United States transferred $400 million in cash to Iran, holding on to money until three American editors were in the air, on their way home. Some of President Barack Obama's foreign policy critics - including the Republican candidate for President Donald Trump - put the two events together and call them \"fransome.\" The Administration denies this description. \"Iran, the world's first sponsor of terrorism, was put on the road to nuclear weapons, given $400 million in ransom cash, where they caught Obama yesterday in another lie.\" Trump said in a February 21 speech in Michigan. Although some in the national security community may regard the transaction as inappropriate, ineffective, or legally questionable, and calling it \"Fransome\" is not quite accurate. The word \"ransom\" implies that Iran refused to release prisoners unless the United States delivered more than $400 million of its own money to Iran, and American officials surrendered. In fact, the United States owed Iran $400 million as part of a protracted conflict, and negotiators used that outstanding settlement as a driving force for the release of detained Americans. Experts said that this kind of exchange is a common issue in relations between the United States and Iran over the past few decades. The important but critical difference is this: while the $400 million adjustment helped to ensure the return of prisoners to their homes, it was not an illegal payment. In accordance with the claim made by the arbitrators, Iran has a legitimate right to receive money. In 1979, Shah Mohammad Reza Bhlavi, the then leader of Iran, paid $400 million to the United States Government for military spare parts. But that year's revolution brought down the Shah, and the military parts were never handed over. In order to recover its funds, Iran filed a claim against the United States in 1981 at the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, which adjudicates disputes between the two countries. This body, which is located in The Hague, was established in the midst of negotiations aimed at ending the 1979-81 Iranian hostage crisis, in which students in favour of the revolution took over the American Embassy in Tehran. The Court &apos; s first priority was to deal with claims filed by private individuals, including 4,700 claims now filed by the United States against the Government of Iran. Over the past several years, the Tribunal has focused more attention on the allegations made by the two Governments against each other, including this dispute over the $400 million arms deal. The Department of State announced its settlement of the conflict - the United States will pay Iran $400 million plus $1.3 billion in interest - on 17 January, the same day that Obama announced the return of Americans detained in Iran, as well as the formal implementation of the nuclear agreement. The first batch of the settlement was transported on that day by an unmarked cargo plane, as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the first time in early August. The Department has paid funds using various European currencies because United States law prohibits financial transactions with Iran in United States dollars and because Iran &apos; s access to banking services is limited by international sanctions. The Administration explained that the $400 million settlement and the release of prisoners had been negotiated in separate channels and had, by chance, reached their decisions at approximately the same time. The negotiators used the opportunity of convergence to ensure that Iran returned the prisoners by withholding the sum until American detainees were in the air and headed outside Iran. \"while there is no link between $400 million and the return of our American citizens, in any event, in those final hours of the game, we stopped that payment until we learned that the Americans were safe and sound and on their way out of Iran, because, in the last few hours, Iran was playing some games here on us,\" said State Department spokesman John Kirby in an interview with BBC on August 19. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, we may never know how these negotiating channels were intertwined, but two experts who personally knew the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal told us that the Administration's interpretation was acceptable. \"With regard to the timing of this particular settlement, the Obama administration's account is fully in line with my experience,\" said Nancy Combs, who was a legal adviser to the Tribunal until she became a professor at the William and Mary Law School in 2004. Combs said that this particular allegation was huge in size, complexity and value, and it is therefore likely that lawyers were working on this issue before or apart from the prisoners issue, as well as the nuclear transaction talks. Given that these cases have been the subject of professional lawyers for many years, lawyers are likely to have contacted the Department with the news that they were in a position to resolve, unlike the administration that directed them to the settlement, John Bellinger, who served as Senior Legal Adviser in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under the leadership of President George W. Bush. \u2219 (Pellinger model tramp in public) \"I doubt that these negotiations, the settlement of claims and detained persons, were completely separate and happened to meet together at the same time,\" added Bellinger. \"I don't think it's appropriate to call this ransom, and the purpose of the money was not to win the return of these detainees.\" It should be noted that some referred to an article written by Bellinger for the Washington Post in 2009, in which he appeared to have said that the Court had indeed rejected this claim. Billinger told us that he understood that the January 2016 settlement involved a different dispute. We talked to five people studying national security and Iran. The only one who wants to call the payment \"Fransome\" is Claire Lopez, Vice President for Research and Analysis at the Centre for Security Policy, Lopez called Iran's broader deal unconstitutional and wrote to conservative websites. \"There is simply no other way to summon an unmarked cargo aircraft to hand over European currency platforms encased in the middle of the night to the world's first State sponsors of terrorism still under United States financial sanctions for terrorism,\" Lopez said. Most experts said that the ransom card was inaccurate. \"No meaning can be considered a ransom payment,\" said Combs. \"The ransom is a sum paid to ensure the release of the detained person. This amount, on the contrary, was paid to satisfy legitimate debts owed to Iran by the United States.\" Gary Samor, Executive Director of Research at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs of Harvard University, and former coordinator of the Obama White House for Arms and Weapons of Mass Destruction Control, said that it was not \"technically a ransom in that the money returned was Iran's money.\" Samour said that he was not surprised by the exchange because there was a history of using financial instruments to settle transactions with Iran. Specifically, in 2011, Oman had paid Iran $1 million on behalf of the United States to release two American hikers who had been imprisoned in Iran for two years. \"It's business as usual,\" he said. \"I don't think the Iranians will release the prisoners if they get nothing.\" Our referee Trump said that Obama's administration gave Iran $400 million in ransom money. On the same day of January, the United States paid Iran $400 million, and Iran released several American prisoners. While there seems to be a trade - the United States will not give Iran money until the prisoners return home - experts have told us that this is not worth a ransom. Iran has a legitimate right to these funds, because the United States owes them to Iran as part of the resolution of a decades-long financial dispute. It is unclear whether the prisoner and the financial disputes are linked only in the last hours of the prisoner &apos; s transfer or whether there is more advanced coordination. The Trump statement contains some elements of the right, but ignores the critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cdaae571-d1f-42af-b16b-924a46f08f71", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04430"}
