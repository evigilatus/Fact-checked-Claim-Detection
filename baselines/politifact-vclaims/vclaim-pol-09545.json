Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., in a December interview on MSNBC.\n\nHas Bloomberg? Close. But not quite.\n\nThe NRA pointed us to a Nightline interview on Dec. 20, 2012, in which the mayor says if you need more than three bullets, you\u2019re a lousy shot.\n\nAnchor Cynthia McFadden asked him about the challenge of defining an \"assault weapon.\"\n\n\"Well, if it can fire a lot of bullets very quickly, that's a good place to start, okay, and then you can argue about what a lot is,\" Bloomberg said.\n\nMcFadden starts to interject, and the mayor continues:\n\n\"Let's pick it. Let's say three. If you haven't hit the deer with three shots, you're a pretty lousy shot. The deer deserves to get away. Let's get serious here.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater, he says:\n\n\"If it's 30 bullets, or 20 bullets or 10 bullets before you run out, I would suggest, God wants that deer to live.\"\n\nMcFadden says: \"But according to gun owners, what you've just described would ban most guns used by hunters today.\"\n\nBloomberg: \"If that's what they're using, for God sakes, why aren't they using dynamite? Just make it easier. I mean, what's the sport?\"\n\nDid that interview constitute a proposal to ban more than three bullets?\n\nNot according to Bloomberg\u2019s spokesman, John McCarthy, who shared the Bloomberg speech and letter supporting legislation to ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.\n\n\"Everything we have proposed has been very public. We have never proposed that,\" McCarthy said. \u00a0\"We have been very clear about what we have wanted and have seven years' worth of public advocacy, reports, press releases and more. We have never called for that, nor did he in that interview.\"\n\n\u2018Firearms with nukes\u2019\n\nDid Bloomberg say \"the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them\"?\n\nAlmost.\n\nHe said the group would support the right to own them.\n\nHere\u2019s what he told MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski on Dec. 18, 2012\u2019s Morning Joe:\n\n\"The U.S. Army has a rifle \u2014 they call it a rifle. I would call it a cannon. It\u2019s attached to the front of a tank or a moving vehicle,\" Bloomberg said. \"It shoots a nuclear warhead. The NRA would say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a gun. And people have a right to have that.\u2019 \"\n\n(We searched for a sign the NRA would indeed say such a thing. At the moment, the group pokes fun at the idea. Meanwhile, it once blessed a ban on fully automatic machine guns, much less ones with nuclear warheads. Still, soon afterward it said it supported \"the right of law-abiding individuals to choose to own any firearm, including automatic firearms.\")\n\nWhy did Bloomberg think the NRA would support a nuclear-armed populace?\n\n\"The NRA used to support background checks, and now they don't,\" McCarthy said. \"The mayor was using a rhetorical device to point out that if you oppose every regulation, you will allow anything.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nLaPierre claimed that Bloomberg has said \"we can only have three bullets\" and \"the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them.\" He\u2019s partially right.\n\nBloomberg suggested on MSNBC that the NRA would support the right to carry a cannon firing nuclear warheads \u2014 but his point was that the organization always supports gun rights, not that it was actively promoting nuclear weapons. And while he hasn\u2019t formally proposed a three-bullet maximum, he does support banning magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and has said anyone who needs more than three is \"a pretty lousy shot.\"\n\nLaPierre hits the target, but it\u2019s no bull\u2019s-eye.
