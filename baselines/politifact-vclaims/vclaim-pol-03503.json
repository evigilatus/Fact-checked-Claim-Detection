Larry Metz, R-Yalaha, sponsored a proposal (HB 697) that would require county and local law enforcement agencies to comply with and support enforcement of federal immigration law or face stiff penalties.\nThe bill has moved along party lines in a couple of House committee hearings. It needs a full vote in the House and approval in the Senate, where it has not been heard at all, before it can reach Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s desk and become law..\nRep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, has raised strong objections.\nSmith tried to weaken the bill with six filed amendments in a March 21 hearing.\nAfter all six of his attempts failed, Smith argued that the bill\u2019s enforcement penalties are uniquely harsh.\n\"It will be the only law of its kind in the nation,\" Smith said.\nThis made us wonder: Is Florida considering one-of-a-kind legislation for sanctuary cities?\nIt looks like Smith is basically right, if the law didn't undergo any significant changes and was signed by Scott.\nNational experts agree that \u2014 to the best of their knowledge \u2014 while other states have taken up bills on sanctuary cities, no other law or pending bill goes as far in terms of the breadth of the prohibitions and the penalties imposed in HB 697.\nHB 697 offers an orginal mix of penalties\nThere is no legal definition for sanctuary policies. The term is used to describe places that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\nThe Trump administration has begun calling out cities and counties with these policies, and he promised to cancel all funding of sanctuary cities.\nCities and counties that choose not to actively assist federal authorities in carrying out immigration enforcement duties argue that such practices negatively impact police-community relations, and that ultimately it's not their responsibility to enforce federal laws.\nSome argue that the tactics used to enforce these policies border on unconstitutional, too.\nThe main way agencies refuse to comply is to not honor written requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain individuals for up to 48 hours longer than they would have been released.\nMetz\u2019s\u00a0bill doesn\u2019t call out any specific places in Florida as sanctuary cities, but a staff analysis does mention a 2010 Miami-Dade policy as an example of place that might be affected by this bill. The county\u2019s policy said that ICE detainers would only be honored if the federal government reimbursed the costs incurred.\nMiami-Dade mayor Carlos Gim\u00e9nez reversed the policy in January, putting him in the realm of compliance with Metz\u2019s legislation.\nA major component of Metz\u2019s HB 697 requires state and local entities, as well as law enforcement agencies to comply with the enforcement of federal immigration law 90 days after the law goes into effect.\nIf they don\u2019t? Cities and counties with those policies would face penalties that include:\n\u2022 a five-year suspension on receiving non-federal grant money from state and local entities that don\u2019t honor immigration enforcement;\n\u2022 The threat of automatic suspension and removal from office for elected state officials accused of violating sanctuary prohibition policy;\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 A prohibition of public funds to reimburse or defend a public official who is accused of violating a sanctuary prohibition policy; and\n\u2022 civil fines if detainers are not honored starting Oct. 1.\nSmith said his research shows no other law in the United States goes that far.\nSmith found that Alabama, Georgia, Utah and North Carolina have laws that require entities to honor all ICE detainer and information requests, but still don\u2019t go as far as HB 697.\nFor example, Alabama law restricts funds, grants, or appropriations until a violation has ceased, but doesn\u2019t have a provision to have a civil cause of action against an official if a person is injured by an undocumented immigrant.\nGeorgia law authorizes local officials to cooperate with federal immigration officials, but doesn\u2019t require it.\nUtah restricts sanctuary policies, but does not prescribe penalties.\nAnd North Carolina prohibits sanctuary cities, but there\u2019s no enforcement mechanism.\nIn addition, Indiana has a law that prohibited local governments from refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, but the penalties are lacking.\nIt can be hard to say for certain if Smith is right, but national immigration experts agree with Smith\u2019s point.\n\"If passed, that statement is accurate in that no such law is currently on the books, although several state anti-sanctuary bills are pending with some similar provisions,\" said Avideh Moussavian, a policy attorney at the National Immigration Law Center.\nSmith\u2019s research encompassed pending bills in other legislatures. While many states have pending legislation supporting compliance with ICE, he found, once again, that none of the penalties went as far as HB 697.\nAnn Morse, the director of the Immigrant Policy Project for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said her group is looking into 100 bills in more than 30 states related to local law enforcement and immigration.\nMorse said she couldn\u2019t find any pending legislation with quite the penalties listed above.\nWe also reached out to Monica Varsanyi, an associate professor at political science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY. Her research explores the explosion of state- and local-level \"immigration\" policy-making and she has authored several reports over the years regarding the topic.\n\"I can say that I haven\u2019t seen anything like this bill,\" Varsanyi said. \"I can\u2019t be 100 percent sure that there aren\u2019t others out there, however.\"\nThree other immigration law experts from around the country gave a similar assessment.\nThe only other state considering a bill anywhere close to Florida\u2019s bill is Texas, which is considering a piece of legislation that would prohibit sanctuary city policies and apply some of the same penalties included in HB 697, including withholding grant money and civil fines.\nThe penalties in Florida\u2019s bill go further by restricting grant funds for up to five years. Texas\u2019 bill only withholds funds for the following year.\nMetz told PolitiFact Florida he got the idea to withhold grant money from the Texas bill but considered its language\u00a0too general. Because this is the second year Metz has proposed this type of legislation, he was able to survey bills from the 2016 and 2017 session to see what was out there before finalizing HB 697.\n\"In some of the bills I surveyed, this year, they were looking at making it a criminal violation to have a sanctuary policy,\" Metz said. \"I did not go that route. I felt it should remain in the civil arena, but with significant penalties.\"\nOur ruling\nSmith said that a proposed crackdown on Florida\u2019s \"sanctuary cities\" HB 697 would be the \"only one of its kind in the nation.\"\nSeveral states have come up with bills targeting so-called sanctuary cities. Among them,\u00a0HB 697 in its current form is\u00a0indeed unique in terms of the severity of the prohibitions and penalties\u00a0against state and local entities that choose not to comply with federal immigration detainer requests. The Texas Legislature appears to have the next-closest version of this legislation.\u00a0\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    2 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly True  Says if a Florida bill (HB 697) punishing sanctuary cities becomes law \"it will be the only law of its kind in the nation.\"    Carlos Guillermo Smith  State Rep.    in a vote on HB 697 Tuesday, March 21, 2017 03/21/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03503"}
