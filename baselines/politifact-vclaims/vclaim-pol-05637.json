What he did in business, he argues, he can do for the country.\nRepublican and Democratic critics aim to shoot holes in that assumption. One tack is that Trump hasn\u2019t been the super savvy investor he purports to be.\nThe liberal group Occupy Democrats posted an image on its Facebook page on Dec. 2, 2015, to bring Trump down a notch or 10. Under a smiling photo of Trump, the image has these words:\n\"Bloomberg puts Trump\u2019s current net worth at $2.9 billion. ... If Trump had just put his father\u2019s money in a mutual fund that\u00a0tracked the S&P 500 and spent his career finger-painting, he\u2019d have $8 billion.\"\nThe source, included in the post, is Deborah Friedell with the London Review of Books.\nAs it turns out, the graphic from Occupy Democrats did a fine job of quoting Friedell, but Friedell did a less than stellar job of quoting the source for her claim.\nFriedell\u2019s words come from her review of a new biography of Donald Trump, Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success by Michael D\u2019Antonio. Here\u2019s the full text relevant to this fact-check:\n\"Bloomberg puts Trump\u2019s current net worth at $2.9 billion, Forbes at $4.1 billion. The National Journal has worked out that if Trump had just put his father\u2019s money in a mutual fund that tracked the S&P 500 and spent his career finger-painting, he\u2019d have $8 billion.\"\nBut if you read the National Journal story, it doesn\u2019t directly tie whatever money Trump got from his father to an eventual $8 billion today. Here\u2019s the key paragraph from a Sept. 2, 2015, article headlined \"The 1 Easy Way Donald Trump Could Have Been Even Richer: Doing Nothing.\"\n\"Had the celebrity busi\u00adness\u00adman and Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial can\u00addid\u00adate in\u00adves\u00adted his even\u00adtu\u00adal share of his fath\u00ader\u2019s real-es\u00adtate com\u00adpany in\u00adto a mu\u00adtu\u00adal fund of S&P 500 stocks in 1974, it would be worth nearly $3 bil\u00adlion today, thanks to the mar\u00adket\u2019s per\u00adform\u00adance over the past four dec\u00adades. If he\u2019d in\u00adves\u00adted the $200 mil\u00adlion that For\u00adbes magazine de\u00adterm\u00adined he was worth in 1982 in\u00adto that in\u00addex fund, it would have grown to more than $8 bil\u00adlion today.\"\nThere\u2019s a bit of informed guesswork behind these numbers because outsiders can only know so much about Trump\u2019s finances. The National Journal writer, S.V.\u00a0D\u00e1te, figured Trump started with $40 million in 1974. That\u2019s the year he became president of his father\u2019s real estate company. By one estimate, the firm was worth about $200 million and divided among Donald Trump and his four siblings, each would have received $40 million.\nBut it\u2019s not as though the company was liquidated that year. Trump\u2019s father lived until 1999, so whatever happened, it\u2019s more complicated than Trump receiving a cash inheritance in 1974 and deciding what he would do with it.\nWe\u2019re left with a question of how much money Trump got from his father and, most important, at what point those assets morphed from being his father\u2019s to being his.\nIn 1982, after running his father\u2019s firm for eight years, Forbes magazine estimated Trump\u2019s worth at $200 million. Since he was in charge of the company, then those dollars are more his than his father\u2019s. The Journal article tiptoed around this uncertainty with careful phrasing. The author talked about Trump investing \"his eventual share of his father\u2019s real estate company.\" An eventual share is not cash in hand.\nSimilarly, the article did not say that the estimated $200 million in 1982 was from Trump\u2019s father. D\u00e1te\u00a0told us in his view, that truly was Trump's money because the real estate company was worth more than that.\u00a0D\u00e1te said\u00a0he didn't really care what the status of the assets was.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just wanted to get to the point of saying that given the amount of money he started with, to be a billionaire \u2014\u00a0it's not too hard,\" D\u00e1te\u00a0said. \"I worded it as carefully as I did because there are a lot of uncertainties.\"\nImportantly, if the $200 million did not come from Trump's father, then you can't say that the father's money could have been worth $8 billion today.\nBut the Occupy Democrats\u2019 Facebook post took a paraphrase of the National Journal piece and then edited the paraphrase down to the text on the image. Occupy Democrats editor Omar Rivero didn\u2019t defend the graphic he shared. Rivero said his group occasionally shares graphics made by others.\n\"As you can see in the post description and in the watermark, this graphic was made by Santa Pegatina, a political graphics maker,\" Rivero said.\nThe best summary of the National Journal article is that it presents a hypothetical investment scenario using numbers that have some basis in the value of the Trump holdings, but aren\u2019t necessarily what Trump got directly from his father.\nRunning the numbers\nEven if the underlying assumptions are dodgy, the math at least is in the ballpark.\nWe used $40 million as the starting point for 1974. Honghui Chen, associate professor of finance at the University of Central Florida, told us the account would have grown to $3.94 billion by November 2015 if the money had followed the S&P 500 index and all dividends had been reinvested.\nThis is a rough calculation that ignores taxes owed on dividends, but it\u2019s on the same scale as what the National Journal reported.\nChen said it\u2019s trickier to calculate the value of $200 million invested in 1982.\n\"Because the stock market in 1982 was quite volatile, the current value of $200 million investment in 1982 would depend on the time at which it was initially invested,\" Chen said.\nIf it went in right at the end of 1981, it would be worth $6.7 billion. Invested in June 1982, the value today would be $8.3 billion. Invested at the end of 1982, it would be worth $9 billion. Again, in the neighborhood of what the Journal said.\nThere is a huge debate over Trump\u2019s current net worth. Estimates from outsiders, such as Bloomberg and Forbes, range from about $3 billion to about $4 billion. Trump says he has closer to $9 billion.\nOur ruling\nOccupy Democrats shared an image that said if Trump had taken the money he got from his father and simply put it in a fund that tracked the S&P 500, he\u2019d have $8 billion today. While it's true that Trump got a leg up from his father on the order of many tens of millions of dollars, this specific claim suffers from a key flaw.\nThe only way to hit the $8 billion mark is to start with $200 million in 1982, and it's wrong to say that was\u00a0Trump's father's money.\u00a0While the father's business\u00a0put Trump\u00a0on the path to have $200 million in 1982, Trump himself had been running the company for eight years.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    5 7  Politifact Rating: False  \"If Trump had just put his father\u2019s money in a mutual fund ... he\u2019d have $8 billion.\"    Occupy Democrats Liberal advocacy group   In a Facebook post Wednesday, December 2, 2015 12/02/2015    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05637"}
