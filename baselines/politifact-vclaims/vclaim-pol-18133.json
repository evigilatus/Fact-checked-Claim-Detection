Bernie Sanders argued about their past records on bailouts following the 2008 financial collapse.\nSanders said that he voted against the 2008 bailout while Biden supported it.\nBiden then countered: \"Part of that was bailing out the automobile industry \u2014 saving thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs over time. (Sanders) voted against that as well.\"\nSanders interjected: \"No, I did not vote against that. That bailout money was used later on by Bush to protect the automobile industry.\"\nWe found that both Biden and Sanders are only telling part of the story about Sanders\u2019 votes.\nRELATED: Bernie Sanders overstates recession aid to Wall Street banks\nBailouts from the 2008 financial crisis\nIn October 2008, Congress approved the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The money was intended to assist financial institutions, but it also ended up bailing out the auto industry.\nThat December, Congress tried to pass a separate $14 billion bailout program specifically for the auto industry. But the measure failed in the Senate, so President George W. Bush instead used his authority to allocate some of the TARP funds to General Motors and Chrysler.\nJust days before President Barack Obama started his first term in January 2009, some members of Congress tried to block the release of the the second half of the $700 billion TARP funds, a package that included some auto bailout money. The attempt failed, and the funds went out to the banks and motor companies.\nSo Sanders had two opportunities to show support on the auto bailout: in December 2008, when Congress tried and failed to pass an auto bailout, and again in January 2009, when members considered blocking TARP funds.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

(Sanders opposed the initial TARP bill in October.)\nSanders said he opposed bailout funding for financial firms, which is where the majority of TARP dollars were headed.\n\"I have strong reservations about continuing this bailout without strong taxpayer protections written into law,\" he said in a statement. \"I also object to using middle-class taxpayer money to bail out the exact same financial institutions whose greed and recklessness led to the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression.\"\nAuto companies ended up receiving about $85 billion in TARP funds, according to the New York Times.\nOur ruling\nBiden said that Sanders voted against the auto bailout.\nSanders did vote against a set of funds that financed most of the auto bailout \u2014 though the funds\u2019 primary purpose was bailing out Wall Street firms, which Sanders strongly opposed.\nBut Biden left listeners with the impression that Sanders\u2019 opposed bailing out the auto industry. Sanders voted in favor of providing auto companies with $14 billion, which was separate from the Wall Street bailout funds he opposed. That standalone measure failed.\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18133"}
