Leonard Lance (R-7th Dist.), for example, notes that the nation tops the list when it comes to certain types of taxes.\n\n\"The United States currently has the highest corporate tax rate in the world,\" Lance said in a news release last week that emphasized the need for tax reform.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey has tested this claim before, when it was cited twice by state Sen. Joe Kyrillos (R-Monmouth). Kyrillos\u2019 claims were rated Mostly True.\n\nLance\u2019s claim hasn\u2019t broken new ground in the six months since Kryillos\u2019 last claim about corporate tax rates.\n\nLet\u2019s revisit this popular talking point.\n\nAs far as corporate tax rates, the U.S. leads the pack worldwide \u2013 but not after factoring in various tax breaks paid by U.S. businesses.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s review the two types of corporate tax rates: statutory rates and effective rates.\n\nThe top statutory corporate tax rate in the United States is 39.1 percent and represents a combination of federal, state and local tax rates imposed by law before any tax breaks are factored into the equation.\n\nJapan once had the highest combined tax rate in the world, but lowered it in April 2012. That move bumped the United States\u2019 statutory rate to the highest among industrialized nations, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group.\n\nSo the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world in terms of statutory rates.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the effective tax rate, which is typically lower than the top statutory rate because of tax breaks.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElaine Luria\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a campaign finance report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn accepting corporate PAC donations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a September 2011 report, the Tax Foundation summarized the findings of the latest 13 studies of effective corporate tax rates across the world. Due to different methodologies, those studies determined U.S. effective tax rates ranged from 23 percent to 34.9 percent, according to the report.\n\nThe United States did not rank first in any of those studies, but in most of them, U.S. effective rates were among the top five highest for the countries analyzed, the report stated.\n\nApart from that Tax Foundation report, it\u2019s worth noting that a separate analysis found that 30 Fortune 500 companies, including General Electric, didn\u2019t pay any federal corporate income taxes for the 2008-2010 period. That study was done by the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice along with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the better measure -- statutory or effective rates?\n\nTax Foundation president Scott Hodge told us previously that statutory rates make for better comparisons. Effective rates are unpredictable and vary across different industries, while statutory rates are fixed, he explained.\n\n\"(The effective tax rate) will differ from industry to industry and business to business, whereas the list price is what it is and everyone starts at that point,\" Hodge said.\n\nBut Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, has argued that \"effective tax rates provide the best measure of comparison for overall tax burdens.\"\n\nAparna Mathur, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told us for our Kyrillos fact-check on this claim that \"both are equally valid measures of looking at the burden of the corporate income tax.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nLance claimed in a news release, \" The United States currently has the highest corporate tax rate in the world.\"\n\nIt\u2019s accurate that, at 39.1 percent, the United States has the highest statutory corporate tax rate among industrialized nations. But with various tax breaks, U.S. effective corporate tax rates range anywhere from 23 percent to 34.9 percent, studies show.\n\nThose effective tax rates may not land in first place, but they\u2019re still among the highest in the world.\n\nAs we did with Kyrillos\u2019 two claims on this topic, we rate Lance\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09422"}
