Scott Walker touts as a major achievement.\nWhen asked what he would do about the state\u2019s struggling middle class, Pade referenced his tax background and said as governor he wants to put together a bipartisan group to reform the state\u2019s tax code.\nHe also said this: \"Scott Walker touts his tax cuts. Unfortunately Wisconsin\u2019s still one of the highest-taxed states in the country.\"\nIs he right about Wisconsin\u2019s tax status?\nThe evidence\nWhen we asked Pade\u2019s campaign to provide backup for the statement, spokeswoman Kate Cooney pointed us to a study by\u00a0Wallethub, a personal finance website, that ranked Wisconsin as 46th in effective tax rate (Number 1 being the lowest).\n\"We do acknowledge that other measurements of taxation have shown a lowered trend over time beginning before Governor Walker took office, but those studies are not as comprehensive in their data sets,\" said Cooney. \"We have also pointed out the tax burden as a percentage of income in Wisconsin is often lower on the most wealthiest income brackets than those with lower income.\"\nA spokesman for Walker\u2019s campaign declined to offer any evidence on the issue, so we checked with a variety of experts and other rankings.\nSince Pade\u2019s statement referred to taxes in general, we\u2019ll start with what experts said about the overall tax burden.\nTamarine Cornelius, a research analyst at the Wisconsin Budget Project: She said the state ranks somewhere in the middle when looking at state and local taxes -- 20th when measured on a per-state resident basis in 2015 and 21st when measured as a share of personal income.\n\"Measured either way, state and local taxes in Wisconsin are actually\u00a0below the national average,\" she said, noting that when fees are included it drops Wisconsin\u2019s rank even further.\n\"In Wisconsin, residents pay lower fees than residents in many other states,\" she said.\nTax Foundation: A 2018 report from the\u00a0Tax Foundation, an independent tax policy nonprofit, also shows Wisconsin in the middle of the pack with a rank of 18 for state tax collections per capita for 2016.\nRichard Auxier, a research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute: \"It looks like it\u2019s a stretch to say Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the country,\" he said. He mentioned the state\u2019s \"somewhat progressive\" income tax rates, noting the top rate isn\u2019t that high\u00a0compared to other states; the existence of an\u00a0Earned Income Tax Credit, though it isn\u2019t as large as some others; and an average, if not low, sales tax rate\u00a0compared to other states.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, all three put Wisconsin in the middle of the pack, not \"one of the highest.\"\nWhy does the Wallethub study differ?\nCornelius said she had concerns with how Wallethub did its analysis. She noted thestate Legislative Fiscal Bureau\u00a0had determined the amount of property taxes paid on a median-valued house in Wisconsin to be $2,830. Cornelius said the Wallethub study \"overestimated property taxes on a median-valued house by 27%.\" \u00a0\nSpecific taxes\nWhat about Wisconsin\u2019s rank for specific taxes?\nOn property taxes, we contacted senior research analyst Adam Langley from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a nonprofit focused on economic, social and environmental components of land.\nHe pointed us to a ranking of states by property tax collection as a percentage of personal income from the Tax Policy Center\u2019s\u00a0State and Local Data Query Systembased on a survey of state and local governments. Wisconsin ranked 12th at 3.7 percent.\nHe also pointed to an analysis his group did using U.S. Census Bureau data. That \u00a0analysis examined the median property tax bill as a percentage of the median household income for homeowners for 2015. Wisconsin ranked eighth at 4.6 percent.\n\"Property taxes are definitely higher in most New England states, New Jersey and Illinois than they are in Wisconsin,\" Langley said, \"Depending on the specific measure of property taxes used for the comparison, there are several more states that also have higher property taxes than Wisconsin.\"\nOn income taxes, Auxier called Wisconsin\u2019s income taxes \"somewhat progressive\" and referenced the state\u00a0Department of Revenue\u2019s tax rates\u00a0and an\u00a0Urban Institute summary\u00a0of U.S. Census Bureau data.\nAuxier said Wisconsin\u2019s four brackets, with a top rate on income above $329,810 for married filers, are relatively progressive because half the states that have an income tax have one flat rate or a threshold for their top rate on income below $40,000, which is \"essentially flat.\"\nAuxier said the most important thing to keep in mind when thinking about state taxes is different people pay different taxes. This is why statements saying one state is the highest-taxed are not that simple.\nHe\u00a0referenced\u00a0an Urban Institute\u00a0study\u00a0he co-authored that estimated what each state\u2019s revenue would look like with a tax system based on national average tax rates. Results showed \"Wisconsin\u2019s actual taxes raise about as much revenue as it would with the average system,\" Auxier said.\nOur rating\nPade said \"Wisconsin's still one of the highest-taxed states in the country.\"\nThe study his campaign provided as evidence was from an organization that does not specialize in tax analysis and experts we spoke with were skeptical of how the study was done.\nIn any case, the statement was too broad to be accurate. Specific taxes may rank higher than others, and the rankings might vary for different income groups. But the claim was about taxes in general.\nAnd, in general, the state is now more middle of the pack.\nWe rate his statement Mostly False.
