Roy Cooper this year vetoed a state budget proposed by the GOP-controlled legislature, saying it didn\u2019t do enough for teachers.\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have questioned Cooper\u2019s commitment to teachers. They\u2019ve suggested that, if he cared about them, he wouldn\u2019t have blocked raises that were included in their proposed budget.\nAnd so the blaming and posturing has gone on for months now, with each side blaming the other for this year\u2019s budget stalemate.\nEnter NC Sen. Jeff Jackson, a Charlotte Democrat who recently tweeted his goal for improving teacher pay in North Carolina.\n\"We need to raise NC teacher pay to at least the national average - which is where it was back when I was in public school,\" Jackson tweeted.\u00a0\n\nJackson\u2019s tweet appears to claim that, during his time in the public school system, North Carolina\u2019s average teacher salary was on par with the average salary for all of the nation\u2019s teachers.\u00a0\n(Jackson says that\u2019s not what he meant by \"average,\" and we\u2019ll get to his argument later.)\nFirst, though, let\u2019s set the record straight on average teacher pay in North Carolina and how it has stacked up to average teacher pay in America as a whole.\nJackson said he finished high school in the year 2000. So we looked at that year, the 1990s and into the 1980s. Turns out, the good old days weren\u2019t so good after all.\nLagging behind\nOur primary source was the National Education Association, which is known for releasing annual reports detailing the average annual teacher salary in each state. (In March, the organization estimated NC\u2019s average teacher pay at $53,975 for the 2018-2019 school year, WRAL reported.)\nNEA data shows that, over the last 40 years, North Carolina\u2019s average teacher pay never reached the national average.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics also tracks teacher salaries for the U.S. Department of Education. For the 1990s to 2000, the NCES had similar numbers to the NEA.\u00a0\nThe data is \"spotty\" for older years, according to Tom Snyder, the NCES director of annual reports and information staff. But, for the years NCES does have, Snyder said \"North Carolina is lower than the national average.\"\nFor 1990 and earlier, the NCES shows:\n1989-1990: US $31,367, NC $27,883\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1979-1980: US $15,970, NC $14,117\n1969-1970: US $8,626, NC $7,294\nWe also reached out to the North Carolina Association of Educators, a left-leaning advocacy group for teachers. Kevin Rogers, the group\u2019s government relations and communications manager, said North Carolina has \"never quite hit\" the national average.\n\"The closest we came was in 2001-2002,\" Rogers said. \"We were ranked 20th in the country, with an average NC salary of $42,680 as compared to the national average for that year of $44,660.\nRogers\u2019 mention of rankings takes us to Jackson\u2019s argument.\nMean vs. median\nSo far, we\u2019ve been comparing NC\u2019s average pay to the nation\u2019s average pay. But when we reached out to Jackson, he said he used the word \"average\" to compare NC to other states \u2014 not the average (or mean) salary for the country as a whole.\n\"We were above average (U.S. teacher pay) in my senior year of high school, understood as the median rank for all 50 states.\"\nIt\u2019s true that, in 1999-2000, NC\u2019s ranking among all 50 states was 23rd \u2014 meaning NC paid better than half the states. And, as Rogers mentioned, NC moved up to 20th during the 2001-2002 school year. So, as far as rankings go, NC looked good when compared to other states.\nBut, there are a couple problems with Jackson\u2019s reasoning.\nFirst, a state\u2019s ranking isn\u2019t necessarily reflective of whether it pays teachers more than the national average. Let\u2019s look back at the 1999-2000 school year. NC ranked 23rd, but the state\u2019s average teacher pay was still $2,599 below the national average.\nSecond, his explanation suggests that average pay refers to the \"median rank for all 50 states.\" But that\u2019s not how the average teacher pay is determined. It\u2019s determined by looking at average pay across the country -- not by taking the median salary of the states. Being above the middle value in a list isn\u2019t the same as being above average.\nJackson told us that the difference between what his tweet says and what he meant is a matter of semantics. In this context, however, the word \"average\" has a very specific meaning.\nWe asked Kris Nordstrom, a senior policy analyst for the liberal NC Justice Center, about how he\u2019d interpret someone saying they \"want to raise NC\u2019s teacher pay to the national average.\" Nordstrom has done extensive research on the topic. He said, \"I would interpret that as wanting to bring the state\u2019s average salary to the same level as the nation\u2019s average salary.\"\nOur ruling\nJackson said North Carolina needs \"to raise NC teacher pay to at least the national average -- which is where it was back when I was in public school.\" Jackson told us he graduated high school was 2000, so we looked at that year and the preceding decade.\u00a0\nAnd we found no evidence that NC\u2019s average teacher pay ever matched the national average.\u00a0\nJackson said he used the word \"average\" as a reference to the median salary among all 50 states. There\u2019s some validity to his claim that, generally speaking, NC could be seen as faring better than most other states for a couple years.\nBut this argument strays from his original tweet, which made no mention of NC\u2019s rank, median pay or how its pay compared to other states. We rate the tweet False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16677"}
