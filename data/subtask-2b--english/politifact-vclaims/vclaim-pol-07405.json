However, recreational use has been in effect for only seven months, making any numbers suspect in terms of how longer-term trends might play out.\nThat said, we figured that comparing the number of traffic fatalities recorded during the first seven months of this year with the first seven of 2013 would the fairest way to evaluate Johnson\u2019s claim.\nWe called Emily Wilfong, a Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman. As of Aug. 22, 2014, she said, 295 people had died in motor vehicle crashes in the state. That compared with the 313 deaths reported as of the same time a year ago.\nA difference, yes, but one of less than six percent.\nBut even so, Wilfong added, those two figures don\u2019t reveal a useful picture when it comes to assessing traffic deaths in the age of legal marijuana.\nFor starters, neither figure includes the icy dangers of Colorado\u2019s winter driving season, which begins around mid- to late-October, she said. Hazardous conditions could easily skew the number of traffic fatalities dramatically.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor another, neither includes an analysis of exactly how the deaths occurred.\n\"There could well be a big decrease in the number of pedestrian fatalities,\" Wilfong said. \"There\u2019s nothing in these figures to show that impaired driving has been reduced to any measurable degree.\"\nMuddying the numbers further is the fact that toxicology reports showing what drivers had in their systems may not come back for months, she said.\n\"So we have some numbers,\" Wilfong said, \"but we\u2019re not at all certain what they mean at this point. It\u2019s way too early to tell.\"\nTrooper Josh Lewis, Wilfong\u2019s Colorado State Patrol counterpart, agreed.\n\"Statistically, we\u2019re essentially neck and neck with last year,\" he said. \"But there\u2019s nothing to say that marijuana use is reducing the number of fatalities or that there\u2019s any correlation between the two. It could well be months or years before we have gathered that sort of data.\"\nWe tried to reach Johnson, but were told he was out of the office. The Yes on 91 campaign referred us to Art Way, senior drug policy manager of the Drug Policy Alliance (Colorado).\nOver the past decade, he said -- or roughly the time that Colorado began loosening its marijuana laws -- total highway fatalities are down. Statistics bear that out, but the margin is slim and there are other factors such as improvements in vehicle safety and trauma medicine.\nThe ruling:\nAnthony Johnson, chief petitioner for Measure 91, which would legalize recreational marijuana use in Oregon, pointed to Colorado\u2019s brief seven-month experience with legal pot and noted that traffic fatalities have decreased there over that stretch.\nColorado\u2019s most recent statistics show that 18 fewer people have died so far this year in fatal traffic accidents than did during that same time period in 2013.\nNothing in those numbers, however, supports any contention that legal marijuana had anything to do with a drop that\u2019s as much as a blip as anything. Johnson\u2019s statement is true, but it omits important details and context.\nWe rate it Half True.\nThoughts on our ruling?

An earlier version mischaracterized one of Anthony Johnson's arguments regarding driving and recreational marijuana. It did not change the ruling.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07405"}
