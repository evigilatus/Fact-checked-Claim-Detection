They fund her campaigns.\"", "truth_label": "half-true", "date": "stated on May 24, 2016 in an ad:", "title": "How much do gun lobbyists fund Kelly Ayotte's campaign?", "text": "The ad cuts to a shadowy close-up of a man and woman shaking hands, as if they'd just made a deal, superimposed over a stack of $100 bills. \nThe narrator explains: \"She stands with the Washington gun lobby. They fund her campaigns.\" \nThe 30-second spot attacks Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte's record on gun control measures as she faces a tough re-election bid against New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat. \nSponsored by the political action committee for Americans for Responsible Solutions, the ad\u2019s ominous tone and imagery leave the viewer with the impression that Ayotte doesn\u2019t care what her constituents want because she\u2019s in the pocket of well-heeled firearms lobbyists.\nIt\u2019s a line of attack used in the wake of the Orlando shootings and the Senate\u2019s votes on gun control legislation. It has also employed by New Hampshire Democrats. \"Ayotte puts her gun lobby backers before the safety and security of New Hampshire,\" Ray Buckley, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said in a June 21 statement.\nPolitiFact New Hampshire wondered how much the \"gun lobby\" is really spending on Ayotte\u2019s campaign. We\u2019ve recently looked into Ayotte\u2019s voting history on expanded background checks. Now, we\u2019ll focus on the financial supporters of her campaign.\nFollowing the money\nA review of campaign finance records shows that Ayotte has accepted at least $7,450 in donations from the most prominent lobbying group, the National Rifle Association, over her career.\nOver the course of Ayotte\u2019s career, according to the database, gun rights groups have given her campaign or leadership PAC a total of $68,595. This total includes donations from the NRA as well as other groups such as the National Shooting Sports Foundation. It also includes donations from individuals who have a pattern of making political contributions supporting gun rights,\u00a0which most people wouldn\u2019t associate with the \"Washington gun lobby.\"\nAmericans for Responsible Solutions communications director Mark Prentice said the data in the OpenSecrets database makes it \"absolutely clear\" that gun rights groups fund her campaign.\nBeyond direct campaign contributions to Ayotte, those groups have spent another $12,500 in independent expenditures to support her, bringing the sum to more than $80,000.\nBut it\u2019s important to keep those numbers in context. \nThe average U.S. Senate campaign costs more than $10 million, according to a study by MapLight.org, a nonpartisan group that studies money in politics.\nAs she prepared for a contentious reelection battle, Ayotte reported having $6.9 million cash on hand in the last fundraising report March 31.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, the money she\u2019s received -- directly or indirectly -- from gun lobbyists during her political career represents about 1 percent of the cash she has on hand right now. When compared against the $12.4 million she\u2019s raised since she first became a candidate in the 2010 cycle, it\u2019s 0.65 percent of her lifetime fundraising.\nAnd Ayotte\u2019s $7,450 from the NRA pale in comparison to what the group gave to its top recipient in Congress, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. McCain has received $37,150 in direct support and more than $7 million in independent expenditures for him and against his opponents, according to OpenSecrets records dating back to 1989.\n\"The ad is misleading because the contributions cited equal only about half a percent of the total amount raised by our campaign over her career,\" Ayotte\u2019s campaign spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in an email statement.\nMeanwhile, the group that\u2019s running the ad, Americans for Responsible Solutions, was founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords, an Arizona Democrat and mass-shooting survivor. It has spent $834,278 in independent expenditures against Ayotte\u2019s candidacy, according to OpenSecrets.\nThat\u2019s about 10 times the amount of money spent on Ayotte\u2019s campaign by pro-gun groups.\nAyotte\u2019s gun-policy views\nThe ad also claims Ayotte \"stands with the Washington gun lobby\" in return for the donations she\u2019s received, but that hasn\u2019t universally been the case.\nAyotte received an \"A\" rating from the NRA in 2012, meaning she was viewed as a \"solidly pro-gun\" candidate. \nThe NRA and associated groups have taken out ads supporting Ayotte in the past. \"Thank you for protecting the rights of gun owners, hunters and all who cherish the freedoms of our Second Amendment,\" one ad from from the National Shooting Sports Foundation said. Another ad came from an organization called the The New Hampshire Men and Women of the National Rifle Association. \u00a0\nHowever, her voting record has not always adhered to the NRA\u2019s stances.\nOn June 20, for instance, Ayotte backed two bills blocking gun sales to suspected terrorists -- a switch from when she voted to kill a similar Democratic plan in December.\nA day later, she co-sponsored a bipartisan gun control bill with U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to strengthen existing background check laws, which the NRA opposed. Collins, one of the Senate\u2019s most moderate Republicans, has a C+ rating from the NRA. \u00a0\nOur ruling\nThe gun control group Americans for Responsible Solutions said Ayotte \"stands with the Washington gun lobby. They fund her campaigns.\"\nAyotte has indeed benefited from money from gun rights groups \u2013 $81,095 over her career, to be exact. But it\u2019s worth adding some context -- that\u2019s about one-half of one percent of the total money she\u2019s raised, and a modest amount compared to other Senate Republicans.\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s not entirely correct to say that Ayotte always \"stands with the Washington gun lobby.\" She has voted for legislation favored by the NRA, but has also bucked the NRA on at least one occasion. \u00a0\nThe statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.\nEditor\u2019s note: This article has been clarified to reflect the existence of some ads that were supportive of Ayotte from pro-gun groups and to reflect that some campaign contributions came from individuals, not organizations. The rating remains the same.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04755"}
