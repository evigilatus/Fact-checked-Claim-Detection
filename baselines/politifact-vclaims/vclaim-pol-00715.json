Wade", "text": "On an episode of Politically Speaking, a podcast from St. Louis Public Radio, O\u2019Fallon Rep. Nick Schroer spoke about legislation he sponsored known as the \"Missouri Stands for the Unborn Act\". The bill, which would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat or brain activity is detected, is considered one of the \"strongest pro-life\" bills in the nation.\nInterviewer Jason Rosenbaum asked Schroer how he responds to opponents of his bill who say this will prompt women past the 6 to 8 week mark in their pregnancy when a heartbeat or brain activity could be detected to obtain a dangerous abortion.\nSchroer responded by saying statistics that measured the number of women who died from illegal abortions prior to the nationwide legalization of abortion in Roe v. Wade in 1973 were fabricated and overestimated.\nSchroer said, \"There are statistics out there that show the number of women who died from illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade, that number has skyrocketed since with women dying more with legal abortions.\"After further investigation, we found that Schroer\u2019s claim was misleading.\nWhat makes a woman\nWe reached out to Schroer to find out where he got the information about the number of women dying from legal abortions.\nIn his reply, Schroer said, \"This quote was meant to pull in the numbers of female babies as well.\"\n\"Since Roe v. Wade, the number of babies killed, male and female, has skyrocketed per this information. Whether mother or female baby, the amount of life lost as a result of abortion since Roe has skyrocketed,\" he said.\nNone of that is clear from Schroer\u2019s answer on the podcast, and it has nothing to do with the question he was asked -- which was about pregnant women.\nA brief history of abortion\nSo what do we know about outcomes of pregnant women seeking an abortion pre-Roe v. Wade? And have deaths of pregnant women seeking an abortion been increasing or decreasing?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Koenig\n\n\nstated on August 18, 2017 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's time to remove any statue of Margaret Sanger who was a white suprematist (sic), spoke at kkk events & supported by democrats. #prolife\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Katie Parkins \u2022 October 5, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarissa Haugeberg, assistant professor of history at Tulane University, said, \"It can be difficult to get at precise deaths due to illegal abortions because many physicians and pathologists obscured the cause of death on death certificates to protect providers and women\u2019s families.\"\nMany of these deaths would be reported as a miscarriage or other complication in the pregnancy.\nThe Guttmacher Institute outlines the number of abortion deaths prior to Roe v. Wade, with abortion being the official cause of death for almost 2,700 women in 1930, 1,700 women in 1940 and over 300 women in 1950. The institute also says the actual number was likely much higher.\nIn her book \"When Abortion Was a Crime,\" Leslie J. Reagan said, \"The same developments that finally reduced the mortality associated with childbirth reduced the mortality due to abortion.\" Medical developments such as the use of blood transfusions and antibiotics made every medical procedure, including abortion, more safe. Antibiotics were widely introduced in\nAfter Roe v. Wade, the number of deaths caused by abortions continued to drop. The Center for Disease Control\u2019s 1992 Abortion Surveillance report outlined the number of deaths from legal and illegal abortions from 1972, one year before Roe v. Wade, to 1990. Over this time period, the number of deaths from both legal and illegal abortions dropped. In 1972, the case-fatality rate was 4.1 percent; by 1976, it had dropped to 1.1 percent.\n\nAccording to the CDC, \"in 2014, the most recent year for which data were available, six women were identified to have died as a result of complications from legal induced abortion.\"\nOur Ruling\nSchroer said the number of women dying from legal abortions has \"skyrocketed\" compared to illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade.\nSchroer said he was talking about pregnant women and female fetuses, though that wasn\u2019t the question he was asked and is extremely misleading to listeners. The number of women who have died from abortions has steadily decreased, even prior to the decision in Roe v. Wade.\nWe rate this claim Pants On Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00715"}
