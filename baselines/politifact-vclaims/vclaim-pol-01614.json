For one thing, she didn\u2019t get arrested. For another, Sept. 31 doesn\u2019t exist.\nThe preposterous claim, published on TheAmericanNews.co, is among the latest of many false news stories about Obama\u2019s two daughters, Malia and Sasha. Recently, we\u2019ve fact-checked claims that Malia was suspended from Harvard and that Sasha was expelled from school. We rated both Pants on Fire.\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe image that accompanies the false article can be traced to a story we debunked last year. That Pants on Fire post claimed Malia was arrested for drinking, drugs and dog-fighting. At the time, Malia was edited into a collection of mugshots from an actual dog-fighting incident in South Carolina in 2013.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cropped version of that altered image appears with the new false claim.\nWe found no evidence of the existence of a \"notorious\" drug dealer Christopher Turk mentioned in the story. A doctor named Christopher Turk is, however, a main character on the sitcom Scrubs.\nMalia is currently attending Harvard University, and Sasha is a senior at Sidwell Friends School in Washington. Neither has been suspended or expelled, and neither has been charged with cocaine possession.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2018-09-14 12:15:24 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Malia Obama just got arrested buying cocaine\"    TheAmericanNews.co Bloggers https://www.theamericanews.co/breaking-malia-obama-just-got-arrested-buying-cocaine/   in a blog post Saturday, September 8, 2018 2018-09-08    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01614"}
