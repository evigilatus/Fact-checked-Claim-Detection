The post features a picture of a Red Bull can, a picture of a milky substance in a vial, and this text: \"Q: Do energy drinks have bull sperm in it? Answer: Yes. A study done by longhorn cattle company tested some of the top energy drink brands (Red Bull, Monster, etc) and found that they do in fact contain bull sperm.\"\u00a0\nThis post, which has been shared more than 7,200 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nRed Bull did not respond to emails we sent asking about the post.\u00a0\nBut according to its website, the Red Bull energy drink contains caffeine, sugar, B-group vitamins and taurine, which it describes as \"an amino acid naturally occurring in the human body and present in the daily diet.\"\nA Q&A section on the website says that the drink is \"suitable for vegetarians\" because it uses only non-animal ingredients. It also addresses whether taurine is made from \"bull\u2019s testicles.\" It\u2019s not.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRather, the company says, it\u2019s produced synthetically by pharmaceutical companies without animal products. Taurine is also found in food like scallops, fish and poultry, and most infant formulas, according to the company.\u00a0\nIn fact, taurine is in many animal tissues as well as plants. According to the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes database of medical terminology, taurine derives its name from the Latin word \"taurus\" for bull. It was first isolated from ox bile in 1827 by German scientists Friedrich Tiedemann and Leopold Gmelin.\u00a0\nScientists have debunked the notion that energy drinks like Red Bull are made with taurine derived from animals. In July 2018, Joe Schwarcz, director of McGill University\u2019s Office for Science and Society, wrote that while scientists originally isolated taurine from\u00a0bull semen, it\u2019s now produced synthetically.\n\"This compound is an \u2018aminosulfonic acid\u2019 that is widely distributed in the human body and plays a role in cardiovascular function, development of the nervous system and formation of bile acids,\" he says in the post. .\nSchwarcz warns that excessive consumption of energy drinks should be avoided, \"but not because of a concern that taurine is isolated from bull semen.\"\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00096"}
