A casting call for extras will reportedly take place in the Jacksonville area in a couple of months.\"\nWe were intrigued, and broke out a box of tissues just in case the tears started flowing.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be too crazy of an announcement. Sequels are all the rage in Hollywood these days, and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has said he wants to bring back the state\u2019s tax credit for film projects \u2013 a campaign promise we\u2019ve rated as In The Works on our Coop-O-Meter.\nWhat\u2019s more, Nicholas Sparks \u2013 author of \"The Notebook\" and other popular books \u2013 lives in New Bern, not far from Jacksonville. Many of his books are set in North Carolina, and a few of the film versions have been shot here, too, including \"A Walk To Remember,\" \"Safe Haven\" and \"The Longest Ride.\"\nThe state\u2019s official tourism bureau even has a guide for a three-day trip around eastern North Carolina, which it calls \"A Nicholas Sparks Tour of the North Carolina Coast.\"\nAnd Sparks has written a sequel to The Notebook, which is called The Wedding and hasn\u2019t been made into a movie \u2013 yet.\nThe stars seemed to align for this rumor. But sadly, it\u2019s fake news.\n'\n \nA quick search\u00a0online led to something almost as good as a real movie announcement \u2013 a video clip of Conan O\u2019Brien and Ryan Reynolds reenacting The Notebook\u2019s famous kissing-in-the-rain scene, which they jokingly claimed was a trailer for The Notebook 2.\nThis sequel, they said, would be starring Reynolds in the place of Ryan Gosling and O\u2019Brien in the place of Rachel McAdams.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we were pretty sure his Notebook 2 announcement was a joke.\nBut the article circulating about Jacksonville and the film was not nearly so satirical.\nIt correctly named the director of the first film and the place in South Carolina where it was filmed, it gives a brief outline of the plot and has several quotes from unnamed producers from the unnamed company that was allegedly behind the film.\nThe website does contain a disclaimer that it\u2019s a satirical site, but it takes an extra click or two to find and isn\u2019t immediately obvious.\nAnd just in case the website had accidentally stumbled onto the truth, we checked with the people who would know if there actually are plans for this movie in the works.\nAlas, they say, there\u2019s no Notebook 2.\n\"We have not been contacted by this production,\" said Johnny Griffin, director of the Wilmington Regional Film Commission in eastern North Carolina.\nHe would know; his office was in charge of collecting resumes from local crew members the last time a Sparks movie actually filmed in the area \u2013 which was \"The Longest Ride\" in 2014.\nAnd the N.C. Department of Commerce, which oversees the N.C. Film Office, said there was no Notebook 2 project anywhere in the state.\n\"The Film Office is not working on/with any \"Notebook 2\" project,\" Commerce Department spokesman David Rhoades said in an email.\nOur ruling\nNo, there isn\u2019t a sequel to The Notebook being filmed in North Carolina. Not everything that looks like legitimate news actually is.\nEven if it\u2019s a story about your long-lost love repairing the home he once promised would be yours, be sure to double-check if it\u2019s true.\nWe rate this claim Pants On Fire!\nEditor\u2019s note: PolitiFact North Carolina examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017.
