It\u2019s the best source of data in this case.\nWe confined our review to graduation rates for African-American and Hispanic students because they make up most of the minority students in Beloit. Black students were 26 percent of the total enrollment there in 2006-\u201907, Holtz\u2019s first year in the district. Hispanics made up 13 percent of the student body.\nLet\u2019s look at the graduation rates from his time in Beloit, spanning three school years:\nFor African Americans:\n2006-\u201907: 64 percent\n2007-\u201908: 76 percent\n2008-09: 85 percent\nFor Hispanics:\n2006-\u201907: 74 percent\n2007-\u201908: 75 percent\n2008-\u201909: 84 percent\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figures back up the part of Holtz\u2019s claim about rates climbing over 80 percent on his watch.\nWhat about the contention that Beloit\u2019s graduation rates started out below those of minority students in Milwaukee and Madison?\nAt that time, 2006-\u201907, Beloit\u2019s rate for black students was slightly lower than in Milwaukee, but slightly above Madison\u2019s rate.\nSo that\u2019s a mixed bag.\nAs for Hispanic students, the graduation rate in Beloit was higher than in either of those two districts in Holtz\u2019s first year.\nBut if you look back to the year before he arrived, Beloit\u2019s graduation rate for Hispanic students was significantly lower than the rates in Milwaukee or Madison.\nAgain, some support.\nFor context, the graduation rate for white students in Beloit was considerably higher than for black students, but the gap between the groups narrowed dramatically by Holtz\u2019s third year. That\u2019s because while the rate for whites improved (topping Milwaukee and Madison), the rate for black students rose more.\nThere is another aspect to Holtz\u2019s claim -- to what degree did his policies influence the rate?\nSpecific policy changes he helped enact fueled the progress, Holtz claims, pointing to improvements in safety and discipline.\nBut experts, and Holtz, acknowledge that students, teachers, parents, elected officials and community members all have to play a role.\nThat muddies the water on claiming credit.\nOur rating:\nHoltz says that when he ran the Beloit school district, \"Our minority graduation rate went from levels below Milwaukee and Madison, to above 80%.\"\nRates rose significantly and topped 80 percent both for black students and Hispanic students.\nBut the picture upon his arrival was not quite as bleak as Holtz claimed.\nWe rate his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03519"}
