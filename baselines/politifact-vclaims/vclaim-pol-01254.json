But a new concern over illegal immigrants and the midterms got play on Lou Dobbs\u2019 Tonight, with the host claiming many non-citizen voters cast ballots in the race.\n\"We are watching, you know, millions of illegal immigrants cross our borders,\" Dobbs said, \"and many of them voting in the past election that's what, just a couple weeks ago.\"\nDobbs said illegal immigrants were having an \"immense impact.\" He then went on to cite the potential consequences on the apportionment of congressional districts.\nWe found no basis for the Fox Business Network host\u2019s claim about undocumented people voting in the midterms.\nAllegations of undue influence over American elections have become fairly commonplace in the Trump era. Trump himself has repeatedly claimed the existence of massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we\u2019ve debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again.\nIn the case of the 2018 midterms, we\u2019ve found no evidence to back up Dobbs\u2019 claim that many illegal immigrants voted.\nFox News\u2019 media contacts did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s zero evidence of even dozens, let alone millions, of non citizens voting in this or any other election,\" said according to David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a non-profit focused on election integrity.\nDobbs\u2019 claim that \"we are watching millions of illegal immigrants cross our borders\" needs context.\nAccording to Department of Homeland Security figures, in fiscal year 2018 the U.S. Border Patrol caught 396,579 people crossing the southern border. A broader read of border crossings would also include department data on the number of foreign travelers to the United States who overstayed their visas, which was estimated at around 600,000 in fiscal year 2017.\nAs we\u2019ve noted in a previous fact-check, there\u2019s an oft-cited study among those claiming illegal immigrants have an outsized influence on U.S. elections. The study purports to show \"14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens.\"\nMany credible researchers have panned the study as methodologically unsound for using an opt-in Internet poll originally designed to survey citizens and not considering possible survey response error.\nThe federal government recently brought charges against 19 foreign nationals who voted in the 2016 election in North Carolina, where a total of more than 4.7 million votes were cast.\nExperts said the Department of Justice under President George W. Bush, and Republican and Democratic election officials have investigated voter fraud extensively and found it is extremely rare. President Trump\u2019s short-lived voter fraud commission couldn\u2019t find any evidence of widespread fraud before being disbanded.\nAs for Dobbs\u2019 claim, we rate it Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01254"}
