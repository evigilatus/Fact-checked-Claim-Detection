But we thought Gingrich's statement was worth checking.\nGingrich has focused on poverty before, accusing President Barack Obama of being \"the most successful food stamp president in American history\" because \"47 million Americans are on food stamps.\" (We rated this statement Half True.)\nWe decided to check whether Gingrich is right in this new statement, so we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which is the official federal source of poverty statistics.\nGingrich is right that the numbers go back more than half a century, to 1959, and that the absolute numbers of people in poverty in 2010 -- \u00a046.1 million -- is at its highest since the statistic has been recorded.\nHowever, Gingrich ignores population growth since 1959. Over that period, the U.S. population has increased by 73 percent. So today\u2019s poverty rate -- that is, the percentage of people in poverty -- is 15.1 percent, compared to a high of 22.4 percent in 1959. Between 1959 and 1965, the poverty rate was higher every year than it is today.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat paints a somewhat different picture than what Gingrich suggested.\nStill, the poverty rate in 2010 was higher than it\u2019s been in every year for more than four decades save one -- 1983, when the rate was 15.2 percent -- and that\u2019s largely in tune with Gingrich\u2019s larger point.\nA final note: Unlike his claim about food stamps, Gingrich was more oblique about the blame Obama bears for this statistic. But he does seem to blame the president.\nAfter saying that \"more Americans are in poverty today than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago,\" Gingrich added, \"President Obama and his administration have tried to blame the persistent unemployment and economic stagnation on the severity of the recession they inherited. However, the historical record shows us that the deeper the recession the stronger the recovery. America should at worst be finishing the second year of a booming recovery by now.\"\nIt\u2019s impossible to parcel out blame for the nation\u2019s economic troubles in a scientific fashion, but we think that it\u2019s unfair to place that much of the blame for high poverty on Obama.\nOur ruling\nGingrich is right about the absolute number of Americans in poverty. A better understanding of the extent of poverty in the United States requires looking at the number of people in poverty as a percentage of the population. Measuring it that way, the current poverty rate is not the highest ever. Still, this rate is the second highest in more than four decades, which fits with Gingrich\u2019s general point. However, we think Gingrich overstates the amount of blame Obama personally deserves for this statistic. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/435851f0-ed97-4aab-bb33-a751e6f8c8b4", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12114"}
