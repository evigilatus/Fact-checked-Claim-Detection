Drain the Swamp now! John Kerry should be next!\"\nBefore Trump\u2019s decision in May to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal \u2014 which had lifted some economic sanctions on Iran so long as Iran discontinued its pursuit of nuclear weapons \u2014 Kerry worked behind the scenes to preserve the pact, according to a May 4 report by\u00a0the Boston Globe\u00a0detailing the quiet lobbying efforts as described by anonymous sources.\nWho has Kerry been meeting with?\nSpecifically, Kerry met with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and made several phone calls to European officials and members of Congress in an effort to rescue the deal. Kerry, who was the nuclear deal\u2019s chief architect under President Barack Obama, said during an\u00a0interview\u00a0with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, that he met with Zarif three or four times to discuss the agreement.\nKerry\u2019s private meetings have sparked an outcry from congressional Republicans, who say he may have undermined U.S. foreign policy interests. On Sept. 18, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sent a letter asking the Justice Department to investigate the meetings, according to a\u00a0press release.\nPreviously, PolitiFact found claims that Kerry met secretly with Iranian officials in Paris to be\u00a0unsubstantiated. PolitiFact also gave several websites\u00a0Pants on Fire ratings\u00a0for false reports that Kerry was facing prison charges under the Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorized American citizens from working to subvert U.S. foreign policy.\nBut Padgett\u2019s claim that Kerry has been \"working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments\" seemed particularly sweeping, so we decided to give it a look.\nWhen asked for comment, Padgett said he stands by his statement and suggested Kerry has been compromised and should be examined under the Logan Act or brought before the Senate for hearings.\n\"His efforts appear to represent the interests of the Iranian government more than American citizens right here on American soil,\" Padgett said. \"He is part of the previous administration and he should stop trying to ink deals (in the) foreign interest as though he is still part of President Trump\u2019s administration.\"\nHow normal is this?\nKerry spokesman Matthew Summers acknowledged that Kerry has maintained contact with his counterparts from other countries. But he explained that other secretaries of state did the same and that Kerry told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a phone conversation earlier this year about the discussions he had with Zarif at international conferences.\n\"At those conferences, (Kerry) urged Iran to keep its commitments under the Iran nuclear agreement,\" Summers said. \"He was advocating for what was wholly consistent with U.S. policy at the time, as the United States was still a part of the Iran deal.\"\nDavid Wade, Kerry\u2019s former chief of staff, also pointed to an\u00a0email newsletter\u00a0from Diplomacy Works, a pro-diplomacy organization that includes Kerry on its advisory council, addressing the idea that Kerry\u2019s meetings were secret and illegal.\nCiting Kerry\u2019s interviews with Hewitt and Fox News host Dana Perino, the email said his meetings with Zarif were routine and occured at a time when the Iran nuclear deal was still U.S. policy.\n\"There\u2019s nothing unusual, let alone unseemly or inappropriate, about former diplomats meeting with foreign counterparts as Secretary Kissinger has done it for decades with Russia and China,\" Summers said. \"But certainly anyone can agree it doesn\u2019t constitute working \u2018for\u2019 another country.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe consulted some experts, and they agreed. \"Of course Kerry did not work on behalf of Iran,\" said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.\nPeter Feaver, a professor of political science at Duke University and a former National Security Council staff member, said there is \"nothing unusual or untoward about formers continuing or extending relationships they fostered while in office.\"\n\"Former national security officials like John Kerry meet with foreign leaders all the time,\" he said.\nFeaver said such meetings can be useful for relaying messages back to current policymakers, and that departed diplomats are usually very careful to emphasize that they are not advocating or creating policy.\nStill, although Kerry\u2019s meetings were fairly standard practice, Feaver noted that it\u2019s not strange that they raised some eyebrows among Republicans.\n\"Based on published reporting, it is possible that former Secretary Kerry\u2019s interactions danced close to the line \u2014 a line measuring professional norms, not legal restrictions \u2014 in terms of discussing ways to thwart current Administration policy,\" he said. \"The Obama Administration would have been angry if former Bush Administration officials had crossed that line and so it is understandable that the Trump Administration is suspicious of Kerry\u2019s activities.\"\n\"One can have a good debate about the Logan Act,\" O\u2019Hanlon added, referring to the law prohibiting unauthorized citizens from working to undermine U.S. policy. Padgett said the government should look into Kerry\u2019s meetings as a potential violation of that statute.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow does the Logan Act play into this?\nBut as PolitiFact has\u00a0noted\u00a0before, there are only two known instances where Americans have been indicted for violating the Logan Act. The most recent of the two indictments came in 1853, and neither led to a conviction.\nStephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, told the\u00a0Boston Globe\u00a0that the act probably would not apply to what Kerry has been up to, even if it was commonly enforced.\n\"If all Kerry is doing is working to keep in place something that\u2019s still technically a \u2018measure of the United States,\u2019 I don\u2019t see how the statute would apply even if someone was crazy enough to try it,\" Vladeck said, according to the Globe.\nSo Kerry may have come close to \"a line measuring professional norms,\" as Feaver said. But his meetings are unlikely to warrant prosecution under the Logan Act, and they certainly did not amount to \"working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments.\"\nFor the record, Feaver also said the Iranian regime would more precisely be described as \"major state sponsors of terrorism,\" not foreign terrorist governments.\nOur ruling\nPadgett said Kerry is \"now working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments.\"\nExperts we consulted said that is not the case. Kerry\u2019s meetings with Zarif were not unusual, and there is no clear evidence that his efforts to salvage the Iran deal were undermining current U.S. policy because the meetings occurred before Trump actually moved to scrap the deal, when the deal was still consistent with U.S. policy.\nMore to the point, there is no evidence that Kerry has been in cahoots with or working for Iran. We rate Padgett\u2019s statement False.\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
