Government of the Republic. Nathan bragged that the famous little magazine chose CBBC's location and heavyweight media saw Georgia's highest place in the country to do business. Democratic challenger Jason Carter questioned the political tendency to arrange, saying that it masked other problems such as the unemployment rate ranked 50th of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The Centre for Truth in Non-Party Accounting in Chicago has now published a study that struck Georgia because it carries approximately $16 billion in debt burdens, mostly from unfunded retirement obligations and health care for retirees. It classifies Georgia &apos; s financial situation as the worst 28 states in all states. \"In order to fill this financial hole, each Georgian taxpayers will have to send $5,000 to the State Treasury,\" according to a summary of the study. Who's got that kind of coin? It is certain that Poletti Fakt Georgia does not do so. But how can the State have both balanced budgetary requirements and this kind of debt? Sheila Weinberg, the approved accountant-general who founded the International Investment Authority, believes that the problem lies with Georgia (and other states) and does not include long-term pensions and health-care compensation for retirees in the annual budget. The audited financial report of Georgia shows $2 billion in retirement benefits. However, Weinberg claims to add such other compensation, the State has more than $14 billion in unfunded retirement programmes over the next three decades. Each State has this type of long-term commitment. These unfunded liabilities are now disclosed in the notes to the financial statements, which are presented annually. However, the State Accounting Standards Board is in the process of changing those accounting rules. Pension liabilities will be included in the balance sheet starting with 2014 reports. If Georgia follows these criteria this year, the State employees &apos; retirement or pension scheme will show an unfunded commitment of $4.8 billion. However, those rules only affect how those debts are reported. It does not change its totals or establish policies for their financing. In Georgia, pension financing is governed by State law, which requires the actuary to calculate the minimum annual contribution required to meet the long-term obligation. As of 2013, Georgia is also adding additional cash to this minimum, consumed over 25 years, to fill the gap. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" By Haley Beller \u2022 January 26, 2012, the state set aside that money first, before setting the balance of the budget. It has never failed to do so. In 2013, 71.4 per cent of this proportion - covering 60,000 active members and 45,000 retirees - was funded. This shames us with the average of 72 per cent of the country &apos; s largest pension funds, which, according to the Pension Research Centre at Boston College, are well funded for the future. Jim Putfin, Executive Director of ERS, said: \"Our contributions come every year like round-the-clock work.\" \"The support came literally from multiple administrations over decades.\" However, if retirement costs are mandatory, the health-care costs of retirees are optional. The study expects that health-care liabilities for retirees will amount to $7.4 billion. Changes in State law - which would most likely reduce benefits - would be required to reduce that cost. Alan Essig, Executive Director of the Georgian Institute of Left Budgets and Policies, said that such changes were much more likely than the option of tax increases in our financially conservative State. \"It's not like we have to pay tomorrow,\" said Essig. \"We have 30 years of budget planning and policy change to meet our commitments.\" In other words, Georgia has never fulfilled its obligations regarding the health care of retirees or pensions, and there is no reason to expect that this will change any time soon. Since no one expects Georgian taxpayers to crawl into the city centre and pay a lump sum, the report accounts consider some to be a ridiculous practice. It would be useful to discuss commitments, as said by Alicia H. Monel, Executive Director of the Retirement Research Centre. However, a more useful practice would be a separate discussion on long-term debt repayments. Georgia, Monel, said that it had already held many discussions that had resulted in the development of existing laws and policies that were on the right financial track. \"The whole report has this terrible tone, as if they've discovered something new,\" said Monel. \"Really, Georgia should be proud of itself to manage fairly wisely to repay its debts.\" So, the $5000 bill facing Georgian taxpayers? It's a great way to make us pay attention to the promises we made in public dollars. The statement suggests that the State has become reckless, or that a single push will come soon. That's not the case. Georgia has been mindful of its commitments on the horizon and is in a position to repay those debts over time. That's why, we assess the claim mostly false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07387"}
