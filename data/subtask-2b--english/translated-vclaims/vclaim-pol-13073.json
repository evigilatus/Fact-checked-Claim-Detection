The master shows a graph entitled \"Who increases religion?\" For the five former presidents, Ronald Reagan: 189% highest, George H.W. Bush: Up to 55 per cent Bill Clinton: Up to 37 per cent George W. Bush: Up to 115 per cent Barack Obama: Up to 16 per cent we can see why a liberal group is faking such figures, as they - if accurate - provide strong evidence of conservative claims that President Barack Obama was spending putting the nation on an unsustainable financial path. But the reader who sent it to us was surprised to see that the debt increase under Obama was too small. So we decided to check the numbers. The graph actually came from the home minority leader &apos; s Flicker page Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., published on May 5, 2011. Specifically, the chart follows the \"percentage increase in public debt\" of the five Presidents during the following time periods - January 1981 to January 1989 (Reagan), January 1989 to January 1993 (George H.W. Bosch, January 1993 to January 2001 (Clinton), January 2001 to January 2009 (George W. Bush) and January 2009 to April 2011 (Obama). We checked with the Belusi office to find out what data they used to compile the graph. They referred us to \"Debitt\" to Penny's calculator at the U.S. Treasury Department. First, we should note that we have explained the title in the Pelosi graph, which states that \"the percentage increase in public debt\" means public debt, not gross federal debt. Public debt is publicly owned, while the total federal debt includes public debt and government-owned debt, such as money in the Social Security Trust Fund. Despite what the graph card suggests, the data we received from the Belucci office showed that they were using the total number of the federal debt. So we're gonna start like this. We can quickly eliminate the numbers for Reagan and George H.W. (Bosch) The \"Debt to the Beny\" calculator does not return until after 1993, but we were able to estimate the debt figures under Reagan and the Bush elders using data from the Bureau of Management and Budget. The numbers of the Office of the Ombudsman are calculated somewhat different from those of the Treasury, but the percentage increases were close enough to the graph that we would not manipulate them. The debt under Reagan increased by 186 per cent (the chart said 189 per cent) and by 54 per cent under George H.W. Bush (compared to 55 per cent in the chart). Instead, we will focus on Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama figures. Through the online calculator, we have requested the daily debt totals since 1993 and selected the totals closest to the dates of the inauguration of these three Presidents, as well as the end of April 2011. This is what we came here to receive the total federal debt: January 20, 1993 (the end of George H.W. Bush and the beginning of Clinton: $4.188 trillion on 19 January 2001 (end of Clinton and start of George W. Bush): $5.728 trillion on 20 January 2009 (end of George W. Bush and start of Obama): $10.627 trillion on 29 April 2011 (date of closure of the chart): $14.288 trillion allows us to determine the amount of debt that has risen under each president: under Clinton: an increase of $1.54 trillion, or 37 per cent under George W. Bush: an increase of $4.899 trillion, or 86 per cent under Obama: an increase of $3.661 trillion, or 34 per cent so that we can dispense with Clinton - in the chart, its number is correct. But the graph is unclear for both Bush and Obama. We found that Bush has an increase of 86%, not 115%, as the graph says. We found that the debt under Obama increased by 34 per cent, more than double the 16 per cent mentioned in the chart. We quickly discovered the source of the contradiction: whoever put the scheme together used January 20, 2010 -- exactly one year until the day after Obama was sworn in -- instead of the date of his actual inauguration. We know that because the Ministry of Finance says that the debt for January 20, 2010, was $12.327 trillion, which is the exact figure mentioned in the supporting document given to us by the Belusi office. However, whatever error occurred, it actually took one year of rapidly escalating debt from the Obama column to place it in the Bush column, which led to a significant distortion of numbers. The use of corrected numbers means that Democrats have at least a superficial view. However, on a percentage basis, the debt in the Bush era increased more than in the Obama era. However, other graph problems and its methodology undermine even this conclusion. \u2022 Timescales: Bush served a full term of eight years, while Obama had served only 27 months at the time of preparation of the outline. If Obama's number is supposed to be reduced to a full eight-year period, it will have a 121% increase in debt instead of 34%, making it more than Bush's increase. To be fair, this would be a simple practice - but no less misleading than planned. \u2022 Public debt versus total debt: the graph not only says that it uses one statistically and then another, but also chooses the debt that has shown a better comparison. According to the statistics of the Office of the Ombudsman, public debt rose by 70 per cent under Bush, 16 percentage points higher than the total federal debt. According to the Treasury, public debt rose by 53 per cent under Obama, compared with a 34 per cent increase in total federal debt. These figures for the two Presidents could have been more closely reflected in the debt creation records -- without even adapting to the very different length of time in office. \u2022 Debt versus debt as a percentage of GDP: Some economists will tell you that it is not the size of the debt per se, but the size of the debt relative to the GDP of the State. This helps to minimize the complex impact of economic cycles and inflation. So how do you stack these numbers? Using OMB statistics, here's what we've come up with, using public debt figures that have not been adjusted according to the President's tenure: Reagan, 14.9 percentage points high, George H.W. Bush: 7.1 percentage point rise Clinton: 13.4 percentage points decrease George W. Bush: 5.6 percentage points increase Obama: 21.9 percentage points increase (to December 2010 only). Thus, through this measure - a measure that may be more important - Obama is the undisputable king of the last five presidents, rather than the man who added a share to the debt, as proposed by the Pelosi scheme. Of course, all of this shows that statistics can be used - and misused - to reinforce almost any argument. After we submitted our research to the Belusi office, a spokesperson acknowledged that the office had erred in compiling and disseminating the outline and that the office was in the process of redeploying it. The updated version - which corrects the mathematical error but not what we consider to be the three additional design defects - can be found here. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers cited a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for incineration security, and said, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman: January 17, 2021, this is a step in the right direction, but it does not change our assessment because it only occurred as a result of fact-checking. We find so much wrong in this graph that we don't even think it contains any great convergence of right. I made a major arithmetical error that led to a major deviation in the increase of debt away from Obama and towards George W. Bush. It has overlooked the significant differences in the length of time a staff member has spent in his or her post. She chose the scale that was favourable to her case. This contrasts with the GDP-adjusted debt statistics, which show that Obama is the most, not least, principal of the last five. None of this indicates that Obama cannot change the course of things as the economy improves (and Democrats can also take some comfort in the fact that Bill Clinton was remarkably good at all our measurements). However, this chart failed to report on departments that contributed most to debt growth. We evaluate it with pants on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13073"}
