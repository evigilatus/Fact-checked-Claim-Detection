That professor, Kelly said, found no correlation between his opinions and conservative background and even called him a maverick.\n\"He starts out with what he believes he knows about my politics, and then he compares the opinions that I write and join,\" Kelly said. \"He\u2019s looking to see if there\u2019s any necessary correlation between the two. And his conclusion was that there\u2019s not a necessary correlation there, and in fact, he called me a maverick.\"\nA professor who analyzes state Supreme Court justices did suggest Kelly could be a maverick among conservatives \u2014 in 2017, and in one type of case. But a more recent review of opinions indicates that title may belong to another justice.\nSo how does Kelly\u2019s claim stack up?\nSome constitutional theory\nThe blog Kelly referenced, SCOWstats, is run by Marquette University history professor Alan Ball.\u00a0\nWhen asked for evidence to back Kelly\u2019s claim, his campaign referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to an Oct. 16, 2017 post by Ball titled \"Justice Kelly a Maverick? An Update on Fourth Amendment Cases.\" In that piece, Ball found that Kelly and Justice Rebecca Bradley were more receptive to Fourth Amendment arguments than their predecessors.\u00a0\nReminder: The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects people against \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\"\u00a0\nMost Fourth Amendment cases that come before the state Supreme Court are criminal ones, Ball told PolitiFact Wisconsin. That could mean the search of a vehicle in a drug case, as one example. Liberal justices tend to be more sympathetic to defendants, Ball said, while conservatives often support the state and agree the evidence was admissible.\nBall noted that Kelly had only cast a small number of votes at the time of writing and said \"this early impression will need to be checked against the results from subsequent terms.\"\u00a0\nBut Ball was struck by an opinion written by Kelly that cautioned against giving the state Legislature the power to erode people\u2019s constitutional rights, using arguments that could have come from a more liberal justice.\n\"There are certain parts of the State that experience a disproportionate amount of crime,\" Kelly wrote in his opinion for State of Wisconsin v. Navdeep S. Brar. \"Perhaps the legislature might decide police need greater access to homes and other buildings in such areas.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Ball, that opinion and Kelly\u2019s receptiveness to Fourth Amendment arguments distinguished him from other conservatives.\n\"Thus, if one were asked to predict who might emerge, if only occasionally, as a maverick among the court\u2019s five \u2018conservatives\u2019 in the upcoming term, the most conceivable candidate could well be Justice Kelly, and a promising place to look for evidence of this would be his separate opinions in Fourth Amendment criminal cases,\" Ball wrote.\nWhile Kelly cited the post as evidence that he\u2019s an independent thinker, it\u2019s not quite that straightforward.\u00a0\nPay attention to Ball\u2019s phrasing. He didn\u2019t outright call Kelly a maverick \u2014 he instead speculated that the justice could emerge as a possible, but only occasional maverick.\nPlus, Ball wrote that post after Kelly\u2019s first term and focused only on Fourth Amendment cases. That\u2019s certainly not enough for Kelly to hinge his identity on.\u00a0\nThat was then\nKelly\u2019s claim also omits some key information: Ball wrote another, more recent, blog post assigning the title of maverick to someone else.\nOn Jan. 30, 2020, Ball argued in a post that Justice Rebecca Bradley is proving to be more independent than Kelly. The two were in lockstep during the 2016-17 term, Ball\u2019s data show, but Bradley has increasingly deviated from her fellow conservatives.\nIn 2018-19, for example, Kelly voted with conservative Chief Justice Patience Roggensack on two more cases than Bradley, according to Ball. Kelly voted with Justice Annette Ziegler 74% of the time that term, compared to 63% for Bradley.\nSo far this term, Kelly has voted with Roggensack and Ziegler on every case, while Bradley has only voted with them 43% of the time. Ball expects that gap to close as the term progresses, but said Bradley \u2014 as it stands now \u2014 is still twice as likely to disagree with other conservatives than Kelly.\n\"If you wanted to call any of them a maverick, she would be a better candidate this year than Kelly,\" he said.\u00a0\nTranslation: Kelly is relying on an outdated analysis as evidence of his independence.\nOur ruling\nIn a TV interview, Kelly claimed that a Marquette law professor called him a \"maverick\" and found no correlation between Kelly's opinions and conservative background.\nThe professor analyzed Kelly\u2019s rulings on Fourth Amendment cases in 2017 and determined that Kelly \"might\" emerge as a maverick after standing out among his fellow conservatives. But that\u2019s hardly enough to stake an identity on.\nAnd earlier this year, Ball awarded the label to a new justice: Rebecca Bradley. Kelly\u2019s claim completely disregards the most up-to-date analysis of his opinions.\u00a0\nA statement is Mostly False when it contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nThat fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18215"}
