Ted Budd is accusing his Democratic opponent Kathy Manning of benefiting from a development in Greensboro.\nBudd represents North Carolina\u2019s 13th Congressional District, which covers much of the Greensboro-High Point area as well as the mostly rural area south of Winston-Salem and north of Charlotte. Manning is an attorney, and Budd has criticized her for donating more than $500,000 to the Democratic Party and its candidates.\nA\u00a0recent Budd ad, though vague on details, accuses Manning of profiting off a government project.\n\"A parking deck that nobody needed, benefiting a luxury hotel and Kathy Manning,\" a narrator says in the ad. \"$30 million of your tax dollars plus $2.3 million a year to Kathy Manning and her husband, filling the Manning\u2019s swanky hotel and their own French castle.\"\nIt concludes: \"From her castle, it\u2019s no surprise Queen Kathy doesn\u2019t care about doubling parking rates for workers and commuters because Kathy Manning makes government work for her and we pay the price.\"\nManning called on Budd to remove the ad because, she says, it\u2019s nearly identical to a video\u00a0ad by the America First Action Super PAC\u00a0that was removed from a pair of Triad-area radio stations.\nPolitiFact contacted the Budd campaign about the claim. Budd\u2019s spokeswoman, Elizabeth Oglesby, cited several stories about the Westin Hotel being built in Greensboro by Elm Street LLC. Randall Kaplan, Manning\u2019s husband, is a part of the group.\nBut those stories don\u2019t support the ad\u2019s claims.\nAbout the project\nKaplan is described as a leader of Elm Street LLC, which is developing the Westin Hotel project. The city of Greensboro agreed to reimburse developers up to $30 million to build a parking deck adjoining the hotel, the\u00a0Greensboro News & Record\u00a0reported.\nThe deck is expected to be six stories tall and have 850 parking spaces, according to Jake Keys, communications manager for the city of Greensboro.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe $30 million isn\u2019t pure profit for developers. It\u2019s to pay developers to build the deck. That includes material, labor and other costs.\n\"Under the reimbursement agreement, the developer will build a new public parking deck for the City in conjunction with the development of their hotel project. Once complete, the City will fully own and operate the new public parking deck,\" Keys said in an email.\nAn overestimation\nThe city would own the deck and spend an estimated\u00a0$2.6 million a year\u00a0to maintain it and pay down the debt, according to the city\u2019s website. The operating cost will include general deck maintenance, cleaning it and keeping the lights on, Keys said. The city would raise yearly parking spot rental rates from $65 to $128 by 2025, according to another\u00a0News & Record story\u00a0provided by the Budd campaign.\nBut that doesn\u2019t go to Kaplan\u2019s group, either, Keys said.\n\"The City will maintain the deck, thus any amount (whether it is $2.3M or much less) will be completely an internal expense of the City paid for through revenues associated with the deck,\" he wrote. \"In the end, the hotel will pay for parking spaces in the City owned and operated deck just as any other business or individual.\"\nWhatever money Kaplan does receive from the project will be donated to the Community Foundation of Greater Greensboro, the\u00a0foundation announced\u00a0on Aug. 21.\n\"The donations will be used to support a range of charitable programs, including economic and workforce development, health care, education, arts, poverty alleviation and social services in the Central Piedmont region of North Carolina and elsewhere,\" the foundation wrote on its website.\nOur ruling\nBudd\u2019s ad said Kathy Manning got $30 million \"of your tax dollars plus $2.3 million a year\" from a luxury hotel and parking lot. While Manning\u2019s husband was involved in the project, Manning was not. And the $30 million represents the entire cost of the parking deck project \u2014 not gross profit for Manning or her husband. In fact, Kaplan is donating his profits. And the $2.3 million isn\u2019t going to Manning or her husband\u2019s group, either.
