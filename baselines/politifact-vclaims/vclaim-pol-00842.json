(The West Virginia Republican Party did not respond to inquiries for this article.)\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government\u2019s official source for employment data, the annual average for 2018 of women in the labor force was 76 million. That\u2019s an all-time high, as this chart shows:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, simply counting the number of women in the workforce is not very meaningful, because this number almost always goes up from year to year due to simple population growth.\n\"Levels are generally not the appropriate form of measure to look at when examining this particular statistic, because it is influenced by the overall number of women that live in the U.S. \u2013 and since that number is rising, it makes sense that the number of women participating in the labor force would also rise,\" said Brian Lego, a research assistant professor in the West Virginia University economics department.\nA better measurement is to look at the percentage of women who are in the workforce from year to year. And this statistic undercuts the claim in the tweet.\n\nBy this measurement, women\u2019s participation in the workforce peaked in 1999 at roughly 60 percent. It bottomed out in 2015 around 56 percent and has slowly climbed up to 57.5 percent \u00a0in 2019.\nOur ruling\nThe West Virginia Republican Party cited a line from Trump\u2019s State of the Union address in which he said that the United States has \"more women in the workforce than ever before.\"\nThe raw number of women in the workforce is higher than ever, but that\u2019s meaningless because growth in population means that essentially every year brings a higher number.\nThe more appropriate statistic, economists say, is to look at the percentage of women who are in the workforce -- a measurement that takes rising population levels out of the equation. And while that percentage is rising, the historical peak came in 1999.\nWe rate the statement Half True.\n Share the Facts 2019-03-27 20:43:40 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  \"We have more women in the workforce than ever before.\"    West Virginia Republican Party state party organization https://twitter.com/WVGOP/status/1092978085660684288   a tweet Wednesday, February 6, 2019 2019-02-06    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00842"}
