Gorsuch is a conservative federal judge for the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Denver.\n\"If you care about that for your children, he's not your guy,\" Pelosi said during a Jan. 31 town hall on CNN. \"(Former Democratic Rep.) Gabby Giffords' group, the group for responsible solutions relating to gun safety, said that he comes down on the side of felons over gun safety.\"\nPelosi\u2019s claim that Gorsuch \"comes down on the side of felons over gun safety\" caught our attention. Her office sent us a press release that Giffords\u2019 gun control advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, put out along with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\"In his time on the 10th Circuit, (Gorsuch) made repeated efforts to weaken the federal law that\u2019s prohibited felons from possessing guns for the past 50 years, a law that has saved thousands of lives and enjoys near-unanimous support among Americans and elected officials on both sides of the aisle,\" wrote Robyn Thomas, the law center\u2019s executive director.\nIt\u2019s fair to assume that Gorsuch takes a right-leaning approach to the Second Amendment; the National Rifle Association supports him. But it\u2019s misleading to say Gorsuch\u2019s past rulings demonstrate that he thinks more felons should be allowed guns than what is already permitted under the law.\nGames-Perez\nThe primary case in question is United States vs. Games-Perez. The defendant, Miguel Games-Perez, was a convicted felon, and he possessed a gun \u2014 an apparent violation of the federal law that bans felons from knowingly possessing guns. (Remember the word \"knowingly.\")\nGames-Perez, however, wanted to make the case that he shouldn\u2019t be convicted for this offense because he didn\u2019t know he was a felon. He said that the state trial judge who ruled on the prior crime (the felony) repeatedly suggested to Games-Perez that he wasn\u2019t being convicted of a felony but instead a lesser charge.\nIn line with precedent, the 10th Circuit denied Games-Perez\u2019s request. But Gorsuch disagreed.\nGorsuch said he believes the federal law is written in such a way that a defendant must have both knowledge of being a felon and knowledge of possessing a gun in order to be convicted. Thus, Games-Perez should have the opportunity to make his case in court. If it\u2019s decided that Games-Perez really didn\u2019t know he was a felon, he shouldn\u2019t go to prison on this charge.\nThe upshot is that Gorsuch\u2019s opinion did not say felons should be allowed guns or that the law violates the Second Amendment. It said a defendant who didn\u2019t know he was breaking the law should have the chance to make his case in court instead of going straight to prison. He did, though, make the point that this is especially important in this case because possessing a gun is a constitutionally protected right.\nWhile this case has a gun component, Pelosi\u2019s claim has it \"quite backwards because I don\u2019t think Gorsuch\u2019s opinion is about guns. For him, it\u2019s about treating people fairly before sending them to prison,\" said Eric Citron, a partner at Goldstein & Russell who profiled Gorsuch for SCOTUSblog, and a self-described liberal.\nIn theory, if courts adopted Gorsuch\u2019s interpretation of this law, it could marginally weaken the federal law because some people charged with possessing a gun as a felon might successfully convince a jury they didn\u2019t know they were felons and thus not go to prison for that offense. \u00a0But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that felons are not allowed to possess guns, and people generally know whether they\u2019ve been convicted of a felony.\nAdam Skaggs, litigation director for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, emphasized the fact that Gorsuch\u2019s reading of the statute deviated from the majority of justices on the panel, as well as other federal courts.\nAnd if Gorsuch\u2019s opinion were to be adopted, \"The immediate effect is to create the possibility that this guy would be back on the street,\" Skaggs said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReese\nGorsuch\u2019s 2014 decision in United States vs. Reese has also been cited against Gorsuch. But it takes a tremendous leap of logic to view this decision as an attempt to rethink the federal ban on gun possession by felons.\nIn this case, a court had convicted defendant James Reese of being a felon in possession of a firearm. But Reese appealed the decision to the 10th Circuit and won because the state of New Mexico had restored his civil rights. If a felon\u2019s civil rights have been restored under state law \u2014 including the right to vote, serve on a jury, hold public office and own firearms under state law \u2014 federal law allows the felon to legally own a gun.\nThe 10th Circuit\u2019s decision was uncontroversial. The opinion was unanimous and written in just 300 words. Even the government attorneys who brought the original charges conceded \"that Mr. Reese\u2019s federal firearms conviction is unsustainable.\"\nHad the court come to a different conclusion, it would have been \"appalling,\" said Eugene Volokh, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law, who clerked on the Supreme Court with Gorsuch.\nPope\nWe won\u2019t spend much time on this third case, United States vs. Pope. We wanted to note, though, that here, Gorsuch had the opportunity to address the question: Is there a situation in which the federal ban on gun possession by people with domestic violence convictions is unconstitutional?\nHere, he intentionally chose not to answer the constitutional question. Instead, he relied on procedural rules to affirm a grand jury\u2019s decision to charge the defendant, convicted of domestic abuse, with violating the federal ban.\nRule of law\nVolokh and Citron both noted a touch of irony: In both Games-Perez and Reese, Gorsuch advocated in favor of a big-picture principle generally associated with liberals more so than conservatives: defending the rights of criminal defendants.\nThis is an area where the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat Gorsuch might fill, found common ground with liberals, too.\n\"This is a standard liberal position historically,\" Volokh said. \"It\u2019s a standard rule-of-law conservative position, as well. The criticism of (Gorsuch) for this is misplaced.\"\nSkaggs sees it differently. He said Gorsuch is willing to \"bend over backwards\" to make rulings outside the mainstream opinion on the law banning felons from owning guns, noting that it\u2019s important to consider whether Gorsuch would advocate for criminal defendants\u2019 rights in the same manner in cases that don\u2019t involve guns.\nOur ruling\nPelosi said Gorsuch \"comes down on the side of felons over gun safety.\"\nThere\u2019s one case, Games-Perez, where Gorsuch wouldn\u2019t immediately send the defendant, a felon, to prison for having a gun, despite the federal ban on felons possessing guns. But Gorsuch\u2019s reasoning wasn\u2019t about whether the law infringed on the defendant\u2019s Second Amendment rights. Instead, he thought the law allowed the defendant an opportunity to make the case in court that the he didn\u2019t know he was a felon.\nTwo other cases that came up in our research, Pope and Reese, turned out to be irrelevant.\nPelosi\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/499b4c72-4a9d-4076-87de-deafa052455c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03724"}
