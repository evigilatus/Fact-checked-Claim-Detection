But what about the other gains Bennett referenced? PolitiFact Ohio always appreciates a chance to look back at recent history, so we decided to review McNulty\u2019s entire tenure at the Ohio GOP.\n\nAccording to the RNC, McNulty joined the state party in 1995 as field representative covering Northeast and Southeast Ohio. He became political director in 1997 and executive director in 2001. He served in the latter post through 2006, then moved on to the national scene.\n\nRepublicans swept Democrats out of statewide office in 1990, gaining control of the powerful Apportionment Board and setting up an era of dominance in Columbus. Their hold on the board allowed them to draw legislative districts for General Assembly, which approves congressional boundaries. The GOP had ruled the Ohio Senate since 1985 and captured the House in 1994.\n\nRecounting these events is important, as they all occurred prior to McNulty\u2019s arrival. He joined the Ohio Republican Party at a time of great strength. We narrowed in specifically on the decade in which McNulty held the key positions of political director and executive director.\n\nThe most significant accomplishments during that period are the party\u2019s exclusive lock on nonjudicial statewide posts in the 1998 and 2002 elections and control of the General Assembly through 2008. This essentially kept the power of the redistricting pen with Republicans.\n\nIn 2000, after Republican George W. Bush won Ohio\u2019s electoral votes in his bid for the White House, McNulty was part of the team sent to Florida to oversee the recount there.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo years later, under new congressional lines, the party picked up a seat while Democrats lost two. (Because of population trends, Ohio\u2019s delegation shrunk from 19 to 18 seats that year.)\n\nAll of these achievements came during McNulty\u2019s time at the Ohio GOP. It is fair to say that under his leadership, the party capitalized on previous gains and enjoyed new ones.\n\nBut McNulty\u2019s story doesn\u2019t end in 2004. He served as executive director through 2006. That was the year Democrats won all but one of the statewide administrative offices and unseated Republican U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine. Coincidentally, McNulty briefly was a primary candidate for state auditor, serving as a placeholder until questions about Mary Taylor\u2019s petitions were resolved. As it turned out, Taylor was the lone bright spot for the GOP that November.\n\nRepublicans also lost a congressional seat that year. Democrat Zack Space won the battle to replace Republican Rep. Bob Ney, who stepped aside amid corruption charges.\n\nThe Associated Press caught up with McNulty on Jan. 8, 2007, as Taylor was sworn into office and reported that the reality of the defeat had begun to sink in for the executive director.\n\n\"On Election Night, you\u2019re tired,\" McNulty told the AP. \"Today, I\u2019m wide awake. It\u2019s real.\"\n\nJust as it\u2019s unfair to credit one individual for all the party\u2019s successes, it\u2019s unfair to place all the blame for 2006 at McNulty\u2019s feet. With Bush unpopular, the midterm elections represented a wave for Democrats nationally. And Ney\u2019s legal troubles clearly hurt Republicans in that district.\n\nBennett said the state party \"made significant gains\" while McNulty was there. There is no question that this was true between 1997 and 2004. However, Bennett\u2019s statement does not take into account the significant Republican losses in 2006, McNulty\u2019s last year in the Buckeye State.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio is not claiming the losses were McNulty\u2019s fault. We\u2019re not claiming the bad outweighs the good. But the fact that the party was in a weaker position when he left than it was when he arrived is an important clarification.\n\nSo on the Truth-O-Meter, Bennett\u2019s statement rates Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09597"}
