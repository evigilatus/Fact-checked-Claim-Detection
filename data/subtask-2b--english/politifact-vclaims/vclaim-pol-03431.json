General Assembly.\nRep. Greg Murphy, a Republican from Greenville who is also a urology surgeon, is the primary sponsor of what\u2019s being called the STOP Act. That stands for \"Strengthen Opioid Misuse Prevention.\"\nIn the past several weeks, he has promoted his bill with a sobering statistic.\n\"Every day, four North Carolinians die from a medication or drug overdose,\" Murphy said in early March, when he first introduced the bill. \"I prescribe these medications daily and I see the problem first hand.\"\nMurphy has often been quoted or paraphrased in the news repeating some version of that claim about the deadliness of drug overdoses, most recently on Monday when the bill passed the House of Representatives unanimously.\nIt\u2019s a popular argument for a popular bill, which has support from lawmakers of both parties as well as a vocal ally in Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein.\nIn addition to other provisions, the bill would reduce the amount of pain pills a doctor could prescribe to most patients on their initial visits. The idea is that fewer pills will lead to fewer opportunities for abuse or addiction.\nThe STOP Act passed the N.C. House 114-0 and is now in the Senate. But we wondered whether the morbid statistic that\u2019s driving much of the conversation is actually correct.\nHow deadly are prescription pills?\nIn 2015, according to the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, 1,370 people died of unintentional poisonings. Of those deaths, 93 percent (1,274) were drug overdoses \u2013 everything from painkillers to cocaine to heroin.\n\nThat\u2019s an average of 3.5 deaths daily, which is in line with Murphy\u2019s claim of four a day.\nNearly the same number of people died in 2015 from unintentional drug overdoses as died from gunshots. If you also include intentional overdoses, then drugs were deadlier than both guns and car crashes.\nA 2016 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study found the counties with the highest rates of\u00a0drug overdose deaths\u00a0are all in western or southeastern North Carolina.\nBut even though Murphy phrased his claim broadly about all drug overdoses, his bill doesn\u2019t target street drugs like cocaine and heroin. The STOP Act is only aimed at limiting the supply of prescription painkillers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrescription pills were involved in 738 unintentional overdose deaths in 2015. That\u2019s two a day \u2013 certainly troubling, but only about half of Murphy\u2019s claim.\n\nHowever, experts agree there\u2019s a strong link between painkillers and heroin, since they give the same type of high, and heroin tends to be cheaper and more widely available to addicts.\n\"When we talk to people who are injecting heroin, they all got there through prescription opioids,\" said Steve Marshall, an epidemiologist and director of UNC-Chapel Hill\u2019s Injury Prevention Research Center. \"It's not some of them. It's all of them.\"\nMarshall said it would be fair for Murphy to count heroin overdose deaths when promoting the STOP Act, if not cocaine overdose deaths. Cocaine, unlike heroin and painkillers, is not an opioid.\nJust under 1,000 North Carolinians died from an unintentional opioid overdose in 2015 (see here for county-level data).\nThat\u2019s an average of 2.7 per day \u2013 again, not exactly what Murphy said, but not far off.\nLast year California medical company Castlight Health ranked four North Carolina cities among the top 25 nationwide for painkiller abuse. Wilmington, the company\u2019s study said, had the country\u2019s highest rate of opioid abuse. The report found more than half of the prescriptions issued for painkillers in Wilmington are being abused.\nKay Sanford, another UNC-Chapel Hill epidemiologist, is credited with discovering the rising trend of prescription pill addiction and overdoses in North Carolina in the early 2000s. She said many people have been replacing painkillers with heroin in the last few years.\n\"The number of people dying from prescription opioids, in North Carolina and nationwide, has gone down while the number of people dying from heroin has gone up,\" Sanford said. \"So when you combine those two, it's basically the same number.\"\nYet in Murphy\u2019s favor, at least one piece of brand-new research has made the argument that cocaine should be included in these counts, too. In February researchers with several federal government agencies published a paper that argued cocaine overdoses can be linked back to the increased use of opioids like painkillers.\n\"Opioids, primarily heroin and synthetic opioids, have been driving the recent increase in cocaine-related overdose deaths,\" the study concluded.\nOur ruling\nRep. Greg Murphy has been promoting his STOP Act, which would limit access to prescription painkillers, by saying that drug overdoses kill four people a day in North Carolina.\nThat\u2019s basically accurate (it\u2019s 3.5 per day) but prescription pills alone are only responsible for 2 deaths a day \u2013 half of what Murphy said. However, there\u2019s wide agreement in the scientific community that for such counts it makes sense to lump heroin and painkillers together (which cause 2.7 deaths a day) and some research has argued for including cocaine deaths, too.\nEven if his statistics are slightly inflated, Murphy\u2019s general point \u2013 that opioid addiction is leading to multiple deaths per day in North Carolina \u2013 is correct.
