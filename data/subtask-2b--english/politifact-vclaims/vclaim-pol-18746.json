(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It\u2019s been shared more than 5,200 times.\nLeft Action is a popular Facebook page that\u2019s part of a series of online liberal advocacy properties called the Left Action Network. We reached out to the page for evidence to back up its post, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nWe\u2019ve previously fact-checked claims about the Trump children being disallowed from operating charities, but we wanted to take a fresh look at the facts.\nThe Facebook post is wrong to say that the Trump children aren\u2019t allowed to operate charities, and it paints a misleading picture of Hunter Biden\u2019s connection to a nonprofit that fights global hunger.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nWorld Food Program USA is a 501(c)(3) charity based in Washington, D.C. Its mission is to support the World Food Programme, a United Nations-affiliated humanitarian organization that delivers food assistance in dozens of countries around the world.\nThe World Food Programme won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize \u2014\u00a0not World Food Program USA. While the two organizations share a common mission, and the U.S. group frequently donates to the international one, they are separate entities, as evidenced by public tax records.\nHunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, was on the World Food Program USA board of directors from 2011 to 2017 and served as chairman from 2011 to 2015, according to the nonprofit\u2019s annual reports. Randy Russell is the current chairman.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.

But what about the Trump children?\nWe reached out to the White House and Trump\u2019s re-election campaign for more information. A spokesperson for the campaign pointed to an October 2019 PolitiFact fact-check about a Facebook post that claimed the Trumps were \"disallowed from operating any charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity.\"\nWe rated that claim False. Left Action\u2019s recent Facebook post is also misleading.\nIn June 2018, the New York attorney general filed a lawsuit against the president and three of his children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump. The Donald J. Trump Foundation, whose board the Trump children served on, was also named in the lawsuit.\nThe suit claimed that for more than a decade, the foundation violated state and federal laws related to charities in New York state. As a result, it sought to dissolve the foundation and to temporarily prohibit the Trumps from future service as officers or directors in New York charitable organizations.\nIn November 2019, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced a settlement under which the state Supreme Court ordered the president to pay $2 million \"for improperly using charitable assets to intervene in the 2016 presidential primaries and further his own political interests.\" The settlement also required training for the three Trump children and imposed restrictions on the president if and when he joined another charity as director.\nRELATED:\u00a0Trump family \u2018disallowed\u2019 from operating charities in New York? No.\nThe lawsuit had nothing to do with a charity for children with cancer, as the Facebook post claims.\nForbes reported in June 2017 that Eric Trump\u2019s own foundation gave donors the impression that all the money it raised at an annual golf event went to St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, when in reality more than $500,000 went to other causes. Eric Trump resigned from the foundation in December 2016.\nThat scrutiny was separate from the New York attorney general\u2019s lawsuit against Donald J. Trump Foundation, which agreed to dissolve in 2018. And Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump can still operate charities under the terms of the settlement.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18746"}
