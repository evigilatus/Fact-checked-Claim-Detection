We found that this story, which has circulated on multiple websites, lacks any evidence and is filled with ridiculous,\u00a0made-up statements.\nThe story\u2019s only source is an alleged intern -- unnamed -- who interviewed the alleged hitman on behalf of Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity.\nThe story said that the hitman who operated under the alias Wilshire Williams (but was actually named Terrence Wilekenmeyer) was a low-level runner for the mafia until he was sold to Clinton in exchange for 12 cases of confiscated Arkansas moonshine.\nBut now dying of pancreatic cancer with one week left to live, the hitman wanted to come clean and told his story to the Fox News intern.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intern allegedly told The Patriot News that the hitman \"put three bullets in Vince Foster and two in Seth Rich. He tied up more loose ends than any other hitman in history.\"\nFoster was the former White House counsel who committed suicide in 1993. Rich was the Democratic National Committee worker who was murdered in 2016. Both deaths have been the subject of conspiracy theories.\nWe noticed that the supposed real name of the hitman -- Terrence Wilekenmeyer -- was the same last name as Ezekiel Wilekenmeyer, a pen name used by one of the biggest purveyors of fake news, Christopher Blair.\nA Fox News spokeswoman Jaclyn Giuliano said that Hannity had no involvement whatsoever in the story alleging a Clinton hit man confessed on his deathbed.\nThe Patriot Report\u2019s website claims that it offers \"solid conservative perspective on the issues of the day\" and aims to \"to equip the current generation of American Patriots with the right information\" to support and defend the unalienable rights of man. We find that the website posts fake news.\nWe sent a message to The Patriot Report on Facebook and did not hear back.\nA headline said that \"Bill Clinton\u2019s hitman confesses on his deathbed.\" There is no evidence that such a confessing hitman exists. We rate this story Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a48c9791-9917-4581-ae3e-07c2e6d1ff87", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02495"}
