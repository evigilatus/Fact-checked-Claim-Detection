Bob McDonnell failed to create ample jobs", "text": "In a sluggish economy where the spotlight has been on elected officials\u2019 efforts to boost employment, the state Democratic Party is saying Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s job creation efforts are disappointing.\n\nA Feb. 25 news release from the Democratic Party of Virginia cited statistics from a Bureau of Labor Statistics report released that same day showing Virginia\u2019s monthly unemployment rates during 2010 averaged out at 6.9 percent. That\u2019s a slight increase from the 2009 average of 6.8 percent.\n\nThe Democrats also noted the BLS reported a drop in the state\u2019s percentage of working age people with jobs. It fell from 64.9 percent in 2009 to 64.1 percent in 2010.\n\nBrian Moran, chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, fired out a news release charging the numbers demonstrate \"the governor and his team did not even create enough jobs to keep pace with population growth.\"\n\nWe dove into the BLS numbers to see if Moran is right.\n\nWe started with his claim that in 2010 - the first year of \u00a0McDonnell\u2019s term - \u00a0Virginia\u2019s average monthly unemployment rate rose .1 percent to 6.9 percent. That\u2019s true, but it provides an skewed picture.\n\nThat\u2019s because when McDonnell was inaugurated in January 2010, the state unemployment rate was 7.2 percent -- its highest point of the year. The rate slowly declined the rest of the year and ended at 6.6 percent by December, ranking Virginia 9th lowest in the nation.\n\nIn other words, the unemployment rate improved during McDonnell\u2019s first year as governor. And one could make an argument that, when it comes to computing the monthly average for 2010, McDonnell was hurt by a relatively high unemployment rate he inherited from his predecessor, Democrat Tim Kaine.\n\nMoran doesn\u2019t go there. Nor does he mention that Virginia\u2019s monthly unemployment rate in 2009 -- Kaine\u2019s last full year in office -- increased from 5.7 percent in January to 7.2 percent in December.\n\nWe\u2019re not pointing this out to say one governor performed better that the other. Economists have repeatedly told us that governors have a limited impact on employment in their states. We\u2019re merely pointing out that there\u2019s a variety of ways to interpret these statistics.\n\nVirginia\u2019s 6.9 percent unemployment rate for 2010 was far better than the national rate of 9.6 percent.\n\nLet\u2019s turn to Moran\u2019s second assertion, that percentage of working-age Virginians with jobs fell from 64.9 percent in 2009 to 64.1 percent in 2010. His numbers are correct.\n\nWe were curious whether the percentage of the state\u2019s population with jobs continued to improve throughout 2010 just like the unemployment rate did.\n\nTo the contrary, the numbers got worse. \u00a0The percentage of employed working-age Virginians declined from 64.3 percent in January to 63.9 percent in December.\n\nSo, as Moran says the population growth did indeed outpace job growth in 2010. But is that McDonnell\u2019s fault?\n\nHoward Wial, an economist and fellow with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, is dismissive of Moran\u2019s use of the BLS statistics to to fault McDonnell.\n\n\"I\u2019m not saying the governor is right that he\u2019s been a wonderful job creator or that the Democrats are right in saying he hasn\u2019t been,\" Wial said. \"I\u2019m just saying that these numbers don\u2019t prove anything either way \u2026 They don\u2019t show you any connection between public policy and results.\"\n\nVirginia, with 64.1 percent of its working age population employed last year, out-performed the national average of 58.5 percent. Just like Virginia, the national percentage of working age people who were employed declined by .8 percent from 2009 to 2010.\n\nAt the end of Kaine\u2019s term, the percentage of employed working-age Virginians fell by 1.8 percent -- from 66.7 percent in 2008 to 64.9 percent in 2009. So the same argument Moran uses to disparage McDonnell\u2019s performance could also be hurled at Kaine.\n\nLet\u2019s review.\n\nMoran uses two sets of data to prove his point that job growth lagged a rise in population during McDonnell\u2019s first year as governor.\n\nHe says Virginia\u2019s the average of Virginia\u2019s monthly unemployment rates rose in 2010.While technically correct, a month-to-month review shows the unemployment rate was at a high point when McDonnell took office in January and fell throughout the year. Moran\u2019s use of the annual unemployment rates is misleading and cloaks that improvement.\n\nMoran also cites a drop in the percentage of working-age Virginians who were employed last year. The numbers certainly confirm his claim that state job growth did not keep pace with population growth. So he\u2019s right on the trend, but it\u2019s questionable whether the sluggish job environment can be laid at the feet of a governor who has been in office for a year.\n\nWhile there is some truth in Moran\u2019s statement, he also uses a misleading figure to paint\u00a0an inaccurate picture of the jobs situation under McDonnell. We rate the statement Half True.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13494"}
