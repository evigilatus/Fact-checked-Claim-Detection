And if you take this line and you project what has been happening into the future, we will get less and less competitive. So we need something else.\"\n\n\u2022 \"Attack the costs first, and then worry about expanding coverage. I would much rather see another plan that really attacks costs. And I think that's what the American public wants to see. I mean, the American public is not behind this bill.\"\n\nThe post goes on to paraphrase Buffett as saying he would scrap Obamacare and start over.\nA variety of other conservative media outlets spotlighted the post in the past week as a development in the ongoing battle over the health care law, such as Wall Street Journal blogger James Taranto and Newsbusters.\nBut the comments come from an interview that Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., gave to CNBC on March 1, 2010 -- three and a half years ago, before the bill was signed.\nBuffett's office told PolitiFact that the blog reports do not reflect his views. Buffett \"has never said or thought that Obamacare should be scrapped,\" said Debbie Bosanek, Buffett's assistant. She said she showed him our research and that he said our analysis \"covered it very well.\"\nSo what did Buffett say in 2010? They can be found in a\u00a0Politico article published at the time that summarized the interview.\nThat article also includes other tidbits excluded from the more recent blog posts that paint a more nuanced picture of his views.\n\u2022 Buffett was referring to a bill that was still pending in Congress. At the time of his comments, a bill had passed the Senate, but lawmakers were still deciding how to get it through the House, so he\u2019d have reason to think his comments might carry some weight in bargaining over details. He was not referring to the law after it was on the books, and he did not make his comments with three and a half years of hindsight from looking at its implementation.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Buffett said the bill he was criticizing was still worth passing despite its imperfections. According to Politico, Buffett was asked on CNBC whether he would be in favor of scrapping the Senate\u2019s version of the health care bill; he responded: \"I would be.\" However, Politico also noted \"that while he does not like the Senate bill, he\u2019d vote for it in preference to doing nothing.\"\nBuffett said in the interview, \"If it was a choice today between plan A, which is what we've got, or plan B, \u2026 the Senate bill, I would vote for the Senate bill. But I would much rather see a plan C that really attacks costs.\"\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in July 2012, just after the Supreme Court upheld the health care law, Buffett told Bloomberg TV that the court made the right decision.\nInvoking the same metaphor, Buffett said health care is \"the tapeworm, essentially, of the American economy, and we have not dealt with that yet.\" But he added, \"Obamacare is a step in the right direction in many ways.\"\nShortly after we started looking into the blog posts, the Weekly Standard added an \"update\" to its post. It said, \"It appears that Buffett made his anti-Obamacare comments in 2010, thereby showing that he, like most of the American people, has opposed Obamacare since even before it was passed \u2014 a point that Mark Hemingway addressed yesterday in response to USA Today\u2019s implication that Americans\u2019 widespread dislike of Obamacare is mostly attributable to Republicans\u2019 efforts to fight it.\"\nWe sent inquiries to the Weekly Standard and Money Morning but did not hear back. We also sent an inquiry to Buffett and will publish a comment if he offers one.\nOur ruling\nA variety of blogs reprinted an item indicating that Warren Buffett recently said \"Scrap Obamacare and Start All Over.\" However, the comments came from an interview in 2010, when the health care bill was still being debated, and are not based on the subsequent three and a half years of seeing the law implemented. If anything, comments by Buffett in 2012 suggest that he\u2019s pleased to see the law being put into effect, despite the shortcomings he sees. The notion that Buffett had recently turned on a president he supported by souring on his signature health care law could have been easily debunked using Google searches.
