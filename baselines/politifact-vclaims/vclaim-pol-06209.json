But Fiorina said a dearth of new small businesses is preventing more than anemic growth at the moment.\n\"In fact, we're destroying more businesses in the United States now than are being created for the first time in our history,\" she said.\nPolitiFact has looked at this claim before, and when we asked Fiorina\u2019s campaign where they found their statistic, they pointed to the same source -- the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Business Dynamics Statistics data. Fiorina is accurate to say that more business firms are closing than are opening, but the data can\u2019t say for sure whether this is the first time that\u2019s happened in the 239-year history of the United States.\nA Fiorina spokeswoman sent us a September 2014 article from Gallup that examined the data, which showed that the startup rate for new businesses first dipped below the closure rate in 2008. The trend has remained through 2011, the latest year of available data.\nHere\u2019s a chart illustrating Fiorina\u2019s point, from a May 2014 Brookings Institution study of the same data:\n\nAs you might notice, the chart only goes back to 1978. Why? Because the Business Dynamics Statistics database only goes back to the 1970s. Before then, there was no official metric recorded -- by the federal government or anyone else -- for business startups and deaths.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomists say that really limits the ability to judge claims like Fiorina's, who talked about the entire history of the country. Business failures may have exceeded startups at other points, such as during the Great Depression, but it\u2019s impossible to say without reliable data.\nClaims like Fiorina\u2019s are \"somewhere between plausible and impossible to prove,\" Robert Litman, a Brookings economics fellow who has studied the number of business openings and closings, told PolitiFact. He suggested it would be \"more accurate to say that for the first time since the government began tracking these things, fails have exceeded starts.\"\nThe reasons for this trend are harder to determine. \"Despite all this research, there has been no definitive answer as to why the rate of U.S. startups has declined so precipitously,\" the Gallup story concedes. Fiorina told Stephanopoulos the problem was \"crony capitalism\" and a \"very large, powerful, complicated government\" that made it difficult for smaller businesses to survive while bigger, established business have thrived.\nLitman, in his research, noted that \"it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy -- whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones.\"\nAs HP\u2019s CEO, Fiorina oversaw a controversial $25 billion acquisition of Compaq in 2001. The move resulted in 30,000 layoffs as the two companies merged operations. HP\u2019s board of directors fired Fiorina in 2005 for poor stock performance and missed earnings targets.\nOur ruling\nFiorina said, \"In fact, we're destroying more businesses in the United States now than are being created for the first time in our history.\"\nThe data she\u2019s relying on, however, only looks back to 1978, and economists say it\u2019s going a bit too far to say this is the first time such a trend has occurred in all of U.S. history. The fact is we simply don\u2019t have definitive data to prove it either way.\nFiorina\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
