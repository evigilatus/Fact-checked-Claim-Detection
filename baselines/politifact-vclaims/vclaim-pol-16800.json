Then-U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., said at the time that if Trump insisted on building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border despite Congress\u2019s opposition, his actions could lead down a path toward impeachment.\nIn December 2016, five Democratic senators, including 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, announced they would introduce a bill to require Trump to divest assets that could pose a conflict of interest in his role as president. They said the legislation would symbolically make violations of federal conflict-of-interest rules \"a high crime or misdemeanor under the impeachment clause of the U.S. Constitution.\"\nBut those are only examples of Democrats raising the possibility of impeachment \u2014 far short of promising to do it. And Pelosi and Schiff were not involved.\nTrump\u2019s evidence\nThe same is true of two statements cited to us by the Republican National Committee to back Trump\u2019s claim in the ad.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(The ad, by the way, was placed by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint fundraising committee composed of the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. As of Sept. 30, 2019, it had raised more than $96 million during 2019, according to the latest figures from the Federal Election Commission.)\n1. A Schiff tweet on Dec. 22, 2016, said: \"There\u2019s no question the Emoluments Clause applies to POTUS \u2013 including Trump. Severe remedies if its violated, including impeachment.\"\nThe Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause bars officials from receiving payments from foreign entities and is the basis for lawsuits challenging foreign payments to Trump\u2019s Washington hotel. It has rarely been tested in court.\nAt the time, the federal Office of Government Ethics was urging Trump to sell his business holdings as the \"only way to resolve these conflicts of interest.\" Similarly, Schiff was calling on the president-elect to \"divest completely,\" raising impeachment as one possible consequence if Trump didn\u2019t, but not pledging to impeach.\n2. U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, another California Democrat, said four days before the inauguration that if there was evidence the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians by using hacked information from Democratic National Committee emails against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, it would be an impeachable offense. Waters has repeatedly called for Trump\u2019s impeachment, but those demands didn\u2019t start until the months after Trump took office.\nThe RNC didn\u2019t provide us any information about Pelosi. A Pelosi spokesman denied to us that Pelosi ever promised before Trump took office that she would seek to impeach him.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Pelosi and Schiff long resisted calls by other Democrats to initiate an impeachment inquiry. Pelosi launched the inquiry, in September 2019, only after evidence emerged Trump allegedly pressured the president of Ukraine to open a corruption investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and the rest of the corrupt Democrats made a promise to their crazy left-wing base that they would impeach me even BEFORE I took office.\"\nThe Republican National Committee, on Trump\u2019s behalf, cited no evidence of such promises and we did not find any.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16800"}
