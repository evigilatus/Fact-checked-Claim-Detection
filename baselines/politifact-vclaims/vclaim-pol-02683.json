Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat fake news.\nThe article states that Parks\u2019 granddaughter defended Trump to denounce claims from \"Antifa\" protesters that Trump is a \"racist bigot\" and a \"traitor.\"\nThe article quoted Parks\u2019 supposed granddaughter, Muriel Parks-Gouldman, speaking to students at Oxford University: \"This violence and destruction I see from my people is just unacceptable. My grandmother took a stand by sitting down, but she would never \u2018sit down\u2019 while our once-proud people cover their faces and commit violent acts in the streets.\"\nBut the story is fake because Rosa Parks was childless when she died in 2005 at age 92. The photo in the story is of Ohio state lawmaker Nina Turner.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRosa Parks is a famous African-American civil rights icon who in 1955 refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man in Montgomery, Ala. The goal of the story appears to be to shock readers that a grandchild of Parks would side with Trump, who called the violence in Charlottesville a result of \"hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\"\nIn August, we fact-checked a similar claim that \"Rosa Parks\u2019 daughter praises (President Donald) Trump\u2019s response to Charlottesville.\" In that article, Parks\u2019 daughter had a similar name: Muriel Parks-Rosenberg.\nWe messaged the website on Facebook and received a reply directing us to scroll to the bottom of the page. The disclaimer states: \"Nothing on this site is real. It is satire. Call it \"fan fiction\" if you prefer.\"\nThe headline says, \"Rosa Parks\u2019 granddaughter SLAMS racist Democrats, endorses Trump.\" But Parks didn\u2019t have children. For viewers who scroll to the bottom of the page, they will find a disclaimer that describes the website as satire.
