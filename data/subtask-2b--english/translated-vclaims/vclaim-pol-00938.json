In 2016, black voters preferred Hillary Clinton to Sanders at an impressive 50 percentage point (although he had little progress among those under 30 years of age). However, according to Pundit and former employee of the Hillary Clinton campaign Xerlina Maxwell, the Sanders speech in which the bid was announced in 2020 did not do much to support his support. Maxwell, speaking of MSNBC after Sanders' remarks, said that the senator buried any male race and gender up to the depth of his presidential speech in 2020. \"I've recorded it.\" He didn't mention race or sex until 23 minutes in this speech, \"Maxwell said March 2. \"as someone who's a black woman... I was looking for private messages for my community, and I didn't hear them, at least until 23 minutes of speech.\" Subsequently, the same letter was transmitted to more than 150,000 Twitter followers - in a tweet that has since been deleted. But a review of the tape shows that Sanders mentioned these constituencies earlier in his speech, Maxwell's signal now says that they were mistakenly ignored. In his inaugural speech, Sanders organized the first gathering of the 2020 campaign in Brooklyn, several miles from his birthplace. In his opening remarks, he thanked his family and acknowledged several key supporters. Within the first five minutes of his speech, Sanders proposed to rearrange the governing principles in America, and he made a specific reference to race and gender (emphasis added): \"At our first gathering, I would like to welcome you to a campaign, saying loud and clear that the basic principles of our Government will not be greed, hatred and lies. It will not be racism, sexual prejudice, xenophobia, homophobia and religious intolerance. It will not be the tax exemptions for the billionaires and the efforts to free millions of people from the health care they currently enjoy. \"This campaign will end all this. The principles of our government will be based on justice. On economic justice, social justice, ethnic justice, environmental justice.\" Sanders referred to race and gender again about 21 minutes in his speech. Sanders pledged a campaign to unite the country, and said, contrary to President Donald Trump, who \"wanted to divide us based on the colour of our skin, based on where we were born, based on our sex, based on our religion or sexual orientation.\" He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2012, MSNBC broadcast the speech, which lasted approximately 37 minutes. After that, the host Alex Whit moved to the team for their reaction, at which point Maxwell Sanders claimed to have been silent about race and gender until 23 minutes. Maxwell said: \"Only for the point of comparison, I went back and looked at Elizabeth Warren's opening speech.\" \"It mentions race and gender in the first paragraph. So that's a big difference.\" Maxwell &apos; s claim was met with a quick reaction. Reporter Glenn Greenwald noted that Sanders had already presented a series of speakers, including three African-Americans (including Greenwald &apos; s opposition colleague, Sean King), each highlighting the senator &apos; s record as the champion of racist justice. In response to the criticism on Twitter, Maxwell retracted her first claim. (I later deleted the wrong first tweet) \"Well, I've reviewed again since yesterday, and while I can admit that I missed the traffic line in six minutes and I stand by my point of view because talking about criminal justice isn't the same thing as talking about race and gender and if you don't understand why Bernie won't win... again. \"I've tweeted. Well, I've reviewed it since yesterday, and while I can admit that I missed the crossing line in six minutes, I stand by my point of view. \u2219 On 3 March 2019, Maxwell, in an interview with Politifakt, admitted the error, but stood next to her broader point that Sanders had not adequately addressed the issues in his introductory address. It should be noted that Saunders gave another speech in the election campaign on 3 March that addressed the issue of race in more explicit terms. After the celebration of the 54th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Salma, Ala, Sanders delivered a speech in Chicago calling for \"the end of institutional racism that permeates almost every aspect of our society.\" Our rule, Maxwell, Sanders, said, \"Never mentioned race or gender until 23 minutes of this speech,\" his announcement to preside over him in 2020. Sanders referred to race and gender during the first five minutes of his speech. Maxwell has since admitted that she ignored this, and deleted the wrong tweet. We're assessing this wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00938"}
