At some point you\u2019ve got to deal with these root issues.\"\nWe reached out to Williams to better understand his statement but did not hear back. We think you could interpret his words two ways.\nYou might think that a majority of white people believe black people are less intelligent, trustworthy and patriotic.\nOr you could hear Williams' claim and think that within the white population, you\u2019re more likely to find people who think poorly of blacks. You could have that trend even if most whites don\u2019t think that way.\nThe difference in interpretation makes all the difference, polls show.\nWhat the polls show about race\nTo make sense of racial attitudes, pollsters ask whites and blacks the same set of questions about their own group and the other group. Then they compare the results.\nA 2012 survey from a partnership of the Associated Press, the GfK polling firm, Stanford University, the National Center for Opinion Research (NORC) and the University of Michigan attempted to answer questions about how one race thought of the other.\nThe series of questions followed the pattern of, \"How well does each of these words describe most blacks/whites?\"\nWords included \"intelligent at school,\" \"smart at everyday things,\" \"law abiding,\" \"good neighbors\" and \"dependable.\"\nThe possible responses were Extremely well, Very well, Moderately well, Slightly well and Not at all well.\nJosh Pasek, a researcher at the University of Michigan who worked on the project, broke down the results for us to help analyze Williams' claim. \"Intelligent at school\" and \"smart at everyday things\" are approximations for intelligence. \"Law abiding,\" \"good neighbors\" and \"dependable\" work as stand-ins for trustworthy. (Alas, the survey did not ask about patriotism.)\nThis approach lets you tease out how many whites have negative opinions of whites, and how many whites have negative opinions of blacks. And you can compare that to black perspectives on whites and blacks.\nThe results: A majority of whites don't hold negative views of blacks. But you will find a group of whites who view blacks more harshly than whites. And that group is bigger than the fraction of blacks who see blacks negatively.\nThe following chart shows the negative opinions of whites. The green bar is the percentage of whites holding a negative opinion of blacks. The brown bar is the percentage of whites holding negative views of other whites.\nThe higher the column, the more negative the feeling.\n\nThe clear pattern is that whites are more likely to have a negative view of blacks than of whites. To round out the picture, the fraction of blacks who hold negative views of blacks is about half that of whites.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional study results\nWe looked at other studies in this area, including one that looked at people's views on patriotism.\nIntelligence.\u00a0A group of researchers led by Harvard University sociologist Lawrence Bobo looked at\u00a0recent trends in white attitudes about blacks. That research shows that since 1990, the fraction of whites who think that whites are more intelligent and more hardworking than blacks has declined.\n\n\u00a0\nTom Smith, director of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago\u2019s National Opinion Research Center (NORC), told us that \"racial differences have decreased over time, but many whites still rate blacks more negatively than they rate whites on various traits.\" Smith said in the 2014 survey, one quarter of whites rated blacks as less intelligent than whites.\nTrustworthy. Angie Maxwell, a political scientist\u00a0at the University of Arkansas, told us that the 2012 Blair Center national poll found that about a fifth of whites (20 percent) say that blacks are untrustworthy.\nGenerally negative views. Vincent Hutchings at the University of Michigan pulled responses from the American National Election Study to assess the impact of race on the 2008 election of Barack Obama. Hutchings didn\u2019t report how whites answered specific questions but he wrote that overall, a \"slight majority of Latinos and Whites indicate that they view Blacks more negatively than they do Whites.\"\nPatriotism. Spencer Piston, a political scientist at Syracuse University, directed us to the American National Election Study, which added patriotism to its questionnaire. Piston ran the numbers for us and found that for whites:\n46 percent rate blacks less patriotic than they rate whites;\n49 percent rate blacks equally patriotic to how they rate whites;\n5 percent rate blacks more patriotic than they rate whites.\nA final note\nThe connection between these survey results and overt racism is far from straightforward. Pasek at the University of Michigan said the connection between outcomes is even more complex.\n\"If you look at the series of recent incidents, from Trayvon Martin to Ferguson, Mo., those are not necessarily cases where people would have actively espoused racist attitudes,\" Pasek said. \"But there could be an internal racial predisposition that would lead them to act in prejudicial ways, and social science suggests that most of us harbor these implicit biases.\"\nOur ruling\nWilliams said polls show that white people think that black people are less intelligent, less trustworthy and less patriotic. The veracity of Williams' claim hinges on how you interpret his comments.\nOne way: That whites are more likely to hold negative opinions of blacks (than they do of fellow whites or blacks do of blacks), is largely accurate.\nBut a second way: That a majority of whites hold negative opinions of blacks, is inaccurate.\nOn the question of\u00a0patriotism, the data are thin. But what we have suggests that Williams is wrong.\nWilliams\u2019 statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06254"}
