As stated in the report, on February 1, 2019, Wisconsin &apos; s politics, Foxcon, said that it would already build a liquid crystal factory in Wisconsin, after talks between President Donald Trump and the CEO of Terry Go. On January 30, 2019, Reuters reported that Louis Wu, Special Assistant to Go, said that the company was considering moving away from high-quality display screens and was likely to hire most engineers and researchers instead of the manufacturing workforce originally promised by the project. As part of the deal between Foxcon and Wisconsin Economic Development, the State will pay Foxcon up to $2.85 billion in cash over 15 years, depending on how many jobs the company creates and how much the company invests in the plant. The company also receives a further sale tax reduction of up to $150 million for construction materials for the plant. The total incentive, together with aid from local governments and public utility payers, amounts to about $4 billion, against the manufacturing facility and up to 13,000 jobs. The response in Wisconsin to the news Foxcon was thinking about changing his plans was fast. On 30 January 2019, a joint statement by the President of the Assembly, Robin Voss, R-R-Ruchster, and the President of the majority in the Senate, Scott Fitzgerald, R-Jonao, blamed the democratic government. Tony Evers says his administration brought with it a wave of economic uncertainty. We've evaluated those pants on fire. A separate part of their statement put forward another claim that we wanted to verify: \"From the beginning, we were looking for the interest of taxpayers in the state,\" reading the statement. \"No dollar will be paid until posts are created in the Foxcon Development Area. The incentive package is based on the fulfilment of the contract.\" Does the Global System Legislators correct that \"no dollar will be paid until jobs are created in the Foxcon area?\" When evidence support was requested, the Vos Kit Bayer spokesman presented this statement by e-mail: \"This part of the statement refers directly to the State incentives agreed in the contract with Foxcon in the Income Tax Credit Area.\" No government taxes are granted with exemption from the sales tax. The seatmarks established for the incentive scheme criticized by Democrats have not been met, as indicated in the letter to WISconsin Economic Development Corporation.\" On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 On 20 January 2021, I also noted that Foxcon had not achieved its 2018 functional goals and therefore had no access to the relevant State funds. Let's break it. In January 2019, Foxcon reported 178 full-time employees in Wisconsin State in 2018 as of 31 December 2018 - 82 jobs below the minimum required for the company to immediately request government tax exemptions for job creation. However, Foxcon still has access to credit for employment in 2018 by compensating for the lack of job creation in the coming years of its long-term contract with the State. Exemption from sales tax: Unlike employment-related incentives, Foxcon already benefits from a reduction in the State sales tax of up to $150 million. According to a report issued by the Legislative Tax Office in 2017, the Revenue Department estimates that the tax exemption for sales and use will result in tax savings of $139 million for Foxcon and its contractors. It's worth the money to Foxcon, but it's louder. As the Bureau's tax report notes, in part: \"As it is highly unlikely that Foxcon would be in the state without the incentives provided by law, this amount should not be seen as a loss of State revenue.\" Local Incentives: In the statement, Voss and Fitzgerald framed their claim for State-based Incentives. But this ignores another important piece of work -- support from local government units. The village of Mount Pleasant and Racine Province have so far borrowed $355 million to support Foxcon. Of this amount, approximately $190 million was spent by local governments, with most funds allocated for land purchases. So, considering the three, the \"not a dollar\" claim from Voss and Fitzgerald is a mixed bag. If you look closely at the incentives for work, they are both on solid ground. However, their original statement generally refers to government tax dollars. The company does provide dollars through exemption from the building sales tax, even if it is not considered a loss of State revenue. Finally, while funds borrowed at the local level may not be fully regarded as government incentives, they constitute a significant public investment in the project. And this money is already being spent -- the fact that the claim shines more than that. Our evaluation of Voss and Fitzgerald said \"not a dollar\" in taxpayers' money will be paid until jobs are created in the Foxcon Development Area. While job creation incentives have not begun, this is only part of state-level support - the company is already benefiting from exemption from the sales tax on construction materials. In addition, the statement ignores the costs incurred by local taxpayers - costs that the company actually benefits from. Anyway, we're mostly assessing the claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01067"}
