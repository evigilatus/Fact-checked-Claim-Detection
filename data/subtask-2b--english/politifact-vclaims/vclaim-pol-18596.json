Snopes in February 2017 reported that the image did not appear in \"The Simpsons,\" and while its origins are unclear, it appears to have been promoted on the fringe forum website 4chan.\nThe Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nEarlier this year, social media posts also claimed that \"The Simpsons\" predicted Trump would die Aug. 27, 2020, and used that same image of Trump in a coffin. \"The Simpsons\" has featured Trump before, but we found no indication that the show aired an episode of him in a coffin.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Oakley, a former writer for \"The Simpsons,\" told the Hollywood Reporter in a story published March 2020 that the show gets too much credit for predicting the future and also didn\u2019t like past episodes being used for nefarious purposes. Facebook posts have falsely claimed that \"The Simpsons\" predicted the coronavirus. We rated that Pants on Fire.\n\"There are very few cases where \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 predicted something,\" Oakley told the Hollywood Reporter. \"It's mainly just coincidence because the episodes are so old that history repeats itself. Most of these episodes are based on things that happened in the '60s, '70s or '80s that we knew about.\"\nIn his Oct. 2 tweet, Trump said that his wife, Melania Trump, also tested positive for COVID-19. \"We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!,\" Trump said.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18596"}
