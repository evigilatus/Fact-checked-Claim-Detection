You're looking at Baltimore. You're looking at the violence in the inner cities. Chicago. Take a look at Washington, D.C., we have an increase in homicides within our cities, the largest in 45 years.\" Trump is largely on target that \"we have an increase in homicide within our cities, 45 years older.\" His staff did not respond to any investigation, but Trump appears to refer to a set of annual statistics produced by the FBI. The last report was issued in September. These statistics showed that between 2014 and 2015, the number of manslaughter and manslaughter increased by 10.8 per cent nationwide. When we verified the figures, we confirmed that this increase ranked the highest year-to-year jump in homicides since 1970-1971, when the number rose by 11.1 per cent. That was exactly 45 years ago. In fact, Trump &apos; s discussion comment was more accurate than one of his main replacements -- former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- said earlier today about the press meeting. Giuliani mentioned that \"last year, crime has increased more than it has been in the past 41 years.\" Juliani not only erred in the number of years, but also referred to a \"crime\" in general, not to murders specifically. That makes a difference. Violent crimes rose between 2014 and 2015, but by far less than homicides -- 3.9 per cent. This rate of increase has been lower than a number of year-to-year increases since 1971, the most recent of which was a 10.6 per cent increase between 1989 and 1990. In addition, property offences actually decreased by 2.6 per cent between 2014 and 2015. So Trump has a fair point. However, we will note two warnings. First of all, it wasn't a full term. An increase of 10.8 percent represents a comprehensive national number -- not the number of murders \"inside our cities,\" as Trump said. However, urban homicide rates tend to be higher than in the country as a whole, as this graph shows. (Red line is the rate for cities with a population of over 250,000, while the Blue Line is the rate for the country as a whole). Therefore, this defect in Trump's formulation does not raise our problems in particular. A bigger problem for Trump is that he ignores some important contexts - as we have noted before - that crime rates have been declining for a quarter of a century before the last rise, and that the recent increase is hardly large enough to erase those gains. With regard to current homicide statistics, the following graph shows a sharp rise in the number of homicides between 1970 and the early 1990s, followed by a somewhat steady decline since then. Specifically, the number of homicides decreased by 42 per cent between 1993 and 2014, even as the United States population increased by 25 per cent during the same period. On January 8, 2021, Sherwood Brown stated in an interview with Ohio Summer journalists: \"Protesters outside the White House were interviewed with tear gas, rubber bullets, and full military response. While the rioters were able to break through the Capitol Building. \" After the latest FBI statistics were released, we asked many criminal scientists how concerned they were at the rise in the recent murder. It was certainly worth noting - but it also needed to be understood in a broader context. \"The rates of violent crime are higher than historical declines, and they are still very low compared to what they were only five or ten years ago,\" said Raymond Patterson, from Maryland University of Criminology. Alan Lisette, a university in the Albanian world of crime, agreed. \"A small increase between two points of time is not an increase when 20 years are declining,\" he said, \"a small increase between two points of time is not an increase when 20 years are declining.\" \"If it lasts for several years, it may indicate an increase.\" James Alan Fox, a crime scientist from the University of the North-East, said that while \"crime has risen, it is uncertain that it will continue. This major leap in homicide, the most volatile figure in crime, can easily be followed by a shift in the other direction. One year doesn't make the trend.\" For example, in the past, see the October 2006 report of the Police Operational Research Forum, which referred to an increase in 2005, as reflected in our graphs above. The group warned of \"a mass storm of violent crime threatening to undermine significant reductions in past crimes.\" However, starting in 2006, the crime began to fall again, and remained so for most of the next decade. As Jeffrey Pats from John Jay Criminal Justice School recently said to the Guardian, \"I lost 50 pounds. I've earned a couple. You're not fat. This does not mean that you should not look at your behaviour, because the trend is not good.\" Our Governor Trump said, \"We have an increase in homicide within our cities, the oldest in 45 years.\" The number of homicides at the national level has increased by the largest number in 45 years, and crime scientists agree that this is a development that deserves attention. But they add that it comes after a sharp fall in a quarter of a century, indicating that it is not yet a cause for panic. The statement is precise but requires clarification and additional information. We're mostly assessing it right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dbd0f6e6-df11-462a-bf5c-ac53c13c462f", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04165"}
