In remarks after the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, Trump drew an explicit comparison between his proposed wall and the Great Wall of China.\n\"They say you\u2019ll never be able to build a wall,\" Trump said on March 2, 2016. \"Well, it\u2019s 2,000 miles but we really need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago, is 13,000 miles, folks, and they didn\u2019t have Caterpillar tractors, because I only want to use Caterpillar, if you want to know the truth, or John Deere. \u2026 We can do that so beautifully. And this is going to be a serious wall. This is going to be a high wall. This is going to be a very serious wall.\"\nA number of people asked us to check whether Trump\u2019s description of the Great Wall -- that it was built 2,000 years ago and that it\u2019s 13,000 miles long -- was accurate.\nAfter checking with scholars of the period, we found that the numbers Trump are grounded in reality, but that there\u2019s a lot of nuance that\u2019s been lost in the process.\nThe wall was \u2018built 2,000 years ago\u2019\nAs a starting point for the Great Wall\u2019s construction, \"2,000 years ago\" has some merit. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and other groups say that around 220 B.C., efforts began to link together existing earthen walls on modern-day China\u2019s northern frontier.\nBut today, those early walls are barely discernible, if at all. Better constructed portions of the wall only came into existence much later -- and over many centuries,\u00a0said Lynn A. Struve, an East Asian historian at Indiana University and author of\u00a0Time, Temporality, And Imperial Transition: East Asia From Ming To Qing..\n\"Almost every dynasty contributed to building the wall,\" said Arthur Waldron, an East Asian historian at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of the seminal 1992 volume, The Great Wall of China: From History to Myth. (The bottom portion of the figure below shows the full historical timeline.)\n\u00a0\n\nIndeed, the most familiar and best-preserved portions of the wall are more recent than Trump indicated -- only 300 to 600 years old. They were built during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), when the Great Wall became the world's largest military structure, according to UNESCO.\n\"The Great Wall you see today was almost entirely built in the 1500s under the Ming dynasty,\" said Kenneth M. Swope, a University of Southern Mississippi historian and author of A Dragon's Head and a Serpent's Tail: Ming China and the First Great East Asian War, 1592-1598.\nThe wall\u2019s length \u2018is 13,000 miles\u2019\nIn citing this figure, Trump can point to an official statistic. In 2012, China's State Administration of Cultural Heritage released a five-year-long study that the wall is 13,170 miles long -- much longer than the previous estimate of 5,500 miles, which was limited to the Ming-era structures.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this number should be taken with a grain of salt, experts said.\nFor starters, this includes all of the wall, not just the Ming-era portions. And just a fraction of these 13,000 miles includes intact walls.\nAnd contrary to the wall in Trump\u2019s proposal, the wall \"is not contiguous,\" Swope said. (This can be seen in the map portion of the graphic above.)\nWaldron calls the Chinese government\u2019s estimate the most generous measurement. \"China is endlessly puffing up the wall for the benefit of tourism,\" he said.\nHe said his fairest estimate would be perhaps 1,700 miles, \"with a solid line\" around Beijing and \"elsewhere a dotted line.\"\nIn the view of the scholars we contacted, the wall also doesn\u2019t serve as a particularly good model for Trump\u2019s point.\nHistorically, trade was generally a far more successful policy than warfare. Indeed, walls didn\u2019t stop the Mongols and the Manchus from crossing the frontier and causing serious trouble, including, ultimately, the fall of the Ming and the establishment of the Manchu, or Qing, dynasty that lasted from 1644 to 1912.\n\"The wall never worked,\" said Michael Szonyi, a professor of Chinese history at Harvard University and author of Practicing Kinship: Lineage and Descent in Late Imperial China.\nWaldron, who added that he is sympathetic to the notion of closing off U.S. borders more completely, nonetheless agreed with Szonyi\u2019s assessment of the Great Wall. The Great Wall \"didn't do what it was supposed to do, it was enormously costly, and there's no question that it caused great suffering among the people who built it,\" he told Mother Jones magazine.\nHe added to PolitiFact, \"I would say Trump is one of a long train of Western and Chinese people who bought into the mythology of the wall.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said that the Great Wall of China was \"built 2,000 years ago\" and \"is 13,000 miles\" long.\nHe has repeated two figures that are widely cited and, superficially at least, seem credible. But when we ran them by several experts in Chinese history, we found that the reality is more nuanced.\nMajor unifications of early portions of the wall did occur about 2,200 years ago. However, the wall was built over the course of many centuries, and the best preserved, most iconic portions of the wall are a lot younger -- roughly 500 years old.\nMeanwhile, a Chinese government survey from 2012 reported a total length of 13,000 miles. However, this figure includes many bits and pieces of wall, some of them quite isolated.\nTrump\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05318"}
