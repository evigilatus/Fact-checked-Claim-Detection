He added this commentary:\n\"Look at this in Wisconsin! A day AFTER the election, Biden receives a dump of 143,379 votes at 3:42AM, when they learned he was losing badly. This is unbelievable!\"\nSigh.\nThis jump is actually very believable \u2014 and was entirely expected.\nAn array of similar claims surfaced in the days after the election, most based on errant assumptions around a chart from FiveThirtyEight.com that showed a sharp uptick in Biden votes in the wee hours of Nov. 4.\u00a0\nA conservative website trumpeted this as \"Voter Fraud in Wisconsin.\" One widely shared Facebook post called it a \"ballot dump,\" while another referred to the votes as being \"found.\" Trump also asserted Nov. 4 that his lead in key states \"started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted.\"\nThose claims led to unanimous debunking from an array of fact-checking organizations, including USA TODAY, PolitiFact, AFP and Reuters.\nBut since Trump has raised the issue yet again, with a slightly different chart, let\u2019s review why this claim is absurd.\nJump caused by pool of Milwaukee absentee ballots\nThat 3:30 a.m. change simply shows the time when the City of Milwaukee reported its absentee ballot results.\nThis wasn\u2019t surprising because:\n\n\nMilwaukee is a longtime Democratic stronghold. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the city of Milwaukee 77%-18%.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe knew well before the election that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to vote absentee. Polling showed 81% of the people planning to vote absentee in Wisconsin supported Biden.\n\n\nWe knew it was going to take a long time to count the absentee ballots, leading them to be reported later.\n\n\nThose absentee votes \u2014 a total of 170,000 in Milwaukee \u2014 were reported together because Milwaukee and 38 other Wisconsin communities used a central count location. Other communities counted absentee ballots at the polling places and reported them earlier along with their in-person vote totals.\nThe ballots took that long to process at central count because Wisconsin law bans clerks from tallying absentee ballots before Election Day. Clerks from both parties have pushed for years for a change in state law, but Republicans who run the Legislature refused to address the matter.\nAs a result, Claire Woodall-Vogg, the executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, said months before the election she didn\u2019t expect to finish that count until the early morning hours of Nov. 4.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what happened.\nFrom 3:26 to 3:44 a.m. in The Associated Press election reporting stream, the vote for Biden jumped by 149,520 (9.2% of Biden's total votes) and Trump's vote jumped by 31,803 votes (2% of his total votes). Milwaukee County accounted for nearly all of that jump.\nThe fact that Trump was \"ahead\" before that batch was reported \u2014\u00a0 as highlighted in Trump\u2019s tweet \u2014\u00a0 is immaterial. At that point all the votes hadn\u2019t been counted yet.\nIt would be like trying to end a football game when your favorite team is ahead after the third quarter.\nSo Trump\u2019s number may be roughly right. But his explanation of what it means is completely wrong.\nOur ruling\nTrump said Nov. 18 that Wisconsin received a \"dump\" of Biden votes, asserting this is \"unbelievable\" and evidence of fraud.\nBut it\u2019s just evidence of someone who doesn\u2019t understand the vote counting process in Wisconsin.\nThat jump in Biden votes is when Milwaukee reported its 170,000 absentee ballots all at once. We knew long before the election this group would be reported late together and would weigh heavily in Biden\u2019s favor.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18552"}
