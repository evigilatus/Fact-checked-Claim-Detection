They also say photo ID is unnecessary, since reports of voter fraud in North Carolina are rare and tend to occur not at polling sites but with mail-in ballots.\nState Rep. Tim Moore, the Republican House speaker, recently defended the idea in an interview with\u00a0Spectrum News. Reporter Loretta Boniti asked Moore whether an ID requirement might suppress votes.\n\"Not at all,\" Moore said in the June 7 interview. \"States that have adopted voter identification laws have seen zero decrease in voter participation. In fact, most have seen an increase in voter participation.\"\nHe went on to say that, \"When it comes to voter participation, it's generally dependent on what kind of cycle it is.\"\nWe decided to look at what has happened in states that did what Republicans would like to do in North Carolina. Was there no decline in voter participation, as Moore said?\nThirty-four states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls. Seven states \u2014 Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin \u2014 have what the\u00a0National Conference of State Legislatures\u00a0refers to as \"strict photo ID\" requirements.\nBy \"strict,\" the NCSL means that voters in those states who don\u2019t present acceptable photo ID must vote on a provisional ballot and then come back with an acceptable ID after Election Day for it to be counted.\nVoting laws in NC\nIn North Carolina, voters don't have to show photo ID when they vote or register to vote.\u00a0The\u00a0proposed ballot question is vague, leaving it up to the legislature to fill in the details on what kinds of IDs would be needed.\nThe North Carolina legislature, which has been controlled by Republicans since 2011, adopted a voter ID law in 2013 that limited voting options and required voters to show photo ID at the polls. Federal appellate judges struck that law down in 2016, saying the restrictions \"target African Americans with almost surgical precision.\"\nIn his interview, Moore didn\u2019t specify what he meant by \"voter ID\" or \"participation.\" Joseph Kyzer, Moore\u2019s communications director, clarified in an email to PolitiFact that Moore was referring to total turnout.\n\"While fluctuations in voter participation between election cycles are common, none of the extensive studies on this issue have demonstrated that voter ID decreased total turnout in the thirty-two states that have some form of voter ID,\" Kyzer said.\nBut total turnout \u2014 the percentage of eligible voters that make it to the polls \u2014 is not the contentious point with voter ID. Turnout is higher in presidential years, an exciting governor\u2019s race increases interest, and other factors drive turnout.\nThe voter ID debate hinges on whether these laws systematically put certain types of voters at a disadvantage compared to others. That was at the heart of the federal appeals court ruling.\nEffects of voter ID\n\"Turnout alone doesn\u2019t tell the whole story,\" said Myrna Perez, deputy director of the Democracy Program of the liberal-leaning\u00a0Brennan Center for Justice\u00a0at NYU School of Law. \"The portion of the population without the ID can be suppressed, and at the same time, people who do have the ID can turn out in larger numbers.\"\nAmong the most cited and respected studies on the impact of voter ID laws was one conducted in 2014 by the\u00a0U.S. Government Accountability Office, an independent, nonpartisan agency that works for Congress. The GAO did its own study while examining 10 others.\nWhen comparing the 2008 and 2012 elections, the GAO analysis found that turnout decreases in Kansas and Tennessee \"were attributable to changes in those two states\u2019 voter ID requirements.\" And of the 10 studies the GAO reviewed, five found that ID requirements had no statistically significant effect on turnout; four found decreases in turnout and one found an increase in turnout.\n\n\"Although not the final word on this question, the GAO study provides credible evidence that strict ID requirements may depress turnout,\" said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin.\n\"It remains clear that the best research on this topic does not support the idea that voter participation increases as a result of a voter ID law, with about half of studies unable to detect a statistically significant effect on turnout and the other half of studies finding a small negative effect on turnout,\" he added.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Adam Berinsky, director of the political experiments research lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said \"the research findings are mixed. So \u2018zero decrease\u2019 may be going too far, but there is no clear evidence of decrease.\"\nAs for Moore\u2019s claim of an increase in participation, \"That seems clearly beyond the scope of findings from credible research,\" Berinsky said.\nVotes blocked\nSeveral experts pointed to a\u00a0paper\u00a0by Benjamin Highton, a professor at UC-Davis, as a good summary of the situation.\nHighton acknowledges a lack of conclusive studies, but notes \"even if we posit that voter identification laws have no influence on turnout because all those without valid identification who would otherwise vote take the necessary steps to obtain proper identification in advance of Election Day, these people do face a higher barrier to voting.\"\nPhoto ID laws are a \"barrier,\" Highton said, and the barrier is \"real, nontrivial, and unequal in impact.\"\nMoore\u2019s office pointed to an\u00a0Atlanta Journal-Constitution article\u00a0showing that turnout rose among black and Hispanic voters from 2006 to 2010 \u2014 despite adoption of a new voter ID law in 2007. But the same article noted that the ID requirements blocked some votes from being counted.\nUnder Georgia\u2019s law, an in-person voter who arrives without a photo ID may cast a provisional ballot. The provisional ballot is counted only if the person returns with proper identification by the Friday following the election.\n\"Records show that since 2008, 2,244 provisional ballots were cast by voters lacking photo ID. Of those, 658 returned with an ID and 1,586 did not \u2014 meaning their votes did not count,\" the AJC reported.\nNorth Carolina\u2019s short-lived voter ID law yielded similar results. In the state\u2019s 2016 presidential primary, 1,276 ballots weren\u2019t counted because the voter didn\u2019t bring ID to the polls, according to Josh Lawson, general counsel for the N.C. Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement.\nOf those who did not bring photo ID with them to the polls, nearly 1,100 who possessed valid IDs failed to return to their county board of elections to show their IDs before results were certified, so their votes did not count.\nAn\u00a0algorithm developed\u00a0by professors at Tufts and Harvard universities recently found that, in Texas, voters who were black and Hispanic were less likely to have IDs than whites. Their research methods are considered among the most precise for tracking voters, as explained by\u00a0Wired Magazine.\nBoth sides point to studies\nMoore\u2019s office pointed to a mixture of academic studies, news articles and opinion columns to support his claim. They look at individual results from specific states, as well as the broad effects of voter ID on turnout.\nIndiana adopted a voter ID law in 2005. The\u00a0Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a liberal Washington think tank that focuses on issues of race, found that black turnout in the 2008 election was at a historic high after rising substantially from 2004. Hans von Spakovsky, a proponent for voter ID and senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank,\u00a0noted the rise in black turnout\u00a0in both Indiana and Georgia in a 2009 column.\nA 2017 study by a trio of professors from UC-San Diego and Bucknell University, \"Voter Identification Laws and the Suppression of Minority Votes,\" found \"a significant drop in minority participation\" in states that implemented strict voter ID laws between 2006 and 2014. But that finding was disputed in\u00a0another study\u00a0by five professors who argued the trio used unreliable data to reach their conclusions. (Moore\u2019s office cited that subsequent study to support his claim that there\u2019s no evidence photo ID laws affect voter turnout.)\nStill, contrary to Moore\u2019s \"zero decrease\" statement, available data suggest that voter ID can decrease voter participation.\nEitan Hersh, who is one of those five professors and also was among the developers of the algorithm used to track Texas voters, said that Moore\u2019s statement is \"misleading\" since some voters struggle to obtain ID.\n\"At the same time, measuring an aggregate effect of ID laws is hard and there hasn\u2019t been decisive evidence about how many people are actually deterred from these laws,\" Hersh said in an email. \"There has also been no good evidence to suggest the laws increase turnout.\"\nJustin Grimmer, another of the five professors, said Moore is exaggerating the research conclusions.\n\"The best I could say is (it\u2019s) lacking a lot of context,\" Grimmer said. \"Acceptable IDs are not held by everyone and disproportionately minorities and low income people don't have IDs. Therefore, if there is a mechanical deterrence effect of ID laws, then it will harm minorities. This was the line of argument used in the Texas ID law case and I find it convincing.\"\nPolitiFact ruling\nMoore said \"states that have adopted voter identification laws have seen zero decrease in voter participation. In fact, most have seen an increase in voter participation.\"\nThere\u2019s a kernel of truth in Moore\u2019s statement, as studies haven't consistently shown a direct relationship between voter ID laws and voter participation. However, a report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found some evidence that participation declines. And experts said studies don't show an increase in participation as a result of voter ID.\nMoore\u2019s claim that there has been \"zero decrease\" in voter participation is a misleading exaggeration. We rate his claim Mostly False.\n'\n Share the Facts 2018-06-20 23:16:56 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  States with voter ID laws have seen \u201czero decrease\u201d in participation. \u201cMost have seen an increase    Tim Moore NC House Speaker https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/triangle-sandhills/news/2018/06/07/tim-moore-interview   North Carolina Thursday, June 7, 2018 2018-06-07    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01945"}
