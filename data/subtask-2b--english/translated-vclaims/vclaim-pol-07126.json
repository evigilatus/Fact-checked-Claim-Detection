Apart from the expected reference to Walker's failure to stimulate the creation of 250,000 jobs as promised, Burke revealed a new talking point. She said, \"It's not working,\" on October 10, 2014. The typical Wisconsin family has actually experienced a decline in their real income of about $3,000 in the last four years. Three thousand dollars!\" Not so fast, the Republican Party responded in Wisconsin, and quickly released a news release with this headline: \"Mary Burke opens her depressing debate with a new lie.\" Let's go to Treat-O-Meter. When support was requested, the Burke campaign mentioned income figures reported by the Wisconsin Council for Children and Families following the release of the 17 September 2014 statements through the United States Census Bureau &apos; s Community Survey. The American Community Survey is the preferred method of tracking year-to-year changes in average household income at the state level. It is based on a random sample of residents from each state. Income figures are adjusted by inflation, allowing comparisons between apples and trailers over time. Burke was called \"real\" income, the technical term for the modified inflation approach. The most recent year of survey reported revenue for 2013. So to track the four-year trend, as did Burke, you have to start with 2009 as a baseline and measure changes over 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Burke's camp did it -- but there's a problem with the method, as we'll see in one moment. This is reported in the survey: Average year household income change in United States dollars in percentage change 2009: change of $54.210 in 2010 US$ 52,317 - US$ 1,893 - 3.5 per cent in 2011 US$ 52,111 - US$ 206 in a tweet that would raise the price of the Taco Bell burrito to US$ 38. By Bill McCarthy: 20 January 2021 - 0.4% 2012 US$ 51 649 - 0.9% US$ 2013 - 467 - 182 - 0.3% US$ 2009 - 13 - 2 743 - 5.1% Source: American Community Survey that the decline of US$ 2,743 was significant enough to be statistically significant, even when looking at the margin of error in the survey, census officials told us. Burke describes it as \"about $3,000\" -- a generic recipe for the target, even though the 257th difference isn't great. But Burke is having problems in this area. It involves Walker and Walker alone in the four-year period you're discussing. That makes sense on the roof; the governor's term is four years, and it ends. But there are no data for 2014 so far, so getting four full years has to go back to the last year (2010) of the democratic predecessor Walker, Jove. Jim Doyle. In other words, your census data cover one year of the Doyle era and three years of Walker time. In fact, most of the income decline mentioned by Burke was in 2010, the last year in Doyle, when the average household income fell by $1,893, or 3.5 per cent. The decline under Walker in his first three years is $850, or 1.6 per cent. The game of blame for economic matters is difficult under the best conditions. The remaining effects of the national recession, the cuts made by Walker on the income available to public sector workers, the tax cuts made by Walker, the pace of job creation below average, the national economy - all of these factors, etc., play into fluctuations in income. But in this case, Burke blames Walker for something that happened to a great extent before his watch, presenting a distorted view of the voters. Our assessment says that his approach did not work, and Burke blamed Walker for the loss of income, saying: \"The typical Wisconsin family has actually experienced a decline in real income of about $3,000 in the past four years. While the average household income in Wisconsin has declined by $2,743 in four years, most of the decline occurred before Walker took office in 2011, and we often appreciate the wrong claim.
