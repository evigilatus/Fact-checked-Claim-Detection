Maybe you heard this: \"If you're going through hell, go on.\" Or maybe \"the price of greatness is responsibility.\" But we didn't know anyone else on Facebook. \"When you're 20 years old, you care what everyone thinks, and when you're 40 years old you stop caring about what everyone thinks, when you're 60 years old, you realize that no one was thinking about you in the first place,\" you read a quote published on March 6th attributed to Churchill.

This quote is not included on the Churchill International quotes page, or in the American BBC group of 50 Churchill quotes \"to live.\" We live with the facts, and having found no evidence that Churchill made this statement, we are evaluating this false article on Facebook.
