The government intelligence agents have concluded that Russia has tried to influence the presidential election in a way that favors Trump over Hillary Clinton. The main reason for this conclusion is that Russian actors have tried to access accounts of both Democrats and Republicans through Internet infiltration, but have published only important information stolen from Democrats on a large scale. At his press conference, the Democrats said Trump could do better to protect themselves, as the Republicans did. Trump said that the Russians \"tryed to break through the Republican National Committee, and they couldn't break through.\" Over the past few weeks, there has been some confusion as to whether the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) has been infiltrated in a manner similar to the National Congress Party (CNP). So we decided to put Trump's claim on Treat-O-Meter. In a Kremlin-driven campaign, fraudulent artists stole online, and then leaked e-mails from Clinton's campaign leader John Bodista and the National Democratic Commission. It ended with the posting of e-mails on WikiLeaks and other sources on the Internet. The leaks caused many headaches of the Clinton campaign and led to the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz from the presidency of the National Congress Party. It is clear that Russian hackers have infiltrated some Republicans and affiliated groups. The DC website published approximately 200 e-mails related to the work of the Republican Party, as well as e-mails from former Foreign Minister Colin Powell. Mr. Lindsay Graham, GSS, said on CNN that Russian actors had compromised his e-mail campaign. However, the allegation that the Republican National Council did not specifically break through is an important one because the organization is at the core of the structure of the National Republican Party. On December 9, the New York Times reported that the Russians had hacked computer systems into the RNC. But the Wall Street Journal reported on December 16 that the attempt to infiltrate the Republican National Army did not succeed. The reports were based on unknown sources. Two government reports on interference with the Russian elections - published on 29 December and 6 January - provide no explanation. The most extensive report in January 6 says only: \"Russians have collected some public-related targets but have not conducted a similar screening campaign.\" On January 17, 2021, President Donald Trump, in an interview with Fox News, \"cannot say anything (about the riots in the American Capitol Building) because the platforms have removed it.\" By Bill McCarthy, on January 18, 2021, FBI Director James Comay recently presented the most critical data, at the January 10th hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. He explained that Russian pirates had entered State-level organizations and Republican candidates, as well as the old e-mail areas associated with the National Broadcasting Authority, but not the active national radio network or the Trump campaign. \"There was evidence that there was a breach directed at state-level organizations, State-level campaigns, and RNC, but old areas of RNC,\" said Komi. \"This is, the e-mail fields they no longer use, and the information was collected from there, but they were old things. None of this was released. We have not developed any evidence that the current Trump or RNC campaign has been successfully hacked.\" The methods used to attack the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) and the Parti pour la d\u00e9fense national (PND) systems were similar. Russian actors used a technique called hunting, meaning that electronic intruders sent e-mails designed to trick the recipient into clicking on a link. But Komi said that the Russian attackers \"become deeper and more extensive\" in the National Democratic Party, even though he couldn't say why they didn't enter the current system of the Republican National Party. According to Trump and other Republican leaders, pirates were unable to enter the Republic because of the organization's super-defenses on the Internet. While this is a reasonable allegation, we are unable to assert it independently. The Republican National Council referred to the Wall Street Journal article mentioned earlier, which stated that \"intruders have failed to bypass security defenses on the Republican National Council's computer networks.\" In addition, electronic intruders were much less aggressive in their attempts to infiltrate the Rwandese Patriotic Republic than in their attacks against the national Republic. This article is based on unnamed sources that are said to be close to the Rwandan National Police and the intelligence investigation. In contrast, the National Drug Control Directorate did not have the most advanced software to detect suspicious e-mail traffic, and the organization was slow to respond to the FBI warning that it had been hacked, and the New York Times reported an article based on interviews with several registered sources. Our verdict, Trump, said that the Russians \"tryed to hack into the Republican National Committee, and they couldn't hack it.\" While the Russians were able to access the e-mail accounts of some Republicans and Republican organizations at the State level, they did not break into the current system of the Republican National Commission, according to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Russians have been able to access e-mail areas associated with the National Broadcasting Authority that are no longer in use, but the information is outdated and has not been published. In addition, it is not quite clear why pirates have not been able to enter the current regional national centre. The essence of Trump's claim is true, but it is important to bear in mind that Russian pirates have been able to access some republican data, including the old NC account. So we evaluate his claim mostly true. :: Political fact-sharing: 6 policy assessments: the Russians \"tryed to break through the Republican National Committee, and were unable to penetrate.\" President-elect Donald Trump at a press conference at the Trump Tower Wednesday 11 January 2017 - 01/11/2017 Read more information", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03801"}
