Senator from Georgia This time, it's a radio announcement that simulates a man on the street meeting with a potential voter. In the announcement, the announcer says: \"According to news reports, she admitted that she allowed a well-known criminal convicted of extremist anti-United States statements to hold a fundraiser.\" Then the unidentified woman asked: \"Is there any wisdom in this thinking?\" \"I'm gonna say \"no one\" answers a woman. It is part of a new campaign to end spending that speaks for Nan's well-known name. Her father, Sam Nan, was a moderate and respected Democrat in the United States Senate for 24 years, from 1972 to 1997, some of whom considered the White House or Vice President's material. The Declaration follows the new website of the Standing Committee, www.Absolutly Nunn.com, which answers the question. Is there any reason for Georgians to vote in favour of it? But, Polly Fuckett Georgia wondered, did Nan work with criminals to win the job? First, let's look at the business fund to end spending, which was formed by the founder of TD Americrade Joe Rickets. As of September 11, the group spent approximately $2.8 million - more than any other external group - on the Senate race in Georgia, according to OpenSecrets.org. The Baku Party prefers Nan's competitor, businessman David Birdo. Some of its funds were paid for in the controversial presidential elections earlier this year. The race is closely monitored and heavily funded at the national level because of the narrow battle to control the United States Senate. It is also a priority for State democracies eager to restore a key position across the state. The Battle of Nan-Berdo attracted the fifth largest money from outside groups in the Congressional races across the country this year, $12.4 million on advertising from both sides. This brings us back to the announcement, which is a reference to July 8, Washington, D.C., of the fund-raising that Sam Nan offered as a special guest. The default Murl was listed as a co-host of the event, giving $2,600 to Nan's campaign for honour. Guests paid at least $250 for the campaign, according to the invitation. Two days after the fund-raising ceremony, the conservative National Journal published the story that Muriel, now a political adviser, pleaded guilty in 1995 to accepting a bribe while serving as an assistant to the city council (Califf). He was sentenced to one year &apos; s imprisonment. Nan expressed surprise at the news of Muriel &apos; s history, which also included a long period in the 1960s as leader of the Black Tiger Movement. Her campaign was rejected this week to make it available to discuss fund-raising and its implications. We referred his spokesman, Nathan Klick, to a statement issued in July in which he said that Nun was not aware of Muriel's record and promised to return his associated donations. In any case, he refused to click to confirm the exact amount of money that the campaign said was returned or to reveal the amount of money that had been tied to Morel. Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. By Tom Kircher \u2022 29 January 2021 \"We didn't say goodbye to any contributions from him or anything that raised him for the event,\" he said click in a statement. We've reached Muriel via e-mail to confirm that Nan's donated back and the other one. He didn't reply. We also contacted Brian Baker, head of the outlet company, who said that Nan confessed to Muriel, a convicted criminal, who co-hosted a fundraiser. That's exactly what we say in the ad, Baker said. \"The Declaration is 100% realistic\" The event was not the moment of the only embarrassing campaign. In late August, a series of secret notes revealed Nan &apos; s campaign strategy and weaknesses. Paradoxically, these documents may support the campaign's claim that Nan did not know Muriel's background. On page 57 of the 144-page document - after listing weaknesses such as the engagement of President Obama and several pages before presenting campaign issues - a category called \"transit.\" It takes less than a quarter of the page, in particular this one-size-fits-all paragraph: \"For the time being, there are no plans to examine donors for the campaign,\" as mentioned in the note. Baker said knowing Morrell's background \"Doesn't require a complicated examination\" was accessed with Google's basic research. The Panel &apos; s earlier publicity claims were reviewed by Politi Fakt Georgia, with mixed results. In August, the alleged termination of spending on the announcement that \"the founder of Michel Nun\" was awarded to an Islamic group associated with extremist terrorists often made a mistake. In July, we estimated that it was often a real claim to end spending that Nan earned up to $300,000 of light points at about a time when 90 workers were dismissed because of her merger with the non-profit network Hands. Information available on the latest claim indicates that the termination of the new spending announcement uses guilt by association in an attempt to propose Nan who knowingly wished a former convict to raise money for their bid in the Senate. Nan repeatedly said she didn't know Muriel's history when she attended the fundraiser. She pledged to return the money he had raised, although the election campaign and Muriel did not confirm the determination to associate with Muriel. Most of the end-of-expenditure declarations are valid. A convicted criminal hosted a fundraiser for Michelle Nan. Nan said she didn't know anything about the criminal guy's background. There is evidence from a leaked note that her campaign was not a donor check. The claim is accurate. However, it leaves some relevant details. We're mostly assessing it right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07318"}
