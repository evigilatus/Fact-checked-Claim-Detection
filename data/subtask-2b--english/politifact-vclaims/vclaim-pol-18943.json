Kamala Harris call young Americans stupid, as a post on social media claims?\nIn an image posted by a Facebook page called \"Students for Trump,\" we see a photo of Harris next to a quote that reads, \"What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? They are stupid!\"\nThe post\u2019s caption says: \"This is what Kamala thinks about young Americans?!\"\nThe quote is part of something Harris said six years ago, but rather than insulting young voters, Harris\u00a0 made the comment during a speech about the need to forgive mistakes made by young, low-level criminal offenders.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nHarris made the remark during an address on criminal justice policy at a symposium hosted by the Ford Foundation in May 2014, when she was California\u2019s attorney general.\nThe quote on its own is missing the context of the larger point that Harris was trying to make, which was how the criminal justice system shouldn\u2019t penalize young adults for making certain mistakes.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full video of her remarks (her comment comes around the 16:45-mark) shows that Harris is talking about forgiving young people\u2019s low-level crimes, and how the system treats offenders in the age group during what she referred to as their most developmental stage in life.\n\n\u00a0\nHere is her comment, with more context:\n\n\"When I was at Howard University and we were in college, we were 18 through 24, and you know what we were called? College kids. But when you turn 18 and you\u2019re in the system, you are considered an adult, period. Without any regard to the fact that, that is the very phase of life in which we have invested billions of dollars in colleges and universities knowing that is the prime phase of life during which we mold and shape and direct someone to become a productive adult.\u00a0\n\"What\u2019s the other thing we know about this population? And it\u2019s a specific phase of life, remember, age is more than a chronological fact. What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? They are stupid (audience laughs). That is why we put them in dormitories, and they have a resident assistant. They make really bad decisions. So we focused on that age population.\"\nHarris was describing a recidivism reduction program for first-time, low-level offenders in Los Angeles. The initiative, modeled after the \"Back on Track\" program that Harris launched in 2005 in San Francisco, would provide services to young Americans who were convicted of nonviolent felonies. If they met certain education and career goals, they would have their cases dismissed.\nOur ruling\nA post on Facebook says Harris called young Americans \"stupid.\"\nIt\u2019s a partial quote of something Harris said. Harris was speaking about initiatives to reduce recidivism rates for young, low-level offenders and wryly made a comment about how young adults often make bad decisions in order to illustrate the broader point that more empathy is needed for them within the criminal justice system.\nHarris made the comment, but the post leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18943"}
