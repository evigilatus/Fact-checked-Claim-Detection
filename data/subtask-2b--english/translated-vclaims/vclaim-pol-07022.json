Robert Healy of the Conservative Party says he spent only about $36 on his ruling campaign.", "text": "This is the kind of campaign that Robert J. Healy Jr. likes to pay for. While other candidates had been campaigning for months and spending millions in the most expensive Governor's race in the history of Rhode Island, Haley had only entered the competition shortly after the primary stage in September, when he had replaced the original candidate of the Conservative Party, who had been unable to run because of illness. Haley, who has repeatedly nominated for the post of Deputy Governor with the intention of abolishing the post, and who spent the 2002 election season distributing condoms under the slogan \"Never felt so good,\" obtained 21.4 per cent of the votes after counting the ballot by post in the 2014 state elections. While the main party candidates, the Democratic Gina Raimundo and the Republican Alan Fong, saturated the transmission waves with commercials, Haley presented some manifestations of the election campaign and some markings. But his performance in the TV discussions in October got his support from a lot of people who liked his unconventional style -- or they didn't much like Fong or Raimundo, who won the race. On the day after the election, Hayley told the columnist of the newspaper Providence (Eduard Fitzpatrick) that he had spent only $36.29 on his campaign. A similar claim was made on WPRO, where the host morning Jane Valesenti congratulated him on his strong offer. \"Thank you. For 35, for $38, it's not bad. Hayley said... \"Maybe I should have spent twice what I spent.\" I was gonna double my numbers and maybe be the governor.\" Felicity mocked him that he wasn't gas money anymore. \"I know,\" Hayley answered. But I had to go there anyway. The candidate of the Conservative Party - who also founded the Kol Moss Party - has cited similar figures elsewhere. This led the reader to question the accuracy of Haley's statements. \"Someone had to spend money on those badges on I-195. The reader said that those signals were not cheap. In fact, there were more than a few Haley signals across the state. We decided to check. The last Haley files on the Rhode Island election board for the period ending 27 October 2014 showed that he hadn't collected any money and hadn't spent anything in the last 20 days. His previous report showed that he had given himself $35.31 and spent all of it on cellular phone expenses. We told Hayley that it's up to $36.29 when he's added the price of the only purchases he's made since his last financial report, a couple of postage stamps. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook that says that Nancy Belusi sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"requiring him to stick to a proven democratic playbook.\" By Sira O'Rourke on January 11, 2021, the conservative party's own files show that she didn't spend any money on the Healy race either, at least until October 27. So where did the money come from for the signs? Haley said that a lot of supporters downloaded public images of him and his artwork from his website so that anyone could produce anything. They printed their own books. In addition, a local signmaker printed his own sign and sold it at cost. The candidate also recycled the signals from his previous campaigns for the post of Deputy Governor. \"We just crossed the word \"Litant\" and gave us this,\" said Haley. He also drew a campaign message on the wall of a building using the old black paint. At first he had trouble opening the paint cans of the Rust-Olum because the covers had been rusted. \"I found this somewhat ridiculous. \"They must make unrustless cans,\" he said. In the end, \"I didn't spend any money on the signs. Not at all, \"Haley confirmed. In addition, \"people print a lot of shirts. I don't know what people did to them. But we're setting up small businesses in Rhode Island. We give people jobs.\" \"We've recycled everything -- anything I can get past the word \"helper.\" We've recycled the buttons. We had some old shock posters from when I ran for governor in '98. In the attic, I found a case of cold banana combs, which I had in '86. He said, \"A yardstick.\" Did he have any remains of condoms? \"We did, but they all expired in 2003. We didn't want to give expired condoms.\" So when Robert Healy said he spent only $36 on his campaign, all the evidence points to a real decorative process. We're assessing his claim as correct.
