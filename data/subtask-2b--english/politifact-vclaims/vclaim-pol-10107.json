And what we\u2019ve said is let\u2019s change those certifications. The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work. And as a consequence, veterans\u2019 unemployment is actually now lower than general population. It was higher when I came into office.\"\n\nWe wondered if Obama had his statistics correct.\n\nWe looked at data on veterans\u2019 employment compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We focused on two categories of veterans -- all veterans, as well as those who have specifically served in the post-Sept. 11, 2011, armed forces. While Obama didn\u2019t specify what type of veterans he was referring to, the context suggests he was referring to post-9/11 veterans.\n\nThe statistics for all veterans\n\nUnemployment rate for all veterans, January 2009: 7.4 percent\nUnemployment rate for the general population, January 2009: 7.8 percent\n\nObama had said veteran unemployment was higher than the general population when he came into office, so by this measurement, he\u2019s wrong.\n\nUnemployment rate for all veterans, September 2012: 6.7 percent\nUnemployment rate for the general population, September 2012: 7.8 percent\n\nObama had said veteran unemployment is now lower than the general population, so on this measurement, he\u2019s right.\n\nThe statistics for post-9/11 veterans only\n\nUnemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans, January 2009: 8.9 percent\nUnemployment rate for the general population, January 2009: 7.8 percent\n\nObama had said veteran unemployment was higher than the general population when he came into office, so by this measurement, he\u2019s right.\n\nUnemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans, September 2012: 9.7 percent\nUnemployment rate for the general population, September 2012: 7.8 percent\n\nObama had said veterans unemployment is now lower than the general population, so on this measurement, he\u2019s wrong.\n\nTallying the results\n\nSo, whichever measure you use, Obama\u2019s formulation was half-right.\n\nWe should also note, as we have in the past, that presidents do not necessarily have a large impact on either rising or falling unemployment, since the nation\u2019s labor market is sufficiently big and dynamic to be shaped by multiple factors beyond just presidential policies. However, presidential policies may have a bigger impact on employment among veterans than on other types of workers, since the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies have specific policies aimed at boosting veterans\u2019 employment.\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama said, \"Veterans\u2019 unemployment is actually now lower than (the) general population. It was higher when I came into office.\" Whether you\u2019re talking about all veterans or just those who served after 9/11, Obama gets one number right but one number wrong. So we rate his claim Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
