Unfortunately, this is the case with the massive fire that almost destroyed the historic Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on 15 April. The French authorities said that they had found no evidence of arson and terrorism and treated the fire as an accident that might be linked to a continuous renovation project in the church worth 6 million euros. This did not prevent some Internet users from suggesting that it was a terrorist act - as did a low-quality video published on the Facebook page Equinox News. A 18-second section shows a man walking in a cathedral tower shortly after the fire. The video address says, \"There are no workers at the time of the Notre Dame Cathedral fire...

The person in the photo is not wearing a Muslim dress - he is a firefighter. The clip was removed from the three-hour live fire stream that can be seen at the 42-minute mark. Because the video used in Facebook post is foggy, broken, and crop, it's hard to make a fire uniform or see the wider angle of the water hoses used on the right of the tower. When watching the official video, full length, the yellow man's jacket and helmet are clear, a few moments later many firefighters appeared in the same area. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021, a Twitter clip was also shared, and the European Factcheck EU and the Ceck News uniform both called the false claim that the only man had access to something evil in the tower. \"No, there was no \"one man in a yellow jacket\" in one of the Notre Dame towers,\" Fatcheck EU.

Hitz also said that the Paris police had already mobilized nearly 50 investigators to look into the fire, and that investigators had begun to interview some 15 workers who were working in the cathedral as part of the renovation of Euro6 million ($6.8 million). The fire brigade in Paris was quoted as saying that the fire could be \"related\" to the project. A video released on social media showed a man walking alone in a Notre Dame tower \"in Islamic clothing.\" The video is from a real direct channel of Notre Dame fire, but it shows a less quality version and a crop that does not allow viewers to see clearly that it was a firefighter. The video is not long enough for other firemen to show up in the same area after moments, and grow to remove the water hoses used to fight the fire. The French authorities are conducting an investigation into the fire, but initial reports have so far been considered to be an incidental cause, indicating that there may be a connection to the Cathedral Renewal Project.
