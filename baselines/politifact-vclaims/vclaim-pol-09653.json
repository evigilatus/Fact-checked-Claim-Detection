Democrats would prefer to reduce the deficit partly by raising taxes.\n\nBut the California Republican argued on Fox News that any solution should cut spending only \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of revenue, he said.\n\n\"There's more money going in than any other time,\" he told host Greta Van Susteren on Feb. 25, 2013. \"In the last four decades, on average, we brought in 17.9 percent of GDP. Now we're going to bring in 19.1.\"\n\nIs the federal government collecting more than it ever has \u2014 more than it has on average the last 40 years?\n\nHere\u2019s what we found.\n\n \u2018The last four decades\u2019\n\nMcCarthy talked about \"percent of GDP,\" a common tool of economists evaluating the impact of tax policies over time. They prefer to compare tax revenues as a percentage of the overall U.S. economy, the gross domestic product.\n\nIt\u2019s fairly easy to see why \u2014 using raw numbers wouldn\u2019t account for inflation or changes in population, for example.\n\nWas McCarthy correct that the federal government used to collect, on average, 17.9 percent of the gross domestic product, and that the number will rise to 19.1 percent?\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s office pointed us to reports from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nA recent CBO analysis says that, indeed, federal revenue is projected to rise with changes in the law, such as the recent end to Bush tax cuts on households making more than $450,000 a year.\n\n\"Revenues are projected to grow from 15.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 19.1 percent of GDP in 2015 \u2014 compared with an average of 17.9 percent of GDP over the past 40 years,\" CBO\u2019s analysts conclude.\n\nSo McCarthy accurately cites a reputable source when he says the federal government has collected an average of 17.9 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product over four decades, and now is \"going to bring in 19.1.\"\n\n(We should mention that even with higher revenue, CBO projects that deficits will increase \"because of the pressures of an aging population, rising health care costs, an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance, and growing interest payments on federal debt.\")\n\nBut what about McCarthy\u2019s claim that \"there's more money going in than any other time\"? That\u2019s messier.\n\n \u2018More money\u2019\n\nSo, remember how percentage of GDP is a useful tool for comparing revenue over time?\n\nThe government will pull in 16.9 percent in 2013, lower than the average over the last 40 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That\u2019s not more money than at \"any other time,\" as McCarthy said.\n\nWhat about in 2015, when the government is projected to bring in 19.1 percent?\n\nThat\u2019s still lower than revenue as a percentage of GDP in seven years of the last 40\u00a0\u2014 also not more money than at \"any other time.\"\n\n Federal revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product\n\n1981: 19.6 percent\n1982: 19.2 percent\n\n1997: 19.2 percent\n1998: 19.9 percent\n1999: 19.8 percent\n2000: 20.6 percent\n2001: 19.5 percent\n\n Source: Congressional Budget Office\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s office told PolitiFact that CBO projects revenue in 2013 will be the highest ever in raw numbers, at $2.708 trillion, up from $2.568 trillion in 2007.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the measure a listener would have assumed from McCarthy\u2019s comments, which focused on revenue as a percentage of GDP \u2014 not raw numbers.\n\nNor are raw numbers a useful way to compare amounts of money over time.\n\nThe value of the dollar changes. Population changes. That means revenue in raw terms mostly climbs by default.\n\nTax policy experts we spoke with called comparisons based on raw numbers \"lousy,\" \"never valid\" and \"silly.\"\n\n\"Ignoring the increased value of the dollar and population growth both distort comparisons and make them meaningless,\" said Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.\n\n Our ruling\n\nMcCarthy told Fox News, \"There's more money going in than any other time. In the last four decades, on average, we brought in 17.9 percent of GDP. Now we're going to bring in 19.1.\"\n\nStarting in 2015, reputable projections show revenue rising to 19.1 percent of GDP, up from an average of 17.9 over the last four decades. But McCarthy\u2019s wrong to say that there\u2019s more money coming in than at any other time.\n\nIn fact, the nation collected more than 19.1 percent of GDP in seven years of the last 40. To say that the nation will collect the most revenue in raw dollars in 2013, according to tax experts, is meaningless.\n\nWe rate McCarthy\u2019s statement Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
