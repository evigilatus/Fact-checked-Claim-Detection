Ted Cruz that Trump was in favor of the United States helping Libyans oust dictator Muammar Gaddafi.\n\"He said I was in favor in Libya,\" Trump said, sounding perplexed. \"I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gaddafi would be in charge right now.\"\nOh, Trump discussed it.\nAnd thanks to BuzzFeed, we have the video. (All the hat tips to Andrew Kaczynski.)\nIt comes from 2011, on Trump\u2019s video blog.\n\"I can\u2019t believe what our country is doing,\" Trump said, according to a BuzzFeed transcript. \"Gaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we\u2019re sitting around we have soldiers all have the Middle East, and we\u2019re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that\u2019s what it is: It\u2019s a carnage.\"\nTrump continued.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You talk about things that have happened in history; this could be one of the worst,\" Trump said. \"Now we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives. This is absolutely nuts. We don\u2019t want to get involved and you\u2019re gonna end up with something like you\u2019ve never seen before.\"\nAnd then ...\n\"But we have go in to save these lives; these people are being slaughtered like animals,\" Trump said. \"It\u2019s horrible what\u2019s going on; it has to be stopped. We should do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives.\"\nThe U.S. military, working with NATO, spent about $2 billion and several months backing the Libyan uprising against Gaddafi, who had held power for decades. The uprising -- part of the Arab Spring -- toppled Gaddafi in August 2011, and rebel forces killed him the following October. \u00a0\nOur ruling\nTrump tried to claim during the Houston debate that he never discussed supporting U.S. intervention in Libya.\nThat\u2019s patently inaccurate, as Trump\u2019s own words show.
