But still, we were intrigued. Does North Carolina really have the world\u2019s largest military installations?\nWe\u2019ll narrow this claim down to just the largest U.S. bases in the world. It\u2019s impossible to accurately verify how large various Chinese, Indian, Russian and North Korean bases (the only countries with militaries comparable in size to the U.S.) might be.\nDifferent metrics\nWhat does it mean to be the largest military base?\nBiggest land area? Most air space? Most active-duty military members? Largest population in total? The most buildings and square footage? The most expensive facilities? Those are all good indicators, although we\u2019ll give the most weight to a base\u2019s geographic size and, especially, its military population.\nFor data on physical size and cost, we relied on a 2009 report the Department of Defense compiled on its sprawling infrastructure.\nThe U.S. has the world\u2019s largest military footprint, with hundreds of bases spanning the globe from Asia to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and South America.\nSo where does North Carolina stack up?\nTwo North Carolina bases are among the largest in their respective branches in terms of military population, as well as facility value \u2013 the Army\u2019s Fort Bragg and the Marine Corps\u2019 Camp Lejeune. However both of them are dwarfed, in area, by other bases out West.\nStill, we\u2019re more concerned with military strength than with area, so that\u2019s pretty convincing.\nBut are North Carolina\u2019s the absolute largest, or just among the biggest?\nArmy\nFort Bragg in Fayetteville is home to the 82nd Airborne and a host of other units ranging from intelligence to artillery. People there are fond of saying it has more generals than anywhere but the Pentagon, but that\u2019s a fact check for another day. We just want to know how big it is.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt about 153,000 acres, it trails Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Benning in Georgia. And all of them are puny compared to the 900,000-acre Fort Wainwright in Alaska.\nBut Bragg\u2019s population is the largest of any base in any branch of the military \u2013 not just the Army. Back in 2010, PolitiFact looked into a claim by Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who said Hood was the biggest. He got a Half True because some days Bragg had more people, and other days Hood did.\nBut as the war on terror has gone on, special forces are more in vogue, and Fort Bragg is where many of those units are based. As of 2015 it was substantially larger than Fort Hood.\nBragg had 53,660 soldiers last year, according to the Fayetteville Observer, while Hood had 40,820 according to the Killeen Daily Herald.\nIt\u2019s also possible that some soldiers at Bragg might not be included in official counts, since even their units\u2019 names are sometimes kept secret. Bragg is home to the Joint Special Operations Command, in which Navy SEALs, Army Delta Force and other secretive groups often team up with CIA operatives for sensitive missions. A small airfield in nearby Johnston County was likely once a major piece of the CIA\u2019s \"extraordinary rendition\" program.\nBragg\u2019s entire population of soldiers and civilians is about 140,000 people. If it were a city, it would be one of the largest in North Carolina.\nSo North Carolina has America\u2019s largest single military installation. But the roll call statement said it has the world\u2019s largest installations, plural. So let\u2019s keep looking.\nMarines\nNorth Carolina\u2019s second-biggest base is the Marine Corps\u2019 Camp Lejeune. Is it also the country\u2019s second-biggest?\nNo. In fact, it\u2019s not even the biggest Marine Corps base. The largest, in terms of area and population, are both in California. Twentynine Palms has a relatively small population but covers 650,000 acres, and Camp Pendleton has more Marines than Lejeune \u2013 although that hasn\u2019t always been the case.\nLejeune had more Marines in 2008, with about 48,000 compared to 42,000 at Pendleton. But by 2013, according to Marine Corps reports, Pendleton has risen to 46,000, compared to 41,000 at Lejeune.\nAnd what about the other branches of the military?\nNorth Carolina has no significant Navy presence, let alone anything that could compete with the 44,000 sailors at Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia.\nThe Air Force and Coast Guard have some medium-sized bases in North Carolina, but Air Force bases in Nevada and Florida are significantly larger, and the Coast Guard only says its Elizabeth City base is is \"one of the busiest\" and even then, just in terms of air operations.\nOur ruling\nThe N.C. GOP introduced itself at the Republican National Convention as hailing from the state with \"the largest military installations in the world.\"\nNorth Carolina does have Fort Bragg, which has more active-duty troops than any base in the Army \u2013 or any other branch of the military, for that matter. Camp Lejeune is also large, although it\u2019s not the biggest Marine Corps base anymore. In terms of physical size, none of the state\u2019s bases are even close to the biggest. And its Air Force and Navy bases don\u2019t stack up in any category of largeness.\nA little bit of bluster is to be expected during roll call statements, which are often filled with local pride. But North Carolina\u2019s, while exaggerated, has definite merit \u2013 due in large part to Fort Bragg. We rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04644"}
