According to the rumour, which was widely disseminated on social media platforms, companies such as In-Nout, Taco Bell and Olive Garden supported the President in the 2020 presidential election. Photos include 12 such companies. \"Not a lot of fast food eaters, but just in case I get a lust, that's the motive for definitely healthy food!\" One Instagram address reads. This article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the news broadcast. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, Instagram's parent company.) The Washington Post wrote about these rumors about the August 9 fast foods after a college student tweeted the list. Some 250,000 rewrites have been collected, partly assisted by a quote from Chrissy Tegen, a model and a television character. \"So if you see me start getting skinny and weeping don't ask me why,\" says the original tweet. The contributions do not show Trump's support in responding to his original tweet, the original poster, whose real name is Zorel Sanders, is linked to five pages of the Internet as evidence. None of them support their claim that 12 restaurants directly support Trump in 2020. There are two links from the Centre for Responsive Policy, a non-profit group that tracks political donations. The first shows that Czech Phil-A employees, owners or family members donated $36,530 to candidates during the 2016 elections, with the bulk of the money transferred to the Republicans. However, from the last election cycle, this money went to all national politicians (not only Trump) and, as stated in a memorandum on the website, none of this money was donated by the same company. The second link shows the largest contributors to the food and drink industry for candidates in the period 2019-2020. McDonalds leads the list with $238,220, most of which went to the Republicans. Waffle House Inc. also provided the top 10 with $68,950 per return to Republicans and other conservatives. McDonalds did not respond to our request for comment. However, a closer look at the company &apos; s political contributions shows that there is no evidence that it directly supports Trump in 2020. Relevant: Does part of every purchase of Bang Energy Drinks go to Tramp's re-election effort? :: Not exactly the Centre for Responsive Policy has no data indicating that individuals and PACs associated with the company have so far donated to Trump this election cycle. The figures from the 2016 elections show that Hillary Clinton was a candidate with one of the largest contributions. What the data on the 2020 contributions show is that McDonald has contributed $98,500 to federal candidates so far, with the lion's share reaching the Republicans. None of them have so far gone to Trump, according to the data of the Centre. We considered the political contributions from the other 10 companies, and their associated PACs, listed in Instagram post. We found that only one of them, Taco Bell, supported Trump in 2016. Only the PAC company affiliated to Vital Medicines, which owns the Bang Energy Drink, contributed money to Tramp's re-election in 2020, as we noted in an examination of earlier facts. Finally, Trump is not the first recipient of funds from the food and drink industry to date. Mr. Kamala Harris, Dr. Califf. The news stories refer to political tendencies and the other three links listed by the original tweet as evidence of his claim are three news stories. They speak of the political orientation of the owners and operators of fast food restaurants, but do not prove that 12 companies supported Trump in 2020. The first link is an article from a website called The Scrap. He claims to reveal political tendencies behind many popular restaurant chains. Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. By Tom Kircher: 29 January 2021 Chick Fell-A, Pizza Hot, Waffle House, KFC, McDonald's, Wendy, I Hope, Governor, according to the site. The article refers, as evidence, to news reports of political contributions made by each company in the past, most of which went to Republican candidates. But these stories do not mention the company's direct contribution to Trump. Even the story of the 2016 Eater cited by the Chet newspaper says: \"The RCACs, at least those listed on the Eat List, do not donate to Clinton or Trump. Instead, PACs tend to work for the best interests of the company as a whole, \"read the story, which analysed political contributions from PACs with Wendy's support, Chick Phil-a, Wem! Trademarks (which own Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hot), among other things. :: Jim Fortier, left, and Mark Tomajian, while joining some 20 members of gay rights groups and other protestors outside Decatur, Ga., Chick-Phil-a on Friday, 3 August 2012. The second news link shared by tweeting comes from food and wine. In 2016, I reported that Taco P.C. had sabotaged her grant to the Trump campaign. As evidence of this, the article cited statements from the Centre for Responsive Policy. They show that Taco PAC gave $5,000 to the Trump campaign during the 2016 election cycle. To date, the General People &apos; s Congress Party has not contributed any funds to federal candidates at this session. The last news the tweet called comes from a salon. Five radically conservative \"fast food companies,\" including Chick Fell-A, Carl Jr. and Wavel House, were reported. This article refers to other information accounts and interviews with the company's founders and executives that illustrate their views. For example, Salon wrote about how the President of Chickville A. Dan Kathy spoke in support of \"the traditional family\" and works by \"the principles of the Bible,\" which echo conservative values. However, none of the above stories proves that the companies concerned directly support the Trump 2020 campaign. The restaurants reject the political support of Politi Fuckett reached out to each of the companies listed in the original tweet, saving Bang, from which we have already verified the facts. We have often been misappreciated for the fact that the energy drinks company gives part of every sale of the energy drinks to the Trump campaign. However, verification of the facts indicated that the Bang leaders were frank in supporting Trump and Bang Mother had made a donation to a major company in favour of Trump this year. Of the 11 companies we contacted, six responded. Here's what they told us: Chick-Vil-a: \"Chicken-Vil-a does not make political contributions. We don't contribute to the Political Action Commission.\" \"We're about pancakes, not politics. Hope as a brand does not participate in providing financial support to either side of the corridor.\" In N-O-O-O-O: In N-O-O-Out Berger, we are always proud to provide the finest and finest food to all our customers, regardless of the political party. The Olive Garden: \"We don't know where this information came from, but it's not true. Our company doesn't donate to presidential candidates.\" Pizza Hot: \"Pizza Hot doesn't make donations to presidential political campaigns, and we don't support any political parties or candidates. There is no relationship or control over the donations made by our concessionaires, who are independent entrepreneurs, and like all Americans, are free to donate or support those who wish to do so.\" Taco Bell: \"Tako Bell Corp. makes no contributions to presidential political campaigns and has no relationship or control over the donations made by the concessionaires. Our privileges are independent businessmen, and, like all Americans, free to donate to those who want or support them.\" While it is true that most of the companies named at Instagram have contributed funds to policy appraisal committees in the past, including those that often support Republicans, we have found no evidence that they all donated or directly supported candidates in 2020. Only the parent company of Bang has so far contributed to the Trump aid campaign. The ruling Instagram newspaper claimed that 12 food companies supported the Trump re-election campaign in 2020. The campaign &apos; s contribution data show that while many of its employees and branches are providing money to Republican candidates, none of the companies mentioned have contributed directly to Tramp &apos; s re-election efforts. One company is associated with the Unionist Party, which was given to the President in 2016, and one is associated with the Unionist Party, which was given to Trump during this election cycle. News stories speak of the views of political companies and their past contributions, but do not prove their support for Trump. Six companies refused to make direct political contributions and/or support candidates for the presidency. The job is not accurate. We assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00232"}
