The photo in the tweet and linked story, however, is from November, involves Israeli strikes, and doesn\u2019t show U.S. planes on fire.\nIslamic Republic News Agency, which calls itself the official news agency of Iran, on Jan. 7 tweeted the image and text that said: \"US planes in fire after #Iran's missile attack: Source http://bit.ly/39P6gnq #IranvsUSA #Solemani #IranAttacks #AinAssad.\"\nThe photo in the tweet also appeared in the linked news story. But the photo actually shows the impact of a Nov. 15, 2019, Israeli missile strike in the Gaza Strip. BBC in November used that photo in a news story and credited it to the AFP.\nGetty Images\u2019 caption for the photo in part says: \"A ball of fire is seen following an Israel airstrike in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip early on November 15, 2019.\" Getty credits the image to Abed Rahim Khatib/AFP.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Twitter users replied to the news agency\u2019s tweet, questioning why it was recycling the old image and noting that it was from November. Other Twitter users more broadly claimed that \"Iran\u2019s online operatives\" were re-using old pictures.\nThis is not the only case of old images being repurposed and falsely labeled as showing the most recent air strikes against U.S. military. Our reporting found that additional images and videos of older missile strikes by Iran and Israel were also shared widely on Facebook, falsely identified as being from this week\u2019s Iranian strikes.\nThe Islamic Republic News Agency shared an image on Twitter giving the inaccurate impression that it showed U.S. planes on fire after Iranian strikes this week.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17556"}
