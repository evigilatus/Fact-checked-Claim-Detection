The car dealer whose lot got burned to the ground kills himself after he found out that his insurance won\u2019t cover for the damages for the riots. Close family members are (sic) devistated.\"\nThis sloppily-worded claim is not true.\nThe dealership\nThe car lot involved \u2014 Car Source \u2014 is co-owned by Anmol Khindri, his father and his brother, Anmol Khindri told WKOW for a Sept. 2 story. They bought the lot in 2013.\nAfter Blake, 29, was shot in the back seven times by a Kenosha police officer on Aug. 23, the lot was targeted on consecutive nights as protests devolved into looting and violence.\nKhindri estimated the damage at $2.5 million. A gofundme page launched to help the lot\u2019s 20-plus employees said 137 cars were destroyed, in addition to the damage to the building.\nHere is another look at 'Car Source' dealership in #Kenosha pic.twitter.com/sYJ2o8jYeB\u2014 Jorge Ventura Media (@VenturaReport) August 24, 2020 \nKhindri told WKOW his insurance company rejected his claim for damages.\n\"They don't cover the riots. This is domestic terrorism, (they) don't cover it,\" he told the TV station. \"I'm screwed.

Anmol Khindri did not immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment.\nBut the sloppily-assembled image also gave a discerning viewer many reasons to doubt its veracity. Among the tells:\n\n\nThe subhead misspells the word devastated and doesn\u2019t capitalize Kenosha.\n\n\nThe image has the right logo and links at the top of the page, but it doesn\u2019t show a story date above the headline or a byline and social media links below the headline, as real stories on the Fox Business Network\u00a0site do.\n\n\nThe subhead in particular uses poor grammar throughout, inconsistent with a news operation on the scale of Fox Business Network. Other references such as \"2.5 million dollars\" aren\u2019t in line with Associated Press style guidelines used by news organizations.\n\n\n\u00a0A partially cropped word at the bottom of the image says \"ifunn,\" potentially indicating it is connected to ifunny.co, an online repository of memes and other doctored images.\n\n\nOur rating\nA viral image says the owner of a Kenosha car dealership destroyed by arsonists killed himself because insurance wouldn\u2019t cover the losses.\nThe owner of Car Source has said insurance denied the claim since it was due to \"domestic terrorism.\"\nBut the thrust of the claim is not about insurance, it\u2019s that a man lost his life. And that element is manufactured and completely wrong.\nAnmol Khindri has not taken his own life. The headline shown here was manipulated \u2014 no such story was published by Fox Business Network.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18909"}
