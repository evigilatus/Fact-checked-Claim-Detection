Now, says Assemblyman Joe Cryan, the time has come for public colleges and universities that accept state funding to be more accountable for its graduation rates.\n\"What do Rutgers University, Kean University, Montclair State University, New Jersey City University, Stockton College, Rowan University and William Paterson all have in common?\" Cryan (D-Union) asked during a Dec. 19 Assembly session in which he discussed a new state panel formed to study the affordability of higher education. \"They all graduate less than 50 percent of their students within four years.\"\nThat statistic seemed a bit startling to the Truth-O-Meter, but we found that Cryan is correct.\nCryan\u2019s statistic is based on data reported by the schools themselves, as required, to the state. That data then goes to the U.S. Department of Education, where it can be accessed on the website for the Institute of Education Sciences. The institute\u2019s website shows data for students starting in fall 2004 and fall 2006. Cryan\u2019s claim is based on 2004 data.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the graduation rates for each of the schools Cryan mentioned, based on a first-year, full-time equivalent student graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in four years. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that the graduation rates increase if students take six years to complete their degree:\n\n\n\nSCHOOL\n\nFOUR-YEAR RATE,\nSTARTING FALL 2004\n\n\nSIX-YEAR RATE, \nSTARTING FALL 2004\n\n\n\nRutgers University\n48 percent\n77 percent\n\n\nKean University\n17 percent\n47 percent\n\n\nMontclair State University\n31 percent\n62 percent\n\n\nNew Jersey City University\n8 percent\n37 percent\n\n\nRichard Stockton College\n40 percent\n64 percent\n\n\nRowan University\n44 percent\n70 percent\n\n\nWilliam Paterson University\n17 percent\n49 percent\n\n\n\nSources: Asm. Joe Cryan\u2019s office; U.S. Department of Education website, Institute of Education Sciences College Navigator, Retention and Graduation Rates\nCryan noted that he didn\u2019t include some schools, such as the New Jersey Institute of Technology, because its curriculum requires five years to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree.\nWe reached out to each of the schools cited by Cryan. Not all responded but some that did said that there\u2019s more to graduation rates than numbers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s a big difference between a kid going to Harvard and a kid going to New Jersey City University, a big difference between going to William Paterson and to Rutgers,\" said Joe Cardona, vice president of university relations for Rowan University in Glassboro. \"Their preparedness profile, their economic profile -- all of those really tie in to your ability to excel and to be able to achieve whatever the degree program is.\"\nComparing schools with different missions, populations and demographics is akin to comparing apples and oranges, Cardona added.\nTaking six years to complete a bachelor\u2019s degree has become a more accepted timeframe, according to Cardona and Steve Manas, a spokesman at Rutgers New Brunswick.\n\"The current national standard for graduation rates is six years, and Rutgers' rate is 75 percent, comparable to AAU (Association of American Universities) peers,\" Manas said in an e-mail. \"The latest graduation rate for four years is 52 percent.\"\nMaryjane Briant, a spokeswoman for Stockton College, confirmed Cryan\u2019s graduation rate number for the Atlantic County school for students starting in 2004, but noted that the number has climbed significantly since.\nThe four-year graduation rate for Stockton students starting school in fall 2009 was 53 percent, she said.\nTo reiterate, Cryan\u2019s numbers are accurate for students starting their degrees 10 years ago, but schools that spoke with us generally pointed to higher graduation rates from more recent timeframes.\nCryan said many families that save money to send their children to college plan or expect it to be a four -year program, not six. And he re-emphasized his concern that institutions accepting state money for higher education need to be more accountable for on-time graduation rates. He also disagreed that it\u2019s unfair to compare students attending schools that may have different missions and demographics.\n\"What demographic is allowed not to graduate on time?\" he said. \"What students do you favor over others as a result?\nOur ruling\nCryan said, \"What do Rutgers University, Kean University, Montclair State University, New Jersey City University, Stockton College, Rowan University and William Paterson all have in common? They all graduate less than 50 percent of their students within four years.\"\nCryan cited statistics reported by the schools he names for first-time, full-time students starting a four-year program in 2004. \u00a0The graduation rates trend upward, though, for more recent years, and the rates jump substantially for students who took six years to earn their bachelor\u2019s degree.\nStill, Cryan\u2019s claim is technically accurate and we therefore rate his claim True.\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08416"}
