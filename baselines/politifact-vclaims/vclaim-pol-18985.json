But now, McConnell said Trump\u2019s nomination will receive a vote.\nDemocrats called it the height of hypocrisy and double standards. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., even quoted McConnell\u2019s 2016 rationale verbatim in a tweet that said \"Americans should have a voice.\"\nWe researched McConnell\u2019s past statements. From the beginning, he said the Senate should wait for elections to decide the next president who would choose Scalia\u2019s replacement. On numerous occasions, he offered an artfully crafted justification that cited historical precedent to uphold that position, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he is not waiting on the voters to speak in 2020\u00a0 as he had argued in 2016.\nUltimately, experts told us that McConnell would have been more honest to simply explain that he\u2019s pursuing a Supreme Court confirmation this late in the election cycle because he has the power to do so.\nWhat McConnell said in 2016\nMcConnell\u2019s short remembrance of Scalia upon the news of his death ended with the revelation that he would reject any nominee from Obama during his final year. At the time, the election was almost 10 months away.\n\"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell said in a Feb. 13, 2016, statement.\nThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. #Scalia https://t.co/QXHfOpEY6G\u2014 Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) February 14, 2016 \nOn that first night, there were no further caveats.\nSubsequently, in some settings, McConnell stuck to this line without elaboration (once adding #LetThePeopleDecide). Many Republican senators picked up the argument that it was too close to the presidential election to pursue confirmation.\nBut McConnell would come to repeat a caveat that left open a path of consistency if the shoe were ever on the other foot. McConnell said on several occasions that the Senate had not confirmed a nominee from a president of the opposite party since 1888.\nFor instance, in March 2016, McConnell said on Fox News Sunday, \"You have to go back 80 years to find the last time a vacancy on the Supreme Court created in a presidential election year was filled. You have to go back to 1888 when Grover Cleveland was in the White House to find the last time when a vacancy was created in a presidential year, a Senate controlled (by the) party opposite the president confirmed.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020: Consistency or principle?\nWith the Senate majority and White House both in Republican hands today, McConnell revived the caveated version of the justification he used in 2016.\n\"In the last midterm election before Justice Scalia\u2019s death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president\u2019s second term,\" McConnell said in his Sept. 18 statement. \"We kept our promise. Since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year.\"\nMcConnell made this point again a few days later in his first Senate floor speech after Ginsburg\u2019s death.\u00a0\nHowever, claims like this obfuscate the fact that Supreme Court vacancies in presidential election years are rare \u2014 and there was no consistent pattern of punting on a nomination.\nOne problem with parsing precedents for handling past Supreme Court vacancies in an election year is that there are only a few historical examples to look at, and each has quirks that make them different. For instance, Scalia\u2019s death and Ginsburg\u2019s both created vacancies, but Scalia\u2019s came 268 days before Election Day while Ginsburg\u2019s came just 46 days before the election, at which point voting in some places had already begun.\n\"What we have is a framing war that reflects the values of each side, one that ultimately spins, picks and chooses the facts, perspectives, and structures of the discussion,\" said Colorado State University political scientist Kyle Saunders.\u00a0\nPrevious \"rules\" addressing the handling of election-year Supreme Court nominations, including one attributed to the late Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., in 1968 and one offered by then-Sen. Joe Biden in 1992, have been cited frequently, but they carry no official force, said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis.\u00a0\nIf McConnell\u2019s overarching argument in 2016 was that the public should be able to weigh in on the nomination, then he\u2019s offered a different standard for 2020, Smith added. In February 2016, McConnell said the expression of popular sentiment would occur in the coming November election. But in September 2020, McConnell indicated that the public expression has already been made by electing a president and Senate majority in the past, in 2016 and 2018.\n\"To say, \u2018We blocked the opposing party\u2019s nominee in 2016 because we controlled the Senate, and we will vote on our own party\u2019s nominee in 2020 because we control the Senate\u2019 is merely to say, \u2018We control the Senate and will do what we wish, regardless of the occupant of the White House,\u2019\" said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University historian. \"No actual rule is being articulated.\"\nIn addition, a majority of voters rejected Trump in 2016, and in both 2016 and 2018, Democrats won more votes for Senate seats than Republicans did, said John J. Pitney Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist.\n\"Principle, schminciple \u2014 it's all about power,\" Pitney said.\nOur ruling\nMcConnell\u2019s position in 2016 was not to hear a Supreme Court justice nominee in an election year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,\" he said on the night of Scalia\u2019s death.\nIn 2020, his position has changed. He will no longer wait for the American people to decide in the next election.\u00a0\nIn both cases, McConnell offered a justification that confirmations have proceeded when the presidency and the Senate are in unified control and have stalled when the two are under divided control. However, this isn\u2019t a higher principle that led McConnell to his decision; it\u2019s a cherry-picked, after-the-fact justification for the raw exercise of power he undoubtedly has.\nMcConnell\u2019s overarching stance on whether the people should weigh in on a nomination during the next election was different in 2016 and 2020.
