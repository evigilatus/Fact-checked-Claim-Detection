Barack Obama \"missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes.\" In 2004, John Kerry missed \"close to 60 to 70 percent\" and Bob Graham missed \"over 30 percent of his votes.\"", "truth_label": "true", "date": "stated on October 28, 2015 in the CNBC GOP presidential debate:", "title": "When attacked for missed votes, Marco Rubio calls out Barack Obama and John Kerry for missing votes", "text": "A major Florida newspaper\u2019s editorial board called for U.S. Sen Marco Rubio to resign because of his record of missed votes in the Senate. The next day, Rubio was asked about it at the CNBC Republican debate in Boulder, Colo.\nCNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla asked Rubio about the editorial and if he hated his job.\nRubio countered that the Sun Sentinel had showed \"bias\" in its endorsements, because a few other senators who ran for president had missed a huge chunk of votes, too.\n\"Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. I don't recall them calling for his resignation. \u2026 Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. In fact, the Sun Sentinel endorsed him. In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again. So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.\"\nWhat was the voting record of Sens. Obama, Kerry and Graham when they ran for president? We decided to check the roll call, as well as the endorsement record.\nPlaying hooky\nIn 2008, Obama missed 137 out of 213 votes, or 64.3 percent of votes. (His career absentee rate is 24.2 percent.)\nIn 2004, Kerry missed 89.8 percent of votes. (His career rate is 7.7 percent.) That's somewhat higher than what Rubio said.\nFrom January to October 2003, which includes the span of his campaign, Graham was absent 37 percent of the time. (His career rate is 3.2 percent.)\u00a0Graham also underwent heart surgery\u00a0on Jan. 31 that year, which caused him to miss votes before his official campaign launch.\nFor his part, Rubio has missed 99 out of 291 votes (about 34 percent) from the start of the year to Oct. 22, more than any other candidate in the race, according to Govtrack.us.\nRubio recently took the \"most truant career\" sash from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

He filed his papers to form a president campaign committee Feb. 27, 2003, launched his campaign May 6 and dropped out Oct. 6, 2003. We couldn\u2019t find the Sun Sentinel criticizing his voting record.\nIn October 2004, the Sun Sentinel endorsed Kerry:\n\"The Massachusetts senator possesses a prodigious intellect capable of grasping the complexities of the serious issues facing the nation and the world,\" the Sentinel wrote.\nThe Sentinel\u2019s editorial page editor Rosemary O\u2019Hara, who joined board in 2012, told PolitiFact that as far as Rubio\u2019s endorsement \"We believed him when he said he wanted to work for Floridians in the Senate.\"\nWhile Clinton and Obama were criticized when they ran for president for missing votes, \"I don't recall either of them complaining about the job,\" O\u2019Hara told PolitiFact. \"By contrast, Sen. Rubio has made it clear he doesn't like the job, which is why he wants another. Also, Sen. Obama and Clinton were not the senators from Florida. Marco Rubio is our guy. We have a personal relationship with him. We have only two people representing us in the U.S. Senate, and he said he wanted to do the job.\"\nOur ruling\nRubio said that Obama \"missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes,\" that Kerry missed \"close to 60 to 70 percent\" and that Graham missed \"over 30 percent of his votes\" when they were running for president. Those numbers check out, though Obama\u2019s and Kerry\u2019s numbers were over the course of an election year. Rubio is also correct that the newspaper didn\u2019t call for their resignations. Overall, we rate Rubio\u2019s statement True.\nCorrection:\u00a0This report has been updated to correct minor math errors in the calculations of voting percentages. Rubio's numbers remain on track, and our rating remains the same.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05800"}
