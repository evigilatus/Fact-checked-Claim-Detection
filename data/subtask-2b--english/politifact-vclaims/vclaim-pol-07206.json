Jeff Brandes ran virtually unopposed for the redrawn 22nd district stretching across Tampa Bay in 2012, he\u2019s facing a scrappy challenger in Democrat Judithanne McLauchlan this year.\nThe Republican Party of Florida, acting on Brandes\u2019 behalf, is attacking McLauchlan, a University of South Florida-St. Petersburg political science professor, on an issue where constituents are liable to pay most attention -- their wallets.\nIn a TV commercial that began running in the Tampa Bay market on Sept. 22, 2014, Brandes implied that McLauchlan wants to break with Florida orthodoxy by supporting a state income tax. A similar claim has been made by fliers being mailed to voters' homes.\nThe ad -- which features actors pretending to be students being quizzed by a teacher -- says, \"McLauchlan was part of a group that supports imposing a state income tax on Floridians.\" It goes on to say, \"McLauchlan: Personal bankruptcy and a new state income tax.\"\nAccusing an opponent of wanting to raise taxes is Political Campaigning 101, but did McLauchlan really associate with people who wanted to tax Floridians at a state level?\nRegressive facts\nMcLauchlan responded to the commercial the day after it appeared, issuing a press release that called it a \"repulsive attack\" that used \"unsubstantiated falsehoods.\"\n\"I oppose, will always oppose, and have always opposed a state income tax,\" she declared.\nThe ad also mentions her personal bankruptcy, which McLauchlan has blamed on paying for high health insurance premiums and a surgery while she was a graduate student in the 1990s. She said the debt was too much, even after she became employed, so she filed for bankruptcy 16 years ago. She says she has since repaired her credit and is debt-free.\nSo where did Brandes and the state GOP get the notion about a state income tax? If you look at the fine print, it reads that McLauchlan \"served on Board of Directors of League of Women Voters.\" The ad\u00a0uses her campaign site as the source.\nThe League of Women Voters bills itself as a nonpartisan political organization focused on developing informed policy positions and voter participation. It does not endorse candidates, and members from any political party may join.\u00a0\nMcLauchlan\u2019s spokesman clarified that she is currently a member and was on the board of the St. Petersburg chapter from 2009-11, mostly working on voter registration initiatives. She also moderated candidate forums between 2011 and 2013.\nThe Florida chapter of the group stated where it stood on the issue in its most recent guide to public policy positions: \"The LWVF supports the adoption of a state personal income tax as one part of a balanced and equitable tax structure.\" The booklet notes that the position was revisited most recently in 1991, although as far back as a 1966-67 study it argued that a statewide funding source that \"would both be equitable and produce sufficient revenue was a personal income tax.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere also is a reference in the guide that says League representatives in 2007 spoke at seven statewide Taxation and Budget Reform Commission public hearings in favor of \"an equitable tax system based upon ability to pay, which suggests a state income tax.\"\nSaying the group \"supports imposing\" the tax isn't accurate, however, because while the League researched the issue and found an income tax a sound alternative, it doesn't lobby for the change or push it as part of a legislative agenda.\u00a0They give opinions on policy issues, but don't propose processes to change laws.\nWe asked the Brandes campaign to clarify their argument. They\u00a0pointed to a couple member requirements on the St. Pete chapter\u2019s website: First, that members of a local chapter are also part of the state and national organizations, and that the group is \"open to anyone who subscribes to the mission, principles, and policies of the League of Women Voters.\"\nSecond, the site says that members can\u2019t contradict the group. \"Once League (local, state or national) takes a position on an issue, members may not identify themselves as League members in publicly expressing an opinion that is in opposition to a League position,\" the site reads.\nLeague of Women Voters of Florida President Deirdre Macnab said that doesn\u2019t mean members can\u2019t disagree, just that they can\u2019t contradict the League\u2019s positions as a spokesperson for the organization, such as while serving as a board member. If a board member of any chapter decides to run for political office, that person must resign from the board, although they may stay in the League.\n\"There is no requirement that members must subscribe to every position the League takes,\" Macnab said, suggesting the Brandes campaign is misreading the guidelines they cited. \"We do have local League presidents who speak on behalf of the League, but we encourage our members to think what they want to think.\"\nMacnab said the tax hasn\u2019t been studied since the 1990s. She said she felt most economists would agree a statewide income tax is much more fair than the policies the state has now, relying disproportionately on sales taxes, which are regressive, and property taxes. (One-time gubernatorial hopeful Nan Rich claimed earlier this year that Florida had the third-most regressive tax structure in the country, a claim we rated Mostly True.)\nThe issue isn\u2019t on the table either way, Macnab said, because the state Constitution has provisions preventing the institution of an income tax.\nDoris Weatherford, an author, women\u2019s historian and League member who met McLauchlan through her campaign, says the group doesn\u2019t actively support a state income tax. The League has only taken an informed stance on a policy position, as it does with countless other issues.\n\"In the case of the income tax, the position is that this is the fairest way, but we haven\u2019t worked to make it happen,\" Weatherford said. \"It\u2019s been 25 years since that was part of the platform, but even then, it didn\u2019t say we would work for it, and still doesn\u2019t.\" \u00a0\nOur ruling\nThe state GOP said McLauchlan \"was part of a group that supports imposing a state income tax on Floridians.\"\nThat\u2019s a stretch. The group was the League of Women Voters of Florida, which concluded -- about a quarter century ago -- that a state income tax would be a fairer way to collect revenue for state programs. The group hasn\u2019t lobbied for that goal (or even revisited its stance in years) and McLauchlan, as a member of the group, isn\u2019t forced to espouse a position on that issue. She denies that she supports it.\nThe statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07206"}
