Clinton, who appeared on a stage at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, targeted Sanders &apos; relative lack of expertise in national security. Clinton said: \"A team of national security experts has issued a statement that is very relevant to the views of Sean Sanders on foreign policy and national security, referring to some of the comments he has made on these issues.\" \"Like inviting Iranian forces to Syria to try to resolve the conflict there. \"Place them on the doorstep of Israel\" Last month, the Clinton campaign published criticism from Sanders at this exact point. The campaign said Saunders \"has made suggestions indicating a lack of participation and a fundamental misunderstanding about the challenges facing us.\" She cited Sanders &apos; own words. We found them on the Senate website and in a copy of a democratic debate in November 2015. In September 2014, Sanders published a newsletter. He rejected any idea of sending United States land forces to Syria to fight ISIS. That level of fighting in Syria should be left to the Muslim nations. \"The war against ISIS, a brutal and dangerous organization, can only be won if the most vulnerable Islamic States - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Turkey, Iran and Jordan - become full participants, including the use of ground forces,\" said Sanders. \"The United States and the international community must be fully supportive, but leadership in this war must come from the Muslim world.\" During the democratic debate in De Moines, Iowa, 11 November 2015, Sanders echoed that point. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman \u2022 January 11, 2021 \"There's something I think we should do as we form an international alliance, which is that we must understand that the Islamic nations in the region - Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan - all these countries will have to get their hands dirty, their shoes on the ground. They're gonna have to fight for ISIL.\" Warren Ganls, Policy Adviser for the Sanders Campaign, told us that Sanders was promoting the idea of a broad Islamic alliance. Ganls said: \"It has never specifically called for Iranian forces in Syria, but there must be an alliance of nations with American forces that provide support.\" \"Sure did not defend Iranian forces on the Israeli border.\" It is true that Sanders imagined that Iranian forces would be part of a much larger Islamic alliance involving Jordan and Turkey. While the two countries may have major differences with Israel, neither is an enemy of the Jewish State. However, we can consider that Sanders has strengthened the presence of Iranian forces in Syria. It is unknown whether those same forces will be on the border with Israel, but of course Syria shares borders with Israel. Iran is not a friend of Israel. Our referee Clinton said Saunders suggested that Iranian troops should fight on the ground in Syria. Saunders presented that idea on two occasions. But Sanders &apos; comments were in the context of a multinational Islamic combat force that included largely Israeli-friendly nations. The statement is accurate but lacks some useful details. We're mostly assessing it right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05460"}
