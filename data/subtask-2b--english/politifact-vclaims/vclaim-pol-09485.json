That money is used to build up reserves in good economic times so unemployment benefits can be paid during economic downturns. The fund pays unemployment benefits to people who worked in New Jersey.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what happened, especially after both parties spent years diverting fund money to cover charity care payments to hospitals, ultimately reaching $4.6 billion by 2005. Then the recession hit and unemployment claims started pouring in around 2008.\n\nThe fund was near empty by March 2009 and New Jersey had to borrow more than $1 billion from the federal government to cover expenses. That loan is on track to be repaid by March 2014, said Frank W. Haines III, assistant legislative budget and finance officer for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services.\n\nAbout a year ago, state Sen. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris) claimed an \"unchecked Democratic Majority in Trenton\" was largely responsible for the frequent fund diversions, but PolitiFact New Jersey ruled that claim Mostly False. While both political parties were responsible for diversions, the OLS told us that about 67 percent of the roughly $4.6 billion in total diverted funds resulted from legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature between 1992 and 1997.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo where does Corzine come in? Despite Christie\u2019s claim, Corzine was the first governor in years to stop diverting money from the fund. But he authorized a $260 million payment into the fund so claims could be paid, as well as borrowing from the federal government.\n\nMoney from the fund has not been diverted since fiscal year 2006, which was actually calendar year 2005, Haines explained. The governor at that time was Richard Codey, not Corzine. Codey served 10 months as interim governor after Democrat Jim McGreevey resigned. Corzine became governor in January 2006.\n\nSo Christie is wrong to pin diversions on Corzine, but Corzine still bears some blame, said Michael Drewniak, a Christie spokesman.\n\n\"The Governor has said many times that both parties were guilty of raiding the UI fund; Governor Corzine\u2019s borrowing extended and compounded the problem,\" Drewniak said in an e-mail, noting that Christie was speaking colloquially when he used the word \u2018stealing.\u2019 \"There\u2019s been other equal opportunity failures too, pension underfunding comes immediately to mind. The Governor has always said there\u2019s plenty of blame to go around for prior fiscal mismanagement, but he also always emphasizes the need for bipartisanship to fix all those things that set us back.\"\n\nDrewniak also noted that Christie said of the fund\u2019s diversions, \"We simply don\u2019t do that, haven\u2019t done it, and won\u2019t permit it.\"\n\nThat\u2019s probably because the governor supported a ballot question giving taxpayers the say-so for future diversions. Taxpayers approved the measure in 2010. As a result, state law forbids the diversions Christie claims he \"won\u2019t permit.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nChristie said, \"The people who were running the budget, in the Corzine years, decided to steal from the unemployment trust fund. \u2026 As did other Governors before. We simply don\u2019t do that, haven\u2019t done it, and won\u2019t permit it.\"\n\nThe governor\u2019s claim contains an element of truth, that other administrations have diverted money from the fund, but his hasn\u2019t. The reason? State law now forbids such diversions \u2013 something he didn\u2019t say. Although Christie was speaking colloquially about \u2018stealing\u2019 from the fund, he was wrong when he pegged diversions to the Corzine administration. The last time such a diversion occurred was when Codey was interim governor. We rate Christie\u2019s statement Mostly False.\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09485"}
