When asked, four out of five Americans say the cost of drugs is \"unbelievable.\" Cory Booker from D.N.G. has signed up for a set of price reduction plans. \"There are many people who benefit from the pain of people in America, from pharmaceutical companies to insurance companies,\" Bocker said in the first democratic debate in Miami. The Trump campaign was launched as a reminder that poker has a history with drug manufacturers. Curry Booker accepted over $400,000 from the pharmaceutical industry during his political career @trompWarRoom tweeted on June 26, the night of the first democratic debate. FACT: Corey Booker accepted over $400,000 from the pharmaceutical industry during his political life. Pic.twitter.com/1HufFVBGVU - Trump War Room (@trompWarRoom) 27 June 2019, with one action, this number is correct. But a more beautiful look at the drug manufacturer's political money gives a lower number, and tweeting gives no hint that poker stopped taking pharmaceutical money in 2017. The Trump campaign sent us to the poker trade brief page on the Open Secrets website, a reliable source of federal political financial statements. Booker was first nominated to the Senate in 2013. Since then, people and groups associated with the pharmaceutical/health product industry have provided Poker with $411,948. The number is actually higher. Booker runs the PAC leadership, a common Capitol Hill fund-raising device for a variety of uses, from travel expenses to helping other candidates finance their campaigns. Booker has received $56,000 since 2014, for a total of $468,000. There is an important warning: this industrial group involves much more than drug manufacturers. All pharmaceutical wholesalers, medical equipment manufacturers and food supplement companies fall into this category. The wholesalers will have a share in the bills aimed at reducing the cost of prescription drugs, but many other companies, such as Nestle, which has several supplementary food brands, and Medtronic, which manufactures insulin pumps and much more, will not be affected by such legislation. According to data drawn by workers in open secrets, the total number of drugs in poker is $327,000. This includes voluntary contributions to its campaign committee and leadership of the General People &apos; s Congress Party. One last wrinkle will add some money. The Trump campaign tweet was based solely on the Federal Booker receipts. But as Mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013, Poker raised millions. Some of this came from people associated with drug manufacturers. One noteworthy example is Jonathan Sackler, a family member behind Bordeaux Varma, the oxycontinian maker. In 2009, Sackler gave $26,000 to the poker team of Newark, a joint campaign committee to help elect poker and a list of city council members. In the end, we found that drug manufacturers carried out campaigns on poker worth $350,000. This is less than the tweet claimed, but still a large amount. If drug traffickers are added in bulk, the gap will largely disappear. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, and said, \"We're not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, Poker rejected drug manufacturers' money in June 2017, Booker said that he had stopped receiving industrial donations. \"We have stopped even receiving contributions from pharmaceutical companies because they give rise to a lot of criticism,\" said Booker. Recently, he tweeted, \"The large pharmaceutical companies must be held criminally responsible for the opiate crisis. I said I wouldn't take contributions from PACs, from pharmaceutical managers -- they're part of this problem.\" Large pharmaceutical companies should be held criminally responsible for the opiate crisis. I said I wouldn't receive contributions from PACs, from pharmaceutical managers - they're part of this problem. It is time to work on a solution. Chip to help us run a popular campaign - Corey Booker (@CoryBooker) 27 June 2019 as much as his PAC money, Until 2016, drug manufacturers had given him $202,000. Since then, as shown in the chart below, the amount provided directly by drug manufacturers has been zero, with some contributions continuing to be made by individuals working for drug manufacturers. New Jersey is home to many large pharmaceutical companies, including Merc, Novartis and Bristol Myers Squipe. Self-employed individuals have continued to provide grants to Booker, but since 2016 this has decreased from about $100,000 to about $26,000. The poker campaign indicated that he joined Sin Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, on the drug import bill. Booker has also introduced legislation allowing the medical care programme to negotiate lower prices for the medicines it describes. These and other measures have provoked strong opposition from the drug industry. Our ruling campaign in Trump said that during his career, poker was over $400,000 in the pharmaceutical industry. The number's close. What the tweet ignores is that Booker stopped taking money from pharmaceutical companies and senior executives. Since 2016, poker has received zero dollars from drug manufacturers, and individual contributions have decreased by 75 per cent. The regular tweet reader will have no idea that poker has avoided pharmaceutical money over the past two years. That's the additional context, but poker's accepted the money in the past years. This matches our definition of \"mostly true.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00469"}
