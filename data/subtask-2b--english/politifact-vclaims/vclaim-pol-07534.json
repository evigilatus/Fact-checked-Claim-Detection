Which do you think have done better? It\u2019s not the states with the highest state income tax.\"\nMillions of words have been spilled arguing about the effect taxes have on the economy. We can\u2019t resolve that debate here, but we wanted to check Weinstein\u2019s claim that the nine states with no state income tax outperformed the nine states with the highest state income taxes.\nIt turns out there are metrics that support Weinstein\u2019s point -- and others that contradict it.\nArthur Laffer\nWeinstein told us he was referring to a study from the Laffer Center for Supply-Side Economics authored by Arthur Laffer, the so-called \"father of supply-side economics,\" and Stephen Moore, another pre-eminent supply-side economist.\nLaffer\u2019s argument in \"Taxes Really Do Matter\" has been persuasive. He actually helped design the Kansas tax cuts that Weinstein was defending, and Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback seemed to refer to Laffer\u2019s research when he said that \"pro-growth states with no state income taxes \u2026 are among the country\u2019s strongest economic performers.\"\nLaffer and Moore analyzed nine \"no-tax\" states (Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, Wyoming, Tennessee and New Hampshire) and compared them to nine \"high-tax\" states (California, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Vermont).\nLaffer and Moore look at the average growth from 2001-10 for each set of states in four factors: population, Gross State Product (GSP: GDP but for states), employment, and state and local tax revenue.\nBy each of these four measures, the nine states without an income tax outperform the high-tax states.\nAnother way to look at it\nSo Weinstein cited Laffer\u2019s study accurately. But there is more to the story.\nDick Lavine, a senior fiscal analyst at the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, said Laffer\u2019s measures are not what economists usually use to judge a state\u2019s success. \"The trouble with Laffer\u2019s study is that fast-growing states look good by his measure mainly because of population growth, not because of any excellence in the economy.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) -- a research group that partners with Citizens for Tax Justice, which advocates for the tax interests of middle- and lower-class families -- responded to Laffer\u2019s research with its own study, \"\u2018High rate\u2019 Income Tax States Are Outperforming No-Tax States.\"\nThe results, as you might imagine, are 100 percent opposite of the Laffer analysis.\nWhereas the Laffer Center study looks at raw totals, ITEP looked at three per capita statistics that Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, called \"the three major economic indicators.\"\n\"The nine states with the highest individual income tax rates had better change in median wage (-0.7 percent\u00a0to -3.5 percent) and significantly better growth in state GSP per capita (10.1 percent\u00a0to 8.7 percent),\" Martire said, while \"no-tax states had marginally better unemployment.\"\nOther factors\nWhile the Laffer Center study argues that population is a valid measure for economic growth -- they look in particular at migrants between high-tax and no-tax states -- it\u2019s tough to attribute that growth solely to the absence of an income tax.\n\"The majority of population growth is natural increase,\" Lavine said, noting that Texas and Florida have relatively high Latino populations, who statistically have more kids per family. Eight of the no-tax states are also in the South and West, which have seen their populations increase since the popularization of air conditioning after World War II.\nEven setting aside population, income tax alone doesn\u2019t capture the full difference between states, said Jay Ritter, professor of finance at the University of Florida.\n\"As the ITEP notes, some states have no income taxes because they can generate revenue from taxing tourists or taxing oil extraction,\" Ritter said. \"Lowering income tax rates or eliminating them does attract residents, but if lower revenue is generated, at least in the short run, the state has to either increase other taxes or cut expenditures.\"\nTexas, for example, has particularly high local property taxes and is also having problems funding its school system, according to the New York Times.\nScott Drenkard, an economist for the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that differences between states make it hard to draw conclusions just from the Laffer Center\u2019s nine versus nine comparison. Case studies \"can be fruitful,\" Drenkard said, \"but you should be careful to try to compare apples-to-apples as much as possible.\"\nOur ruling\nDefending Kansas\u2019 tax cuts, Weinstein claimed that the states that are doing \"better\" are the ones that have no income state tax.\nWeinstein is accurately citing a study by the Laffer Center that compares states on their growth in population, GSP, total jobs, and total state and local tax revenue. To Laffer, no-tax states are besting high-tax states.\nBut we found another study from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy that concluded the exact opposite, by using a different set of measurements.\nIn the end, measuring \"better\" ultimately is in the eye of the beholder, and we\u2019re not going to settle this economics debate. But Weinstein isn\u2019t going to either. We rate his claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07534"}
