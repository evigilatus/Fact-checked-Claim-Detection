However, that goal wasn\u2019t part of the education plan he laid out last month.\nSo we were curious when Progress Texas, a liberal-leaning education and advocacy group, attributed dire consequences to Trump\u2019s education plan. The group opened a Sept. 20, 2016, blog post: \"He doesn't always talk about policy, but when he does -- it's also terrible. Donald Trump's education plan to dramatically slash funding for public education would fire 49,000 Texas teachers.\"\nTrump\u2019s plan\nSo, what does Trump want to do?\nFor our part, we confirmed instances of the Republican presidential nominee saying he could shutter or shrink the 4,400-employee, $68 billion education department. The agency, founded in 1980, says it focuses on distributing federal aid, collecting student performance data and ensuring equal access to schools. In Texas of late, federal aid of late covers more than 10 percent of school spending.\nOn Fox News Sunday in October 2015, Trump was asked if he would cut agencies. Trump replied that he favors \"local education\" and that \"I may cut Department of Education.\" In April 2016 on Fox News\u2019 Hannity, the candidate called the department \"massive, and it can be largely eliminated.\" But Trump also said, \"you maybe want to have a little bit of tentacles out there.\"\nThen again, Trump\u2019s formal education initiatives, unveiled in September 2016, don\u2019t mention shrinking or eliminating the department, stressing instead his vow to enable children to attend the public, charter or private school of their choice starting by reprioritizing $20 billion in federal funds. Trump didn\u2019t say where the funds would come from; an Education Week news story on his plan said \"it's possible he was referring to Title I money for disadvantaged students, funded at about $15.5 billion right now.\"\nAlso not in the posted plan: Any statement about cutting teachers in any state including Texas, which has more than 320,000 teachers.\nTexas group cites speculative study\nWhen we asked Progress Texas how the group reached its count of 49,000 potentially doomed\u00a0teachers, Phillip Martin replied by email that the group relied on a report from the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning Washington-based think tank.\nWorth noting: The report, which came out Sept. 1, 2016--before Trump laid out his education platform--draws from Trump the month before telling a reporter for Circa, a video-centric news service, that \"we're going to be cutting the Department of Education big league.\"\nCirca's story didn\u2019t quote Trump talking about teachers. But the center\u2019s report states: \"To calculate the number of teachers who could potentially lose their job as a result of Trump\u2019s proposal, the author added the most recent average teacher salary by state figures from the National Center for Education Statistics to the representative statistic of costs associated with education and health-services occupations from the Department of Labor. Subsequently, the author divided the total dollar amount each state receives for elementary and secondary education from the Department of Education by the above sum,\" it says.\nWe clicked through to an education department presentation of state-by-state aid, finding that for fiscal 2016, Texas school districts would receive $3,228,065,364 across 19 program elementary and secondary education categories topped by $1.3 billion in grants to local educational agencies.\nBy phone, the center\u2019s Will Ragland told us the center sought to show what the potential impact would be if all Department of Education funds disappeared; the center reached its figure of 49,045 teachers for Texas by assuming the cut funds would play out entirely in lost teaching jobs--a calculation that we confirmed. \"His plan wasn\u2019t very specific,\" Ragland said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNationally, federal funds cover about 8 percent of school district budgets and such aid flows to specific programs, such as to benefit low-income students, students with disabilities, computer science programs or early childhood education, according to the Department of Education website.\nExperts say it's speculation\nExperts we asked about the center\u2019s teachers-vamoosed conclusion saw flaws.\nBy phone, Lori Taylor, a Texas A&M University associate professor, told us that 70 percent of more than $3 billion in federal education funds spent in Texas in 2014-15 went to payroll. But, Taylor noted, that spending could include all positions, ranging from administrative assistants to speech therapists to teachers. In contract, to get to the center\u2019s 49,000 teacher count, Taylor said, you have to inaccurately assume that 100 percent of federal revenues are spent on teacher payrolls--plus that every penny of it would be eliminated under Trump\u2019s plan.\nTaylor added that even if Trump moved to shutter the department, it\u2019s unlikely the government would eliminate funding for popular programs that serve low-income children or students with disabilities. \"It\u2019s not politically possible,\" she said by phone.\n\"I believe the estimates are overblown,\" she said.\nFor out-of-state perspective, we reached Kevin Welner, director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado. Welner told us by email he doesn\u2019t \"fault the authors of that report for trying to come up with estimates like this, but it\u2019s very important to stress that, in doing so, these authors are not just adding flesh to a skeletal proposal \u2013 they necessarily have to add most of the bones.\"\n\"To my knowledge,\" Welner said, \"Trump hasn\u2019t provided any specifics at all concerning what he would actually \u2018shred\u2019 in the realm of Department of Education programs... So the report authors had to speculate, which means it\u2019s speculative to conclude that the plan \u2018would fire 49,000 Texas teachers.\u2019\"\nOur ruling\nProgress Texas said Donald Trump\u2019s plan would \"fire\" 49,000 Texas teachers.\nThis claim rests on Trump diverting a great deal of federal aid--something Trump hasn't said he'll do, far as we can tell.\nTrump has said he wants to shrink the Department of Education toward more local control. However, he\u2019s offered no specifics on what that would entail. Notably too, the education plan Trump rolled out before this claim surfaced doesn\u2019t mention the agency or intentions of cutting teachers.\nWe find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
