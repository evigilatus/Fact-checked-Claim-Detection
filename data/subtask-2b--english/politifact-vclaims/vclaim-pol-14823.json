So far, her toughest battle is not with the incumbent, John Eaves, but getting on the Nov. 2 ballot.\u201cGeorgia has the most restrictive ballot access laws in the country,\u201d Norwood, a former two-term Atlanta city councilwoman, said during a television interview Tuesday evening.That claim was too juicy for PolitiFact Georgia to resist checking out.We began by asking the Norwood camp for details. Anne Fauver, her campaign manager, explained. Georgia requires independent candidates running for countywide offices to get at least 5 percent of all registered voters eligible to vote in the last election in that jurisdiction to sign a petition supporting their placement on the ballot.\u201cI didn\u2019t know how restrictive it was in comparison to other states,\u201d said Fauver, who served with Norwood on the City Council.Norwood needs about 22,700 signatures to get on the ballot. Thus far, she is \u201cmore than halfway\u201d to her goal, Fauver said. Norwood has until July 13 to reach the magic number.Norwood has taken Eaves to court over what she calls a \u201chypertechnical interpretation\u201d of the law to discount about 3,000 of the signatures she has collected. The Eaves campaign says each petition signer must write \u201cFulton,\u201d along with their address, on the form. Norwood says Fulton election officials told her she could pre-type \u201cFulton\u201d on the form. A judge dismissed Norwood\u2019s complaint on this point Thursday, saying, in part, that any ruling before the deadline \u201cwould constitute an advisory opinion.\u201dAs for the 5 percent rule, we reached out to Richard Winger, the California-based editor of Ballot Access News. He has studied ballot issues for more than four decades. Winger was called a \u201csavant\u201d on the topic by Columbia University professor Nate Persily and \u201cthe nation\u2019s encyclopedia on this stuff\u201d by Capital University Law School professor Bradley Smith.\u201cThat is the toughest such law in the country,\u201d Winger said of Georgia.Until 1943, any political party could gain across-the-board ballot access by registering a slate of officers with the secretary of state. State leaders changed the system that year, primarily to discourage Communist Party candidates from getting on the ballot, Winger said. Some Southern states also used such rules to ensure that a white candidate would win, Smith said.The laws gradually changed over the years for some offices, Winger said. Statewide independent candidates now need the signatures of 1 percent of registered voters to get on the ballot. The rules stayed the same for independent candidates seeking a municipal or countywide office, or seats in Congress or the Georgia Legislature.Why hasn\u2019t the law changed? For some reason, Winger said, state lawmakers couldn\u2019t agree in the 1980s on several proposed bills that would have made it easier for people to get on the ballot to potentially run against them.A bill that would have removed the requirement that independent candidates gather signatures on a petition to run for office did not pass earlier this year.Winger ranks North Carolina as having the second-most-restrictive ballot access guidelines for independent countywide candidates. The Tar Heel State requires those candidates to get the signatures of 4 percent of registered voters in the county to get on the ballot. Winger ranked Illinois as third, but it\u2019s worth noting that state also requires independent countywide candidates to get 5 percent of the signatures of voters who cast ballots in the 2008 election.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for her claim on Georgia\u2019s rules about ballot access, the Peach State and Illinois both have similar ballot access guidelines.
