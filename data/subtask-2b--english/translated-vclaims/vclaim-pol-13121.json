Tofu said: \"Austin Energy,\" the city's power facility, \"considers its first increase since 1994.\" We wondered, since our first thought was that electricity bills certainly rose during that time. The manager of the Tofu campaign, Mark Yeznaga, told us that Tofu is referring to the basic electricity charge. The hearings are expected to culminate in news reports and articles on the Austin Energy Corporation website in view of the high prices around this year. In a January publication entitled Austin Energy Review, the Service states that since 1994 it has added more than 100,000 clients, experienced significant increases in the cost of materials and services, and added business functions, with the expansion of other functions such as energy efficiency programmes and solar cuts. At the same time, the article states that growth in sales of electricity in Austin has recently declined, requiring facilities to decline in their operational reserves. The spokesman for Austin Energy echoed the newsletter, Ed Clark, telling us that the basic electricity rate, which covers staff costs, the electrical system, power plants, vehicles and the like, has not changed since 1994. It is 3.55 cents for each of the first 500 kWh of electricity used and 7.28 cents per kWh. Clark also said that clients pay a monthly service fee of $6 unchanged, but that does not mean that they paid the same amount for electricity each year. Their invoices include variables such as the state-wide transportation cost charges added by the Texas Public Utilities Commission in November, as well as volatile charges associated with increases and decreases in fuel costs. At our request, Clark told us that an average residential customer using 1,000 kWh per month would be paid in August 1994 to 2011. In this period, we calculated that the average cost of fuel was 2.322 cents per kilowatt hour, although it was higher each year as of 2004. In 1994, the bill for 1,000 kWh would have amounted to $79.14. In 2010, the bill for the use of this large amount of electricity was $20,100 - an increase of 27 per cent. In August 2011, invoices for the same use will be paid in the amount of $94.72, owing to lower fuel charges. In other words, the 2011 fee appears to be 20 per cent higher than the client &apos; s cost by using the same amount of electricity in 1994. Ah-ha! Is it really fair to say that Austin's energy rates have not risen since 1994. Well, we realized that our comparison failed to consider inflation over the years. According to our cheque using the inflation calculator in the consumer price index published on the Internet by the Office of Labour Statistics, the 2011 bill is in fact about $15 lower than the 1994 comparative bill. When we managed this by the economist Austin Stewart Greenfield, he pointed out that according to the fine inflation adjustment associated with household energy prices, the August 2010 average bill was about $33 lower than it had been in 1994. However, the Tofu statement could, as a sign, leave the confusion that customers of public utilities have not had to extract more dollars for electricity since 1994. They've got it. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.
