Jackie Speier, a Democrat who represents the San Francisco area, weighed in through Twitter\u00a0with an alarming statement:\n\"3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend.\" \n\nDomestic violence plagues all corners of the United States, no matter a community\u2019s political leanings, economic status or demographic make-up. Still, we wanted to know whether the congresswoman\u2019s provocative claim was accurate and what source of information she relied on.\nWe set out to fact check Speier\u2019s sad statistic.\nOur research\nRep. Speier, a survivor of gun violence, has been a strong voice for gun control and for stopping sexual assaults.\nHer spokeswoman pointed us to an NBC news article which says \"nearly three women are murdered every day in the U.S. by current or former romantic partners.\"\nThat\u2019s slightly different from the congresswoman\u2019s tweet, which did not specify former partners. But it\u2019s fairly close.\nThe NBC article cited data from a 2017 Violence Policy Center report called When Men Murder Women. Representatives at the policy center could not be reached for comment. After examining the report, we found it somewhat supports Speier\u2019s statement, with a few caveats.\nIt analyzed 2015 homicide data collected by the FBI. It found 928 female homicide victims were \"wives or intimate acquaintances of their killers.\"\nThat works out to 2.54 female victims killed by an intimate partner on average per day in the United States. While Speier stated \"women,\" ages were not specified in the report.\nThe report, which is the most complete and current we could find, indicates the assailants were not just husbands or boyfriends, but also ex-spouses and former boyfriends.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon claim\nSeveral domestic violence prevention groups have cited the same \"three women murdered\" figure on their websites. At least two of these, the National Organization for Women and the American Psychological Association, cited data that\u2019s a decade or more older from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an office at the U.S. Department of Justice.\nThe National Organization for Women, for example, cited federal statistics from 2005 that show, on average, about 3.2 women were killed per day by an intimate partner in the United States.\nShari Miles-Cohen, senior director of the Women\u2019s Programs Office at the American Psychological Association, said the statistic dates to a 2003 Bureau of Justice Statistics report, but also matches with more recent homicide findings, including from 2013.\nMissing data\nWe found a note of caution in a 2013 Bureau of Justice Statistics report\u00a0on female homicides by intimate partners. It warned that the relationship between the killer and homicide victim was unknown for anywhere from a quarter to a third of the homicides in any given year. That\u2019s because an offender was not identified or apprehended, according to the report, which examined the years 1993 through 2010.\nGiven that missing data, one could speculate the actual number of women and girls killed through the years by intimate partners would be marginally higher.\nNo matter which report is examined, Gretchen Shaw, associate director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said domestic abuse is all too prevalent and deadly in the United States.\n\"It\u2019s much more common than people ever realize,\" Shaw said.\nOur ruling\nSpeier said in a tweet that \"3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend.\"\nSeveral domestic violence prevention groups make the same claim on their websites, though they cite data that in some cases is a decade old. We examined an analysis\u00a0of 2015 homicide data by the Violence Prevention Center, and found that about 2.5 females were killed, on average, by an intimate partner each day in the United States.\nSpeier\u2019s statement could have clarified that assailants include former intimate partners, as well as current ones. Also, her tweet references women, though the victims likely include some teenages.\nFinally, we found a 2013 Bureau of Justice Statistics report\u00a0that cautions the relationship between female homicide victims and their killers is unknown in as many as one third of the cases. This makes the actual number of women killed by intimate partners difficult to determine. One could argue the tally is higher than the studies show.\nWe found Speier\u2019s claim is on the right track, but could have used a few clarifications.\nWe rate\u00a0it Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2018-02-19 21:29:36 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend.\"    Jackie Speier U.S. Representative https://twitter.com/RepSpeier/status/962424186793848832    Saturday, February 10, 2018 2018-02-10    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02391"}
