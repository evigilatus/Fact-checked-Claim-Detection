Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., has called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign over taking meetings with the Russian ambassador without disclosing it to Congress.\nSessions, a former Republican senator from Alabama, defended the one-on-one he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak because it was part of his duties as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, not as a surrogate for President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign.\nIn a retort, McCaskill, also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said she never met with Kislyak, who has held his position since 2008.\n\"I\u2019ve been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years. No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador. Ever. Ambassadors call members of Foreign (Relations Committee),\" she tweeted March 2.\nI've been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years.No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador. Ever. Ambassadors call members of Foreign Rel Com.\u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) March 2, 2017\n\nBut McCaskill\u2019s own earlier tweets show that that\u2019s not the case. She has communicated with the Russian ambassador, at least twice, to discuss policy matters.\n\"Off to meeting w/Russian Ambassador. Upset about the arbitrary/cruel decision to end all US adoptions, even those in process,\" she tweeted on Jan. 30, 2013.\nOff to meeting w/Russian Ambassador. Upset about the arbitrary/cruel decision to end all US adoptions,even those in process.\u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) January 30, 2013\n\nThe Atlantic has a picture of that very meeting, showing McCaskill (and a few other senators) sitting across the table from Kislyak.\nAnd in April 2015, she tweeted: \"Today calls with British, Russian, and German Ambassadors re: Iran deal. #doingmyhomework.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcCaskill spokeswoman Sarah Feldman said McCaskill\u2019s interactions with Kislyak were materially different than Sessions\u2019. Sessions met with Kislyak one-on-one around the same time Russian actors are believed to have been meddling in the election. McCaskill, on the other hand, met him in a group setting to discuss adoption policy and in a brief phone call about the Iran nuclear deal, Feldman said.\nA few hours after tweeting that she never met with the Russian ambassador, McCaskill published two clarifications, downplaying the significance of the two interactions she had with Kislyak.\nAgain, As senior member of Armed Serv, never received call or request from Russian Amb for meeting. Never met one on one w/him.\u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) March 2, 2017\n\n4 years ago went to meeting of many Senators about international adoptions. Russian Amb also attended.\u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) March 2, 2017\n\nShe also told CNN that Twitter\u2019s 140-character limit prevented her from initially saying she never received a call from the ambassador, as opposed to the call she made to the ambassador about the Iran deal.\nSessions had two interactions with Kislyak in 2016. The first was in an informal group setting at a July 2016 event for diplomats at the Republican National Convention. And the second was a private meeting in Sessions\u2019 former Senate office in September. Who initiated the private meeting and what was discussed is so far unknown.\nIn specifying that she never met with Kislyak on Armed Services Committee business, \"McCaskill seems to have inadvertently supported Sessions\u2019 claims,\" said Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow in security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"She made an unequivocal statement and then had to go back and qualify it by saying she was speaking just about one of her roles and not the other.\"\nOur ruling\nMcCaskill said, \"I\u2019ve been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years. No call or meeting w/ Russian ambassador. Ever.\"\nMcCaskill\u2019s own tweets show that she has had an in-person group meeting, as well as a phone call, with the Russian ambassador in the past four years. A McCaskill spokesperson contrasted these interactions with the private one-on-one meeting Sessions had in his office with the ambassador. However, though the context for McCaskill\u2019s and Sessions\u2019 interactions with Kislyak may be very different, she goes too far in saying she didn\u2019t \"ever\" have that meeting or phone call.\nWe rate McCaskill\u2019s claim False.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    4 6  Politifact Rating: False  \"I\u2019ve been on the Armed Services (Committee) for 10 years.
