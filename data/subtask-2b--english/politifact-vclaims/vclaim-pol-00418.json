It has been on the air since May. \u00a0\nThe Americans for Tax Reform\u2019s ad begins with President Donald Trump saying, \"America will never be a socialist country.\"\nIt then quickly pivots to take aim at the administration.\n\"You're right, Mr. President,\" the ad continues. \"But the Department of Health and Human Services is considering a plan to adopt socialist price controls from foreign countries.\"\u00a0\nThat led us to wonder if the organization\u2019s take is an accurate description.\nThe ad is referring to an initiative being considered by the administration that would be part of the president\u2019s promise to curb high drug prices. Though not expected to launch until 2020 at the earliest, it\u00a0would test-drive the effectiveness of setting price limits on what the federal government pays for prescription drugs. It would tie some payments in Medicare Part B \u2014 which covers hospital and physician-administered drugs \u2014 to prices charged in other countries, mostly in Europe. The trial would be limited to brand-name medicines that are responsible for a high percentage of Part B spending.\nWe contacted Americans for Tax Reform to find out the basis for this claim. John Kartch, a spokesman, said, \"Price controls themselves are socialist\" and argued that they constitute a \"fundamental building block of state control of the economy.\"\nBut independent experts we spoke to said this characterization, while politically powerful, is misleading.\u00a0\n\"Socialism,\" as defined by Merriam-Webster, involves \"collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods.\" In this case, the label doesn\u2019t accurately reflect distinctions in how different countries handle drug pricing and neglects to consider important context about the American pharmaceutical market.\nThe international pricing index\nHHS is still deciding which countries it might include in its \"international pricing index,\" or IPI. Under consideration are Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nSome of those nations may use strategies that could be termed \"socialist.\" Also on the list, though, are countries that use market-based approaches, experts said.\u00a0\n\"Each of these countries has a complex set of decision points, and they\u2019re not the same,\" said Stacie Dusetzina, associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University.\nIn Germany, for instance, the first year a drug is on the market, the manufacturer can set its own price. After that, an independent board assesses the drug\u2019s added clinical value, which is used to determine what the country\u2019s nonprofit insurance plans \u2013 known as sickness funds \u2013 will pay. That, drug pricing experts said, is hardly \"socialism.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven the \"price control\" phrasing is suspect, some argued.\nThat\u2019s because, while the IPI countries vary in strategy, many do not dictate what a pharmaceutical company charges for a drug, said Rachel Sachs, an associate professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis, who studies drug pricing. Rather, she said, they are simply saying what the national insurance plan will pay.\nSome of the countries in question also maintain private insurance systems beyond the government plan. For instance, in Canada, people have options, depending on the province where they live, of various forms of public and private prescription drug coverage, which differ in generosity. Therefore, what the government pays for a drug doesn\u2019t necessarily dictate arrangements negotiated between drug companies and other insurers.\nPlus, experts said, the advertisement\u2019s framing ignores the role the U.S. government already plays in shaping the pharmaceutical market.\nCurrently, Medicare Part B cannot negotiate lower prices, and it is required to cover drugs that come to market. Drug patents, meanwhile, give manufacturers monopolies over their products for a certain amount of time \u2013 and the power to charge higher prices. Together, that means the government has no bargaining power, while drugmakers can set the prices where they want.\n\"We really need to take a look at our own system, and it\u2019s quite far removed from a free market,\" said Ameet Sarpatwari, an epidemiologist and lawyer at Harvard Medical School, who studies drug-pricing regulations.\nSome argued that incorporating the IPI into Medicare Part B payments might actually inject more, not less, competition into the current payment system.\u00a0The administration has made this argument, too. For instance, when we contacted HHS for comment, a spokeswoman directed us to this speech by Secretary Alex Azar as well as this\u00a0 December blog post, both of which outline how this approach would strengthen the U.S. bargaining position by setting Medicare's rates more in line with those of other nations.\u00a0\nFinally, there\u2019s the issue of whether the United States would actually be \"adopting\" strategies used by other countries. Using their prices as a reference point isn\u2019t the same thing as importing their regulatory system.\nA broader conversation\nThe \"socialist price control\" label is one of a few commonly deployed arguments against efforts to curb drug prices \u2013 one that\u2019s \"effective but misleading,\" Sarpatwari argued.\nOther claims in the advertisement \u2013 that HHS\u2019 proposal would reduce pharmaceutical innovation and limit access to life-saving medical treatments \u2013 are also popular attack lines.\nThere isn\u2019t a good body of research to suggest this would happen. Sachs suggested that, if prices come down, there would likely be some impact on either drug access or innovation. Assessing the magnitude of those changes is difficult at best, though. And, she said, it would be balanced against people who are, under the changed system, newly able to afford treatment.\nThere are other issues, experts noted. One challenge: getting accurate data about what other countries pay for drugs. Another: finding a strategy to force manufacturers to accept the lower price.\nBut those aren\u2019t concerns Americans for Tax Reform chose to emphasize. Given the experimental nature of what the administration is considering, they\u2019re also issues HHS could learn from and address based on how things go, Dusetzina said.\nOur ruling\nThe advertisement in question claims that HHS \"is considering a plan to adopt socialist price controls from foreign countries.\"\u00a0\nHHS is weighing a strategy that would take into account\u00a0prices paid in other countries to set amounts paid by the Medicare program. But the advertisement\u2019s language \u2013 in particular, the phrase \"adopt socialist price controls\" \u2013 is reductive, inaccurate and misleading, experts said. These strategies do not necessarily constitute \"price controls.\" And while some could conceivably be viewed as \"socialist,\" it is inaccurate to suggest all of them are.\nFurthermore, the claim ignores important context about the American drug-pricing market.\nThis claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts, and is in some cases actively misleading.
