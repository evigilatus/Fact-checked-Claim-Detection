The White House, in turn, referred us to the Department of Homeland Security.\u00a0A DHS spokesman provided us with the deportation statistics updated through June 7, 2010, though not all the numbers have been officially released yet. In fiscal year 2008 (which ran from Oct. 1, 2007, through Sept. 30, 2008), there were 369,221 deportations. During fiiscal year 2009 (which ran from Oct. 1, 2008, through Sept. 30, 2009) there were 387,790 deportations.\u00a0That's an increase of 18,569 from one year to the next, a jump of about 5 percent. So, using these numbers, Ramos is correct.\u00a0It's worth mentioning a few caveats however.\u00a0\u2022 The fiscal years do not square precisely with presidential years. Fiscal year 2008 was entirely under Bush, while fiscal year 2009 consisted of four months under Bush and eight under Obama. So using the raw fiscal-year figures doesn't quite prove the Bush-Obama comparison. \u00a0\u2022 It's not clear that Obama policies deserve credit (or blame, depending on your perspective) for any increase in deportations, as Ramos implies. Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesman for the Migration Policy Institute, said that \"deportation numbers have been on a steadily upward trajectory\" since 2002, due to a number of policy changes initially undertaken during the Bush administration. Indeed, between 2002 and 2008, deportations rose by 117 percent. \u00a0\u2022 DHS also provided totals for part of fiscal year 2010 -- the portion from Oct. 1, 2009, through June 7, 2010. That number was 227,163. If you prorate that amount to a full 12 months, you get a full-year total of 330,419 -- which is less than each of the two previous years. However, immigration experts said that deportations are not spaced equally throughout the year, meaning that prorating\u00a0is not necessarily valid. \u00a0In our view,\u00a0these caveats\u00a0add a bit of uncertainty to Ramos' otherwise clear comparison. So we rate his statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14808"}
