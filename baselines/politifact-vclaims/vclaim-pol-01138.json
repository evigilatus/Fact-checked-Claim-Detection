But he did", "text": "As his border wall fight with Democrats continues, President Donald Trump finds himself in the awkward position of having to explain what happened to the idea that Mexico would pay all the costs.\nTrump tried to dance out of the apparent contradiction on the White House lawn Jan. 10, the 20th day of a partial government shutdown.\n\"When during the campaign I would say \u2018Mexico is going to pay for it,\u2019 obviously, I never said this, and I never meant they're going to write out a check,\" Trump told reporters. \"I said they're going to pay for it. They are.\"\nLater on the same day while visiting the border in Texas, Trump offered the same logic: \"When I say Mexico is going to pay for the wall, that's what I said. Mexico is going to pay. I didn't say they're going to write me a check for $20 billion or $10 billion.\"\nWe\u2019ve seen the president try to say he never said something that he very much said before, so we wondered about this case.\nSpoiler: Trump has it wrong.\nWe found several instances over the last few years, and in campaign materials contradicting the president\u2019s statement.\nIn an April 2016 memo, Trump\u2019s campaign outlined the steps he could take to get Mexico to pay for the wall.\n\"It's an easy decision for Mexico: make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year,\" the memo said.\nTrump proposed measures to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, such as cutting off remittances sent from undocumented Mexicans in the U.S. via wire transfers.\nThen, the memo says, if and when the Mexican government protested, they would be told to pay a lump sum \"to the United States to pay for the wall, the Trump Administration will not promulgate the final rule, and the regulation will not go into effect.\" The plan lists a few other methods if that didn\u2019t work, like the trade deficit, canceling Mexican visas or increasing visa fees. (Experts have told us there isn\u2019t a connection between the U.S.-Mexico trade deficit and finding money for a wall.)\nTrump has amended his \"Mexico will pay\" pledge many times, though this is the first day we\u2019ve heard him deny that he once called for a large check.\nThe earliest mention we could find of him pitching a Mexico-funded wall came during a visit to New Hampshire in April 2015 (hat-tip Washington Post). He said he would \"take it out\" of the trade deficit: \"I will take it from out of just a small fraction of the money they\u2019ve been screwing us for over the last number of years.\"\nThen he outlined the lump-sum-in-exchange-for-allowing-remittances idea. As president, he has also thrown out \"reimbursement/other,\" the trade deficit and a \"solar wall\" that would cut down on Mexico\u2019s bill.\nMore recently, including during his border trip, Trump says the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USCMA) trade deal will result in Mexico \"indirectly\" paying for the wall. That argument is also faulty: The deal has not been ratified by each country\u2019s legislature, it lacks new tariffs on Mexican goods coming into the country, and the benefits would go to private businesses.\nWe\u2019ve compiled a number of his mentions here:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

It\u2019s 100 percent \u2026 We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year, the wall is going to cost $10 billion. You\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t make that deal?

We're going to be starting those negotiations relatively soon.

Now he says it will be \"indirect\" through the trade deal (though that\u2019s unsupported).\nBut his rewrite of a famous campaign pitch doesn\u2019t clear.
