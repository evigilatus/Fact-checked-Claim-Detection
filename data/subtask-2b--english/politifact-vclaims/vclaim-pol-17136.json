Kamala Harris of California.\u00a0\nIn an Aug. 12, 2020 email, Wisconsin Trump Victory claimed that by choosing Harris as his running mate, Biden is \"putting Wisconsin\u2019s energy workers on notice.\"\u00a0\nTrump Victory is a political group led jointly by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.\u00a0\nThe email claims that Biden\u2019s selection of Harris is \"a shot across the bow to 100,000 Wisconsinites facing unemployment due to their proposal to eliminate fracking.\"\u00a0\nFracking is a common -- but highly controversial -- technique used to access hard-to-reach oil and gas in rock formations.\u00a0\nDoes Biden really support eliminating fracking entirely? And would the elimination of fracking impact 100,000 Wisconsin jobs?\u00a0\nWhat is fracking, and how is Wisconsin involved?\u00a0\nFracking is short for hydraulic fracturing, a type of drilling that\u2019s used to access oil and natural gas trapped inside rock formations.\u00a0\nUsing drills, several wells can be created a mile or more beneath the surface of the earth, and then a mixture of water, sand and other additives are pumped in at high pressure, creating fissures that are held open by the sand. Those small fissures are what allows the trapped gas or oil to flow out of the rock they were trapped in.\u00a0\nThe practice, which is used to access resources in the eastern, western and southwestern areas of the country, is the reason that America is able to tap into oil reserves beneath the soil,\u00a0 according to the American Petroleum Institute.\u00a0\nAlthough Wisconsin isn\u2019t home to the oil or natural gas that is accessed by fracking, it is home to several sand mines, which produce the specific type of sand needed during the fracking process. Those mines generate jobs of all types, from the industrial workers to truck drivers to even those running the grocery stores in the towns near the mines.\u00a0\nDoes Joe Biden want to ban fracking?\u00a0\nIn its email, Trump Victory points multiple times to the March 15, 2020 Democratic debate, in which Biden faced off against U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, then the lone remaining challenger.\nWhile talking about climate change, Sanders said that he wants to completely eliminate fracking in America to help with the climate change crisis, to which Biden responded that he does, too.\u00a0\n\"Well, I\u2019m not sure your proposal does that,\" Sanders said.\u00a0\n\"No more, no new fracking,\" Biden said.\u00a0\nThat statement was a deviation from Biden\u2019s official position, in which he stated he did not want to outright ban the practice.\u00a0\nFollowing the debate, a Biden campaign representative clarified the position, saying Biden wants a ban only on new fracking activities on federal lands and waters, according to a PolitiFact item from June 2020, and another from July 2020.\u00a0\nFor that reason, PolitiFact has rated claims that Biden wants to halt fracking Mostly False.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the Trump Victory email gets off to a bad start.\nSo what about those jobs?\u00a0\nThe number of actual jobs related to the sand mining industry is actually much smaller than the 100,000 figure listed in the email.\u00a0\nAccording to the Job Center of Wisconsin, part of the state Department of Workforce Development, the number of all jobs in the mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction industry was 3,480 in 2019. Even that is a broader figure than just those tied to fracking specifically.\nBut that number doesn\u2019t include related jobs, like those in transportation, manufacturing, finance, healthcare and various other local businesses that are tied to mining.\u00a0\nTo support that claim, the Trump Victory email links to a 2011 study by the American Petroleum Institute, which cites 103,300 as the number of direct, indirect and induced jobs provided by the oil and gas industry in Wisconsin.\u00a0\nBut a more recent study -- from 2017 -- was available, showing an estimated 98,200 total jobs fueled by the gas and oil industry in the state.\u00a0\nThe study breaks down the number this way:\u00a0\n\n\n35,000 in natural gas and oil\n\n\n29,700 in services\n\n\n10,000 in manufacturing\n\n\n7,900 in wholesale and retail\n\n\n3,300 in transportation and warehousing\n\n\n900 in construction\n\n\n11,400 in other jobs\u00a0\n\n\nStill, those figures are for all oil and gas-related jobs in the state. The number tied to fracking would be smaller, though it\u2019s hard to pinpoint how much smaller. In any case, it\u2019s a vast overstatement to say some 100,000 would face unemployment.\nSo, on this point, Trump Victory uses an outdated report that is offpoint and overshoots the mark.\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\nTrump Victory said that by backing a ban on fracking, Biden would cost 100,000 Wisconsinites their jobs.\u00a0\nBiden does not support an outright fracking ban, though he did speak inaccurately about his stance on the issue in a March 2020 debate.\u00a0\nAs far as the 100,000 jobs, that figure includes a far larger range of jobs than just those related to the fracking industry, taking into account other oil and gas figures.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17136"}
