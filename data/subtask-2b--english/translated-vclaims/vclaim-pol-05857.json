We will set aside the narrower issue of medical leave and focus on family leave. A speaker on behalf of Sanders referred to data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which examined paid maternity leave for some 34 OECD countries - developed countries - and seven additional European Union countries. On average, mothers in all OECD countries are entitled to 17 weeks of paid maternity leave. However, the United States is the only country that does not provide any legal entitlement to paid leave on a national basis. Another widely respected source of data on this subject is the International Labour Organization (ILO), a United Nations agency. In 2014, out of 170 countries, all but two provided cash benefits to women during maternity leave: the United States and Papua New Guinea. In the United States, under the Federal Family Medical Leave Act, employers with 50 or more employees must allow parents an annual leave of 12 weeks of protected work to care for newborns or a family member with a serious health condition. While the Act protects their functions, in most cases leave is unpaid. Some employers choose to take paid leave. Some 13 per cent of workers received some type of paid family leave in 2014, according to the Office of Labour Statistics. This is a very low rate compared to the rest of the developed world. Of the 41 other advanced economies, the United States also imposes the shortest period of unpaid leave - 12 weeks. In the meantime, both the United Kingdom and Australia allow a full year of leave (though not all are paid). However, some countries exclude certain categories of workers, such as those in temporary or part-time employment or working on farms, as domestic servants, police, armed forces or civil servants. In some cases, such as domestic workers, laws do not explicitly clarify whether or not leave policies apply, while the explicit legal exclusion of agricultural workers has been identified in at least 27 countries. ILO recommends that countries provide these benefits: women should receive at least 14 weeks of leave; they should be paid at least two thirds of their previous income; and the State should pay the benefit almost entirely through public funds or social security. The United States is the only developed country that does not meet any of the criteria. Why does the United States fail to verify the distinctive facts mentioned by Jennifer Boenko on January 18, 2021 in the Committee &apos; s debate? \u2022 28 January 2021: The explanation of the reasons why the United States is lagging behind other countries is rooted in historical and political factors. We interviewed Vicky Chapo, Vice-President of the National Partnership for Women and the Family, one of several organizations advocating for more family leave for both women and men. The following chart of the partnership shows the timetable for how other countries have established paid leave: the United States has a weaker social welfare tradition compared to other countries such as Germany. There was a payment for family leave during times of war in Europe, when men went to war and women were required in the labour force. Although women went to work in the United States during the Second World War, they generally returned home at the end of the war. \"We missed this historic window and didn't catch it,\" said Shabu. In some other countries, trade unions have played a stronger role in setting leave policies. The experts said that the political authority of the trade lobby had helped to prevent changes to the Family Leave Act. \"The absence of paid leave, paid leave and national health insurance reflects a long history of a business-dominated political economy,\" said Ruth Milkman, a sociologist at New York City University. There has been little legislative action to change this policy here. In March, Ms. Christine Gilbert, from D-NY, introduced the Family Leave and Medical Insurance Act to allow 60 eligible days of care per year, but she did not get a vote. Sanders is one of 19 sponsors, all democratic. (Sanders is independent in the Senate but running for president as a democracy.) Our sentence (Sanders) said \"every other major country\" has paid family leave. Two comprehensive studies of Sanders &apos; multi-state opinion support the fact that the United States is an extraordinary country when it comes to paid family leave. One study concluded that the United States was the only country that did not provide any legal entitlement to paid leave on a national basis. A separate study of a larger number of countries found that only the United States and Papua New Guinea did not provide cash benefits to women during maternity leave. The only warning here is that family leave is not a public good in some countries, because of the exclusions faced by some workers. We're mostly assessing this claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05857"}
