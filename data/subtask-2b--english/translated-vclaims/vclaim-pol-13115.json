But it is up to the Governor and the General Assembly to see how this is done and how the burden of balance should be shared. (Joff) John Kasesh took the lead in that process with what he called the \"post budget,\" an expenditure scheme that includes reductions for local governments, school districts and government agencies to close the budget deficit of $800 billion. Casi\u0107 disclosed his spending plan on March 15, 2011. In a public forum at the Center for Thoughts in Playhouse Square, Sean State, Nina Turner said she feared that the Governor would \"balance the budget on the back of the staff\" and weaken the Government's ability to deliver services. When \"the governor announced his \"work budget, 99 people from the tax department were left the next day,\" she said. Polyte Fact Ohio decided to check this out. On March 16, the state said that it would close seven regional centres for taxpayers on June 30 - the end of the fiscal year - resulting in the loss of approximately 100 jobs. The Commissioner of Taxes, Joe Tetsa, sent e-mail notifications to staff members at the regional centres for taxpayers &apos; services in Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dayton, Toledo, Yongstown and Zenesville. The Columbus Center will remain open. The workers at Cleveland's office told the regular dealer that the closures were a mistake that would hurt taxpayers and damage tax revenues. But the tax department said that revenue is about half of the $7 million that the state will provide. Testa said the offices have only a fraction of the calls and traffic she made once. We asked the governor's office about job cuts. \"It's in the context of what we want to do with the budget as a whole,\" said Rob Nichols. We inherited an $8 billion budget hole. We had the seventh highest tax in the nation last year.\" The closure of service centres is in line with the Governor &apos; s promise during his campaign: to reduce the state government and make it more efficient. \"This budget provides an expenditure scheme that Ohio taxpayers can finally afford,\" Nichols said. \"We cannot continue to do what we do and expect success in this case.\" Whether the closure of tax service centres and the demobilization of workers is a good idea is someone else &apos; s question of the answer. But Cassich does it. This is considered Turner &apos; s statement to be true of the O-Meter truth. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13115"}
