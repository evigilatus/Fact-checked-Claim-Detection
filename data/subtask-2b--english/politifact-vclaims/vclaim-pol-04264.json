(Trump has cited an ongoing audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason he isn\u2019t releasing the returns. Hillary Clinton has released her tax returns from 2000 to 2015.)\nTrump has a point that his financial disclosure form is extensive. Its 92 pages are crammed with small print detailing assets, income sources and positions held. (We were able to track his investments in the stock market, for instance.) By comparison, Mitt Romney -- the 2012 Republican nominee who was a businessman with a complex set of holdings -- filed a 47-page disclosure form, not counting amendments and updates.\nWe have previously looked at the difference between the financial disclosure form, which is required of presidential candidates under federal law, and tax returns, which have been released since 1980 by tradition rather than legal requirement.\nWe found little evidence to support Trump\u2019s argument that the financial disclosure allows observers to \"learn more\" than they would from a tax form.\n\"It is true that Trump's businesses have received a lot of attention, but without the release of Trump's tax returns, we don't know a lot about his personal financial situation,\" Lawrence White, an economist at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, told us earlier this month.\nThe two most obvious pieces of the puzzle missing without Trump\u2019s tax returns are the effective rate of tax he pays on his income, and details about his charitable giving.\nDepending on what figures appear on his tax forms, Trump could face political criticism. Paying a low tax rate could be politically embarrassing. And Trump has faced questions about his past charitable giving. (For details, see the ongoing coverage by reporter David Farenthold of the Washington Post.)\nTax returns also can give a clearer picture of the candidate\u2019s liquid assets. \"Trump can inflate his image of being rich on the financial disclosure forms, but you can get a better sense of how much he\u2019s actually making from his tax returns,\" said former Romney aide Ryan Williams, who did not support Trump during the GOP primary and now says he\u2019s officially undecided on the presidential race.\nOther nuggets can be gleaned from tax forms as well, such as what specific mix of taxes the candidate paid.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Because of this, \"we saw that the majority of his income was taxed at low rates.\"\nTrump wouldn\u2019t necessarily qualify for the carried-interest tax, but as a someone in the real-estate business, he would have access to specialized tax breaks of his own, Sloan said.\nThere is a \"provision in tax law that allows people who spend at least half their working time as real-estate or development professionals to get depreciation deductions not available to other investors,\" he said. \"That\u2019s a huge loophole, and it\u2019s gotten nothing like the attention that carried interest has gotten.\"\nThe fact that Trump has not run for office before or served in government makes the scrutiny of his business dealings especially important for those who care about transparency. Yet the fact that he runs a privately held company makes it hard for outsiders to get a handle on his personal finances as long as no public tax filing is available, experts said.\n\"Because Trump\u2019s business dealings are varied and extensive, there is a lot to look at, but the quality of information is often poor, so reporters spend a lot of time looking at information insufficient to draw accurate conclusions,\" said Dennis Caplan, an associate professor of accounting at the University at Albany.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"You will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the Federal Elections\" to see the financial disclosure form than by looking at his returns.\nAn observer would find valuable information about Trump\u2019s personal financial holdings from his extensive (and legally required) financial-disclosure form. However, experts consider that a red herring.\nUnlike all presidential nominees since 1980, Trump has not released his tax returns, which experts say would offer valuable details on his effective tax rate, the types of taxes he paid, and how much he gave to charity, as well as a more detailed picture of his income-producing assets.\nTrump\u2019s statement was, and is, inaccurate. We rate it False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/314c9496-1c70-41c2-ac55-0b36b9e7cc4d", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04264"}
