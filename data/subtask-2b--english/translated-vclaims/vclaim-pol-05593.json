Rubio said, \"He speaks harshly about some of these issues.\" \"For example, he was going to ISIL's carpet bomb. However, the only budget for which I voted on time in the Senate is that which lowers defence spending more than Barack Obama proposes to do. Rubio tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the army, while Cruz tried to appeal to the Hawks as well as the liberals, who usually preferred less defensive spending. We decided to verify Rubio's claim that Cruz voted in favour of a budget that was cut by more than the Democratic President. Cruz &apos; s vote on the budget proposal submitted by Rand Paul refers to the Rubio &apos; s 2013 Cruz voting campaign in favour of the US budget proposal, Sun Rand Paul R-Ky, who is also running for President. Cruz was one of only 18 senators, all Republicans, to vote in favour of Paul's amendment. Rubio voted against him. The procedure failed. Paul &apos; s 2013 proposal emerged after the large-scale budget cuts, known as &quot; secluded &quot;, came into effect. The embargo has significantly reduced non-war defence spending over the next decade. The Rubio campaign referred to Paul's statement in his budget proposal on the reduction of military spending: \"This budget proposal not only reduces military spending, but provides guidance for the reorganization of the army for the twenty-first century.\" \"Seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military compound, including its global footprint to one more in line with containment policy.\" Under Paul &apos; s proposal, defence allocations would have risen from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2013. Meanwhile, the Congressional Non-Party Budget Office projected $588 billion in defence funds in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. This means that Paul actually increased defence spending from year to year, although he did not keep pace with the estimated expectations of maintaining current defence levels. Was Paul's suggestion \"sure \" to defend him? Why does Rubio refer to Paul's budget as \"cut\" if defense spending will rise? \"We take the budget document in its statement that it reduces defence spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the army,\" said Rubio, Senior Chancellor Joe Pounder. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, experts questioned whether Rubio could call Paul's proposal \"cuts.\" \"Paul's defence budget was higher than the budget ceiling set out in the Budget Control Act, so in this regard it was an increase (and the President's budget was a larger increase), \" said Todd Harrison, Defense Budget Expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \"But Paul's defense budget was less than the other Republicans were proposing and what the President was proposing, Harrison said that Paul &apos; s defence proposal for 2013 was much lower than Obama &apos; s request at that time and now alike. Christopher Bribel, at the Liberal Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul's budget \"cut.\" \"As typical in Washington-Speaker, less than expected is often cast as pieces,\" he said. \"This is misleading.\" The spokesman for Cruz, Brian Phillips, made a similar argument. \"So Rubio seems to be involved in the time-known Washington cartel tactic of budget deception and suggests that lowering the rate of increase is equal to \"stop\" while, in fact, Obama and Paul's budgets spend more on defense every year,\" Philips said. \"The truth is, in support of Paul's budget, Cruz did not support the reduction of defence spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.\" Benjamin Friedman, a defence expert in Cato, referred to Cruz's vote in March in favour of the Rubio amendment to strengthen defence spending over two years rather than Paul's amendment, which would have strengthened it with equations. Friedman said: \"This was a budget, so it doesn't make Rubio wrong, but it undermines a bigger point for him.\" Our ruling, Rubio, said that the only budget on which Cruz voted in time in the Senate was the one that lowers defence spending more than Barack Obama proposes to do. Rubio was referring to Cruz &apos; s vote in favour of Paul &apos; s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul's plan when he called it \"cut.\" That proposal included an increase in defence spending every year from 2014 to a decade, although it did not keep pace with the estimated growth prospects. However, there is a nucleus of truth here in that Paul's defence proposal was below Obama's request. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05593"}
