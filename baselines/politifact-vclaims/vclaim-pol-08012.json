Very rare", "text": "On Thursday\u2019s Morning Joe, host Joe Scarborough dropped a bit of presidential trivia that we hadn\u2019t heard before.\nDuring a discussion about the inability of recent American presidents to accomplish major political achievements, Scarborough said that before \"our last three presidents, you have to go back to the 1800s, early 1800s, to find three presidents in a row being consecutively re-elected.\"\nThe first part of Scarborough\u2019s statement is true -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all won consecutive presidential terms -- but we wondered just how rare the feat is.\nVery rare, it turns out.\nIn fact, it\u2019s only happened once before -- from 1800-24, when Thomas Jefferson, James Madision and James Monroe were each elected to consecutive terms. (They were the third, fourth and fifth presidents.)\nWe\u2019ve only come close one other time, but deaths and resignations interrupted that:\n\u2022 President Harry Truman served more than seven years in office, having finished President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s fourth term and having been elected on his own once, in 1948 (1945-52).\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 President Dwight Eisenhower served two full terms (1953-60).\n\u2022 President John F. Kennedy was assassinated during his first term. President Lyndon B. Johnson completed Kennedy\u2019s term and was elected to his own four-year term in 1964 (1961-68).\n\u2022 President Richard Nixon was elected president in 1968 and re-elected in 1972 before resigning in 1974 (1969-74).\nOur ruling\nScarborough said that before \"our last three presidents, you have to go back to the 1800s, early 1800s to find three presidents in a row being consecutively re-elected.\"\nHe\u2019s right. The last -- and only -- presidents before Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama to be re-elected back-to-back were Jefferson, Madison and Monroe in the early 1800s.\nWe rate Scarborough\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08012"}
