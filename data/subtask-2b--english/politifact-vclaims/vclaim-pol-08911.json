Rick Scott loves them so much that the majority don\u2019t have to bother paying business taxes, he told a conservative crowd at the Americans for Prosperity Foundation conference in Orlando.\nScott told the crowd that during his tenure the state has cut taxes five times (we noticed he pared down his claim quite a bit from earlier this summer when he said he cut taxes 24 times.)\n\"We cut property taxes for homeowners and businesses. We cut business taxes so today 70 percent of our businesses don't pay a business tax. And we got rid of a sales tax on machinery and equipment so we will have more manufacturing jobs.\"\nDo nearly three-quarters of Florida businesses not pay a business tax?\nCorporate income tax exemptions grew under Scott \nPolitiFact Florida has been tracking Scott\u2019s promise to eliminate the corporate income tax rate over seven years. The tax is paid as a percentage of the incomes of Florida businesses.\nScott initially wanted the Legislature to reduce the corporate tax rate, but that didn\u2019t work out. So he took a different route: relieving businesses of paying the tax by upping the amount of income exempt from the tax.\nIn his first year, Scott lobbied to exempt the first $25,000 worth of taxable income, up from $5,000. In 2012, he got the Legislature to raise the exemption to $50,000. Scott wanted to then raise the exemption to $75,000 but the Legislature didn\u2019t go along with it in 2013.\nWe turned to Florida Department of Revenue data to show what percentage of businesses don\u2019t pay corporate income taxes.\nThere were 49,562 corporations in total and 38,060 would have been exempt from the tax -- or about 76.8 percent in 2011. The tax exemption for those businesses adds up to $12.6 million.\nThat left 11,502 businesses that paid about $166 billion in corporate taxes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese numbers represent the 2011 tax year, filed in 2012. The exemption has increased since then, so the number of exempt corporations may be slightly different.\nWe should note that many of these small businesses didn\u2019t have to pay the corporate income tax before Scott\u2019s tenure, too. Department of Revenue data shows of the 38,060 exempt businesses, about half earned less than $5,000 and therefore were exempt before Scott took office.\nWe interviewed two experts about Scott\u2019s claim: Kurt Wenner of Florida TaxWatch and Sam Staley, managing director of Florida State University\u2019s DeVoe L. Moore Center, which aims to increase public understanding about the role of government in a market economy.\nBoth Wenner and Staley pointed out that large businesses have always paid the lion\u2019s share of the corporate taxes -- and continue to do so after Scott\u2019s exemptions. (The large businesses get that exemption, too, but for them it means they don\u2019t pay the tax on a small slice of their income.)\n\"Small businesses don\u2019t contribute that much to overall revenue,\" Staley said. Therefore, the state is \"not losing that much by exempting them.\"\nHowever, even small businesses could be paying several other taxes or fees, such as property or sales taxes or in some cases, licensing fees.\nTo assess a state\u2019s business climate, \"you have to look at an entire portfolio of taxes and regulations,\" Staley said.\n\"Even if they don\u2019t have to pay state corporate income tax, it might not be enough to compensate added costs of permitting at the local and county level,\" Staley said.\nWenner said that anytime the state can reduce taxes it will increase Florida\u2019s attractiveness for businesses. However, \"Florida\u2019s corporate income taxes have never really been that high.\"\nOur ruling\nScott said \"70 percent of our businesses don't pay a business tax.\" His general point was that during his tenure, he\u2019s been cutting all sorts of taxes.\nState data for 2011 taxes shows that 76.8 percent of businesses don\u2019t pay the corporate income tax due to the exemption. Scott is including some very small businesses here in his calculation and omitting that many of them were exempt from paying this tax before he took office.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08911"}
