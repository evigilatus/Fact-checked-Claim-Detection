The plasma contains a specific antibody that helps the immune system fight the virus. The idea is to help give seriously ill patients an immune-system boost so they can better fight off the virus.\nCOVID-19 convalescent plasma therapy is considered as an investigational product by the Food and Drug Administration.\u00a0\nDr. Jamie N. Nadler, the medical director of quality and patient safety for Buffalo General Medical Center and Gates Vascular Institute in upstate New York, recently told the Buffalo News that there\u2019s some evidence that it could be an effective way to treat COVID-19.\u00a0\n\"There have been small trials and small attempts around the world that seem to have had some degree of success,\" Nadler said. \"So it's worth trying as long as it's done correctly.\"\nNadler is right: We found two studies of convalescent plasma therapy that have shown\u00a0 at least initial promise with COVID-19 patients, although experts caution that more investigation is needed. (Nadler did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)\nA brief history of convalescent plasma therapy\nConvalescent plasma therapy has a long history. It was developed by Paul Ehrlich and Emil von Behring for treatment of diphtheria, a finding that was recognized in 1901 with the first Nobel Prize for medicine, epidemiologist Dr. Ian Lipkin, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, told CNBC.\u00a0\nMore recently, it was used against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, an infection with similarities to COVID-19 that emerged in Asia in the early 2000s.\u00a0\nIn one study in Hong Kong during a SARS outbreak, a hospital treated 80 patients with convalescent plasma. Among the treated patients, the study showed a higher discharge rate prior to day 14 of the illness: 58.3% became well enough to be discharged, compared with 15.6% of those who did not receive the treatment.\nHowever, patients suffering from Ebola \u2014 a different kind of virus in the filovirus family \u2014 did not experience positive results from convalescent plasma treatment.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA study from China in the Journal of the American Medical Association\nA Chinese study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, described a study treating five critically ill COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma. All five patients, ranging from 36 to 65 years old, began the study while on ventilators.\u00a0\nFollowing the transfusion, the authors reported, four of the five patients\u2019 body temperatures normalized within three days. Other key metrics, including viral loads, improved within 12 days.\nThe hospital discharged three of the five patients. The remaining two were in stable condition 37 days after the transfusion.\u00a0\nThe authors concluded that this represented an \"improvement,\" but cautioned that the limited sample size and study design precluded \"a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment.\"\nA pre-publication study from China that has been posted online\nAnother Chinese study found similar results. It has not yet been peer reviewed but has been published online.\u00a0\nIn the study, 10 patients with severe cases received a dose of convalescent plasma. Within three days, the viral load became undetectable in seven patients, with no adverse effects. In addition, fever, cough, shortness of breath and chest pain disappeared or significantly improved in all 10 patients within one to three days of the transfusion.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe authors concluded that the therapy was \"well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes\" in severe COVID-19 cases. However, they added, questions on the optimal dose and timing need further investigation.\n\"Just as COVID-19 has taken us back to classic methods for outbreak containment like isolation, through a novel use we are rediscovering the lifesaving potential of a classic strategy like plasma therapy,\" Lipkin said.\u00a0\nExperts say that convalescent plasma therapy is promising, but much more work is needed.\n\"There have not been any breakthroughs recently,\" said Jessica Donington, a professor of surgery at the University of Chicago and chief of the thoracic surgery section. But, she added, \"it all has been going on very quickly,\" with larger clinical trials in the works.\nOur ruling\nNadler said that \"there have been small trials and small attempts around the world\" to test convalescent plasma therapy for coronavirus patients, and they \"seem to have had some degree of success.\"\nWe found two Chinese studies that have found initial success, though more research is needed to confirm these results more broadly.
