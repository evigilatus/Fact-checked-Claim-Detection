Scott Walker alleges that former state Commerce Secretary Mary Burke \"wasted\" nearly $25 million in the so-far failed attempt to attract a major Abbott Laboratories expansion in Wisconsin.\nBut Burke, Walker\u2019s main Democratic challenger in the 2014 governor\u2019s race, says her agency built tough failsafes into the deal.\n\"Everyone from local officials to the local chamber of commerce to Walker's own administration agrees that this was and is a good deal from an economic development standpoint,\" Burke\u2019s campaign said on July 9, 2014.\n\"The grant,\" she continued, \"contained strong protections for taxpayers if job creation goals were not met or infrastructure was not developed for economic development.\"\nOn July 31, 2014, we rated Walker\u2019s $25 million claim False, noting that Walker double-counted the $12.3 million cost of the deal.\nIn the jousting over the strength or weakness of the deal\u2019s protections, the two campaigns cite the same sections of the complicated Abbott aid agreement as evidence for their side\u2019s view.\nLet\u2019s start there.\nThe 2006 deal passed $12.5 million in federal block grant funds through the Village of Pleasant Prairie and the Kenosha Area Business Alliance to purchase 40 acres of land to hold for Abbott, which already had amassed 500 acres for a potential Kenosha County corporate campus.\nIf the pharmaceutical giant\u2019s Wisconsin expansion proceeds, Abbott could buy the land for $1.\nState officials wanted a so-called \"clawback\" provision that would require Abbott to pay back the money if the company did not create at least 2,400 jobs, but Abbott declined to sign one, according to Michael Pollocoff, Pleasant Prairie\u2019s administrator.\nBurke and then-Gov. Jim Doyle pushed forward without such a provision.\nIt\u2019s common for Commerce Department grants and loans to businesses to be tied to performance measures mandating partial or full return of such aid if jobs are not added, according to a 2006 state audit. Often the state\u2019s contracts call for personal loan guarantees and financial penalties in case of non-repayment.\nSuch conditions vary depending on the situation, but in the Abbott case, the state\u2019s approach meant that the party the state was hoping to come through with jobs was not directly on the hook. It was subject only to indirect financial pressure to do so -- the loss of a \"free\" piece of land.\nLand sale envisioned\nThe plan, however, did not leave the state without any recourse.\nUnder the agreement, the business alliance, known as KABA, is responsible for returning some funds to the state if the Abbott jobs don\u2019t emerge by 2016.\nThat refund, though, was tied to what the 40-acre property could bring in a sale, and the plan came with some terms that weakened the possibility the full amount could be recovered.\nAt this point, the land\u2019s assessed value is about 55 percent of what KABA paid for it -- nearly $5 million lower than the $12.3 million purchase price (a pre-recession price paid to a truck stop developer who had leverage in the negotiation.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo at least as things stand now, far less than the full $12.3 million seems recoverable.\nThe deal called for KABA and Pleasant Prairie to recoup their own costs related to holding and preparing the Abbott site for development. Those costs are nearly $4 million, said Pollocoff.\nSo if the state were to immediately sell the property, the leftover funds might total only $2 million to $3 million.\nThere\u2019s nothing in the deal that would block the state from holding the land in hopes that its value in a busy corporate corridor would increase.\n\"This is a unique piece of collateral with significant growth potential,\" Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki argued in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, \"40 acres of land along a busy highway, next to up-and-coming businesses like Amazon and Uline.\"\nTodd Battle, president of the KABA group, didn\u2019t respond to interview requests for this story, but in 2006 he described the land as \"some of the most valuable real estate along the (Interstate 94) corridor.\"\nBut there\u2019s one more, major point here.\nBecause federal officials in 2013 declared the deal ineligible for federal money in the first place, and the promise of jobs was so vague, \u00a0the state is being forced -- now -- to pay back HUD from state tax revenue. Federal officials say the project was overly speculative and has not paid off over eight years.\nThat\u2019s something no one contemplated as a possibility, and one that a stronger and more properly drawn deal would have prevented as a matter of course.\nMike Huebsch, state Department of Administration secretary and a top member of the Walker administration, is not impressed by predictions of money coming back to the state.\n\"The deal was constructed in a way that put us at a disadvantage every step of the way,\" he told us. \"The state\u2019s position was not strong.\"\nWe sought an outsider\u2019s opinion and turned to Ronald D Berkebile. He\u2019s a founder of Dominion Scientific Analytics, a financial analyst with the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia, and an author of articles on the financial impact of economic development projects.\nBerkebile didn\u2019t fault the general structure of the deal, and said there\u2019s an element of hindsight in the criticisms.\nIf the economy had not soured, Abbott might have met the agreement\u2019s expectations, and \"no one would have asked about this situation,\" he said. \"The economy (in 2006) likely supported the promise of a large pharmaceutical company developing the land. A promise of this nature is very enticing.\"\nBut he said more performance milestones should have been built in to protect the investment, and there should have been better monitoring to avoid violating state and federal rules.\nIf Abbott couldn\u2019t produce by a date certain, \"then KABA should have had the ability to exercise alternative property rights to develop the land in accordance with (block grant) standards,\" he said.\nOur rating\nBurke\u2019s campaign said the $12.5 million incentive deal she approved for Abbott Laboratories contained \"strong protections for taxpayers if job creation goals were not met.\"\nWhile the land provides some collateral, the deal\u2019s protections and structure fell short of those used in many such cases, leaving the state vulnerable to picking up some or most of the pieces if Abbott doesn\u2019t deliver.\nAnd it\u2019s hard to reconcile how \"strong protections\" could have allowed the scenario now unfolding in which the state is paying cash to HUD.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07501"}
