One word keeps coming up.\n\"Bernie is a Communist who admires Communist dictators and he should never be President of the United States of America,\" Walker tweeted on Feb. 24, 2020.\nThe label is hardly a first for Sanders.\u00a0\nWalker also made the claim in a column and several earlier tweets, one of which invoked Sanders\u2019 oft-cited Soviet Union honeymoon. President Donald Trump said the same in a Feb. 2, 2020, interview before the Super Bowl. And former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg invoked communism while criticizing Sanders\u2019 monetary policy at the Feb. 19, 2020, Democratic primary debate.\nSeems like it\u2019s time to separate fact from rhetoric.\nBased on Sanders\u2019 political views, is he a communist?\nDefining political ideologies\nWhen we asked Walker for evidence of his claim, a spokesman cited a laundry list of past actions, including Sanders praising leaders of communist governments, visiting the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and traveling to several communist countries.\nFor the record, PolitiFact National rated a claim that Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union Mostly True in 2015 . It wasn\u2019t exactly a traditional honeymoon, but Sanders and his wife left the day after their wedding to be part of a 12-person delegation for a sister city program between Burlington, Vt. \u2014 where Sanders was mayor \u2014 and the city of Yaroslavl.\nFidel Castro was a diabolical dictator who Bernie Sanders praised because he had a great reading program.

And for the record, he has said he is not a communist, in responding to Trump\u2019s pre-Super Bowl assertion.\nExperts point to several clear dividing lines between Sanders\u2019 philosophy and communism \u2014 while unanimously calling Walker\u2019s label an exaggeration.\nEncyclopedia Britannica defines communism as a form of socialism, noting that Karl Marx and others in the 19th Century used the terms interchangeably.\nBut the ideologies have diverged since, said Joshua Tucker, professor of politics at New York University.\nSocialism, as it plays out today in some European countries, is generally associated with a large social welfare state, including free healthcare and education, generous pensions and general \"cradle to grave\" security.\nCommunism on the other hand typically involves a one-party government that owns all property and controls the means of production. In other words, the government exerts a great deal of control over both economic and individual behavior.\n\"(Under communist ideology) the state would own all the sort of large level companies \u2013 airports, factories, hospitals, all these sorts of things, and this is not what Sanders is talking about at all,\" Tucker said. \"He does want to see the state playing more of a role in reducing inequality in society, and one of the ways you do that is providing more social welfare benefits.\"\nThe means of reaching the desired outcome is also a key split between modern democratic socialism and communism, said Russell Muirhead, a professor of political science at Dartmouth College.\n\"Democratic socialists are committed in the first case to persuading citizens of their particular policies and views, and if they can\u2019t persuade, they refuse to try to implement those policies. Democracy comes first,\" he said in an email. \"Communists are so sure that they have the whole truth that they\u2019re willing to impose their policies even if they can\u2019t persuade other people, even if it requires a sustained and brutal application of violence. That\u2019s why we associate communism with tyranny.\"\nLowell Barrington, associate professor of political science at Marquette University, said Sanders has made himself \"vulnerable\" to attacks like Walker\u2019s because he has spoken positively of communist leaders like Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro. But he echoed others in saying Sanders\u2019 proposals are more in line with the northern European brand of socialism than the authoritarian communist regimes seen in the Soviet Union, Cuba and the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSaid Tucker: \"The bottom line is, the way we classically think about communism, there\u2019s no way you can call what Bernie Sanders is pushing for \u2026 communism. That\u2019s scare-mongering.\"\nOur ruling\nWalker says without qualification that Sanders \"is a communist.\"\nHe offers as evidence Sanders\u2019 past visits to communist countries and statements praising communist leaders.\u00a0\nBut experts detail clear differences between Sanders\u2019 democratic socialism \u2014 which focuses on democratically achieved expansion of social welfare programs \u2014 and any commonly accepted definition of communism. Sanders isn\u2019t pushing for authoritarian rule, government ownership of all private property or an end to capitalism.\nWe rate Walker\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18051"}
