All the candidates made questionable statements - looking at some of the facts from the night - including Aurourke, who was asked to respond to a comment on gun violence from Montana Gove. Steve Bullock. Bullock said that Washington, D.C., was \"broken by dark money\" and the political influence of RA and Coach industries, making it difficult for legislators to deal with issues such as gun safety. \"This is the way we're actually going to make a change in this, Don, is to change this system,\" said Bullock, \"And most of the things people talk about at this point we won't fix until we kick the dark money.\" Lemon asked O'Rourke to respond to Pollock's point. \"How can we make it clear that we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country because of armed violence, a figure that no other country is approaching, that we know what all the solutions are, yet nothing has changed?\" He said O'Rourke. \"Because in this country, money buys leverage, access and, increasingly, results.\" We assumed that O'Rourke was talking about the number of gun deaths in the United States last year, a figure supported by federal data. But is Aurourke right that no other country is approaching the number of deaths due to gun violence in the United States? We took a look. Data from the CDC indicate the death of 40,000 Aurourke spokesman Chris Evans, who referred to two studies on firearms-related deaths around the world and a bunch of media articles discussing the results in support of the Democrats' claim. \"As we have visited communities throughout the country, we have consistently heard about the fact that armed violence is one of the major concerns in the United States, where no other developed country is approaching the death toll of guns,\" Evans said. In 2017, there were 39,773 deaths from firearms in the United States (12.2 deaths per 100,000 population), according to information from Evans &apos; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of these deaths, 60 per cent were recorded as suicides and 36.6 per cent as homicides, according to the CDC. The other 3.4% were designated as unintentional or unspecified or as the result of \"legal intervention/war.\" But how do you compare these figures to other countries? Evans referred to a study published in 2016 in the American Journal of Medicine that measured violent mortality rates in the United States compared to other high-income countries, using mortality data from 2010. Researchers compared the figures from the United States to 26 other countries classified by the World Bank as \"high-income,\" which were also members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2010 - with the exception of Iceland and Luxembourg \"for very few inhabitants.\" The study focused on violent death in general, but also looked at firearms deaths and found that \"Americans are 10 times more likely to die as a result of a firearm than residents of these other high-income countries.\" The same researchers conducted an updated study using data from 2015 and reached a similar conclusion that when it comes to firearms deaths, \"no other high-income country compares with the United States.\" :: Irene Greenstein, a professor at the University of San Francisco who co-authored the two studies, said that she had compared the United States with other high-income countries to make a comparison between \"dicks to apples.\" On January 11, 2021, Facebook was published in Nancy Belusi's newspaper, no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman on January 12, 2021, \"The less developed countries are not similar to the United States in many ways and will not normally be used as a comparison of other health indicators,\" she said. \"What Aurourke said is accurate for high-income countries. We are completely excluded from our counterpart countries.\" However, the Aur\u00fcrk statement in the debate was not limited to other high-income countries. He said that \"no other country even approaches\" the number of deaths from weapon violence in the United States. The second study cited by Evans provides a broader view of global trends. The study, carried out by researchers at the Institute of Health Measurement and Assessment at the University of Washington, D.C., dealt with firearms deaths worldwide from 1990 to 2016. In 2016, the last year of the study, there were an estimated 251,000 firearms deaths worldwide. The study found that more than half of these deaths were recorded in six countries: the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Guatemala. Given the number of deaths from firearms injuries in each of these countries in 2016, according to the study, in order of the total number of deaths: the study revealed that most of the deaths from firearms injuries in Brazil in 2016 were homicides. In the United States, just under 40 per cent of these deaths were homicides; the majority were suicides. \"Beto doesn't think that the United States of America should take any consolation in being the second behind Brazil in that study one when it comes to the number of dead guns each year,\" said Evans, when he asked about the results in the study. \"We should not see any more gun deaths in our country each year from the less significantly developed countries.\" The same study had shown that the number of gun deaths in the United States was higher than in places such as Colombia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Honduras, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Libya and Syria. But the raw number of deaths is only part of the equation. There were 19 countries and territories in the United States where firearms deaths per capita were higher than in the United States in 2016, or in the same amount, according to the analysis of the study by PBS Newshor. Evans referred to the news coverage of the study, including an article from NPR that said: \"The level of firearms violence in the United States is quite higher than in other rich countries.\" However, the same article pointed out that gun violence was a bigger issue elsewhere. \"Sure, there are a good number of countries where armed violence is a much larger problem than it is in the United States - especially in Central America and the Caribbean,\" she says. \"The Fox article that Evans mentioned said that the United States \"has many more gun deaths than other developed countries, and has much higher levels of weapons ownership than any other country in the world.\" However, it also says: \"while the mortality rate of firearms in the United States is lower than that of many less developed countries, America is still superior when compared to countries in similar social and economic conditions.\" Evans also referred to a writing from the Jefords Law Center for the Prevention of Armed Violence, which stated: \"No other developed country suffers from mass shootings with the same terrifying frequency as the United States.\" The problem is that all of these results are different from the statement made by Aurourke during the discussion. Or\u00fcrk did not limit his claim to high-income countries or those \"similar social and economic conditions.\" Our governor O'Rourke said, \"We're losing nearly 40,000 people in this country to a weapon of violence, a number that doesn't come any other country even near.\" Studies show that the United States suffers more deaths from firearms injuries than other countries with similar social and economic status, but that is not what Aurourke said in the discussion. In 2016, Brazil experienced more deaths from firearms injuries than in the United States, with firearms deaths per capita in more than a dozen countries compared to the United States in the same year. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong. In fact, this statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.
