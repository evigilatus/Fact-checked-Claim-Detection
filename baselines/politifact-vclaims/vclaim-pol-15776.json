She recommended Congress end tax subsidies for 401(k) plans in favor of \"guaranteed retirement accounts\" into which workers would be required to contribute 5 percent of their pay. The government would guarantee a 3 percent inflation-indexed return. And Uncle Sam would contribute $600 per worker, every year to those accounts.\n\n\nHer idea doesn't have any significant support in Congress that we could find. About the closest to support that we heard was from George Miller, the California Democrat who chairs the committee. He is interested in some kind of major long-term reform to the retirement savings system, but has stopped short of calling for the elimination of the 401(k) system.\n\n\nTwo months ago, his committee held a hearing on strengthening worker retirement security. In his opening statement, Miller said \"the current economic crisis has exposed deep flaws in our nation's retirement system. For too many Americans, 401(k) plans have become little more than a high-stakes crapshoot,\" Miller said.\n\n\nMiller did not discuss any specific changes, but over the long term, he said, we \"should ask ourselves whether our current system gives workers the ability to ensure a safe and secure retirement.\" He emphasized the need to preserve and strengthen 401(k)s but also said the Congress must consider additional retirement options.\n\n\n\"In the short term, Congress must address ways to improve defined contribution plans,\" Miller said. \"The 401(k) needs to be more transparent, fair, and operated on behalf of the account holder, not Wall Street firms. But, we must also ask the difficult questions about the state of our nation's retirement system as a whole and look to see whether we need to create a new leg of retirement security.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\n stated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\n\nWall Street Journal\n\nblasted Ghilarducci's plan in a Nov. 14, 2008, editorial and criticized Miller for even entertaining her ideas. Conservative blogs also criticized the possibility that 401(k) plans be replaced by a government-run savings plan.\n\n\nMiller fired back, accusing the\n\nWall Street Journal\n\nof misrepresenting his efforts and \"needlessly creating fear among Americans rightly worried about their retirement security.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\"I do not support 'abolishing' 401(k)s, moving these plans, or changing their tax status, plain and simple,\" said Miller. \"The truth is that Democrats in Congress are working to preserve and strengthen 401(k)s.\"\n\n\nStill, Miller's use of the phrase \"short term\" in February \"piqued the curiosity\" of Ed Ferrigno, vice president of Washington affairs for the Profit Sharing/401k Council of America, an association that represents employers that sponsor 401(k) plans.\n\n\n\"He (Miller) made it clear that his support of 401(k)s is qualified,\" Ferrigno said. \"I don't know what to read into that. It certainly could create a foundation for a system to overtake 401(k) plans.\"\n\n\nBut there's been no support in Congress or the White House for the kind of wholesale change that Boehner mentioned, according to Ferrigno and our review of legislation and statements. To the contrary, Democrats have spoken of protecting 401(k)s.\n\n\nIn a speech on the economy at Georgetown University on April 14, President Barack Obama spoke of the need to enact rules to \"protect typical American families when they buy a home, get a credit card or invest in a 401(k).\"\n\n\nYes, there are \"some\" in Washington who are tossing around the prospect of moving to a government-run system, and some of them may even want to scrap 401(k)s. But they are not elected officials and not in the Obama administration.\n\n\nOur problem with Boehner's statement is that it seems to suggest the idea has gained traction with Democratic lawmakers and administration officials. Use of the word \"some\" may provide Boehner some wiggle room here ? he could probably safely say that \"some\" people in Washington may be advocating darn near anything ? but the context suggests Democrats are behind it.\n\n\nWe haven't found any, so Boehner's claim comes off sounding more like a scare tactic. And so we rate the statement Barely True.\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15776"}
