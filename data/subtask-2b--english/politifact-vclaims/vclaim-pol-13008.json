NRCC claims PolitiFact Ohio confirmed claim that Rep. Betty Sutton \u201cmaxed out federal debt\u201d", "text": "Is up down? Is red blue? Is rain the same as sunshine?\n\nIn Washington, it is, and if it isn\u2019t, someone will insist it is anyway.\n\nSo PolitiFact Ohio is amused -- and not entirely surprised -- that when we rated a claim \"Barely True,\" a political organization quickly sent out an e-mail to the press crowing that we had confirmed something that we absolutely did not confirm.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 31, we ruled that a claim by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), attacking Democratic congresswoman Betty Sutton, was Barely True. The claim was that Sutton and her Democratic colleagues ran up the nation\u2019s credit card with unsustainable and irresponsible spending and \"now their credit card is maxed out.\"\n\nIn other words, the nation\u2019s federal debt problem was her fault.\n\nWhile Sutton certainly voted for various spending bills, as we noted, our reporting also found that wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, President George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts (extended under President Barack Obama) and the recession played roles in the debt, too.\n\nThe liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said that \"Bush-era tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars \u2014 including their associated interest costs \u2014 account for almost half of the projected public debt in 2019 (measured as a share of the economy) if we continue current policies.\"\n\nBut an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation said such an analysis \"fails basic statistics\" because it doesn\u2019t look at Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and discretionary spending.\n\nIn other words, you can\u2019t just blame the programs and decisions you don\u2019t like or find convenient and ignore all others.\n\nThat cherry-picking criticism was apt for the claim about Sutton.\n\nAs we noted, Congress voted to raise the debt ceiling seven times under Bush, and three times under Obama. So yes, Sutton voted for spending bills, as detailed by NRCC spokesman Tory Mazzola, one of the sources with whom we checked while researching this matter. But you cannot ignore the roles that the wars, tax cuts and the struggling economy also played in the nation\u2019s debt. Those were critical facts ignored by the NRCC claim that led to the Truth-O-Meter rating of Barely True.\n\nFast-forward to 9:51 a.m. today (June 1, 2011).That\u2019s when Mazzola sent out this e-mail news release: \"PolitiFact Confirms Sutton \u2018Maxed Out Federal Debt\u2019 As She Ducks For Political Cover.\"\n\nIn the text of his message, Mazzola wrote: \"POLITIFACT OHIO SAYS TRUE: \u2018Betty Sutton and Her Fellow Democrats Went On A Spending Spree And Now Their Credit Card Is Maxed Out.\u2019\n\nFor backup, Mazzola noted the sections of our fact-checking in which we quoted or paraphrased him.\n\nHe ignored everything else.\n\nWe sent him an e-mail this morning (June 1) noting our puzzlement, and he replied. \"By ruling it \u2018true,\u2019 albeit barely, you determined that the Democrats' responses were not believable, not credible, or false at least a degree more than ours were true,\" he said.\n\nWe could parse, say up is down, left is right, or that it\u2019s snowing in Washington (never mind the heat wave), but Mazzola\u2019s logic on this just won\u2019t fly -- even inside the Beltway.\n\nThe Truth-O-Meter defines Barely True this way: The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\" That description fits the NRCC\u2019s criticism of Sutton.\n\nThe Truth-O-Meter has other ratings available, of course, including its lowest, Pants on Fire.\n\nThe definition? \"The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSherrod Brown\n\n\nstated on November 30, 2010 in an MSNBC interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Understand, this is unemployment insurance. It\u2019s not welfare, as a lot of my Republican colleagues like to suggest it is. You pay into it when you\u2019re working. You get help when you\u2019re not.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Stephen Koff \u2022 December 7, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne other way to put it is: We said what?\n\nBoth fit the NRCC\u2019s characterization perfectly.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13008"}
