The bond rating recovery claim dates to his first four years in office.\nBond ratings are important to municipalities. When a city or town wants to build a new school or an addition to a police station, it raises that money by selling bonds to investors.\nRatings services such as Moody\u2019s analyze the issuer\u2019s tax base, budget stability and financial management, coming up with a grade that reflects their opinion of the issuing municipality\u2019s ability to pay the investors back.\nAn \u2018A\u2019 rated bond would be considered a safe choice, attractive to risk-averse investors who may be willing to accept a lower interest rate in exchange for a surer return. A lower rated \u2018B\u2019 bond, however, would be seen as less safe and the issuing town may have to pay a higher interest rate to attract buyers.\nWhen he was initially elected in 2000, Cumberland had already been in financial trouble for three years. In 1997, the town had drained a $1.4-million surplus fund to cover a deficit and still wound up $147,940 short That prompted Moody\u2019s to drop the town\u2019s bond rating from A1 to A3 in 1998. \u00a0\nThe rating company uses a letter system to rate bonds, with multiple steps. The best rating is Aaa1. The lowest is C3.\nAaa bonds, in Moody\u2019s words, \"demonstrate the strongest creditworthiness.\" Below Baa level is junk bond status. During its bankruptcy, Central Falls was rated Caa1, signifying \"very weak creditworthiness.\"\nCumberland\u2019s municipal finances were struggling in 2000. A series of news reports noted that revenues were not coming in as expected, the town\u2019s audit reports were late and one estimate predicted a deficit equal to a tenth of the town\u2019s overall budget, \"which is an enormous amount,\" an analyst at Moody\u2019s told The Providence Journal at the time.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cicilline\n\n\nstated on September 4, 2012 in a debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The auditor [for the city of Providence] was not locked out\" of access to the city's finances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy C. Eugene Emery Jr. \u2022 September 7, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2001, barely three weeks into McKee\u2019s first term, Moody\u2019s cut the town\u2019s bond rating five steps, to Ba2. Ba rated bonds, in Moody\u2019s words, \"demonstrate below average creditworthiness.\" A Moody\u2019s-rated Ba bond is familiarly known as a \"junk bond.\"\nThe crawl back began in March 2002. A completed audit showed revenues coming in better than expected, and the town implemented a series of cost-cutting measures as well as centralized management of town departments\u2019 spending. Moody\u2019s upgraded the rating to Baa3, one step out of junk bond status.\nBy December 2004, the rating had improved to where it was in 2000, before the downgrades began. McKee said that was important to him because it came as he was leaving office, and it fulfilled a campaign promise.\nTwo years later, in 2006, McKee won the mayoralty back and has been there since. In April 2010, Moody\u2019s classified the town\u2019s bond rating as A1, the top of that classification, where it remains.\nBut is that the highest in its history?\nChecking back in Moody\u2019s records, David Jacobson, a Moody\u2019s spokesman, said Cumberland had an A rating in 1996, but that was before the firm added the three numbers to each letter grade. He said a direct comparison to a 2004 rating would not be exactly apples-to-apples.\nHe said that was also the case with the Cumberland\u2019s April 2010 upgrade to A1. It was because of an adjustment of the standards, not a change in Cumberland\u2019s finances, he said.\nOur ruling\nCumberland Mayor Daniel McKee said the town has \"its highest bond rating in history.\"\nWe found that, as far back as comparable statistics can be found -- about 17 years -- he\u2019s right. The facts also support his claim that the bond rating improved five points under his administration.\nIn addition to the Moody\u2019s A1 rating in May, the city got an AA- rating from Standard and Poors in August. McKee said that during his 30 years in local government, he has no memory of the town ever getting an AA- rating from that service.\nBut Cumberland has been a town for 267 years. It\u2019s possible that at some point in that history, the town had a credit rating that, by some contemporary measure, was higher than its current rating. \u00a0\nMcKee cited evidence going back a few decades, not for two centuries of history.
