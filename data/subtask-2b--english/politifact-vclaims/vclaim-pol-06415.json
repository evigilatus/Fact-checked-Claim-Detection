Debbie Mayfield says", "text": "Florida House members left the 2015 legislative session early over health care funding, but they\u2019ve kept on railing against Medicaid expansion while waiting to reconvene to discuss a state budget.\nRep. Debbie Mayfield, R-Vero Beach, argued against taking federal money to expand Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for the very poor, saying it wasn\u2019t Florida\u2019s money to take. \u00a0\n\"FL is NOT a donor state. Get the facts on federal spending and Medicaid expansion in FL,\" she tweeted. The tweet included an infographic that read, \"Florida sends $135 billion and D.C. returns $150 billion. It's not your hard-earned tax dollars! It's borrowed against your children\u2019s future!\"\nOther House Republicans shared the same infographic, including Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island. We wondered where they were getting their numbers.\nTax totals\nHouse communications director Michael Williams said the amount Florida sends comes from Internal Revenue Service gross tax collections in the state ($154 billion in 2014) minus average tax refunds, ending up at $135 billion.\nThe amount Washington sent back came from USASpending.gov, a website that tracks federal contracts, loans, grants and public assistance. The site says the federal government spent $150 billion in Florida in fiscal year 2014.\nSubtract $135 billion from $150 billion, and that accounts for Florida getting $15 billion more than it puts in.\nBut tax policy experts told us there are different ways to calculate the numbers, so it\u2019s not as cut and dried as the House makes it out to be.\nSteve Ellis, vice president of watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, said the House\u2019s methodology is generally sound, but he would suggest using actual tax refunds instead of average refunds. He said that would push Florida\u2019s payout total even lower than $135 billion.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the spending side, National Priorities Project research director Lindsay Koshgarian points out that data from USASpending.gov does not give the most reliable picture available. Koshgarian said that among the site\u2019s issues is that it does not include all grants or federal employees and operations in state spending totals. She suggested using data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau would yield a more accurate total.\nSo federal tax totals paid out of Florida may be lower than what the House is saying, while federal spending could be even higher. But our experts said that comparison still doesn\u2019t paint a good picture of the state\u2019s nuances.\nFor example, Social Security and Medicare costs are disproportionately high in Florida because of the retiree population, which already paid into the system, but likely in another state. Florida has the third-largest uninsured pool in the country, with a public assistance budget to match. Also, there\u2019s a lot of that $150 billion in Washington cash that isn\u2019t as controversial in the House as Medicaid spending, like money for infrastructure or federal contracts for businesses like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.\n\"I doubt these folks are saying the state should not be taking federal highway money, just because they are taking in more than they spend,\" said Paul Van De Water, a senior fellow with the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.\nDifferences between states make it difficult to make direct comparisons, Koshgarian said. She cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to illustrate her point. \"We all need one CDC, but we don't need one in every state, so the dollars have to go somewhere,\" she said.\nKoshgarian said that in 2013, the last year with complete Census data, Florida received the fourth-highest total of federal grants to state government with $23.5 billion (the bulk of which was Medicaid), but was 48th among states for federal grant dollars per resident -- only Nevada and Virginia ranked lower. Those numbers mostly reflect Florida\u2019s status as one of the more populous states.\nEllis added that there\u2019s one other thing to keep in mind to put Mayfield\u2019s point in context: The U.S. government is always in the red these days.\n\"In my opinion, no state is a donor state when you consider that the budget deficit is nearly half a trillion dollars, so no one is paying their way,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nMayfield said, \"Florida sends $135 billion and D.C. returns $150 billion.\"\nTax policy experts told us the House\u2019s numbers were one way to look at it, but different data sources could yield different totals. They also said such a comparison really doesn\u2019t illustrate the nuances of what federal money is used for in Florida or why.\u00a0We rate the statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06415"}
