A story published on Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, said soon after that Kim was recovering from heart surgery.\u00a0\nSouth Korean officials are skeptical of such reports, according to the Times, but an April 22 YouTube video titled \"Breaking News Kim Jong Un has pass (sic) away\" begins by showing a photo of the North Korean leader with this text over him: \"From different news reports about Kim Jon Un\u2019s death.\"\nA woman then appears on the screen and says: \"The leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, has passed away. According to political, economical, cultural, military and journalistic analysis, Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea, has passed away.\"\nThe video then cuts to clips from news coverage about his condition after his surgery before returning to the woman. The leader\u2019s alleged death is not mentioned in the clips.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is not a joke,\" she says. \"According to my analysis through my head, heart and value, the aura, the leader of North Korea has already passed away.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
