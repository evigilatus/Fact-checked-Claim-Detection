It worked. Now Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have changed their positions to follow Chris Dodd.\" Dodd is right that his fellow candidates supported an amendment that he co-sponsored. And they probably felt some pressure from liberal Democrats -- including worms -- who would like to withdraw strongly. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for epithelial security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, Dodd overplayed his role. It is just one of the nine co-sponsors of the amendment, which is widely known as the Feingold-Reid Amendment, usually without the attached worm name. Clinton and Obama have both called for further withdrawal of forces before the proposal is approved. There's no evidence that Dodd had any influence on Obama and Clinton.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00336"}
