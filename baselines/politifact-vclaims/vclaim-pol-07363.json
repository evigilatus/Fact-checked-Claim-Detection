Rick Perry\u2019s indictment on charges of abusing his power: former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a fellow Texas Republican who has been embroiled in a criminal election law violation for the past 12 years.\nPerry\u2019s charges are nothing short of a political witch hunt, DeLay said, just like his own. Crowley pushed back on the suggestion.\n\"The point is the prosecutor who brought the indictment is not a Democrat in any way anybody can see, and in fact has ties to Republicans,\" Crowley said.\n\"That\u2019s not true. Candy, that\u2019s not true,\" DeLay said. \"He has ties to Obama. He has ties to the Democrats.\"\n\"And he has ties to Republicans, yes?\" Crowley asked.\n\"Well yeah, but that has nothing to do with this,\" DeLay said.\u00a0\"What has to do with this is you take a law and you twist it so you can get the indictment. That is prosecutorial misconduct, whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat.\"\nWe wanted to look into the special prosecutor\u2019s political connections, since Crowley and DeLay seemed to be on different pages.\nTrue colors\nThe special prosecutor, who was not identified on air, is San Antonio lawyer Michael McCrum.\nA grand jury indicted Perry based on charges brought forth by McCrum that Perry misused his power, after Perry threatened to veto the budget of an Austin prosecutor if she did not resign after her DUI was caught on tape.\nOur partners at PolitiFact Texas laid out the legal history of the case against Perry, noting how the prosecutor, Lehmberg, recused herself from the case, and the public integrity unit she leads was uninvolved in picking McCrum.\nMcCrum was selected by Judge Bert Richardson, a Republican appointee of President George W. Bush. Richardson and McCrum both worked as prosecutors in San Antonio, according to the Texas Tribune.\nMcCrum has been tight-lipped in press accounts and did not respond to our request for an interview.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolomon Wisenberg, a former Texas prosecutor who worked with McCrum and considers him an \"old friend,\" called the allegation against McCrum \"pathetic on its face.\"\n\"Mike would not be engaged in a political witch hunt. The idea that he\u2019s politically motivated is ridiculous,\" Wisenberg said. \"I don\u2019t really consider him as a political person.\"\nThe records show McCrum has steered clear of partisanship, even as he has attracted support from both sides of the aisle over 25 years.\nIn 1989, McCrum served as a federal prosecutor in the Western District of Texas, according to his resume. \nIn 2000, McCrum opened his own private practice in San Antonio, focusing on criminal defense.\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama nominated McCrum to be the U.S. attorney in San Antonio, according to the Texas Tribune. His nomination\u00a0was called a \"consensus choice\" by justice trade publication Main Justice, and Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison and House Democrats supported McCrum for the job.\nBut McCrum withdrew his name in 2010, as the prolonged nomination process stalled his law practice, according to the Wall Street Journal. \u00a0\nThe White House did not provide comment.\nMcCrum does not appear to vote in primaries and has donated to candidates of both parties. The Austin-American Statesman detailed McCrum\u2019s political donations: In 2007, he contributed $300 to a Republican 4th Court of Appeals candidate, $500 to a former Democratic congressman, and $500 to Republican Bert Richardson\u2019s unsuccessful re-election bid as state district judge. \u00a0\nThis record of bipartisanship is not unusual nor undesired in special prosecutors, said Wisenberg, who considers himself a conservative and opposes the prosecution against DeLay. He pointed out that special prosecutor Ken Starr, famous for investigating President Bill Clinton, also had ties to both parties, and DeLay did not oppose him.\nThe ruling\nDeLay said it\u2019s \"not true\" that McCrum isn\u2019t a Democrat, saying \"he has ties to Obama (and) he has ties to Democrats.\"\nMcCrum has loose ties to Obama and Democrats\u00a0-- and he has Republican ones, too.\nNews reports and McCrum\u2019s political record show he is not expressly partisan, having contributing a few hundred dollars to a few people on both sides of the aisle.\nThere's a sliver of truth in DeLay's statement,\u00a0but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
