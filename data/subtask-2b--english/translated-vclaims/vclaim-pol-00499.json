Therefore, when a conservative group launched an advertising campaign claiming that such a policy would pay the waiting times for medical care, candidate 2020 responded strongly. His point of view: Some people may wait a little longer for care under a new system. However, in the current situation, many people do not have access to affordable care, and the results are sometimes disastrous. However, Saunders' accuracy gave us pause. In other words, he tweeted: \"30,000 Americans die every year waiting for health care because of the cost.\" Where did this 30,000 come from? How can Saunders - or anyone - know how many people died \"waiting for health care\" precisely \"because of the cost\"? We contacted Sanders' campaign, but we didn't answer it. However, many experts suggested that the figure of 30,000, although not recovered from thin air, depended on shaky mathematics at best. In any event, there is insufficient evidence to fully substantiate or reject this claim. The statistics on the 30,000 mathematics provided by Sanders appear to come from a figure used by doctors in a national health programme, a non-profit group led by doctors, which for years has called for the provision of health care to single-payers. But how did he calculate this number? We asked Dr. David Himmelstein, a doctor and part-time lecturer at Harvard School of Medicine, one of the founders of the National Democratic Party. The Group had considered the experience of health insurance in Oregon, a historical study in which some state residents had been given medical coverage through lottery, and others had remained uninsured. After one year of this study, researchers found that the mortality rate varied by 13.0 percentage points between those who received insurance and those who did not. However, according to the research analysis, this difference was not statistically significant. (This is important and we'll get back to it.) Hemmelstein said that the 0.13 percentage point margin indicated that every 769 people without health coverage would die. In view of the currently uninsured American population - about 27 million people without coverage - you should be put at nearly 30,000. Experts said that cost barriers were generally likely to prevent thousands of Americans from accessing life-saving medical care. But \"the specific mathematics here seems a little questionable\" in reaching 30,000, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a doctor and an economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: 2 February 2021 the problem lies in extrapolating much of the health insurance experience in Oregon. While it has yielded significant results, the difference in mortality in particular is not statistically significant and therefore cannot be broadly applied. The study was not large enough to generate sufficient evidence to explain the link between insurance coverage and mortality. Other research shows such a link. For example, Sommers &apos; own work considered the impact of the Massachusetts Health Reform Act 2006 - the model of the Affordable Care Act, which made the state almost universal coverage. This expansion has been accompanied by a significant reduction in mortality. In order for every 830 adults to have access to coverage, one death has been prevented. However, differences at the national level in both population and health care generally still mean that it is difficult to apply these statistics to the rest of the country - the remaining 27 million that are not insured. So is 30,000 true or wrong? We don't know. \"My guess is that one, [Sanders] is true that thousands of people die because they are still uninsured, despite ACA; but two, may be a very high 30,000,\" said Stan Dorn, a senior colleague in the U.S. family, the left-wing health policy advocacy group. There is one other issue: people are often not insured because they cannot afford to buy coverage. This in turn often means that they cannot afford health care and suffer severe consequences. But it is not an individual replacement. For example, healthy people lack insurance but may not need much medical care in that particular year, or may simply choose not to buy it. On the other hand, some people enjoy not strong enough coverage to make life-saving treatments affordable. So, if you want to measure how many Americans die \"waiting for health care because of cost,\" you have to look beyond just the issue of getting insurance. The Sanders claim speaks of an uncontroversially important political interest that thousands of Americans die because they cannot afford their health care. But his point, \"30,000 people,\" depends on the weakness of mathematics, and lacks meaningful support in both cases. It could be true. But it's also easy not to be. \"The Senator's suspension seems like a reasonable attempt to use the previous search,\" said Sommers. But \"it overestimates the accuracy and confidence that we can obtain in that number.\" Saunders' argument speaks of something more valid but neglects important details about the limitations imposed by the Oregon health insurance experience.
