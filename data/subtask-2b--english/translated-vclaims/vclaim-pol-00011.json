Tony Evers convened a special session of the state legislature. He wanted legislators to adopt the so-called \"Red Flag\" Act - which would allow judges to take weapons from persons considered dangerous - and to extend background verification to sales between private parties. The majority leader of the Senate, Scott Fitzgerald, immediately announced that it was likely that the meeting would be adjourned as soon as it began, and refused even to vote on the proposals. At the same time, the other major republic in the state legislature - Assembly President Robin Voss - is conducting media tours to defend Republican inaction and condemn the Evers proposals. This included a live Facebook interview with Charles Benson from WTJM-TV on October 22, 2019. Their conversation was transformed into Red Flag laws, also referred to as emergency risk protection orders. And here's part of that exchange: the rules of the Vos, the red media, it's basically like saying we're gonna take your car because we think you can drive drunk. This is crazy. But a judge has to decide that. No, they're taking your weapon first, and then you have to go and ask permission to get the weapon back. Then Foss reaffirmed his description while criticizing how the referendum of the Faculty of Law of the University of Marquette summarized the laws of red science as \"perceiving the police to take weapons from persons who the judge found dangerous to themselves or others.\" In late August, the poll showed that 81 per cent of respondents supported it. \"This is not how Red Flag Law works,\" said Voss, R-R-Rochester. \"Take it first. Then you have to get permission from the judge to do so.\" Is Voss right that the Red Flag laws allow weapons to be confiscated before the judge gets involved? Let's dig. The Red Flag laws provide a mechanism to take weapons from people who show dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others. The first such law was passed in Connecticut in 1990, but the second law appeared only in Indiana in 2005. Other states have adopted such laws in recent years following mass shootings by persons who have shown previous warning signs. At least 17 states and District of Colombia now have a Code of Red Science, including several laws passed in 2019, according to the Giffords Legal Centre for the Prevention of Armed Violence, an organization for research and advocacy. Each state allows law enforcement to seek the elimination of weapons, 12 states also allow family or household members to do so, and state studies also allow petitions from medical professionals, coworkers or school staff. The judge (or other judicial officer such as the Commissioner of the Court) usually hears the request and then decides whether to issue a preliminary order without holding a hearing or notifying the owner of the weapon. These orders are provisional and last from two to 21 days according to the state, according to a summary of a number prepared by the non-partisan Legislative Council of Wisconsin. The owner of the weapon is then given the opportunity to present his case at a hearing before the judge decides on a final order. This arrangement usually lasts for one year. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2021, the various states have different burdens of proof that must be met for a judge to make an order, such as finding the individual is a \"high risk\" or there is \"clear and convincing evidence.\" If an order is issued, some states require the immediate surrender of weapons, while others allow for a short period of time. A search warrant authorizing detention may also be issued in some states. The proposed Evers Law on Wisconsin requires a hearing within 14 days of the preliminary order and makes the final order effective for one year. It states that weapons should be seized if the judge finds \"reasonable grounds that the defendant is highly likely\" to harm himself or another person. Applications may be made either for an extension of the final order or for its early termination. The State Act already provides for the surrender of weapons as a result of other judicial conclusions, such as mental health obligations and restraining orders, in accordance with the Legislative Council. You may have noticed that the word \"judge\" appears repeatedly in the above summary. The Wisconsin proposal, contrary to the Vos description, does not permit the confiscation of any weapon without a warrant. The spokesman for Voss Kate Bayer asked about the evidence that judges were not initially involved in red flag law shifts, and said that Voss had misheard the question. \"Speaker Voss believes Charles Benson asked if the defendant went before a judge before an order to surrender,\" said Pierre. However, this interpretation is not consistent with logic. The initial question put by Benson about the Red Science Act was much less specific - whether Voss believed that the people of Wisconsin wanted to go through it. Voss II referred to the absence of a judicial signature after Benson had simply read out the drafting of the Marquette referendum. The prescriptions of the Red Flag Acts consistently refer to decisions taken by judges. This is the term used by Giffords, the Legislative Council, the National Congress of State Legislatures, the New York Times and many others. But there is an exception. The Indiana Act allows the police to confiscate firearms without first obtaining a judicial order. However, they are then required to submit a statement to the judge, who can revoke the officer &apos; s decision and refuse to issue a preliminary order, according to Giffords. Like other States, the preliminary order requires a hearing on a final order to be held within 14 days. Pierre said that the main interest of Voss in Red Flag laws related to due process of law, since a preliminary order could be issued without an individual having the opportunity to challenge it. This is a fundamental objection from conservatives and other groups that are also opposed to Red Flag laws, including the National Guns Assembly. The Red Flag laws have been challenged in other states, but have been upheld by the courts as constitutional laws on the basis of both the second amendment and due process, as the Legislative Council has said. This includes a provision in support of the Florida Act in September 2019. The governor, Voss, said the Red Flag laws meant they took him first. Then you have to get permission from the judge to do so.\" But the laws of red science, including those proposed in Wisconsin, do not usually work this way. It includes the police or family who petition the judge who must sign a preliminary order before any weapons are confiscated. Indiana has a law that has been drafted as described by Voss, but even a decision to seize by the police is subject to immediate judicial review. This is the exception, not the rule. We appreciate Vos' claim that it is often false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00011"}
