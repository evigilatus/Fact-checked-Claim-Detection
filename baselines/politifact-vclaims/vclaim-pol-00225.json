Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., accused South Carolina of spending too much on prisons and not enough on schools, keying in on the issues of mass incarceration and education with an eye toward the early primary state.\n\"Last year, South Carolina spent $21,756 per prison inmate and $11,552 per student,\" Sanders wrote in an Aug. 26 post. \"We should be investing in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.\"\nSouth Carolina\u2019s situation is not unique. Across the country, states spend more on average to lock people up than to educate students.\nSanders may have focused on the Palmetto State because its Feb. 29 Democratic primary vote represents the first real test case of candidates\u2019 strength with black voters, who cite criminal justice and education as critical issues. In 2016, Sanders lost the African American vote to Hillary Clinton by an astonishing 50 percentage points.\nSanders\u2019 numbers checked out. But the gap between South Carolina\u2019s spending on prisons and schools is nowhere near the biggest disparity among the states.\u00a0\nA reflection of priorities\nSanders is correct: South Carolina spent an average of $21,756 on each of its roughly 20,000 inmates in 2018, according to a South Carolina Department of Corrections budget sheet that Sanders\u2019 campaign referred us to.\u00a0\nDuring the 2017-18 academic year, the Palmetto State spent an average of $11,525 per student. That data comes from the National Education Association\u2019s annual assessment, which Sanders\u2019 campaign pointed us to.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s a difference of about $10,000 more on prisons than schools.\nWe heard from a South Carolina Department of Corrections official who pushed back against Sanders\u2019 claim, saying that comparing inmate cost-per-year versus students \"is not an apples to apples comparison.\"\n\"Inmate cost includes 24-hour care, housing, clothing, feeding, medical care, mental health care, programming, 24-hour security, plus education costs,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut other experts we spoke to said the comparison is a reasonable way to gauge a state\u2019s priorities.\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s hard to argue that spending twice as much on prisons as on schools doesn\u2019t reflect some distorted priorities,\" said David Bills, an education professor at the University of Iowa. \"By international standards, the U.S. has an inordinate number of people in prison, and by international standards is underinvesting in education.\"\nThe disparity between prison and school spending is not unique to South Carolina \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the same across the country. We compared the most recent data on state prison spending from the Vera Institute of Justice, a criminal justice think tank, with state-by-state public school expenditures from the National Education Association.\u00a0\nEvery state averaged more spending on inmates than students, based on the available data from 2015, which included 45 states. On average, these states spent $11,709 per student, and $33,274 per inmate, or nearly three times more on prisons than schools.\n\nAmong the states we compared, South Carolina had the ninth lowest disparity between inmate and student spending.\nIf Sanders had wanted to highlight the largest disparity \u2014 $53,497 \u2014 he should have turned to deep blue California. In 2015, Sacramento spent an average of nearly $65,000 per prisoner, almost double the statewide average. That same year, California spent close to the statewide average on education per pupil, just over $11,000.\u00a0\n\"I think this is generally a reasonable comparison of state priorities,\" said Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project. \"In many states spending on corrections has increased at a far higher rate than for education over the past several decades.\"\nOur ruling\nSanders said, \"Last year, South Carolina spent $21,756 per prison inmate and $11,552 per student.\"\nSanders is correct that South Carolina averaged more spending per inmate than student last year. But the disparity in prison versus school spending is true across the country, and in most states the gap is wider than in South Carolina.\nWe rate this Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00225"}
