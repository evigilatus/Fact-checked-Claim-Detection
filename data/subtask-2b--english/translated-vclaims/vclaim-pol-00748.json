This provision sets a federal deduction for government and local tax payments at $10,000. \"As Governor of New York State today, my top priority is the abolition of Salt. In March, Como told journalists, referring to the maximum tax cuts at state and local levels in the Tax Reductions and Jobs Act. Como said that the impact of the $10,000 cap on SALT discounts was widespread in New York. \"Fifty counties have average taxes higher than the SALT ceiling of $10,000,\" said Como at his March conference. \"Fifty counties will see an increase in taxes.\" We wondered whether his speech on this issue was accurate. Is the problem with the cover as widespread as he said? Does 52 provinces have average government and local taxes above the maximum of $10,000? Como repeated this claim several times, and a report issued by the Office of the State Comptroller appears to be its source. In October 2017, while the changes in the tax law were under discussion but prior to their adoption, Comptroller Thomas Denapoli issued a report on how the changes could affect New York. One of the proposals analysed at the Denapoli Office was the proposal made in Washington to eliminate or reduce the federal liability for state and domestic taxes. \"This is a big deal for our mandate: New Yorkers reported more than $72 billion in income and property tax deductions in 2015.\" Of this total, income taxes amounted to $51.7 billion and property taxes to $20.9 billion. The Controller &apos; s Office found that, according to its analysis of the county-by-district data from the Internal Revenue Service &apos; s Income Statistics Programme of the 2015 tax year, the filings requesting tax cuts at the state and local levels had on average deducted more than $10,000 in 52 of the 62 New York counties. The most recent data on indoor residual spraying, released from the 2016 tax year, showed that the average deductions were over $10,000 in 53 provinces. On January 14, 2021, Colin Schmidt mentioned at a press conference \"We have scientific data, from all levels, but especially from high school sports levels, from many different states, which show that it's safe to play what New York thinks of high-risk mathematics.\" By the Terri Ramos generation on January 26, 2021, we asked some tax experts about Komo's claim. Many of them pointed out that many tax reporters did not itemize their discounts, and that Como's claim for \"average taxes above the maximum\" did not reflect this point. \"Only 34.8 per cent of New Yorkers received government and local tax discounts in 2016; the Governor claims that the average taxes in these provinces are over $10,000 based on taxes of just over one third of the population -- generally, the richest third,\" said Jared and Zach, the senior policy analyst at the non-partisan tax institution. Zack found that the average government and local taxes in all filers were higher than $10,000 in only three provinces: Westchester, New York and Nassau. Even if they are not relevant for purposes of the SALT discount, those filings who do not specify items also have governmental and local tax obligations, so the average would be over $10,000 in a handful of other provinces, such as Putnam, Rockland and Suffolk, as Wolzak said. Tax experts also noted that averages could be distorted by a few very high-income people. \"To put this in context: 81.5 per cent of New York filers have a gross income of $100,000 or less, and pay an average of $2,840 in federal income taxes. However, the average federal income tax liability of a New York Registrar is $13,896, distorted upward by the highest wage earners, \"said Zach. Similarly, the vast majority of filers in New York are far below the SALT discount ceiling, and in many cases State and domestic taxes are not deducted at all. If Kumo means that taxes will rise because of the SALT ceiling, \"of course, most of these people still get tax cuts due to TCJA,\" said Steve Wamhoff, Director of Federal Tax Policy at the Left Tax and Economic Policy Institute. We asked the Governor's office about the cases with his claim that 52 provinces have average government and local taxes of more than $10,000. \"The facts are still the same: the federal government estimates the maximum SALT deductions at over $600 billion over the next decade; New Yorkers will pay another $15 billion to the federal government annually, taking more than any other state from New York,\" said Freeman Klobot, spokesman for the Budget Division. \"The bottom line is that this is a tax increase for our mandate to benefit the federal government that unfairly attacked New York, which is already the first contributor to the federal government.\" The New York Polyte Fact has verified the fact that New York is giving more to the Federal Treasury than the state is, and I found it true. In our ruling on the elimination of the $10,000 ceiling for state and local tax cuts, Como said that the average government and local taxes in 52 provinces exceeded the ceiling. The most recent data available since 2016, prior to the implementation of the new tax law, show that the average government and local tax deduction in 53 provinces was greater than $10,000, when the average was calculated using the proceeds from the filings who claimed such a deduction - not from each filer. It is based on taxes paid by about one third of the population, which are generally richer than one third of the population. The Como Statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression of the severity of the cover for most New Yorkers. It makes the hat look more widespread than it is. We assess his claim mostly wrong.
