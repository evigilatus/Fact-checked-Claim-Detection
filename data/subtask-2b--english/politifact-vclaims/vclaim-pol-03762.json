Jerry Brown vowed to defend the protections California\u00a0affords all immigrants in the state, documented or not, against the Trump administration.\n\"We will defend everybody \u2013 every man, woman and child \u2013 who has come here for a better life and has contributed to the well-being of our state,\" Brown said in his speech delivered at the state Capitol in Sacramento on January 24, 2017.\nBrown added that immigrants are an integral part of California, helping \"create the wealth and dynamism of this state from the very beginning.\"\nHe went on to say \"27 percent\" of Californians or \"almost 11 million were born in a foreign land.\"\nWe decided to fact-check Brown on those numbers.\nOur research\nA spokesman for Brown pointed to figures from the U.S. Census Bureau to back up the statement.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2015 American Community Survey does, in fact, list California\u2019s \"foreign born\" population at 27 percent.\nThe bureau defines foreign-born as anyone who is not a U.S. citizen at birth, including those who become U.S. citizens through naturalization.\nCalifornia\u2019s overall population was approximately 39.2 million as of July 1, 2016, according to census figures. Twenty-seven percent of that total would be about 10.6 million people.\nBrown is on track when he described the figure as \"almost 11 million.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHans Johnson, a researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California, told us the 2015 American Community Survey is the best source on the state's foreign born population.\nIn a 2013 study using older data, the policy institute itself reported that 27 percent of California\u2019s population was foreign born, about twice the U.S. percentage. California\u2019s percentage appears to have remained steady in more recent years, according to the 2015 census study.\nCalifornia's foreign-born\nForty seven percent of California\u2019s immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens, while about 26 percent had some other legal status, according the policy institute\u2019s report. The study estimates 27 percent were undocumented.\nSo, where do California\u2019s foreign born come from? More than half, or 53 percent, were born in Latin America, while 37 percent was born in Asia, according to the PPIC study. Mexico at 4.3 million, the Philippines at 812,000 and China at 760,000 are the leading countries of origin.\nThe nation\u2019s foreign-born population reached 42.2 million, or 13.2 percent, in 2014, according to the Pew Research Center. That total has more than quadrupled since 1965, though its pace of growth has begun to slow in recent years.\nOur ruling\nGov. Jerry Brown claimed in his State of the State Address that 27 percent of Californians, almost 11 million, \"were born in a foreign land.\"\nA 2015 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau verifies that statistic. Additionally, a researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California, which studies the state\u2019s immigration and demographic patterns, confirmed the census report is the best authority on California\u2019s foreign born population.\nWe rate Brown's claim True.\n\nTRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/157c1e3a-89e6-45e3-874b-afd232d8790c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03762"}
