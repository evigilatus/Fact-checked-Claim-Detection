That quote was written", "text": "Between websites with exoneration, author names and ironic subdivisions, ironic articles can usually be monitored from a mile away. But when Facebook pages share these stories without any context or innocence, many users end up commenting and sharing content as if the news were real, without reading the story or seeing the slogan \"This is ironic\" used by some websites. This seems to have happened with an article on June 28, which participated in an ironic article without giving up the mention of the U.S. Republic of Alexandria, Okasio-Cortiz. Main title: \"Okaysio Cortez proposes a nationwide ban on motorcycles.\" No, Okasio Cortez isn't coming for bikers. The story, the quotes inside, are made up. On January 11, 2021, in Nancy Belusi's article, the Speaker of the House of Representatives was no longer named Samantha Buterman.

The site that published the story, Tatters Sony Tite, describes itself as a branch of the network of other American defence lines from the Satir sites.

Any similarities between the pure imagination of this site and the real people, places and events are pure coincidences and all images should be considered variable and ironic.\" However, Facebook collected comments that she thought were real: \"Think only. You're gonna get a great pension for the rest of her life. For being an idiot.\" Also: \"Retreat! The vast majority of motorcyclists are retired veterans. You won't be able to do that.\" This malignant article is a mere irony. We value it pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00396"}
