She has called for stronger regulations, but continuously affirms her support for the right to bear arms.\nHowever, gun rights advocates argue that it\u2019s reasonable to infer from a few comments that she wants to roll back the Second Amendment as it\u2019s currently interpreted.\nStraight shooting on the campaign trail\nIn both her 2008 and 2016 White House bids, Clinton has called for more gun control all the while saying she \"believes in the Second Amendment.\"\nHere are a few examples of comments she\u2019s made:\n\u2022 January 2008, Democratic presidential debate: \"I believe in the Second Amendment. People have a right to bear arms. But I also believe that we can common-sensically approach this.\"\n\u2022 August 2015, in response to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia: \"We are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths.\"\n\u2022 January 2016, on Twitter: \"Nobody's attacking the Second Amendment. We can protect Americans' rights \u2014 and also protect families from gun violence. #GOPdebate\"\n\u2022 June 2016, on ABC\u2019s This Week: \"I believe we can have common-sense gun-safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment.\" (More on this later.)\nSetting aside the bulk of Clinton\u2019s comments on protecting the Second Amendment (examples here, here, here, here, here and here), we\u2019ll now go over three points that some gun rights advocates and experts say gives Trump\u2019s charge some credence.\nSmoking guns?\nClinton riled the gun lobby with two eyebrow-raising comments last fall and one from this spring.\nClinton said in October 2015 a national gun buyback program like Australia\u2019s compulsory program was \"worth looking into.\" After a gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, Australia banned semiautomatic and automatic weapons and enacted a mandatory buyback of the newly prohibited guns.\nThat program is \"incompatible with private ownership of guns,\" Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told us in May. (The National Rifle Association shares this view.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full context of Clinton\u2019s response, however, suggests she may have misspoken or not fully understood Australia\u2019s program, as she also evoked voluntary buybacks as potential models for a U.S. program.\nSecond, Clinton said in a leaked recording of a private fundraiser that she thinks the Supreme Court \"is wrong on the Second Amendment,\" referring to its landmark ruling in District of Columbia vs. Heller. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down Washington\u2019s handgun ban and recognized that the Second Amendment applies to the individual\u2019s right to bear arms.\nExperts who support gun rights told us undoing Heller basically ends the Second Amendment as currently interpreted. They pointed out that former Justice Department officials under President Bill Clinton and his appointees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in Heller that gun regulations do not violate the Second Amendment because it primarily pertains to a well-regulated militia, not the individual right to bear arms.\nClinton, in her June interview on This Week, added fuel to the fire when she appeared to talk about the individual right as a hypothetical.\n\"Do you believe that their conclusion that an individual's right to bear arms is a constitutional right?\" host George Stephanopoulos asked.\n\"If it is a constitutional right, then it, like every other constitutional right, is subject to reasonable regulation,\" she responded. \"And what people have done with (the Heller) decision is to take it as far as they possibly can and reject what has been our history from the very beginning of the republic, where some of the earliest laws that were passed were about firearms.\"\nThe NRA and voices on the right seized upon these comments as proof that Clinton doesn\u2019t really believe in the individual right to bear arms. But that ignores what she said immediately after:\n\"So I think it's important to recognize that reasonable people can say, as I do, responsible gun owners have a right \u2014 I have no objection to that. But the rest of the American public has a right to require certain kinds of regularity, responsible actions to protect everyone else.\"\nUCLA Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, meanwhile, said that the accuracy of Trump\u2019s charge depends on Clinton\u2019s grounds for rejecting Heller. (According to news reports from the 2008 election, she supported Washington\u2019s handgun ban.)\n\"If she thought the reasoning was wrong, but the result right, then she would fit in with a number of strong pro-gun advocates,\" he said. \"If, however, she thought there should be no protection for gun rights, then Trump's claim comes closer to the truth.\"\nThe Clinton campaign previously told us Clinton \"believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe.\"\nThis suggests Clinton disagrees with the court declaring the district\u2019s ban on handguns unconstitutional, not necessarily the individual right itself \u2014 a position that\u2019s more or less in line with the George W. Bush administration\u2019s position on Heller of recognizing the right but allowing reasonable curtailment.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment.\"\nThe addition of the word essentially doesn\u2019t change the accuracy of this claim. We found no evidence of Clinton ever saying verbatim or suggesting explicitly she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. The bulk of her comments suggest the opposite: She wants to enact stricter gun control, but has no objection to responsible gun ownership.\nGun advocates say Trump\u2019s claim is backed up by Clinton\u2019s openness to a gun buyback program and her disagreement with a Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment. But whether or not these cherry-picked comments actually reveal Clinton\u2019s intentions is a matter of interpretation.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim False.\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/85ef6fa9-d3d9-4a5f-afd2-40af77b1eb94", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04632"}
