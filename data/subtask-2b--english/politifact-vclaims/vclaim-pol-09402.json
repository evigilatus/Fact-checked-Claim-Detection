John McCain, R-Ariz., recently cited one reason for overhauling the nation\u2019s immigration system: Many of America\u2019s young scientists these days aren\u2019t American, and they need a way to become integrated into the U.S. economy.\n\nMcCain made his case at an April 26, 2013, speech at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce summit titled \"Reforming Immigration for a Better America.\"\n\n\"I'll just very briefly mention, if a student graduates from a U.S. college with a science, technology, engineering (or) math degree and has an offer of employment ... they would be eligible to receive a green card to stay in this country\" under the bipartisan legislation McCain supports. \"I'm sure you are aware that over half of the students in the United States of America that are receiving advanced degrees are not citizens of the United States of America. If they want to stay in this country, and they have a job, then we should be able to accommodate for that. It's obviously important for our economy.\"\n\nIs McCain correct that \"over half\" of science, technology, engineering and mathematics students \"receiving advanced degrees\" aren\u2019t U.S. citizens? We didn\u2019t hear back from McCain\u2019s office, but we were able to track down some data ourselves.\n\nWe should begin by pointing out one caveat. The data we found -- statistics compiled by the National Science Foundation\u2019s National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics for 2009 -- divide degree earners into citizens and legal permanent residents on the one hand, and temporary residents (foreign nationals) on the other. So the data doesn't speak directly to McCain's formulation, which refers only to \"citizens.\"\n\nHowever, since McCain referred to degree earners wanting \"to stay in this country\" -- something that permanent residents, like citizens, wouldn't have to worry about -- it seems reasonable to analyze his comment along the lines described by the NSF data.\n\nWe should also note that there is sometimes a debate about what constitutes degrees in science, technology, engineering and math. PolitiFact Florida, for example, looked at whether anthropology is considered a STEM field and rated the claim that it was Half True.\n\nIn an effort to most closely mirror McCain\u2019s formulation, we looked at all advanced degrees (masters plus doctorates) in the fields of engineering and the natural sciences (which includes mathematics, but excludes the social sciences, such as anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology).\n\nUsing this definition, 37 percent of students earning advanced degrees in 2009 were temporary residents; the rest were U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The percentage of temporary residents is even lower -- 28 percent -- if you include the social sciences, which qualify under the NSF\u2019s \"science\" category.\n\nNeither figure is over half.\n\nHowever, because certain subcategories of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (commonly known as STEM) have higher rates of foreign students, McCain would have been on safer ground if he\u2019d phrased his claim more carefully.\n\nHere are some statistics for computer- and electronic-related fields:\n\n\u2022 Master\u2019s degrees and doctorates granted for electrical engineering in 2009: 58 percent temporary residents\n\n\u2022 Master\u2019s degrees granted for electrical engineering in 2009: 56 percent temporary residents\n\n\u2022 Doctorates granted in electrical engineering in 2009: 66 percent temporary residents\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Doctorates granted in computer science in 2009: 54 percent temporary residents\n\nIn general, temporary residents are more dominant in the pool of Ph.D.\u2019s and less dominant in the pool of master\u2019s degree earners:\n\n\u2022 Doctorates granted in all engineering fields in 2009: 57 percent temporary residents\n\n\u2022 Doctorates granted in industrial engineering in 2009: 66 percent temporary residents\n\n\u2022 Doctorates granted in civil engineering in 2009: 61 percent temporary residents\n\n\u2022 Doctorates granted in materials engineering in 2009: 57 percent temporary residents\n\n\u2022 Doctorates granted in chemical engineering in 2009: 53 percent temporary residents\n\nMeanwhile, the predominance of temporary residents in these fields should remain for a while. Here\u2019s data for current grad students (as of 2009) seeking a master\u2019s or doctorate in STEM fields:\n\n\u2022 Graduate students in all engineering fields in 2009: 55 percent\n\n\u2022 Graduate students in electrical engineering in 2009: 74 percent\n\n\u2022 Graduate students in computer science in 2009: 65 percent\n\n\u2022 Graduate students in industrial engineering in 2009: 61 percent\n\n\u2022 Graduate students in materials engineering in 2009: 54 percent\n\n\u2022 Graduate students in chemical engineering in 2009: 51 percent\n\nStill, it\u2019s important to remember some context: Doctorates in engineering and computer science account for a distinct minority of all graduate degrees in STEM fields. Once you factor in students seeking master\u2019s degrees as well as students in other STEM subjects -- such as medical science, chemistry and physics -- the overall share of foreign students drops well below 50 percent.\n\nOur rating\n\nMcCain said that \"over half\" of science, technology, engineering and mathematics students \"receiving advanced degrees are not citizens of the United States of America.\" That\u2019s actually incorrect -- the number is no higher than 37 percent. But McCain has a point that temporary residents account for over half of those earning degrees in many economically important fields, such as electrical engineering and computer science.
