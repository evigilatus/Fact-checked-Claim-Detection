Martin O\u2019Malley.\nSince an anti-abortion group released videos Planned Parenthood officials talking about aborted fetal parts, Republicans have pushed to take away federal funding from the women\u2019s health organization. Democratic presidential candidates, on the other hand, are showing their support, if subdued.\nO\u2019Malley said he hadn\u2019t seen the videos, speaking to reporters in New Hampshire July 26.\n\"And I don't generally make a habit of responding to right-wing videos,\" O'Malley said, according to Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel. \"I do know that 97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health. So that's what I know, but I'll defer to others for commenting on that video and whatever videos they're pumping out there.\"\nIs 97 percent of what Planned Parenthood does mammograms and other preventive care, as opposed to abortions?\nO\u2019Malley spokeswoman Haley Morris pointed us to a Planned Parenthood press release that had a similar, but not identical, statistic.\n\"More than 97 percent of Planned Parenthood's services are primary and preventive health care, including lifesaving cancer screenings, birth control, testing and treatment of STDs, annual exams and health counseling,\" the 2011 release said.\nAs we\u2019ve found in previous fact-checks, Planned Parenthood comes to this number by adding up the number of individual services provided each year. In total, they provided nearly 11 million services in 2013, according to their most recent annual report. (Planned Parenthood clinics saw 2.7 million individual patients in 2013, so many received multiple services.)\nHere\u2019s the breakdown from the annual report:\nAbortions: 327,653\nSexually transmitted infection/disease testing and treatment: 4,470,597\nContraception: 3,577,348\nCancer screening and prevention: 935,573\nPregnancy tests: 1,128,783\nPrenatal services: 18,684\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Fournier\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily practice services: 65,464\nAdoption referrals: 1,880\nUrinary tract infection treatments: 47,264\nOther: 17,187\nBased on this list, it\u2019s accurate that abortion procedures only count for 3 percent of all services provided, meaning 97 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides are other forms of reproductive and primary care. By far, contraception and STI/STD testing and treatment are the most frequented services.\nOf their services, Planned Parenthood considers many to be preventive care in that they manage health and prevent disease or worse problems down the line. This includes STI/STD testing and treatment, contraception and cancer screening and prevention -- 8,983,518 services provided in 2013.\nNot included in this list are abortions, pregnancy tests, prenatal services, adoption referrals, UTI treatments, family practice services (a vague category that could include certain preventive care), and other services -- 1,606,915 services in 2013.\nBased on this breakdown, about 85 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s work is preventive. Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Elizabeth Clark put the figure at 90 percent. But both are a bit lower than what O\u2019Malley said: that 97 percent is preventive care and mammograms.\nOh yeah, what about mammograms?\nWithin the category of \"cancer screening and prevention services,\" Planned Parenthood said it offered 487,029 breast exams or breast care services in 2013. However, as we\u2019ve noted before, Planned Parenthood clinics do not provide mammograms themselves.\nRather, Planned Parenthood physicians perform other types of breast exams and refer patients to outside clinics where they can get a mammogram.\nAn October 2012 statement posted on Planned Parenthood\u2019s website explained the group\u2019s approach, which they said is helping women access mammograms via referral even though the clinics do not perform them in-house.\nSo O\u2019Malley\u2019s 97 percent figure has some basis -- that\u2019s the percentage of Planned Parenthood\u2019s services that aren\u2019t abortion. But that\u2019s a broader category than \"mammograms and preventative health,\" which O\u2019Malley said.\nOur ruling\nO\u2019Malley said, \"97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health.\"\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, about 97 percent of the services the group provides in a given year are services other than abortion. That includes preventive and primary care. Preventive care accounts for about 85 to 90 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides.\nWhile mammograms are considered a form of preventive care, Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t do their own mammograms. Clinics perform breast exams and refer patients to outside clinics for an actual mammogram.\nThe claim wasn\u2019t pulled out of thin air, but it\u2019s missing some important information, so we rate O\u2019Malley\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06121"}
