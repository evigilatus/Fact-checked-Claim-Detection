No. \u00b6 (sighs finally arranged)", "text": "President Donald Trump is known for showing off his achievements. But is he right that he has enacted more legislation than any other president? At the West Palm Beach firehouse on December 27, Trump said, \"You know, one of the things people don't understand - we signed more legislation than anyone else. We broke Harry Truman's record.\" This was different from previous confirmation, probably true of his former press secretary, Sean Spyser, that Trump \"worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman.\" It's been eight months since we evaluated the Spieser statement, so we thought -- and a lot of the readers of the Polyte Fact book -- that it was a good time to verify Trump's latest allegations. The accuracy of bragging has declined over time - a considerable amount of time. According to Govtrack.us -- a non-partisan site that collects congressional and other government statements -- Trump was in fact ranked last in post-World War II legislation in their first calendar year who took office in the regular four-year cycle (as opposed to those who were promoted to the presidency after death or resignation). In a report published on 21 December 2017, Govtrack.us wrote that \"Trap drowned to the last place with 94 signed bills on his 336th day in office (today). This is eight times lower than President George W. Bush, and not even half of President Bill Clinton. Bush (242).\" Trump signed two invoices the day after the report was issued, including a large tax bill, but this will not be enough for him to catch up with George W. Bush. During 28 December, Trump signed 96, and Bush, the youngest 109, told Joshua Tauper, founder of Govtrack.us, Polyte Fact. Tupper added that Truman signed at least 126 laws on his first 100 days, so his number for the whole year is much higher than the current number for Trump 96. We also found out how many pages were signed, and Trump was not on that list either. The report said: \"The 2,038 pages of Trump place him in fourth place - that is, behind Obama's 3,473 pages but more than double the number of George W. Bush's pages at this point in their early years.\" Tupper said that Trump's statement from West Palm Beach \"it doesn't matter how you try to fix it.\" In this chart, which summarizes both measures, it does not include the two draft laws signed in Trump on 22 December. In the chart, most of the signed invoices are ordered by the superiors. Presidents Harry Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson and Gerald Ford are not included in this comparison because they began their term in the middle of the Congressional session. (It would not be appropriate to compare the three presidents who held office other than 20 January with the rest, since each completed its first calendar year in office with much shorter terms in the Oval Office.) Johnson, for example, only had a few weeks. Nor would they have brought a popular mandate and a new conference to begin.) In the first year, President Beals signed the legislation pages John F. Kennedy 1 404,684 Dwight Eisenhower 1,514, 107 George H.W. Bush 242 2,518 Jimmy Carter wrote down the fact-finding blog cited on 13 January 2021 in a story written by General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejecting Nancy Belusi's request for the use of Marines for inaugural security, and saying to her, \"We are not working for you.\" Govtrack.us presented this chart showing the Trump ranking among the ten presidents throughout 2017. It shows that he moved to first place on about 100 days of his presidency, but fell to seventh place in the next two months, slipped to 10 out of 10 as the end of his first calendar year approached. It should also be noted that not all legislation is equally important. On the one hand, Trump signed the tax amendment, a bill with significant consequences. On several occasions, Trump used the Congress Review Act -- a power that had been used slightly in the past, making it easier for Congress and the President to repeal federal regulations. But the figures - for all heads, not just Trump - are added to less important bills. Some of the ones that Trump signed were federal spending bills of the kind that were periodically required of every president and congressman to keep the government running. Some were objective but limited in impact, such as a draft law reforming the travel policy of public officials or a measure dealing with the fleets of vehicles of the Ministry of National Security. There were others who were in nature celebratory, such as the official name of a federal court in Tennessee or a memorial currency for the American Legion. (This is a complete list.) It should also be noted that Trump is working with a Congress controlled by his party, an asset that only some of his predecessors had at the beginning of his term of office. All that was said was that the Trump statement was \"unconscionable,\" and Max J. Skidmore, a political scientist at the University of Missouri-Kansas, wrote several books about the presidency. Trump signed one major piece of legislation, barely working on it in his first year. The White House did not respond to a query about this article. Our referee Trump said, \"We've signed more legislation than anyone else. We broke Harry Truman's record.\" On his first 100 days, Trump signed most of the bills of any president since Truman. Since then, however, it has declined more and more. Just days before the end of his first calendar year in office, Trump was the last among the 10 post-war Presidents who began their term of office at the regular session.
