The prosecution contains a list of individuals with photographs along with their \"known names\" followed by their newly exposed \"real names.\" President Donald Trump finally took out the list as the only person who claims to be using his real name. The article (which misses many names) says: \"O.K. This is warned: Obama's real name is Barack Hussein: Barry Sotoro. The real name of Kamala Harris: Maya Harrison. The real name is Omar. The real name of Bill Deblazio is Warren Wilhelm Jr., the real name of Elizabeth Warren is Liz Herring. The real name of Pete Butigig is Paul Montgomery. The real name of Bernie Sanders is Bernard Gottman. The real name of Donald J. Trump is Donald J. Trump. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The list consists of prenuptial names, middle names, relatives and titles. Let's get this guy on the individual. President Obama Post says his real name is Barry Sotoro. As stated in his birth certificate, the full real name of President Barack Obama is Barack Hussein Obama, the second. We checked the facts earlier where the names of Barry Sotoro and Barack Hussein Obama intersect. Barry was a childish nickname for Brack. He was named Sotoro, the last name of his stepfather Lulu Sotoro, when he was young and raised in Indonesia. At the age of 10, Obama returned to his hometown in Hawaii and stopped using the last name. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" This is wrong. She was named Kamala Davy Harris when she was born in Oakland on October 20, 1964. - Elehan Omar. - Post says her real name is Elehan. No. The name of the American Republic is Ehan Omar \"The Real\" Ilham Abdullah Omar. Congresswoman Minnesota married and divorced a man named Ahmed Nur Said Elmi. (Not Elsie, as followed by the mail.) Bill de Blacio Post says his real name is Warren Wilhelm Jr. Bill de Blacio was born Warren Wilhelm Jr. on May 8, 1961 in Manhattan. However, in 1983, he petitioned a New York court to change his name to Warren de Plasio-Wilm because he said that his father was largely absent and that he wanted to embrace his mother &apos; s Italian heritage. The name Bill de Blacio was officially adopted in January 2002. Elizabeth Warren Post says her real name is Liz Herring. The real name of Elizabeth Warren is Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Ann Herring was born in Oklahoma City to the parents of Donald and Pauline Herring. \"Liz,\" of course, is a common short alias for Elizabeth. (Her maiden name, Betsy, is what her mother called her.) She and her first husband, Jim Warren, kept the last name Warren, divorced in 1980. Pete Buttigig says his real name is Peter Montgomery. That's a weird cherry choice. The full name of the Mayor is Peter Paul Montgomery Butigig (not \"Potege\" as spelled by the post). He is the only child of Joseph Butigig and Jennifer Ann Montgomery Butig. Bernie Sanders Post says his real name is Bernard Gottman. The real name of Bernie Sanders is Bernard Sanders. His parents were Elias the son of Judah Sanders and Dorothy Glassberg. It appears that the mistaken belief that the senator's family name is actually Gottman came from the United States Immigration Register in 1921 when his father arrived from Poland. The record states that Sanders' father is Elias Gittman, although he was naturalized under the authority of Elias Sanders. The registration lists the grandmother of Bernie Sanders in the name of Jetty Gottman, whose name was married. Our Facebook article on HIV claims that a list of prominent democratic politicians hide their true identities from the public and share what their true identities say. The names that candidates are accused of forgery are in fact legal names. The Facebook newspaper publishes their prenuptial names, titles, titles, middle names and, in one case, the name of the brother to make candidates look outrageous.
