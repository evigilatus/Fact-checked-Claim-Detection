In an interview with \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert later that day, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said her party had been more than fair.\n\"You would have thought that the Republicans would all vote for it, because it gave them more rights than we ever received in any of the other impeachment proceedings,\" Pelosi said Oct. 31.\nWe spoke with Pelosi\u2019s staff to learn what she meant when she said the Republicans are getting more rights than Democrats got during the impeachments of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\nThe comparison is a bit convoluted to begin with, because while Democrats were in the minority during Clinton\u2019s impeachment in 1998, Democrats were in the majority in 1974 for the impeachment of Nixon. That put them in a stronger position than the House Republicans are in today.\nPelosi\u2019s claim that Republicans are getting more rights comes down to two measures: the number of lawmakers involved, and their power to call witnesses and ask them questions.\u00a0\nOn the first, Pelosi\u2019s staff say there are twice as many committees involved and so, twice as many minority party lawmakers.\nThat is accurate compared with past impeachments, however, compared with what has taken place so far, the resolution\u2019s focus on the two committees means that several other committees will now play smaller roles. Many Republicans on committees such as Oversight and Foreign Affairs have been able to participate when key witnesses testified. They will lose that under this resolution.\nFor the Nixon and Clinton proceedings, all the action was in the House Judiciary Committee.\u00a0\nUnder the just-passed resolution, duties are split between the Intelligence and Judiciary committees.\nThe Intelligence Committee conducts the investigation. The Judiciary then assesses whether those findings add up to an impeachable offense. The rules laid out in the House resolution and by the Judiciary Committee chair give Republicans equal time to question witnesses.\u00a0It does so in more detail than in the Nixon and Clinton House resolutions.\nPelosi\u2019s office said, compared with the past, more Republican members can participate, and everything the committees produce is shared equally.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Intelligence Committee minority members are now not only able to question witnesses on equal grounds with Democrats, the resolution provides them the ability to call witnesses,\" they said in a statement. \"Thus, twice as many committees and their respective minorities possess this subpoena power.\"\nSubpoena power not quite equal\nThe ability to call witnesses is key, and Republicans have complained that they don\u2019t get exactly what the minority party got during the Nixon and Clinton impeachments. We looked into this in a separate fact-check of a claim from Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla.\nOn paper, that\u2019s somewhat accurate. In 1974 and 1998, members of both parties could call witnesses. Either side could object to a witness, in which case, the dispute would ultimately be resolved by committee vote. Today, the Republicans lack the power to challenge a Democratic subpoena.\nThe practical impact is less telling, because in the past as in the present, the majority party always has the votes to win at the committee level. Effectively, members of the minority party, then and now, have less subpoena power than the majority.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that bipartisanship was in force during the Nixon impeachment, and these issues were not so contentious. The House resolution to start the inquiry passed 410 to 4. The Trump investigation resolution passed 232 to 196.\nThe starting point changed\nSarah Binder at George Washington University said that the rules for calling witnesses, and thus the power to shape an inquiry, \"changed markedly\" since the Clinton hearings.\nIn 2015, Republicans rewrote the standing House rules and gave committee chairs the automatic right to subpoena witnesses. The most that would be needed would be to consult with the minority, not win their approval.\nBinder said, \"it would be a bit eye opening\" if Democrats today rolled back the authority the Republicans established. The House, she said, has always been run by the majority.\n\"It's long been the nature of the beast,\" she said.\nOur ruling\nPelosi said that Republicans get more rights today than Democrats had in past impeachments. Today, Republicans on two House committees can participate, rather than just one. But Pelosi\u2019s focus on past impeachments downplays that Republicans on other committees will have less opportunity to participate than they enjoyed before the resolution passed.\nRepublicans also have less ability to use a committee vote to challenge Democratic subpoenas today than in 1974 and 1998. But practically speaking, the impact is minimal. The majority party can always win a committee vote if it wants to challenge the calling of a witness.\nUltimately, the differences are not large. In the House, the majority always has the edge. The Republicans now have slightly different options \u2014 most notably, there are more participants \u2014 than the minorities in previous impeachments. But that doesn\u2019t give them much more say in the proceedings.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16742"}
