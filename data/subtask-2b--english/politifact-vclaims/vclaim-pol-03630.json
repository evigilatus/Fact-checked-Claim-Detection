Democrats say such policies suppress the vote. Republicans say they cut down on voter fraud.\n\"I've spent a substantial portion of my life doing these cases at (the) Department of Justice,\" Perez said at the debate. \"Let me give you some facts and figures. We sued Texas, and we won. And we won, because over a 10-year period, 46 million votes were cast -- zero, count them, zero reported incidents of illegal noncitizen voting, two incidents of in-person voter fraud, (out of) 46 million votes cast. If we weren't on television I would call this a word that begins with a B. I will anyway. It's bunk. And you know what, it's bunk in every other case. And if you're in Texas, you have got to drive 120 miles to get an ID. If you're poor, that is a poll tax.\"\nThis includes a lot of different claims, but we will look at one aspect. Is it true that you have to drive 120 miles to get an acceptable ID in Texas?\nThe short answer: The vast majority of Texans don\u2019t. Residents of its big metropolitan areas like Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin will certainly have a driver's license office much closer than that.\nHowever, for a small percentage of the population, the trip could be that far, or even farther.\nThe source of the talking point\nThe statistic comes from testimony against Texas\u2019 voter ID law, which required voters to show certain forms of a government-issued ID.\nThe law, signed in 2011 by then-Gov. Rick Perry, required voters to show a valid government-issued photo ID, such as a Texas driver's license, Department of Public Safety identification card, state concealed handgun license, U.S. military ID or U.S. passport.\nWhen the law was under attack, Texas state Sen. Carlos Uresti, a Democrat from San Antonio, testified that some of his constituents would have to drive up to 120 miles to secure a driver\u2019s license, the Houston Chronicle reported.\nThis bit of testimony appears to have been picked up by federal appellate judges in Washington, who ultimately issued a unanimous ruling striking down the law.\nDuring oral arguments, U.S. Appeals Court Judge Robert L. Wilkins asked the attorney defending the law for the state whether the law would be a burden on people having to travel more than 100 miles for a driver\u2019s license. \"How does that impact your argument?\" Wilkins asked. \"Isn\u2019t that unduly burdensome?\"\nJohn Hughes, the attorney for Texas, said rural Texans are used to driving long distances, according to the Washington Post. \"People who want to vote already have an ID or can easily get it,\" he told the judges.\nBut another judge on the panel, David S. Tatel, said, \"The record tells us there is a subset of registered voters who lack ID. We have to think about the economic burden and the fact that minorities are disproportionately poor.\" He, too, cited the 120-mile drive statistic, the Post reported.\nAnd the talking point made it into the ruling in which the appeals court struck down the law.\nThat said, the claim deserves some context.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere would someone have to drive that far?\nUresti, the Texas state senator, had testified that the drive could be up to 120 miles for some Texans who live between San Antonio and El Paso -- basically, the lightly populated western portion of the state. So that\u2019s where we focused our attention.\nWe found one newspaper reader who contributed some thoughts on the law to the Dallas Morning News. Kirby Warnock, of the Dallas suburb of Oak Cliff, told the paper that he has family in the Big Bend region, a rural area of west Texas along the Rio Grande.\n\"If a person lives in tiny Imperial, or Terlingua, they have to get a friend or family member to drive them 60 miles and 120 miles respectively, round-trip, just to be able to vote,\" Warnock said.\nSo we looked at the situation in Terlingua. According to the Texas driver\u2019s license handbook, the closest driver\u2019s license office to Terlingua is in Alpine. According to Google Maps, that is 83.4 miles one way, or about 167 miles round trip. That\u2019s an even longer distance than Perez had said.\nThis shows that there\u2019s at least one place in Texas that would require more than a 120-mile round-trip journey. (Imperial, Texas, for the record, is only 30 miles from Fort Stockton, or a 60-mile round trip, as Warnock indicated.) It\u2019s also worth noting that the 9,145 people who live in Brewster County, Texas -- where Terlingua is located -- are 43 percent Hispanic, which is a bit higher than the state average.\nConsidering that there are no driver\u2019s license offices in 81 of the state\u2019s 254 counties, it\u2019s not hard to imagine that there are other locales beyond Terlingua for which a 120-mile round trip would be necessary to secure a driver\u2019s license.\nHow common would such a long trip be?\nBut just because a 120-mile drive is possible in Texas doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s common. Most of its 27.5 million people live in metropolitan areas.\nTo get a handle on how many people might be impacted by long trips for a driver\u2019s license, we looked at the 81 smallest-population counties in the state.\nAs it turns out, the population of Texas\u2019s 81 least-populated counties is 343,823, or 1.3 percent of the overall state population. And it\u2019s likely that many of them already have a driver\u2019s license.\nSo the 120-mile threshold is a pretty extreme scenario that affects a tiny slice of Texas\u2019 population. That said, it\u2019s still possible that the law would be a burden for thousands of rural residents living far from a Department of Public Safety office.\nOur ruling\nPerez said, \"If you're in Texas, you have got to drive 120 miles to get an ID.\"\nHe has some basis for this statement: The 120-mile figure did crop up in the court case against the law, and we found at least one example of a west Texas town for which the distance was actually even longer.\nHowever, Perez not only failed to communicate just how rare this scenario is, but he didn\u2019t even use a basic qualifier like \"some people in Texas.\" Taken literally, he said everyone in Texas has to drive 120 miles to get a license.\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.\nCORRECTION, Feb, 27, 2017, 11 a.m.: After we published this article, several readers noted that there was a closer driver\u2019s license office to Terlingua than Fort Stockton -- the one in Alpine. We have changed the article to reflect this. We have not changed our rating.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fd5bccc4-db1f-4a28-9f62-e4bbba9e2063", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03630"}
