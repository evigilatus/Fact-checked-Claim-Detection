We found that AARP and Humana actually have very different roles with Medicare plans. AARP makes money by licensing its name to a private insurer that offers a Medicare Advantage plan. Humana is a different private insurer that takes money from the government to provide an Advantage plan.\nHumana contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in a program called Medicare Advantage. Often called Medicare's HMOs, Advantage is an optional program in which the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries. The program was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened, and Medicare Advantage actually costs the government more. President Barack Obama and groups like AARP have said it's time to bring the costs of Medicare Advantage in line with the cost of regular Medicare.\nHumana is the second-largest insurance company that handles Medicare Advantage, right after UnitedHealth Group.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that runs Medicare and is often referred to as CMS, recently announced it was looking into mailings that Humana sent to its Medicare Advantage and Part D patients. (Part D is Medicare coverage for prescription drugs.)\n\"We are concerned that the materials Humana sent to our beneficiaries may violate Medicare rules by appearing to contain Medicare Advantage and prescription drug benefit information, which must be submitted to CMS for review,\" said Jonathan Blum, acting director of CMS's Center for Drug and Health Plan Choices. \"We also are asking that no other plan sponsors are mailing similar materials while we investigate whether a potential violation has occurred.\"\nAccording to the CMS, Humana's mailing warned beneficiaries that they might lose benefits under health care reform, a claim that Democratic officials dispute. The  Huffington Post  said it has obtained  a copy of the mailer  and posted it to its Web site.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

We examined a claim by President Barack Obama that  Medicare benefits would not be cut  and found it to be Half True. Experts told us basic benefits would stay in place but that it's conceivable or even likely that Medicare Advantage patients could see reduced benefits.\nIn a letter to Humana, a CMS official said that Humana's communication could be considered \"misleading and confusing to beneficiaries\" and might be construed as official Medicare communications.\nThe House Republican Conference said CMS did not target the seniors' group \"quite possibly because AARP has been supporting a health care overhaul ...\"\nOur research shows, however, that AARP has a very different relationship with its members than Humana does with seniors on Medicare Advantage.\nHere's how it works: AARP lends its name to insurance companies to sell policies specifically for AARP members. The insurance companies then pay AARP a fee for the policies they sell with the AARP name. AARP calls these payments royalties. (Read our story for more details on  AARP's royalties  .)\nAARP does profit indirectly from selling Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplemental policies, and it uses that money to fund its efforts as a nonprofit advocacy group.\nAARP partners with UnitedHealth on its Medicare plans. UnitedHealth is the No. 1 seller of Medicare Advantage, with 16 percent of the market, followed closely by Humana with 14 percent of the market, according to Mark Farrah Associates.\nSo when AARP mails seniors, it's using its own private membership list for communication.\nHumana, on the other hand, is mailing people using personal information it receives as a government contractor. UnitedHealth would be bound by similar rules.\nWe find that the House Republican Conference is off base when it claims that the CMS and the Obama administration have two different standards for AARP and Humana. Humana is a government contractor for Medicare Advantage; the AARP is not. We rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15552"}
