The post includes what looks like a still of a TV segment with photos of Andrew Gillum, the Democrat running for Florida governor, and Ron DeSantis, his Republican opponent. The figures \"49.4%\" and \"3,343,634\" appear near Gillum\u2019s picture, and \"48.8%\" and \"3,297,970\" next to DeSantis\u2019s. In the top right corner is a graphic that reads: \"Close Call: 99% In.\"\n\"This was shown on MSNBC last night, calling the race for Gillum. Look at the upper right corner-\u201999% in\u2019 referring to Florida voting,\" the post says. It then quotes a Huffington Post story without attribution. \"Oops,\" the story stars. \"MSNBC on Monday inadvertently aired what looked like live results of the heated gubernatorial election in Florida \u2014 a day before the actual voting.\"\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe image actually did air, but the network was quick to say it was an error. (We saw the image that aired on \"All In With Chris Hayes\" on Nov. 5 at around the 12:15 mark of the episode that was posted to YouTube. Hayes\u2019s correction comes around 28:30.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Obviously, we do not yet have any vote totals here the night before the election. That was a misfire. Don\u2019t worry, I was pretty confused when I saw it up there.\"\nFlorida results are not yet available, said Sarah Revell, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of State, and preliminary unofficial election results won\u2019t be posted to the Florida Election Watch website until 8 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\"Florida\u2019s elections are not rigged,\" Revell said in an email. \"No election fraud complaints have been filed with our office today. Our Voter Assistance Hotline is open and has been assisting voters who are calling in with questions about where to vote, how to vote, etc.\"\nThough MSNBC aired a graphic that looked like Gillum won the tight gubernatorial race, the network quickly said it was a mistake. As Hayes said earlier in the segment: \"We have quite simply never seen a midterm election like this one.\" But, he added, \"we don\u2019t know, let\u2019s be clear, how all this energy will translate to election results.\" \u00a0\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-11-07 15:14:54 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says MSNBC called the Florida governor\u2019s race for Andrew Gillum before Election Day.
