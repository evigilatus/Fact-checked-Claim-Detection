On Fox News\u2019 The Five, panelist Juan Williams said he feels more threatened by the number of guns on the street in New York and Washington, D.C., than he does by the militant Muslim group ISIS.\nShow co-host Eric Bolling shot back, \"In countries where there are higher, more strict gun laws, there is more gun violence.\"\nWe decided to see if Bolling had his facts straight.\nWe couldn\u2019t find proof that he did, and neither Bolling nor Fox News got back to us to show otherwise.\nThere is no hard and fast yardstick to compare gun laws across nations, but there are some rough indicators. The United States is unusual in framing gun ownership as a right, so at the most basic legal level, most countries begin from a\u00a0more restrictive starting point.\nThere\u2019s helpful data on gun regulation in other countries from the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland.\nAccording to the group\u2019s 2011 small arms survey, personal protection is not a sufficient reason to own a weapon in Australia and the United Kingdom. In fact, in the United Kingdom, the 1996 slayings of 16 school children in Scotland led to a ban on private handguns. Japan also bans handguns.\nCanada requires all would-be gun owners to get a license to own a gun. They must pass a background check and complete a safety course. If they then go and buy a weapon, they must register it. They can buy a gun for personal protection, but they must show that they face an imminent threat and that police protection is not good enough.\nIn a previous fact-check, a researcher at the study center in Geneva told us that Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom have some of the strictest gun regulations.\nComparing gun violence\nThe studies we found measured gun violence in terms of the rate of firearm-related homicides. By that standard, America ranks worst among every country of comparable economic status.\nDavid Hemenway at Harvard\u2019s School of Public Health has looked at gun deaths across nations.\n\"If we look at high-income countries, the weakest gun control laws are in the United States, and we have by far the most gun violence,\" Hemenway said. \"At the other extreme are the U.K. and Japan, which have the strongest gun laws, and they have among the lowest levels of gun violence.\"\nThe World Bank provides a list of high-income countries. Based on data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and reporting by the Guardian, America does top the list for the rate of murder by gun fire with a rate of 2.97 deaths per 100,000. Chile comes next, but Chile is not on the list of wealthy nations with strict gun laws. (The full list is here.)\nIn the wealthy\u00a0group with strict laws, the data undercut Bolling\u2019s claim.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\n\n\nHomicide by firearm rate per 100,000 population\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n2.97\n\n\n\n\nCanada\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\n0.14\n\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n\n\nJapan\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: UNODC, Guardian\nFor the countries that have tougher gun laws but lower wealth than the United States, South Africa has a higher rate of gun violence, 17.03 deaths per 100,000, and Singapore has a lower rate, .02 deaths per 100,000.\nOur ruling\nBolling said that countries with tougher gun laws have more gun violence. \u00a0The data show that among countries more like America economically, nations with stricter regulation have much lower rates of gun-related homicides. South Africa has tougher laws but is much poorer, and it is the only exception. Bolling described a pattern that does not exist.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06013"}
