This is a misleading allegation circulated on a false website. \"The United Nations has been caught with the help and training of illegal aliens!\" He said the headline of Nov 22 is on Usanetwork. It appears that the U.S. web site sign and its web address are on the Internet. Info, it tries to disguise itself as a television channel in USA Network. The Internet address for the actual network of the United States of America is usanetwork.com. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The title and story of the article indicate that the United Nations has been detected or highlighted for efforts to move the convoy into the United States. That's not true. The United Nations has provided assistance to migrants, none of which has been done in a confidential manner. In October, the Mexican Government requested United Nations assistance to respond to the needs of migrants and to immigration requests. In accordance with its humanitarian mission, the United Nations Refugee Agency sent staff to Mexico to assist the authorities in registering asylum-seekers, assisting in the accommodation of migrants, and establishing \"identification and referral mechanisms for those with specific vulnerabilities and needs.\" The United Nations also stated that it provided legal advice and advice to people in convoys. The organization considers it essential that migrants be given the opportunity to seek asylum and that their international protection needs be duly assessed before they are returned by the authorities to their countries of origin. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverdi, February 3, 2012, the United States web site does not describe the situation in this way. \"The United Nations was simply found in a bargaining position that helps the motorcade travel to the margin,\" said the userwork.info. \"What's more, now, the United Nations authorities are training illegal homeless people in the best way to pick up printed materials and shelter them!\" This article falsely alleges that the United Nations paid for transportation to accelerate the movement of the convoy in Mexico and towards the southern border of the United States. (The United Nations refused a request from immigrants for buses.) The site also supports reductions in United States financial assistance to the United Nations. The GOP is really gonna make the United Nations with a large number of American taxdol.laers! You have to stop them!\" The mail said. \"It would be perfect to send your moment and your letters to Congress at this moment and force them to protect Trump's slides to the United Nations and pass the American Sovereignty Restoration Act to cut off the rest of the support.\" Info says, \"The UN has captured the assistance and training of illegal aliens!\" The United Nations was not \"learning to assist and train\" migrants in convoys wishing to come to the United States. The United Nations has openly provided humanitarian assistance and advice to migrants. The organization stated that immigrants should be allowed to apply for asylum. This position mischaracterizes the work of the United Nations. We assess it wrong.
