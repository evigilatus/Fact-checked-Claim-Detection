The ban was lifted in June 2009. Currently, political leaders in Georgia, Alabama and Florida are battling over a water-sharing agreement.\n\nA county spokeswoman suggested Gwinnett residents and business owners are being more conscious about conserving water.\n\n\"It would seem the water conservation trend that started during the extreme drought continues,\" Gwinnett spokeswoman Heather Sawyer told us in an email to explain why water use has declined in Georgia\u2019s second-highest-populated county.\n\nSawyer also suggested Gwinnett\u2019s toilet rebate program may be another factor in conserving water. The program gives homeowners a $50 to $100 discount for installing toilets that use less water when flushed.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia was still curious about Nash\u2019s numbers. The county\u2019s population grew, according to U.S. census figures, from 588,450 residents in 2000 to more than 805,000 in 2010, a 37 percent increase. Nash\u2019s statement claimed the county\u2019s water use dropped by 18 percent in four years, yet the county\u2019s population increased by 37 percent over the past 10 years.\n\nGwinnett officials provided us a spreadsheet with annual water use data dating to 1999. The average daily use for most years between 1999 and 2007 was nearly 84 million gallons a day. In 2007, the year the drought restrictions took effect, the average daily use was 86.4 million gallons a day. In 2008, the average daily use in Gwinnett dropped to just below 72 million gallons a day. The one-year decline was nearly 17 percent.\n\nThat one-year decline was actually less than the drop in the region, state officials told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2008. They said water use in North Georgia dropped by 24 percent from August 2007 to August 2008.\n\nWe felt better about believing the drop in water use in Gwinnett between 2007 and 2008. So, let\u2019s take a closer look at Nash\u2019s claim of an 18 percent decline from 2006 to 2010.\n\nSawyer alerted us to an error in the math work. Staffers used the difference between the 2006 and 2009 totals to come up with the 18 percent reduction. Gwinnett officials say the average daily use was 87.4 million gallons in 2006 and 71.3 million gallons a day in 2009. In 2010, the average daily use was 74.7 million gallons a day. That is a 14.3 percent decline.\n\nSince the 14 percent reduction is pretty close to 18 percent, we don\u2019t consider the error to be that egregious. We rate Nash\u2019s claim as Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSally Bethea\n\n\nstated on April 9, 2011 in an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In three years we could find close to 50 million gallons per day through a toilet replacement program.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 April 4, 2011", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13011"}
