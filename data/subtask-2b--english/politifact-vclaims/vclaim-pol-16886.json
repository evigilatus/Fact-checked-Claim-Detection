But there is no evidence entertainment celebrities are organizing a strike until he\u2019s removed from office.\u00a0\nAccording to public domain records, News Mag was registered on March 18. We found several copies of the Hollywood strike article on other bogus websites posing as legitimate news organizations.\nThe claim that Hollywood is organizing an anti-Trump strike has been circulating online since he was elected. Other fact-checking outlets, including PolitiFact, have debunked versions of the hoax.\u00a0\nThe rumor appears to have stemmed from a January 2017 ad in the New York Times by a group called Refuse Fascism. The group included O\u2019Donnell and called for millions to hold a protest and sign a petition to \"create a political crisis that prevents the Trump/Pence fascist regime from consolidating its hold on the governance of society.\"\nMany celebrities signed the petition, but they weren\u2019t calling for a strike. And we could find no evidence to support the latest version of the hoax.\nThe article is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16886"}
