A C-SPAN video catches Biden saying the words that drove the headline.\n\"I tell all the guys that ask me about getting married is that you always marry into a family with three or four sisters,\" Biden says. \"I married one with five. Know why? That way, one will always love you...not the same one.\"\n\"America\u2019s had its fill of creepy, womanizing presidents,\" the post said. \"Is he saying that he cheats on his wife\u2026 with one of her sisters?\"\nThis plays off of stories that have dogged Biden of being too physical with women and overstepping the boundaries of personal space.\nBut the piece gets the context of these comments decidedly wrong \u2014 Biden was talking to and sympathizing with a woman whose sister had recently died. The short video in the article misses those key details.\nHere\u2019s the full exchange and setting, which begins at 1:18:30 in the C-SPAN video:\nBiden is mixing it up with supporters. A middle-aged woman comes up, introduces her husband and her sister.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had a sister who passed away four weeks ago,\" she says.\nBiden shakes his head in sympathy and they take a selfie with the woman and her sister.\u00a0\n\"I tell all the guys that ask me about getting married is that you always marry into a family with three or four sisters,\" Biden said. \"I married one with five.

How old was she?\nThe answer is indistinct. Biden shakes his head and says, \"ugh.\"\nThepoliticalbrief.com copied the article word for word from a site called GOP Daily Brief. A short video snippet of the moment in Iowa came from a tweet.\u00a0\nThe article cast Biden\u2019s words as sexist, and by ignoring who he was speaking to and what they were talking about, it suggests he was talking to a man, not a woman.\nSome people might see Biden\u2019s words as awkward, but they had nothing to do with what the article said.\nThe article is a distortion.
