What does that mean to people in New Hampshire? It means she was the deciding vote for Obamacare. \u2026 She\u2019s also voted to put in place policies where we have more and more gridlock by voting with her party over 99 percent of the time.\"\nBrown has delivered variations of this claim so frequently over the past few months that anyone in New Hampshire who\u2019s been plugged into an electronic device has surely heard it. It\u2019s been a mainstay of Brown\u2019s ads in a frenzied air war -- so far in the race for U.S. Senate, more than 10,000 ads have aired costing, more than $7 million.\nPolitiFact New Hampshire looked into a version of this claim last March, after the New Hampshire Republican Party released a web video titled \"99 Percent.\" It claimed that Shaheen consistently supports the president and \"votes with Obama 99 percent of the time.\" The ad was launched before Brown had officially declared himself a candidate in the race.\nHere, we\u2019ll look at Brown\u2019s claim that Shaheen has \"voted with the president 99 percent of the time.\" \u00a0(Last year PolitiFact New Hampshire checked the claim that Shaheen was the deciding vote for Obamacare and ruled that Mostly False.)\nBrown\u2019s charge carries some weight. Even though Obama won New Hampshire twice, a majority of residents (55 percent) now disapprove of his job performance, and his signature legislative accomplishment -- the Affordable Care Act, or \"Obamacare\" -- is opposed by 52 percent of the people in the state, according to findings from an Oct. 10, 2014 Granite State Poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.\nDemocrats across the country have faced similar critiques from Republicans; PolitiFact has frequently checked such claims and found them to have varying degrees of accuracy.\nObama himself acknowledged the strategy during a speech at Northwestern University on Oct. 2, 2014.\n\"Now, I am not on the ballot this fall,\" Obama said. \"But make no mistake: \u00a0These policies are on the ballot -- every single one of them.\"\nDuring the debate, Brown even quoted the president to drive home his point.\nOf course, most politicians fall in line with the president when their party controls the White House. Still, we decided it would still be useful to dig into Shaheen\u2019s voting record to see whether Brown was correct.\nWhen we checked this claim previously, we asked the NHGOP for evidence. Executive director Matt Mowers pointed us toward Congressional Quarterly\u2019s annual presidential position votes report.\nCQ, a news service that covers Capitol Hill, examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow for comparisons. One of those ways is an annual examination of presidential support -- the number of votes by each lawmaker on bills in which the sitting president has staked out a position.\nThe 2013 CQ analysis shows that, when you look at the pool of votes in which Obama took a clear position, Shaheen\u2019s vote matched the president\u2019s stance 99 percent of the time.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank Guinta\n\n\nstated on June 13, 2012 in a statement made after he filed for re-election at the N.H. Secretary of State\u2019s office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, in the House of Representatives, we have 40 different jobs bills that have passed and almost all of them have been bipartisan.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jake Berry \u2022 June 22, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, there\u2019s more to that number than meets the eye.\nIn 2013, the Senate took 291 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on 108 of those votes -- \u00a0about one third.\nWMUR political reporter James Pindell further analyzed the figures and found that 70 of those votes involved presidential nominations -- to positions that ranged from Secretary of State John Kerry to a variety of federal judgeships. The remaining 38 involved some type of public policy, including seven on immigration, four on gun policy, and five budget bills.\nThe only time Shaheen voted against Obama in 2013 came on a bill involving an Internet sales tax, Pindell reported.\nWe found similar figures across CQ reports since Shaheen took office, which coincided with Obama\u2019s election to his first term. CQ put her voting with Obama at least 95 percent of the time each year.\nOverall, during the five years since Shaheen took office, Shaheen\u2019s votes have aligned with the president\u2019s position 98 percent of the time.\nThat\u2019s pretty close to the 99 percent figure, however, it\u2019s important to note some limitations of judging Shaheen\u2019s support for the president based solely on the CQ analysis.\nShaheen communications director Shripal Shah noted that the senator had broken with Obama on some issues that do not come to a vote; these are not reflected in the CQ tally.\nFor instance, Shah noted that Shaheen spoke out against a new round of military base closures, an idea the Obama administration advanced in budget proposals, and she opposed a proposal floated by the president to change Social Security benefits.\nThere are also other ways to measure Shaheen\u2019s voting tendencies. OpenCongress, a nonpartisan legislative tracking service, found that in 2013, Shaheen voted with the majority of Democrats 93.1 percent of the time. That\u2019s less frequently than the average Democrat in the Senate, putting her on the bottom half of the list.\nFinally, in June 2013, Shaheen was featured as a \"Bipartisan Champion\" by the Bipartisan Policy Center for her work on energy efficiency legislation.\n\"It's disingenuous to draw conclusions about Sen. Shaheen's record by only looking at a small number of votes,\" Shah said.\nOur ruling\nScott Brown said Shaheen votes with Obama 99 percent of the time.\nBrown has credible support for this claim -- in 2013, Shaheen took the same position as the president 99 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, based on analysis by Congressional Quarterly. That wasn\u2019t much different than earlier years in the Senate -- overall, her votes have aligned with Obama\u2019s 98 percent of the time since she took office.\nStill, the CQ ratings address a fraction of all issues facing Congress. Obama only took a clear position in about one third of the Senate votes, and in some issues that didn\u2019t come to a vote, Shaheen broke with the President.\nStill, Brown\u2019s claim about Shaheen isn\u2019t far off. We rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07105"}
