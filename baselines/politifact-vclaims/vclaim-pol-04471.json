(A statistical impossibility.)\"\nThe second statement says that \"106,258 people in Wood County are registered to vote out of an eligible 98,213.\"\nThe third says, \"In one Ohio county, Obama won by 108 percent of the total number of eligible voters.\"\nIs something rotten in Wood? These claims unravel quickly with a check of 2012 poll results.\n100 percent of the vote?\nWe\u2019ll start with the claim about Obama getting 100 percent of the votes in 21 Wood County \"districts.\" First off, in Ohio they\u2019re called precincts, not districts.\nA precinct-by-precinct check shows that neither presidential candidate received 100 percent of the votes in any of the county\u2019s 97 precincts. (Therefore, Romney also earned votes, contrary to the claim.)\nOther fact-checkers also cast doubt on these allegations. As fellow fact-checkers at Snopes rightly noted, \"The highest percentage (Obama) achieved in any one precinct was 75.5 percent.\"\nFactCheck.org asked Terry Burton, director of the elections board in Wood County, about GOP inspectors being removed. \"No precinct officials were removed during Election Day and no issues were identified during a recount,\" he answered.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhost registrations\nNow for the post\u2019s second statement about over-registrations. The 98,213 number comes from the 2010 census total of people 18 and over in Wood County.\nAccording to the election board\u2019s data from 2012, there were 108,014 registered voters in the county at that time \u2014 an even bigger gap between people and voters than what the meme claimed.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there is foul play.\nPolitiFact Ohio found that the discrepancy is owed to the large population of college kids at Bowling Green. Students register to vote there and later graduate and move away, abandoning their voter registrations along with their raggedy couches. \u00a0\nElections officials are allowed to purge the rolls of inactive voters after they miss three successive federal elections \u2014 a practice that Ohio\u2019s Secretary of State Jon Husted has defended as Election Day 2016 approaches.\n108 percent\nNow let\u2019s consider the post\u2019s vague reference to \"one Ohio county\" where Obama allegedly got 108 percent of the vote. The numbers for Wood County, where the meme suggests that fraud is so rampant, lead us to believe that this is still about Wood. The number of registered voters, 106,258, is about 108 percent of 98,213, the size of the vote-eligible population in 2012.\nBut election results show that in real life, Obama received 51 percent of the vote in Wood County.\nWe asked Carol DeJong, deputy director of the Wood County Board of Elections, why conspiracy theorists are obsessed with her county. \"As a reporter, you would be better at solving that mystery,\" she replied via email.\nOur ruling\nA viral post makes several claims about 2012 voter fraud in Ohio, ginning up fears ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nBut the election tallies discredit the claims about voter fraud in Ohio.\nElection board officials cannot corroborate the claim of GOP monitors being \"illegally removed\" from polling places. The numbers 106,258 (registered voters) and 98,213 (residents old enough to vote) include the ghost registrations of inactive voters that lingered on the rolls. Finally, Obama got 51 percent of the vote in Wood County, not 108 percent.\nThis viral image is 108 percent wrong.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/86f594ee-8169-4425-9303-725a584210df", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04471"}
