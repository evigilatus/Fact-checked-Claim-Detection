But one was new to us. Trump said: \"Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 foreign criminals to return to United States societies.\" \"These are individuals who have been identified or identified by (migration and customs enforcement), but have not been detained or tried for deportation because it was not politically correct.\" As has been shown, the figures are much more complex than Tramp pointed out. Let's take a closer look. Where does 300 grand come from? Stephen Miller, spokesman for Trump, addressed us to Jessica M. Vaughn, Director of Policy Studies with the Centre for Migration Studies, an intellectual institution favouring more stringent immigration policies. (Officially, according to the Centre's website, the group's research has convinced many of its staff to be \"affected by the vision of low-migration, pro-immigrant\" of America, which accepts fewer immigrants but receives a warmer reception for those who enter it). Vaughn said the estimate of 300,000 comes from three different numbers. \u2022 In fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority released a total of 86,288 criminal aliens pending deportation proceedings. (In fact, this number decreased year after year, from 36,007 to 30,558 to 19,723). :: Saldana, Director of the Institute, at a hearing of the Committee for the Oversight of the House of Representatives and Government Reform on 28 April 2016. According to the Chairman of the Commission, the Republic of Jason Chavez, R-Utah, these 86,288 foreign criminals were collectively convicted of more than 231,000 crimes. \u2022 From 1 January 2014 to 30 September 2015, State and local law enforcement agencies rejected 18,646 applications from the Institute of Immigration and Customs to detain aliens who could be deported for non-immigration offences until the Institute was able to detain them. This figure was verified by the Intelligence and Security Service during an investigation conducted by the Tripion Authority in Texas. \u2022 According to Vaughan, between 2013 and 2015, the staff of the Institute, because of the discretionary authority of the Public Prosecutor's Office, \"deported more than 200,000 foreign criminals, instead of initiating deportation. Most of these were held locally at the time. The meetings were practical, usually prison interviews - not just review the list or get hit in a database.\" Vaughn said that this figure came from internal reports of the Immigration and Naturalization Authority from law enforcement activity - the weekly report on departures and detentions. The original documents are contained in the notes to the work of Vaughn here and here. If you put these three numbers together, they add up to approximately 300,000. How hard is 300 grand? On purely numerical grounds, the experts we reviewed did not express much concern about the first two categories, which combined have some 105,000 people. However, the figure of 200,000 is more controversial. Part of this concern stems from the heavy reliance on the Commission &apos; s Vaughan calculations, which have become necessary in part because the figures from the Commission are often unclear, difficult to obtain, or both. Adam Cox, a professor of law at New York University who studied the issue, said that Vaughn did not provide any evidence as to whether there was indeed a possible reason under the law to arrest most of those who had not been arrested. The report treats every confrontation by a CIA agent was the one we know could have been there a arrest. But as we know from many studies in many police contexts, many police confrontations end without arrest because there is no basis for arrest.\" Marco Rubio stated on 27 January 2021 in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders.\" \"We cannot confirm that ICE released 300,000 criminal migrants and did not place them in deportation proceedings,\" said Sarah Pierce, Associate Policy Analyst with the Institute of Migration Policy, a think tank that believes that well-managed migration brings \"benefits to migrants and their families, their communities of origin and destination, and sending and receiving countries.\" At the same time, another concern arises from differences of opinion on the meaning of the \"appreciatory power of claim.\" The Obama Administration has enacted a \"discretionary authority\" policy to prioritize deportation proceedings. The Guidelines establish a lower priority for expulsion for those who came to the United States before the age of 16, who are currently under the age of 30, who have resided continuously in the United States for five years, or who are in school, graduate, serve in the army or have been released honourably - and have not \"convicted of a felony, a major misdemeanour, or a multiple offence.\" For supporters, this simply makes sense: in a world of limited resources, the Immigration and Naturalization Authority should place the most dangerous or transferable individuals at the top of the list. However, for critics, this policy is a cover for failure to respect the law. According to Von, the current law provides that all illegal aliens present here \"may be subject to deportation regardless of whether they have other criminal convictions.\" Prioritization had not been driven by resource constraints or public safety considerations, but rather by \"political considerations.\" There is a related question as to whether it is reasonable to call Obama's policy \"political health,\" but this is an opinion, so we will put this aside. At the very least, we can say that there is a professional dispute as to whether the figure of 200,000 is the right one. Since this group represents two thirds of the total number referred to by Tramp, at least this raises the question of whether its figure of 300,000 is reliable. How did Trump accurately describe the statistics of Vaughn? Except for the question of whether the number is accurate, the experts told us that Trump made a few angles in the way he described the number in his speech. \u2022 The three categories are a combination of different statistics, and there may be some overlap. Vaughn acknowledges this, although she suspects that the impact will be small. She said: \"There may be some repetitions in the mix, if someone happens or is released more than once during the time period, but this is not enough to overestimate.\" \u2022 Trump is on the loose with his terms. He uses the term \"criminal aliens,\" although the widely accepted definition of that term refers only to category I of the three -- the category that has reached 86,288 over the three-year period. For the third category - cases in which a local law enforcement agency refuses to detain a person who is subject to deportation in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Authority - arrests, rather than convictions, make the term \"criminal alien\" inappropriate in at least some cases. Cox cited research showing that nearly one third of all non-citizens who had been so detained between 2008 and 2012 had not been convicted. \u2022 Putting all of this on the feet of the Obama administration is exaggerated. First of all, in her congressional testimony, Saldana stated that between one third and two thirds of the releases of offenders - category I - were required by law, not by choice of institute, by year. \"These people must also be released by ICE even if Trump is president, unless the agency plans to flout court orders and ignore the rules of detention written by Congress in law,\" said Cox. One problem, as we have stated before, is that in some cases the country of origin of the individual - particularly Cuba and Vietnam - has refused to accept them. We found that in fiscal year 2013, the refusal of the home country resulted in the release of 3,746 persons. (Critics, including Trump, say that the United States must work hard to punish those intransigent countries.) At the same time, the main actor in the third category is government and local law enforcement agencies, not the Obama administration, which means that \"it is very wrong to say that these foreigners' criminals were allowed by the Obama administration. ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ To return to United States societies, Cox said. In fact, he added, \"ICE was very unhappy about this resistance and worked hard to get local governments to comply with requests for detention, so it is misleading to say that ICE's responsible for any such releases.\" (Von replied that such releases \"would have been prevented had the Obama Administration taken action against\" protected cities, or jurisdictions that do not routinely transfer aliens who can be deported in their custody. \"Alternately, the administration has facilitated them.\" Our Governor Trump said that \"since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 foreign criminals to return to United States societies. These persons were confronted or identified by the CIA, but were not detained or tried for deportation because it was not politically correct.\" One can create a reasonably strong - if not guaranteed - case worth $100,000. But the migration professions are divided about the credibility of the next 200,000. Meanwhile, Trump's description of the number in his speech was not quite accurate. Anyway, we're assessing half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/af1634ea-c28a-4911-821c-8368a414fd05", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04375"}
