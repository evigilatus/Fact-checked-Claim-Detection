Scott Walker on the hot seat over his cuts to school funding in the 2011-\u201913 budget.\n\nWilliams opened by saying that among the 10 governors on the panel, only Walker was the subject of a social-media campaign questioning NBC\u2019s decision to include him -- with one Twitter post Williams read comparing it with \"having an arsonist talk about fire safety.\"\n\nThen he read from a letter sent to NBC by Wisconsin educator Heather DuBois Bourenane. The letter expressed shock that they were \"featuring Scott \u2018Teachers are Thugs\u2019 Walker at the summit.\"\n\nTwice in the minutes that followed, Williams pushed Walker hard on the origin of \"teachers are thugs\" reference. Had Walker said it in the heat of the protests over his successful push to sharply curtail collective bargaining rights for teachers and other public employees?\n\nWalker first said it \"came from the Internet and everything else\" and later flatly denied saying it. He then went further, as he described his encounters with teachers around the state.\n\n\"I\u2019d have an open forum for an hour with teachers at our schools and they\u2019d say, \u2018Why are you pickin\u2019 on teachers?\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018Go back to NBC, go back to YouTube, go back to all the statements I\u2019ve made earlier this year and you\u2019ll never find one time when I\u2019ve said anything but great things about our teachers.\u2019\"\n\nHe continued: \"The teachers who teach not only my kids but all the other children across the state of Wisconsin, are great public servants. What I\u2019m doing is long term, it\u2019s making a structural change so that more of them can stay in our classrooms.\"\n\nLet\u2019s see \u2026 high-profile statement, check. Strong comments, check. Important topic, check. A dispute over what was said, check.\n\nYes, this is one for PolitiFact.\n\nSo, is Walker right on the \"thugs\" comment and that he only had positive things to say about teachers?\n\nFirst, \"teachers are thugs.\"\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that prominent public officials -- as well as many political commentators -- \u00a0have freely applied the term \"thug\" to aspects of the 2011 collective bargaining battle.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, said death threats were \"thuggery,\" while former U.S. Rep. Dave Obey, D-Wausau, said Walker\u2019s move against unions itself was \"political thuggery.\"\n\nBloggers saw \"thuggery\" everywhere. In the damage done to the Capitol grounds. In the prank phone call made to Walker. In Walker telling that caller he considered planting troublemakers among protesters.\n\nThey also saw itin a union-supported boycott of pro-Walker businesses. In protesters\u2019 angry confrontation\u00a0 with Republican state Sen. Glenn Grothman. And in a GOP open records request for emails sent by a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who compared Walker\u2019s \"style\" to Joe McCarthy\u2019s.\n\nBut did Scott Walker say \"teachers are thugs\"?\n\nCertainly not in the sharp way that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie did in an April 2011 interview with ABC News about teachers there.\n\n\"I believe the teachers in New Jersey in the main are wonderful public servants that care deeply,\" Christie said. \"But their union, their union are a group of political thugs.\"\n\nWe could find no instance of Walker directly addressing teachers -- or their union -- in that fashion.\n\nWe did, though, find one instance in which Walker used a form of \"thug\" in discussing the reaction to his limits on unions.\n\nIt came in a March 10 appearance on conservative talk host Sean Hannity\u2019s TV show immediately after Republican lawmakers approved Walker\u2019s legislation, ending a stalemate with Senate Democrats who fled to Illinois and blocked a vote for more than three weeks.\n\nHannity asked Walker about \"mayhem\" at the Capitol, which was occupied for weeks by protesters. Hannity specifically mentioned Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald calling the Capitol \"unsafe\" for lawmakers trying to get to work, as well as reports of death threats against senators and protests outside Walker\u2019s Wauwatosa house.\n\nWalker answered: \"People should not be coming into the state trying to intimidate lawmakers, offer up threats or anything else. That\u2019s just not the way it\u2019s done, at least not in the Midwest. And thankfully, again, our lawmakers stood up to those sorts of thuggery attacks, and we\u2019re not going to allow that here in the state of Wisconsin. We can have good civil debate.\"\n\nHe added: \"The people who work for state and local government have been decent, and I respect them throughout this process. But the people coming in from other states, that bring these sorts of tactics, just don\u2019t belong here.\"\n\nIn the view of the state\u2019s largest teachers union, the \"thuggery\" remark was aimed in part at teachers.\n\n\"Wisconsin teachers were a big part of the collective actions at the start of the movement he\u2019s referring to -- and his take that there was \u2018thuggery\u2019 involved, and that it was out-of-state protesters driving these actions, was way off the mark,\" said Christina Brey, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Education Association Council.\n\nBut Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the governor was not talking about teachers when he denounced \"thuggery attacks.\" He said Walker was referring to death threats from out-of-state people. A multitude of threats of various kinds were cataloged by conservative observers and the mainstream media during the protests.\n\nIn our view, it\u2019s clear Walker directed the comment at what he characterized as out-of-state protesters, without specifically mentioning teachers or the teachers union. He didn\u2019t exclude teachers, though.\n\nWe asked DuBois Bourenane, the letter writer to NBC, about the \"teachers as thugs\" moniker she gave Walker. She is a post-secondary instructor whose Monologues of Dissent blog frequently blasts Walker as an enemy of public education. She joined in many of the protests at the Capitol, appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \"The Ed Show,\" and has blanketed Walker\u2019s office with dozens of long, critical emails.\n\nShe told us it was not meant to suggest that Walker ever said those exact words, but merely a device to highlight her view that Walker disrespects teachers.\n\n\"I never said he said that and I\u2019d be surprised if he did,\" she told us. \"But I do think he actively promotes a rhetorical discourse that promotes the impression that teachers who disagree with his policies are bad for schools and dangerous and subversive.\"\n\nThis gets us to part two of this fact check.\n\nTo gauge Walker\u2019s rhetoric regarding teachers, we examined dozens of Walker statements on education, on unions and on the Capitol protests that teachers figured so prominently in.\n\nDuring the 2010 campaign, Walker made clear he felt public schools -- and specifically underperforming teachers -- were failing Wisconsin\u2019s students. On his campaign website, he called for teacher evaluations, merit pay and other measures, without mentioning his plan to severely limit collective bargaining. He touted an expansion of voucher and charter schools.\n\nBut he also made clear the \"vast majority\" of teachers are succeeding, when he released his education plan during the 2010 campaign.\n\nAfter his election, Walker pressed the case against union rules. In a Wall Street Journal opinion column, Walker wrote that the teachers union \"hid behind\" a labor contract when an award-winning first-year teacher was laid off because of seniority rules under collective bargaining.\n\nIn February 2011, after Walker unveiled his union limits and benefits cuts, major school districts across the state shut down when teachers flocked to protests in Madison.\n\nWalker praised the \"good professionals \"who went to work and said those who skipped out had every right to be heard, \"but I said I\u2019m not going to allow for one minute the voices of the tens of thousands here to somehow overpower the millions of hardworking taxpayers of my state who know what were asking for is modest.\"\n\nHe was less diplomatic when referring to the teachers union.\n\nHe told conservative talk show host Mark Levin on Feb. 21, 2011, that the union\u2019s motivation was only to get its hands on teachers\u2019 dues payments. By announcing it would give in to Walker\u2019s benefits cuts if he would drop the limits on collective bargaining, \"they threw their members under the bus,\" he said.\n\nThe same day, Walker told Hannity that Republicans were \"not going to be intimidated\" by tens of thousands of protesters from Chicago, Nevada and New Jersey.\n\n(PolitiFact Wisconsin rated False Walker\u2019s Feb. 22 claim that \"almost all\" the protesters were from outside Wisconsin at that point, while noting that Illinois teachers unions had sent buses of protesters to Madison.)\n\nIn late February and early March, as the standoff with Democrats dragged on, Walker used a series of news releases to highlight deals that teachers had negotiated through their union -- or won in arbitration -- on pay, retirement benefits, overtime and working conditions.\n\nSome of the releases singled out small but attention-grabbing items in particular districts. One was, \"Almost $10,000 Per Year for Doing Nothing,\" a reference to a teacher emeritus program. Another was \"Arbitrator Reinstates Porn-Watching Teacher.\" Another: \"$6,000 Extra for Carrying a Pager.\"\n\nWalker has taken steps to assert that he and his budget were pro-teacher. He frequently praises the public school teachers his two sons have encountered in Wauwatosa, and other outstanding teachers elsewhere.\n\nAt the NBC summit, Walker repeated his respect for teachers. \"I understand there\u2019s sometimes a difference of opinion, but in the end, we believe the right thing to do is put the power in the hands of the teachers,\" he said.\n\nBrey, the statewide teachers union spokeswoman, says WEAC\u2019s main beef with Walker is his actions, not his words. But she said Walker uses his words to depict unions as greedy (seeking an \"expensive entitlement\"); controlled by intimidating out-of-state \"bosses\"; and incompetent (with union hiring restrictions gone, Walker says, now we can keep the best teachers).\n\nCriticism of the union, Brey contends, amounts to criticism of teachers, who elect their union representatives.\n\nIn our view, both sides have a gripe.\n\nTeachers who belong to the union feel aggrieved by Walker\u2019s comments about their union. But being critical of a group is not the same as being critical of individuals, and it\u2019s a stretch to call Walker\u2019s calls for educational reform and school choice an attack on teachers, per se.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s disingenuous for the governor to suggest that his praise of teachers is all-encompassing, but that when he\u2019s talking about the protesters -- even mischaracterizing them as dominated by out-of-state interests -- and teachers organizations, it is limited.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nAt the NBC Education Summit, Walker denied saying \"teachers are thugs\" and said he\u2019s only said \"great thing\" about teachers.\n\nThough we looked at two pieces of the statement, it essentially amounts to single claim -- that he\u2019s only praised teachers.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence at all that he used the thug line -- and even the educator whose letter prompted the questioning doesn\u2019t believe he said it. He did use the term \"thuggery attacks\" in response to a question about the protesters\u2019 occupation of the Capitol, death threats against elected officials and protests outside his home.\n\nMany Wisconsin educators joined in that occupation, but Walker says he was referring only to death threats by out-of-state people.\n\nOn the larger point of his rhetoric about teachers, we found Walker was careful about expressing his respect for teachers and other protesters, while offering criticism of the union that represents them.\n\nSo, Walker can accurately claim he has avoided direct rhetorical attacks on teachers as a profession. But we found Walker said less than \"great things\" about the union that represents teachers, and in his \"thuggery\" comment Walker left room for teachers to assume he was passing judgment on their protests at the Capitol.\n\nWalker\u2019s statement may be narrowly accurate, but it slips down the Truth-O-Meter when you examine the full context of his comments about the teachers union, teacher benefits and the protests.\n\nTaken as a whole, his comments fall short of the high bar he set about saying only \"great things.\"\n\nWe rate his statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12276"}
