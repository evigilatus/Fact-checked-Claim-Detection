Only a few go back to late 1990s and the relevant ones dealt with pension payment problems in individual communities, not state employees.\nOne was a 1998 letter to Coventry's treasurer saying that some of the town's pension plans \"have insufficient assets to meet projected benefits.\" That was 16 years ago.\nAnother was a 1998 copy of a report by the Johnston Financial Review Commission, which Almonte chaired, warning that the town owed $3.2 million in required pension contributions for its employees. For example, Johnston hadn't paid into the firemen's pension fund for more than three years, putting it more than $1.3 million behind in its payments.\nWe note that Almonte's comments in both of these reports are in dry auditor language. Some readers might not take that as the type of scary warning that Almonte says he made.\nBut we also found a May 8, 1988 front-page Providence Journal story reporting how Almonte explained to more than 200 Johnston residents that their town was in deep financial trouble.\n\"To drive home the severity of the situation,\" the story said, \"Almonte gave examples that sometimes made the audience wince: A bottom-of-the-barrel credit rating. A time between April 1996 and March 1997 when the town's bank account was overdrawn for 146 days. Falling behind $3.19 million in required pension contributions for workers.\n\"And that's not all, Almonte said. Still to be reckoned with is an unfunded pension liability that hasn't been quantified, and could add up to untold millions,\" the story reported.\nAlmonte's campaign also referred us to a March 1999 report, available on the Auditor General's website, for the 1997 fiscal year. It notes that \"five school districts, five municipalities and three police and fire units were delinquent\" to the tune of about $1.7 million in their pension payments.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state withheld school aid and traffic fine payments to six municipalities until they paid up. That was 15 years ago.\nIf Almonte wasn't warning about a looming crisis in the state pension system in those days, that's because there wasn't one.\nHis 2000 audit of the state Employees' Retirement System, covering the fiscal year that ended in 1999, reported that the funded ratios -- the amount of money each plan had compared to the amount of money it was expected to need to cover its pension costs -- had been growing steadily for years.\nThe ratio for state employees, for example, went from 73 percent in 1993 to 81 percent in 1998.\nIn addition, all the plans had been getting the recommended amount of funding since at least 1996 and, in many cases, even longer.\nThat would change. By 2006, the funded ratio for that plan had dropped to 55 percent. By 2009, it had only gone up to 59 percent and the debate about pension costs was poised to explode.\nWe found no documentation from that era suggesting Almonte was advocating the type of sweeping changes to the separate pension plans for state employees and teachers that were pushed by General Treasurer Gina Raimondo and approved by the General Assembly and Governor Lincoln Chafee.\nIn an interview, Almonte argued that he was talking about the state's pension problem at the time \u00a0because late payments he was referring to were payments by cities and towns to the state-run Municipal Employees' Retirement System, also known as MERS, which is under the jurisdiction of the state treasurer.\n\"Reform is not just what you to do an employee or an employee's benefits,\" he said. \"I was advocating a reform of management\" to get the communities to make their payments on time, especially when the money being withheld by workers to help pay for pension benefits is being retained by the city or town. \"When payments are made late, you miss out on earnings, and that's the start of the problem because the problem compounds itself.\"\nOur ruling\nErnest Almonte said, \"I was speaking out on pension reform almost 17 years ago.\" The comment was in the context of a question on the state's pension system.\nIt\u2019s clear from documentation Almonte provided and information we found that Almonte was warning about problems years ago. But the documentation he could provide only dealt with problems in municipal plans, although some of those were in the MERS system run by the state.\nBecause his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rule it Mostly True.\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email\u00a0protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07117"}
