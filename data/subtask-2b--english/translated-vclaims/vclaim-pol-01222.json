It was expected that the race would be among the closest in the country and the unofficial results of Harris' pre-McCreedi by 905 votes. However, the N.S. State Council for Election and Enforcement of Ethics in November 30 refused to endorse those results after questioning the legitimacy of some ballots from the Bladen district. The Republican Party N.C. urged the Electoral Council to endorse the results, although the Council &apos; s investigation was incomplete. \"The fact is that there are not enough ballot papers to change the outcome of these elections,\" stated the NCP in an e-mail to media outlets in December 2. Dallas Woodhouse, Executive Director of the World Congress Party, made the same allegation at a press conference on 1 December. \"It is mathematically impossible to have enough postcards that may be in question in the province of Bladen to transform this race,\" said Woodhouse. His observations can be found on the mark 11:45 of this video WRAL. Is it true that there are not enough ballots to change the outcome of the elections? \"In the province of Dian, there were only 569 missed ballots,\" said Woodhouse in an e-mail to Paulette Fuckett on Monday night. \"More than that, 175 of these voters actually cast their votes in another way. This leaves only 394 genuinely non-reimbursable ballots in the province of Bladin, certainly not enough ballots to change the result of the election by a margin of 905 votes.\" Woodhouse has the point that there is a gap between the number of votes missed by mail in the province of Bian (an informal total of 684 for all candidates, combined) and the total of 905 votes followed by McCready Harris. However, the National Congress Party &apos; s allegation gives the misleading impression that only the ballot papers counted by mail in the Dian province are called into question by the National Congress Election Council. That's not the case. What the Electoral Council said was that Woodhouse criticized the lack of transparency about the investigation, and he is right that the National Convention Election Council revealed little about the case in the ninth chamber of Congress, which runs from Charlotte to the east in the past, Fayetteville along the borders of South Carolina. The Council has issued two public statements on the investigation. In November 27, the Council announced in a statement that it did not endorse the results. \"In his proposal, Vice-President Joshua Malcolm cited the authority of the Board under G.S. 163A-1180 as a reason to delay the certification of that competition,\" states the statement. \"This statute empowers the Council to take any other necessary action to ensure that elections are determined without pollution of fraud or corruption and without irregularities that may have changed as a result of the elections.\" In November, the Council announced its intention to hold a public hearing on evidence in allegations of \"breaches and fraudulent activities related to postal voting and other possible issues in the Ninth Congressional Chamber competition.\" The NC Electoral Council cited the irregularities as a reason why the results of the Harris McCreedy contest were not certified, but the statement did not mention that investigators would limit their review to that province alone. The Electoral Council did not publicly disclose: the number of ballot papers in question, whether the investigation was limited to a specific geographical area within the province, or whether the investigation was limited to the ballot papers. Questions remain regarding not only returned and counted postcards, but also requested but never returned ballots. First, let's look at the postcards that have been prepared. On January 26, 2021, in the tweet of Foreign Minister North Carolina Ellen Marshall, \"She won more state-level races than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" By Paul Specht, February 1, 2021, there were eight districts in the province in whole or in part, and two were the only county in the province where Harris was more supported by mail than McCreedy. (The informal results are available on the website of the National Convention Election Council. In six provinces, less than 3 per cent of the total votes were from absent ballots by mail, according to a news analysis conducted at 38 hours for NC electoral management board statements. \"But in the province of Dian, this figure was 7.3 percent, indicating that people were forced to vote by mail.\" Harris won 61 per cent of the postcards in Bian province - although registered Republicans represented only 19 per cent of the district &apos; s accepted absent ballot papers, an independent analysis by Michael Beatzer showed the politician at Kataba College. The support for Harris by the province of Bladin also emerges from republican primary education. In May, the current President of the Republic, Robert Pettinger, was defeated by 828 votes, assisted by 400 votes through postcards in the province of Bladen. This figure is more than twice the total mail in most of the other 9 provinces. And Bladen was the only county where Harris was gone by mail from Pittinger. :: Return to general elections. The province (Bladin) had the highest percentage of absent ballot requests in the state, according to Charlotte's observer. However, the number of unrecovered ballots has been lifted. On average, about 16 per cent of registered voters who request post ballot papers never return them, according to Pitzer. In Harris McCready, the rate of non-return was 24 per cent. In the province of Bladin alone, 40% of the required postcards were never returned. In the neighbouring province of Rubison, 60 per cent never returned, according to a review of news and observers. The Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization found that non-recovered ballots were disproportionately linked to minority voters. With regard to actual votes, Beatzer reported that 495 ballots had been requested but never returned in two countries and that 1,180 ballots had been requested but never returned in Robson. As he observed at 5:30, Rubison had a number of unreturned votes from the District of Michelenburg (Charlotte House) although Miklinburg had voted three times as many votes as Rubison. It is certainly possible that some people asked for a vote and then lost their vote, moved on or forgot to vote. The Electoral Council is likely to review the situation. Steve Stone, President of the Rubison District Electoral Council, told the Washington Post that state investigators had requested information that had been kept by the District Council on an unusual number of absent ballot requests. The residents of the province informed the Rubson Board that people were going door-to-door telling voters that their records had been dropped and that they needed to re-register, and told the Stone Post. It is illegal to take another person &apos; s ballot card by mail and deliver it unless you are in contact with them. However, a few voters submitted affidavits to the National Convention Election Council stating that they had been contacted in their homes by a person claiming to be a polling collector. Much to be determined on Monday evening, the Speaker of the National Convention Election Council, Pat Gannon, sent an e-mail to Politifakt to clarify the scope of the investigation. \"The easy answer is that the range is the non-verbal voting infractions on CD-IX,\" said Gannon's e-mail. \"Investigators will go where the evidence takes them, including ballot papers that are no longer available. We do not know whether there are enough ballot papers under discussion. This is part of what the investigation is trying to determine.\" In the end, the exact number of amended and damaged votes may not be relevant, according to Bitzer and Jerry Cohen, former Special Advocate of the N.S. District General Assembly. In separate mailings to Poletti Vac, they referred to the General Regulations NC, section 163A-1181 with respect to \"new elections.\" The law provides that the State Elections Council may order new elections by means of a majority vote if \"there have been irregularities or irregularities to the extent that they have distorted the results of the entire election and cast doubt on their fairness.\" Our verdict says, \"There are not enough ballots to change the outcome of these elections.\" There is a gap between the number of votes delivered by mail in the province of Bian (684) and 905 by McCreedy Harris. However, it is possible - if not likely - that the National Convention Election Council is studying more than just the blank ballots that were delivered by mail. The Council did not publicly specify the scope of its investigations. Investigators can check 684 post sounds from Bladen County, 680 post sounds from Robson County, as well as 1,675 standard postcards that are no longer from either of these areas. The National Congress Party has not provided evidence that the National Convention Election Council focuses solely on postcards already counted in the province of Bian. In fact, they criticized the Council for its lack of transparency. We believe that Woodhouse and the prosecution of the General Democratic Party are mostly consistent with the definition of false prosecution: it contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.
