Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has gotten plenty of attention.\nSometimes deservedly so.

Ocasio-Cortez describes herself as a democratic socialist and supports more socialist-style changes, including universal health care, tuition-free public college and establishing housing as a human right.\nThe quote comes in varying versions, with some words replacing others. It has been long attributed to economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who passed away in April 2006. It has also more recently been connected to another economist, Russell Roberts, who has used it during events and also in his book.\nThe original version of the phrase: \"Under capitalism man exploits man. Under socialism it\u2019s just the opposite.\" In some cases, the word socialism is swapped for communism, mostly when Galbraith is cited as the speaker.\nIt has also been described as an \"old Soviet joke,\" here, and according to Snopes, was listed as a \"wry Russian joke\" in Jules Archer\u2019s 1977 book Police State: Could It Happen Here?\nThe book was published 12 years before Ocasio-Cortez was born.\nOur ruling\nA viral graphic being spread on social media claims that Ocasio-Cortez said \"under capitalism, man oppresses\u00a0man.
