In fact, in his official tax proposal, Romney has advocated across-the-board tax cuts.\n\nBut has he been consistent over the years about putting his commitment not to raise taxes in the form of a pledge?\n\nThe question about Romney and the tax pledge was raised in late 2007, when the Democratic National Committee released a 30-second ad and a four-minute video charging, among other things, that Romney had changed his position on signing a no-tax pledge. We checked the ad shortly after it came out.\n\nIn this report, we\u2019ll put that question to the Flip-O-Meter.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It\u2019s simply gauging whether they did.\n\nRomney and the 2002 gubernatorial campaign\n\nDuring his 2002 campaign for governor of Massachusetts, Romney said he would not sign a pledge circulated by Citizens for Limited Taxation, a Massachusetts-based anti-tax group.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Boston Globe covered the news:\n\n\"In a break with Acting Governor Jane Swift and her GOP predecessors, Republican gubernatorial candidate Mitt Romney is refusing to rule out tax increases and said yesterday he will not sign a \u2018no new taxes\u2019 pledge,\" the newspaper wrote. \"Romney said that while he opposes all tax increases in principle, he will not make such a pledge in writing.\"\n\nThe article went on to quote Romney saying, \"I am not in favor of increasing taxes. \u2026 At this stage, I am inclined to make that position as clear as I can but not to enter into a written pledge of some kind, and that's true on this and other issues.\"\n\nThe Globe cited another comment by Romney that had been reported by the Union-News of Springfield, Mass. \"I'm against tax increases,\" Romney told attendees of Western Massachusetts GOP meeting, according to the Union-News. \"But I'm not intending to, at this stage, sign a document which would prevent me from being able to look specifically at the revenue needs of the Commonwealth.\"\n\nBarbara Anderson, an official with Citizens for Limited Taxation, was unhappy with Romney's refusal to sign, which came after he\u2019d met with her for half an hour. \"He's thinking like an independent businessman who doesn't sign pledges,\" she suggested to the Globe.\n\nMeanwhile, the Boston Herald quoted Eric Fehrnstrom, then Romney\u2019s deputy campaign manager, saying, \"Mitt Romney doesn't have to sign a piece of paper to have a position on an issue. He's pledged to oppose any tax increase, he doesn't support them, his position on taxes is clear.\"\n\nIn an interview with the Globe, Fehrnstrom was even more dismissive, calling the pledge \"government by gimmickry,\" the newspaper reported.\n\nPut it all together and you have a candidate who didn\u2019t just decide against signing a pledge but who cast doubt on the propriety of such pledges in general.\n\nRomney\u2019s decision on a pledge in late 2006\n\nOn Dec. 31, 2006, Romney became the first major candidate in the 2008 presidential election to sign a prominent taxpayer protection pledge offered by Americans for Tax Reform, an influential anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist.\n\n\"In signing the pledge, Gov. Romney firmly commits himself in writing to fiscal discipline and economic common sense,\" Norquist said in a news release. \"Mitt Romney has told taxpayers in no uncertain terms that he plans to look out for their interests.\"\n\nRomney hardly signed the Norquist pledge covertly. On Jan. 4, 2007, he issued a press release touting his action, and on Oct. 5, 2007, he released a radio ad spotlighting it.\n\n\"For years, conservative candidates for president signed their name on the dotted line pledging to oppose tax increases,\" Romney said in the ad. \"I'm Mitt Romney. I'm proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge. The others have not. I signed the tax pledge because I want everyone to know where I stand. We've got to get taxes down and grow our economy.\"\n\nIn this case, then, Romney not only signed a written pledge but actively broadcast it to the electorate.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the two pledges are not exactly the same. One addressed the state context and one the federal context.\n\nThe Massachusetts text was a \"pledge to ... all the people of this state, that I will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes.\"\n\nThe Norquist pledge, to which Romney is still a signatory, requires the signer to \"oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses \u2026 and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.\"\n\nStill, despite the differences in wording, we think the pledges are equivalent in their underlying requirements.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn 2002, Romney refused to make \"a pledge in writing\" on taxes. Four years later, he signed one and touted it as a selling point for his candidacy. In our book, that\u2019s a Full Flop.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
