In addition, the export growth rate in West Virginia was 14.2 per cent, almost double the national average of 7.6 per cent. https://t.co/PW0hpM1e8z - WVGOP (@WVGOP) 2 April 2019 Did West Virginia really exceed the national average of export growth rates? The tweet is linked to the 17 March article on WVNews. In contrast, the article cites a 15 March news release by the West Virginia Department of Commerce reporting data from the United States Census Bureau. Caitlin Ashley Lizaraga, a specialist in international trade at the Ministry of Commerce in West Virginia, referred to the detailed census office data collected by the Private Sector Contributions Database, World Trade Atlas. In a press article on October 14, 2018, Joe Manchen stated that the United States imports \"50 per cent of at least 50 mineral commodities each year, including 100 per cent of 21.\" The table shows that West Virginia already exported $8.1 billion to the rest of the world in 2018, an increase of 14.2 per cent over total exports in 2017. The increase for the nation as a whole was just over half - 7.6 per cent. We were able to replicate these data using the United States Census Bureau's online trade data portal. While export growth in West Virginia was strong between 2017 and 2018, it should be noted that this expansion came from a small base. In fact, West Virginia ranked 13th out of the lowest total exports in 2018. The states under West Virginia are Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming.
