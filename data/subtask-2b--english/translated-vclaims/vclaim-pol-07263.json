The reader of Polyte Vak Oregon received this from one of his acquaintances and passed it on to us. Prosecution: The e-mail focuses on Robinson, the brother of First Lady Michelle Obama and the wife of President Barack Obama. The article claims that Oregon State officials in 2010 were \"thinking seriously\" about expelling Robinson after his \"Zandism\" team began in the 2009-10 basketball season. \"When the word came to Washington, D.C.,\" continues, \"Under-Secretary of Education Martha Canter sent to Corvallis with $17 million in catalytic money for the University. Craig Robinson's job is safe for another year.\" It refers to first family relationships and closes: \"If it doesn't upset you, nothing will... remember the vote this fall!!!!!!! Analysis: The substance of the claim involves the charge that Bob DeCarlis, Oregon State Sports Director, was preparing to expel Robinson after \"the beginning of the Psalm 8-11 (2-5) at the Buck 10 Conference.\" The university changed its mind, assuming only after Canter, who was formerly the highest official of Obama's higher education administration, was \"distributed\" to Corvallis with a catalytic money code. We contacted Steve Clarke, Vice President of the University of South Africa for University Relations and Marketing. \"It's interesting that he's coming back now,\" he said, \"Just a few months before the election.\" With regard to stimulus funds - from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 2009, approved by Congress and signed by Obama after the beginning of the Great Recession in 2008 - the State of Oregon received some funds. \"As public universities have done all over the country,\" said Clark. The total share of the Operations Support Unit was $26.4 million. \"This finances 61 research projects and some infrastructure,\" he added, \"all linked to issues consistent with the research mission in Oregon.\" On September 17, 2010, Jim Hoffman reported in an online television commercial that Ron Weiden spent $2 million \"to study strange ants.\" \u2022 September 24, 2010. By 12 October 2009, the Unit had already received and spent $17.8 million in incentive funds, according to an educational press story from Oregon, Betsy Hammond (the remainder subsequently spent, on a rolling basis). Therefore, the source of the $17 million referred to in the e-mail chain is likely to be. But when the 2009-10 university basketball season came, that money was already gone. The Beavers didn't reach Vozen and five losses in the league game -- the point that DeCarlis, according to e-mail, was shooting at Robinson -- until January 23 2010, losing the way to California. It should also be noted that funds were provided through the State Fund for Financial Stability, a programme established to assist educational institutions in retaining senior teachers and professors. It was the individual states, not the federal government, that chose the recipients. We've sent Canter now. Visiting professor at the University of New York, Steinhart. \"I have no idea where these rumors come from,\" I wrote. \"I never traveled to Corvallis to give $17 million in catalytic money in 2010, and I don't know Craig Robinson personally.\" It also provided a link to another fact-finding site where the prosecution was formed. The CTU officials said they didn't have a record of Canter showing up in Corvallis at the time, and there's no evidence of news detailing a trip. DeCarlis has denied this story many times. It is also unusual for any major university program to fire a trainer very early in the season, especially since the Robinson team last year finished winning the 18-18 prize and won the first post-season tournament at the University of Ozona by winning the 2009 basketball contest. With regard to Robinson, the run did not last forever. De Carolis fired him on May 5, 2014, after six seasons and a winning record from 94 to 105. Decision: The recycled serial e-mail claims that the basketball coach at the University of Southern Sudan Craig Robinson -- the brother of Michelle Obama and the President's brother in law -- to avoid losing his job in March 2010 only because a high-ranking administrative officer was \"sent to Corvallis with $17 million in catalytic money for the University.\" The records show that the Office of Internal Oversight Services spent $17.8 million in catalytic funds months before the point where Robinson was supposed to be at stake. There's no evidence that an officer of the department was \"sended\" to Corvallis. The state, not the feds, also chose how to spend money. The claim has been written off repeatedly, but it still shows something other than history. It's not just fake, it's ridiculous. We evaluate it with pants on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07263"}
