Greg Walden was elected to Congress?", "text": "U.S. Rep. Greg Walden may be a member of the House GOP leadership, but that hasn\u2019t protected him from allegations that he\u2019s too liberal for his conservative base -- or from drawing a primary challenger.\nLate last month, Klamath County Chairman Dennis Linthicum announced he would try to oust Walden in the 2014 Republican primary.\nPart of Linthicum\u2019s motivation, he told The Oregonian, is that he sees Walden as a career politician who doesn\u2019t stand up for conservative values.\nOn his campaign website, Linthicum offers the nation's ever-increasing public debt as one piece of evidence: \"During Walden\u2019s time as a representative (nearly 16 years) the National Debt has tripled.\"\nWe constantly hear about the nation\u2019s trillions of dollars worth of debt, but has it really tripled in the time that Walden has been in office? We wanted to find out.\nLooking up the public debt -- past and present -- is a fairly simple exercise. The U.S. Department of the Treasury Bureau of the Public Debt has a handy website that lets you look up the debt on just about any date.\nBefore we shower you with numbers, though, a quick note: As with almost anything we dig into, debt is a complex subject. When you talk about the total debt held by the U.S., there are two oft-cited measures. The first is the total outstanding public debt. That\u2019s everything we owe to all of our debt-holders, no distinction made. Then there\u2019s the debt held by the public. That\u2019s our total debt minus intragovernmental debt or money owed by one part of the government to another part of the government. One economist we spoke to said the second one was generally \"a little better measure.\"\nTo be safe, we checked the growth of both.\nWalden began his service as a U.S. congressman in January 1999. The closest date we could find for which the Treasury had estimates of both sorts of debt was Sept. 30, 1999, so we went ahead and used that date and compared it with the most recent figures available, from Nov. 7.\nHere\u2019s what we found: Back in 1999, the total outstanding public debt was $5.6 trillion. These days, it\u2019s a little north of $17 trillion. In other words, it\u2019s tripled. The U.S. debt minus the intragovernmental loans was $3.6 trillion back in 1999 and is about $12.1 trillion these days. So, that\u2019s more than tripled.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClackamas County Commission\n\n\nstated on August 23, 2012 in a press release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClackamas County Commissioners \"approved a re-negotiated agreement to lower the county\u2019s contribution to TriMet\u2019s Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project to $19.9 million from $25 million.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Janie Har \u2022 August 30, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, we\u2019re not economists so our next step was to call some experts.\nWe spoke with Tom Potiowsky, the chair of the Economics Department at Portland State University and the former chief economist for the state of Oregon, and Mark Thoma, an economics professor at the University of Oregon.\nThey both had little doubt that Linthicum\u2019s claim is accurate, but they did provide us with some caveats. Thoma noted that comparing our debt now, on the heels of a recession, to debt from 1999 when the economy was in better shape, might be somewhat deceiving. We\u2019ve had to spend far more on social programs, for instance. \"To me, it\u2019s misleading to use a recession as your end point,\" he said.\nPotiowsky questioned whether it\u2019s fair to hang the debt growth on Walden -- something we\u2019ll get to later. And both Thoma and Potiowsky suggested we look at the U.S. debt relative to the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. If the economy were expanding as quickly as the debt, that would be important to note.\nWe dug back into the numbers. In 1999 the debt-to-GDP ratio (if you use the entire debt) was 57 percent. These days, it\u2019s 101 percent. So it\u2019s just about doubled. Meanwhile, if you skim off the intragovernmental debt, the ratio in 1999 was 36 percent and is 72 percent today. Again, it\u2019s doubled.\nThe takeaway, then, is that debt is growing and it\u2019s growing faster than our GDP.\nWe called Linthicum to ask whether it\u2019s fair to pin this all on Walden.\n\"I realize that Greg Walden is one member of the House, and there\u2019s the Senate and there\u2019s the president and his policies,\" he said. \"I was just making what I saw as a statement of fact.\"\nThat may be so, but given that Linthicum uses the claim on a campaign website specifically to draw contrasts between him as a fiscal conservative and Walden as somebody who has let the debt skyrocket, it\u2019s hard not to read it as an attack.\nThe blame, though, is largely misplaced. You\u2019d also have to account for entitlement program growth and the impact of the recession.\nHis statement is accurate but he can\u2019t pin the bulk of the growth on Walden, who is one of hundreds of lawmakers and three presidents to serve since 1999. We rate the statement Half True.\n(Head back to OregonLive to comment on this article and let us know what you think about the ruling.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08631"}
