Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., for the state\u2019s 4th Congressional District in 2010. The two men are in a rematch this fall.\n\nDeFazio\u2019s campaign recently issued a press release, accusing the chemist from Cave Junction of trying to moderate what DeFazio considers extremist views on public schools, nuclear waste and Social Security.\n\n\"Despite his attempt to recast himself as Social Security\u2019s great defender in 2012, Art Robinson has repeatedly called Social Security a \u2018Ponzi Scheme\u2019 including as recently as December 2011,\" states the DeFazio release. \"And he has said in speeches and interviews that programs like Social Security and Medicare should be ended by attrition.\"\n\nThe press release accompanies an online ad that likens Robinson to Mr. Rogers, but not in a kindly, cardigan-sporting way. \"It\u2019s a nutty day in his neighborhood,\" the voiceover sings as the camera hovers over a diorama of streets and houses.\n\n\"And here he said Social Security should be ended through attrition,\" the voiceover continues. These phrases show up on screen: \"These entitlement programs need to be ended \u2026\" and \"... they have to be ended by attrition.\" Robinson is heard speaking these words in the ad. The words \"Social Security Ended\" appear on screen later in the ad.\n\nSo what gives? Does Robinson want to end Social Security? By attrition? Is he backpedaling? Does he want to freak out frail senior citizens? We\u2019re only sort of kidding on that last question because that\u2019s what the DeFazio campaign is saying with its press release and ad.\n\nMost people know Social Security as the federal program that workers and their employers pay into over the course of the employee\u2019s work life; the person then gets monthly stipends based on age of retirement and pay. The program also pays for people with disabilities and survivors of retirees. (Both Social Security and Medicare face long-term financial challenges and lawmakers have been urged to fix problems with both programs so there will be enough money for future recipients.)\n\nRobinson, not surprisingly, argues that DeFazio is wrong to say -- and to say only -- that he would end programs such as Social Security. \u00a0\"I have consistently called for increases in Social Security payments,\" Robinson writes in his new book, \"Common Sense in 2012.\"\n\n\"I have pointed out that Social Security payments have lagged badly behind price increases. They must be increased to catch up. The federal budget must be balanced, but not by short-changing seniors for benefits they have paid for and counted on.\"\n\nHe sounds very senior-friendly there. DeFazio\u2019s people contend this is a prime example of Robinson backtracking from previous statements -- to end Social Security -- that were not as senior-friendly.\n\nLet\u2019s take a breath and go back to the original interview on which the web ad is based in part. Luckily we didn\u2019t have to hunt too long because it\u2019s posted on the \"Who is Art Robinson?\" website paid for by DeFazio. In the nearly 90-second long clip, Robinson says that we need to change the Social Security system because we\u2019re digging ourselves into a hole:\n\n\"We should change our ways so that we don't incur any further liabilities under entitlements. In other words, these entitlement programs need to be ended, but they can\u2019t be ended by violating the contracts of the people who have already contracted with the government, they have to be ended by attrition. You have to stop taking on new people in the entitlements and let time pass and gradually by attrition cancel them.\"\n\nEven here, you can see that Robinson cares about the contract that government has with Social Security recipients; in other words, he doesn\u2019t want to abandon them. Workers, after all, have paid into the system. A review of previous campaign statements shows that Robinson has consistently called for increasing payments to recipients and making sure the contract with recipients is honored.\n\nIn an interview with PolitiFact Oregon, Robinson stood by the totality of his position on Social Security and said he hasn\u2019t changed his views. He said he wrote what he did in his book because he was tired of DeFazio picking on only one part of his views -- the part most likely to alarm seniors. PolitiFact Oregon can sympathize, although the 2012 book is pretty heavy on wanting to save seniors and doesn\u2019t mention the word attrition once.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to rule on whether ending Social Security by attrition is feasible or flawed. We\u2019re not going to rule on whether Robinson is trying to have it both ways, by calling for an end to the current system while increasing payments to current recipients. Those are issues for voters.\n\nWe will rule on the accuracy of DeFazio\u2019s claim that Robinson wants to end Social Security \"by attrition.\" Robinson has called for an end by attrition and continues to say we should end the current program by attrition, to be replaced by another system, whether it\u2019s private or mixed with a public program.\n\nBut we think it\u2019s also important to point out that Robinson has consistently called upon the government to honor its obligations to Social Security recipients. We rate DeFazio\u2019s statement Mostly True: Accurate but needs additional information.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurt Schrader\n\n\nstated on September 11, 2010 in a debate at the Salem City Club\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Scott Bruun \"still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize Social Security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Charles Pope \u2022 October 2, 2010", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10607"}
