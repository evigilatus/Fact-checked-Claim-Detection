Ralph Northam\u00a0announced that Virginia has received decontamination systems that will help provide front-line health workers with protective equipment against COVID-19.\nEach of the systems can massively sanitize for reuse much-sought-after N95 face masks. The systems were developed by the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio, and received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency has been sending the equipment, free of charge, to various locations. Northam announced during a May 1 news conference that Virginia has gotten three of the systems, to be located in Chesterfield County, Newport News and Blacksburg.\u00a0\n\"These systems have multiple units that are each the size of a storage container and can clean up to 80,000 masks per day using a hydrogen peroxide vapor,\" Northam said.\u00a0 \"(Personal\u00a0 protective equipment) can be decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading.\"\nTraditionally, N95 masks have been designated for only single use. So we fact-checked Northam\u2019s statement that the system allows the masks to be \"decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading.\"\nThe Battelle process\nHospitals send the masks to N95 sanitization centers Battelle has helped set up, including in coronavirus hot spots such as New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C.\nWorkers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours.\nBattelle says the masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times. But, as PolitiFact National recently noted, that\u2019s not a best practice.\nThe FDA, in its letter designating emergency approval, specified that Battelle\u2019s decontamination system \"may be effective\" safely recycling masks 20 times, but it advised that recycling should only be done \"when there are insufficient supplies.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends reuse \"only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy.\"\nThere are several reasons. For one thing, research is limited on how effective this type of decontamination is. Also, masks vary in how they stand up to the procedure.\nAnd it\u2019s not as simple as doing a load of laundry. \"Decontamination is a complicated process,\" said Hana El-Samad, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San Francisco, who researches N95 sanitization. \"Assessing how well it works and which N95 makes and models remain unaffected is an area of active research.\"\u00a0\nN95Decon, a research collaborative with which El-Samad works, has examined Battelle\u2019s hydrogen peroxide approach and found the chemicals appear to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask\u2019s filtration.\nMask integrity\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance is only part of the equation. Another is mask structure: N95s work only when properly fitted to the face.\nWhen workers reuse the masks, they can lose their shape, which undermines the quality of fit and renders them less protective. For some masks, per an N95Decon report on hydrogen peroxide, fit quality declined substantially after just five uses. For others, it took 15 wears to see a meaningful difference.\nIn addition, decontamination itself can in some cases worsen the respirator\u2019s fit.\u00a0\n\"If [an N95] doesn\u2019t fit well, then air will leak around the sides and it doesn\u2019t matter how good a filter it is,\" said Patrick Kenney, medical director of the Yale-New Haven Health\u2019s corporate supply chain.\nPlus, using this technology requires hospitals to have other protocols in place. Used masks must be safely collected \u2015 since they could be COVID-contaminated and pose a biohazard \u2014 and a plan must be in place to move them to and from the sanitization facility.\u00a0\n\"These are all complicated processes that need to be done right,\" El-Samad said.\nShe offered a key takeaway: Technology like Battelle\u2019s can help. But nothing substitutes for new N95s.\nWe should note the PolitiFact National\u00a0fact-checked an April\u00a0 23 statement by President Trump. He said, \"We\u2019re also using a sterilization process \u2015 some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks.\"\nPolitiFact rated the statement Half-True, saying, \"Government authorities and health care researchers are clear that this is a crisis measure and it is in no way as effective as \u2018ordering 20 times more masks.\u2019\"\nOur ruling\nNortham said with decontamination systems being set up in Virginia, \"PPE can be decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading.\"\nThe systems are excellent news for Virginia which, like practically all states, has struggled to acquire N95 masks for medical workers. But the governor\u2019s words are still rosy.\nThe FDA, in its letter of emergency approval, said the decontamination system \"may be effective\" safely recycling masks up to 20 times, but warned the process should\u00a0 only be used when there are \"insufficient (new) supplies.\" Some early research suggests the structure of the masks may be compromised through the repeated process, making them less-secure fits on faces.\nSo Northam\u2019s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details.
