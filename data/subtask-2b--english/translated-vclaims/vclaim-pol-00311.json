His full quote: \"Visions presented in that Senate Bill have allowed everyone here illegally, except criminals, to stay here for the rest of their lives. This may not be a technical pardon, but it is certainly an amnesty in fact.\" But that's an inaccurate description of the bill. Only migrants who meet certain conditions will be able to stay here for the rest of their lives.

And Romney is not correct in saying that illegal immigrants who want to stay in the United States must only prove that they are not criminals. Illegal immigrants who wish to work in the United States must pass background checks, pay fines, work continuously and pay taxes. Applicants must return to their countries of origin, apply for permanent resident status through the applicant and pay an application fee of $4,000.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00311"}
