As noted in a Jan. 5, 2018, KSAT-TV news story, O\u2019Rourke specified there that he hopes to introduce legislation this year requiring all young Americans to spend at least a year \"in service to this country.\"\nSome context: His campaign\u2019s Facebook Live post of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks shows that O\u2019Rourke edged toward airing his interest in mandatory national service after an audience member asked: \"How do we meet the challenge of the increasing wealth gap?\"\nO\u2019Rourke responded, in part, by mentioning his concerns about Republican-passed federal tax changes. He also talked up improved access to higher education before turning to requiring national service, saying:\n\"One last idea on this--and I\u2019m trying to find a Republican colleague--and I may have one, and I hope to announce it soon--who will help me to introduce this into the Congress this year.\n\"And that is a national service bill that will require every young person, no matter how wealthy or how poor, to spend at least a year of their lives in service to this country, in a military unit, in a conservation corps unit, in a medical unit, in a teaching unit, in some way that they\u2019re going to help to make this country better and stronger and have to sacrifice together and leave that with a shared understanding of who we are as a people--and no kid is going to be rich enough to buy their way out of it and no kid (interrupted by applause).\"\nCo-sponsorship of a measure\nO\u2019Rourke had already embraced the idea of expanding national service. A web search led us to learn that in June 2017, O\u2019Rourke was among more than 150 House co-sponsors of the America\u2019s Call To Improve Opportunities Now for National Service Act filed by Rep. John B. Larson, D-Conn.\nThat legislation doesn\u2019t require any Americans to perform government service. Still, Owen Dodd in Larson\u2019s office emailed us a summary stating the proposal would result in at least a million government-linked \"service opportunities\" and reward \"young people who serve two full terms of service\" with four years of their home state\u2019s average in-state tuition. The resulting program, the summary says, would \"help the nation address priorities in education, infrastructure, healthcare, disaster relief and poverty.\"\nAnother mention of mandating service\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spotted one other recent instance of O\u2019Rourke speculating about mandatory service. In September 2017, he said in an interview with The Daily Texan, the student newspaper at the University of Texas, that improved college affordability could lead young Texans to return to their home communities after college.\nO\u2019Rourke then said that compulsory national service might be appropriate:\n\"Maybe a next step is a national service program, which gives everyone the opportunity, or maybe compels young people to spend a year or two improving their communities. And in exchange for that, there is the ability again to pursue higher education, or training, or an apprenticeship or certification. And again, it doesn\u2019t have to be a traditional four-year college, and it doesn\u2019t have to be for the 18-year-old. It could be for that 52-year-old who was just laid off from that peanut-packing plant in Plainview, Texas, who needs a little bit of help getting that next job. And if she needs help getting that online course, certification, the credentials that she needs, she is going to be able to do that. I think all of that should be part of the conversation in college affordability or higher education affordability.\"\nReversal: \u2018I made a mistake\u2019\nIn Corsicana, then, O\u2019Rourke revealed his plans to offer a mandatory national service measure.\nBut\u00a0a few days later, O\u2019Rourke said that he\u2019d gone too far in saying that national service should be \"mandatory.\"\n\"That is a word that has concerned a lot of you,\" O\u2019Rourke said about three minutes into his Jan. 8, 2018 remarks livestreamed on Facebook. \"And I\u2019ve got to tell you, you\u2019re right.\n\"I think I got way out in front of this without having the necessary conversation,\" O\u2019Rourke said, \"without listening to enough of you about if you were serving as a teacher, if you were serving in the VA, if you were clearing trails in a conservation corps, if you were serving in the military, if you were doing some kind of service that helps to make your country stronger, your community better -- that, that allows us all to have some sense of shared purpose and sacrifice in this country.\n\"You know,\" O\u2019Rourke went on, \"talking about this being a requirement for everybody, that\u2019s a few steps beyond the conversation that we\u2019ve had already. So I want to tell you that I\u2019ve heard you and that I\u2019m listening to you--and I think I made a mistake without having listened to enough people and really had the conversation we need to have about what this would look like, getting so far out ahead on an issue.\"\nAfter watching the video, we inquired into O\u2019Rourke\u2019s up-to-date position on national service. An O\u2019Rourke campaign spokesman, Chris Evans, replied by email: \"He does not plan on introducing a bill to require mandatory national service. Texans made their voices heard and he is listening to them.\"\nOur ruling\nIn January 2018, O\u2019Rourke said he soon planned to file a proposal mandating at least a year of national service for all young Americans. A few days later, O\u2019Rourke called his pitch for that mandate a mistake and, we confirmed, dropped plans to file a measure requiring national service.\nWe rate this shift a FULL FLOP.\n\nFULL FLOP-- A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop.\n Share the Facts 2018-01-10 21:37:41 UTC   PolitiFact    9 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Full Flop  On requiring young people to perform national service.
