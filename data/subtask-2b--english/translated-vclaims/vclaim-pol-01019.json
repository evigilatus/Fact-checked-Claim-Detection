The President of the Commission of the United States Republic of America, Gerold Nadler, D-N.Y., opened the hearing with a merciless statement: \"Every day in America, on average, 34 people are killed with a firearm, and more than 183 people are injured in an attack.\" Nadler warned against the proliferation of firearms violence in the United States compared to other industrialized countries. \"But while no other country in the industrialized world will tolerate such statistics - in fact, in most of those countries firearms deaths barely break three figures a year - in the United States, they are accepted as a dark reality,\" Nadler said. \"In comparison, in 2011, for example, the United Kingdom had 146 deaths due to armed violence; Denmark 71; Portugal 142; and Japan 30. But last year, in the United States, about 40,000.\" The Judicial Committee of the Chamber of Deputies approved the Human Rights Act 8, the bi-party background check, by a vote of 23 to 15 in February, in preparation for a full vote by the Council. It is not expected to pass the Republican-led Senate. A comparison of Nidler shows the magnitude of deaths caused by firearms in the United States, and we were curious to know whether his statements were accurate. The demand for absolute figures does not cause huge differences in population. Denmark, for example, has 5.7 million people, while the United States has 325.7 million. However, when taking into account the gun mortality rate, the United States is still in excess. The deaths associated with firearms in the United States, and injuries in the high estimate of firearms deaths in the United States, are essentially correct (although we do not yet have figures for 2018). When he said \"last year,\" he probably referred to the number of gun deaths in 2017, the last year for which data were available, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In that year, there were 39,773 firearms-related deaths. This number absorbs deaths resulting from suicide, murder, unintentional and unspecified deaths, as well as deaths resulting from law enforcement. Nadler claimed that there were an average of 34 deaths and 183 injuries resulting from firearms attacks on a daily basis, echoing an average of five years that the Brady Campaign for the Protection of Armed Violence, a non-profit group to advocate against firearms. The numbers crawl up when we look at 2017 alone, we found. On average, nearly 40 people were killed every day with a firearm in 2017. 107,002 non-lethal gunshot wounds included firearms attacks in 2017, according to the CDC, or about 293 per day. According to the CDC database, the number of non-lethal firearms-related injuries rose sharply from 62,896 in 2015 to 88,702 in 2016, prior to walk to 107,002 in 2017. Deaths resulting from firearms-related homicides have also increased. In the United States, the number of weapons killed in 2011 was higher than the total number of Nadler killed compared to the annual total of the United States in 2017 compared to the number of other countries in 2011. (Return in 2011, 32,351 in the United States lost their lives because of guns) The Nadir figures are consistent with the number of deaths on Gunpolicy.org, a public health database hosted by the University of Sydney. The figures are from the WHO mortality database. On January 13, 2021, General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021, more recent data are available for Denmark (82 in 2014), Japan (28 in 2014), Portugal (155 in 2014) and the United Kingdom (144 in 2013). Experts noted that Nadler highlighted a small sample, leaving developed countries with an increase in the number of deaths caused by firearms. For example, France experienced about 2,330 firearms-related deaths in 2016, while Germany recorded 1,220 firearms deaths that year, according to a study by researchers at the Institute of Health Measurement and Assessment at Washington University on global firearms deaths, 1990-2016. It is also important to consider differences in population size when making comparisons with other countries. Philip Cook, a leading arms researcher and an honorary professor of public policy from Duke University, said: \"The point he makes, however, is that the United States has a far greater number of weapons deaths than any other industrialized country, and its per capita is much greater than any other industrialized State - the right point.\" Although there is no uniform definition of industrialized countries, a study published in 2016 in the American Journal of Medicine compared total firearms mortality rates per 100,000 people in high-income OECD countries in 2010. Of most industrialized countries, the United States has an excellent firearms mortality rate, and the following country &apos; s mortality rate nearly tripled, Finland. The firearms-related mortality rate in Finland was 3.6 per 100,000 in 2010. The gap between the firearms-related mortality rate in the United States and other countries widened between 2010 and 2016. This does not make the United States the leading country in violent firearms killings in the world. Our previous report on international violent rifle mortality rates (excluding suicides and others) in 2016 found the United States to be ranked 10th worldwide, according to the Institute of Health Measurements and Assessments. El Salvador (40.29), Venezuela (34.77) and Guatemala (28.81) recorded the highest homicide rates per 100,000 people, compared with 3.85 in the United States. \"In 2011, for example, the United Kingdom had killed 146 people for armed violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; and Japan, 30. But last year, in the United States, about 40,000.\" The figures cited by Nadler were quite accurate in the corresponding years, but his claim lacked some context. Some precise figures for Wendler were dated, and did not take into account the relative population in each country. However, the most recent figures show that the volume and rate of firearms-related deaths in the United States exceed most, if not all, of its industrial counterparts. We appreciate that Nadler's statement is mostly true.
