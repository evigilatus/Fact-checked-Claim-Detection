The achievements of Scott Walker. \"More than 110,000 new jobs and 25,000 businesses have been created since Walker took office,\" said the issue originally. We noticed the additional zero on this second number, perhaps the echo of Walker's promise that Wisconsin would create 250,000 jobs in the private sector under his control. It's going to be very short, and we've estimated it broken. But what really caught our attention is the corrected version of the release, which says that 25,000 new companies have emerged since Walker took office in January 2011. It's a beautiful circular number, and a sharp contrast to what GOP said in a previous news release -- that 27,000 businesses \"spoiled the state\" because of the policies of the previous government. Jim Doyle and Mary Burke, former State Secretary of Commerce, are trying to get rid of Walker in the Governor's race in November. We've heard the claim of the 25,000 new companies before -- the Walker campaign they use, indicating figures published by a government agency, the Department of Financial Institutions. The Agency reported on the number of \"commercial entities\" registered in Wisconsin, including files submitted by newly established businesses, unregistered non-profit companies, cooperatives, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and partnerships, common law funds, veterans' organizations and some religious companies. The figures are rising and declining with the fall of some entities and the creation of others, giving economists a sense of economic activity. The net gain in the number of entities active during the three years of Walker plus is 24,947 or an increase of 7 per cent. (There were 389,316 commercial entities registered as at 30 September 2014) So this is the number 25,000 in the GOP claim. This is far from the end of the story. In many cases, this figure was found to have nothing to do with actual employment and job creation. We have studied this issue very closely before. In May 2014, we stated that the number of newly registered \"business entities\" included not only new enterprises that brought new jobs, but also thousands who had no workers at all - and few employment opportunities. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" The analysis by Polyte Fact Wisconsin found that the count included: -- thousands of limited liability companies created by real estate investors simply to acquire ownership of property or property. Even investors away from Australia are on the list because they bought rental properties in Wisconsin. The out-of-state companies that registered in Wisconsin because they might want to do business here. Hundreds of non-profit organizations, often managed on a voluntary basis, including scout forces, apartment associations, youth sports associations, volunteer fire department, historical associations, \"friends\" fund-raising groups, scholarship funds and many other organizations. The beginnings are just getting organized and not yet able to pay staff. As Paulette Fact and Wisconsin have noted several times in the evaluation of Walker's promise to establish 10,000 new companies in his tenure, business experts warn that many of the companies contributing liquor licences are established for tax and liability purposes and do not employ anyone. In order to judge the final progress that Walker has made with regard to his new business promise, we will also consider a second measure relating to business formation - the number of new sites, or \"businesses,\" created by companies. We reported in September that the State had added 6,657 such institutions until March 2014. There are certainly many emerging companies that provide employment among the thousands of entities referred to in the Global Programme of Action. But it's impossible to say, without contacting everyone who records a new company, exactly how many fits this category. However, it is easy to say that the GOP claim, which ignores thousands of non-working businesses in this mix, is far from the goal. At the same time, the Party's characterization of net losses in the files of commercial entities during Doyle years as \"sailing from the State\" is an off-the-shelf description. The decline reflected the slowdown in business activity during the Great Recession period, but there is no official account of the number of active employers who closed or picked up and left. The Wisconsin team has claimed that 25,000 jobs have been created since Walker took office. There is an element of truth: this is the number of commercial \"entities\" created. However, the portrayal of these recordings as business in the context of job creation is a significant extension because many of them are mere coincidences of companies, non-profit organizations and restructured copies of existing businesses and companies outside the State. We assess the claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07034"}
