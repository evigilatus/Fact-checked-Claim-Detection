Constables are also responsible for enforcing child-support orders and executing family violence protective orders. Quite often when serving court notices or enforcing court orders constables are confronted with hostility, resistance and, on some occasions, deadly force.\"\n\nThe statement continues: \"Eighty-eight Texas constables have died in the line of duty while serving their communities.\"\n\nWe asked Elfant\u2019s office to back up that count.\n\nElfant, who is also the 2012 Democratic nominee for Travis County tax assessor-collector, said by telephone that he based his figure on adding to a tally of 86 that was part of a video about constables posted a few years ago on the Travis County website. He said he must have miscounted when he penciled in 88.\n\nElfant said the original count came from information compiled by others. He later forwarded a list that he had fielded from Ron Hickman, the constable in Harris County\u2019s Precinct 4, indicating that 215 constables or officers in constable offices in about 100 counties have died in the line of duty since Oct. 17, 1852. That tally includes150 constables, the list suggests.\n\nAbout 60 of the deaths occurred in the 1800s with nearly 110 taking place from 1900 through 1939. Eleven took place in the 1940s, none in the 1950s, four in the 1960s -- and 10 through the rest of the last century. The list shows a dozen on-duty deaths since July 2003.\n\nListed causes of death are topped by gunfire, the cause in about 170 deaths. Less frequent causes include car accidents, heart attacks and stabbings.\n\nBy telephone, Hickman told us much of the research was undertaken by volunteers connected to the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, which describes itself as the state\u2019s largest union of law enforcement officers.\n\nBy phone, CLEAT spokesman Charley Wilkison told us the group\u2019s members helped spearhead the creation of the Texas Peace Officers\u2019 Memorial northeast of the Texas Capitol. He said the group\u2019s special counsel and former president, Ron DeLord, has long guided volunteer research efforts to confirm officers who died in the line of duty.\n\nWilkison said volunteer retired police officers comb libraries and cemeteries and other resources, checking on whether officers died in the line of duty. Wilkison said relevant findings are then made available to the agency that determines whose names appear on the memorial, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Standards and Education.\n\nKaye Wilson, a commission executive assistant, told us by telephone that as of May 2011, the last time names were added to the memorial, 85 constables were shown as having died in the line of duty. She added by email that this count is likely not complete.\n\nThe Elfant-provided list shows three constable officers who have died in the line of duty since then; it does not yet include Brian Bachmann, the Brazos County Precinct 1 constable who died in the College Station shootout.\n\nThe count of 85 constables whose names are on the memorial is slightly less than the 88 Elfant originally aired. But it\u2019s considerably less than the 150 tally of constables felled in the line of duty on the list Elfant offered to back up his claim.\n\nTime for subtraction.\n\nWe counted more than 30 constables on the non-government list who have yet to be approved to appear on the memorial. At our request, DeLord compared the lists and identified about 30 additional constables whose names are on the memorial but were not shown on the state\u2019s list. Also, he suggested that another one or two on the memorial were identified by the agency as deputy sheriffs but they also were constables. He pointed out that officers on the memorial are not identified by rank.\n\nKen Mobley, the agency\u2019s legislative liaison, later told us by phone that it\u2019s reasonable to say that at least 115 Texas constables have died in the line of duty. \"It could be more,\" Mobley said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIt may not be settled precisely how many constables have died in the line of duty over the years. But we ultimately found agreement between the agency that oversees the Capitol memorial and outside researchers that the total is at least 115 deaths, not 88.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElfant understated the total.
