0001	Ainsley Earhardt	Well, here's the presidential seal.
0002	Ainsley Earhardt	There is the White House and inside the White House is the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
0003	Brian Kilmeade	And why would you be bringing that up, Ainsley?
0004	Ainsley Earhardt	He joins us now by phone.
0005	Ainsley Earhardt	Thank you so much for being with us, Mr. President.
0006	Donald Trump	Well, good morning, and I picked a very, very special day because it's Melania's birthday, so I said let's do it on Melania's birthday.
0007	Donald Trump	So, happy birthday to Melania.
0008	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
0009	Brian Kilmeade	Hopefully, they'll be visits in between but have you decided on or do you want to tell us what you got her?
0010	Donald Trump	Well, I better not get into that because I may get in trouble.
0011	Donald Trump	Maybe I didn't get her so much.
0012	Donald Trump	I'll tell you what.
0013	Donald Trump	She has done  a got her a beautiful card.
0014	Donald Trump	You know, I'm very busy 
0015	Brian Kilmeade	At this point 
0016	Donald Trump	 to be running out looking for presents, OK?
0017	Donald Trump	But I got her a beautiful card and some beautiful flowers.
0018	Donald Trump	And she did a fantastic job with France.
0019	Donald Trump	I'll tell you what, the people of France are just  were spellbound by what happened with their great president who just left, Emmanuel, and he is a wonderful guy and 
0020	Steve Doocy	You guys really got along great.
0021	Donald Trump	 with a wonderful wife.
0022	Donald Trump	Well, we did and 
0023	Steve Doocy	You guys got along great.
0024	Donald Trump	We did and, you know, they are both terrific people.
0025	Donald Trump	And, Brigitte  and we had a fantastic time.
0026	Donald Trump	And much more importantly, we accomplished a lot.
0027	Donald Trump	We really accomplished a lot.
0028	Donald Trump	More than anybody knows.
0029	Donald Trump	You'll be seeing what we accomplished.
0030	Steve Doocy	Well, give us a hint.
0031	Steve Doocy	Give us a hint.
0032	Donald Trump	Well, I think we really came to recognize the  you know, I can say it from my standpoint but he is viewing, I believe, Iran a lot differently than he did before he walked into the Oval Office and I think that's important.
0033	Donald Trump	He understands where I'm coming from with respect to Iran.
0034	Donald Trump	Iran is a real problem for this country.
0035	Donald Trump	The president made a horrible deal.
0036	Donald Trump	When I say the president, I'm talking about past administration made a horrible deal giving $150 billion, giving $1.8 billion in cash  in actual cash carried out in barrels and in boxes from airplanes.
0037	Donald Trump	It's inconceivable  $1.8 billion.
0038	Donald Trump	And all they do is scream death to America, death to America.
0039	Donald Trump	And by the way, they're not screaming it so much anymore.
0040	Donald Trump	They were screaming it with him.
0041	Donald Trump	They don't scream it with me.
0042	Donald Trump	We haven't seen their little boats circling our ships in the ocean lately because they know if they do circle the ships they're not going to be there very longer.
0043	Brian Kilmeade	All right, I want to come back to that a little later because we do want to see if that  because you have a big deadline coming up with the Iranian agreement.
0044	Donald Trump	I do.
0045	Brian Kilmeade	But 
0046	Donald Trump	I do.
0047	Brian Kilmeade	 when it comes to Ronny 
0048	Steve Doocy	Your call.
0049	Brian Kilmeade	 Jackson, the word came out from John Roberts 
0050	Donald Trump	Yes.
0051	Brian Kilmeade	 now confirmed that he is no longer going to be a candidate to lead the V.A.
0052	Brian Kilmeade	In his statement is this.
0053	Brian Kilmeade	The allegations against me are completely false and fabricated.
0054	Brian Kilmeade	If they had any merit, I would not have been selected, promoted, and trusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as physician to three presidents over 12 years.
0055	Brian Kilmeade	In my role as a doctor, I have tirelessly worked to provide excellent care for all my patients.
0056	Brian Kilmeade	In doing so, I have always adhered to the highest ethical standards.
0057	Brian Kilmeade	Last night the report was you had a huddle.
0058	Brian Kilmeade	Is that what you decided last night?
0059	Brian Kilmeade	Is that what all of you decided?
0060	Donald Trump	Well, I even told him a day or two ago.
0061	Donald Trump	I saw where this was going.
0062	Donald Trump	And, you know, they're very upset because Mike Pompeo who was again, first in his class at West Point, top in his class at Harvard Law School.
0063	Donald Trump	A brilliant guy, a great guy, and somebody I get along with very well.
0064	Donald Trump	You know, Mike got through and they thought they had him stopped.
0065	Donald Trump	The Democrats are obstructionists.
0066	Donald Trump	It's horrible what they're doing.
0067	Donald Trump	They're not approving people.
0068	Donald Trump	They're taking them out to the maximum 30 hours.
0069	Donald Trump	That's a lot of time  30 hours  to interview people that are going to be approved.
0070	Donald Trump	I mean, they go 30 hours and then people will vote, and it's a disgrace.
0071	Donald Trump	In fact, they had a report the other day that at this rate it will be nine years before 
0072	Steve Doocy	It's unbelievable.
0073	Donald Trump	 they're allowed to come into government.
0074	Donald Trump	So you have that have given up everything.
0075	Donald Trump	They've given up their jobs.
0076	Donald Trump	Topline people  brilliant people.
0077	Donald Trump	They want to come in and help us in government and Chuck Schumer and the group take, you know, years to approve them  years.
0078	Donald Trump	We have judges that are waiting.
0079	Donald Trump	Top of the line people.
0080	Donald Trump	The best people in our country and 
0081	Donald Trump	And by the way, they're going to be approved but they take them out until the very, very end.
0082	Donald Trump	And they said over nine years before they get approved 
0083	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President 
0084	Donald Trump	 because they're using every little trick in the book.
0085	Brian Kilmeade	 Mitch McConnell could keep them seven days a week until they reach their 30 hours and make them, these men and women, stay until this gets done.
0086	Brian Kilmeade	Why won't he do that?
0087	Donald Trump	Well, he should be doing that and I think he will be doing that.
0088	Donald Trump	And he should be doing that.
0089	Donald Trump	Honestly, the Republicans  look, we have some absolute warriors.
0090	Donald Trump	We have  when I  I just watched your show.
0091	Donald Trump	Jim Jordan, and Mark Meadows, and Matt Gaetz, and DeSantis, and so many  Corey Lewandowski.
0092	Donald Trump	We have people  Diamond and Silk are warriors, by the way.
0093	Donald Trump	How about Diamond and Silk?
0094	Donald Trump	They've become amazing.
0095	Donald Trump	You know, that started off like somebody was talking about them on the Internet.
0096	Donald Trump	They were these two women  these two beautiful, wonderful, women.
0097	Donald Trump	And I said well, let me check it out.
0098	Donald Trump	It took me about two seconds to say start them  it's incredible.
0099	Donald Trump	So, Diamond and Silk, these are all warriors.
0100	Donald Trump	We have great people in the Republican Party and I think that, in one way, it's showing how bad, how obstructionist these Democrats are.
0101	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace what's happening.
0102	Ainsley Earhardt	Do you think the obstructionist window  as Dr. Jackson says, these allegations are baseless and they're just attacking him?
0103	Ainsley Earhardt	This is not true, he served our country but yet, he's still withdrawing his name.
0104	Ainsley Earhardt	So does the obstructionist win when your nominees don't fight back?
0105	Donald Trump	Well, I could say yes.
0106	Donald Trump	I can also say no because Doc Ronny  you know, we call him Doc Ronny, we call him Admiral Ronny.
0107	Donald Trump	He's an admiral, highly respected, a real leader.
0108	Donald Trump	And I watched what Jon Tester of Montana, a state that I won by like over 20 points.
0109	Donald Trump	You know, really, they love me and I love them.
0110	Donald Trump	And I want to tell you that Jon Tester  I think this is going to cause him a lot of problems in his state.
0111	Donald Trump	He took a man who was just an incredible man  an incredible man respected by President Obama.
0112	Donald Trump	He gave him his highest rating.
0113	Donald Trump	You saw what President Obama said.
0114	Steve Doocy	Yes.
0115	Donald Trump	President Bush  he was the doctor to President Bush, to President Obama and the family.
0116	Donald Trump	He's been my doctor.
0117	Donald Trump	And he runs a fantastic operation.
0118	Donald Trump	You know, they have many doctors and they run a fantastic operation.
0119	Donald Trump	And honestly, I said it to him.
0120	Donald Trump	He didn't come to me.
0121	Donald Trump	I said, you know, Doc, you run a great operation.
0122	Donald Trump	How do you think you'd do at the V.A.
0123	Donald Trump	?
0124	Donald Trump	Now, we can talk about experience but the V.A.
0125	Donald Trump	 when you think about 13 million people 
0126	Steve Doocy	Sure.
0127	Donald Trump	 you could take the head of the biggest hospital corporation of the world and it's peanuts compared to the V.A., so nobody has experience, you know.
0128	Donald Trump	It's a big monster.
0129	Donald Trump	And I'm really proud of the job we've done for the V.A.
0130	Donald Trump	because we got  we're working right now on Choice and really big  but we got rid of so many rules and regulations that made it impossible and we're really doing great at the V.A.
0131	Steve Doocy	Right.
0132	Donald Trump	But I want somebody that's going to be great.
0133	Donald Trump	He would've done a great job 
0134	Steve Doocy	Did 
0135	Donald Trump	He's got a tremendous heart.
0136	Steve Doocy	Any idea who you might 
0137	Donald Trump	You know, these are all false accusations that were made.
0138	Donald Trump	These are false and they're trying to destroy a man.
0139	Donald Trump	By the way, I did say welcome to Washington.
0140	Donald Trump	Welcome to the swamp.
0141	Donald Trump	Welcome to the world of politics.
0142	Brian Kilmeade	Sure.
0143	Donald Trump	But for Jon Tester to start bringing up stuff like candy man and the kind of things he was saying, and then say well, you know, these are just statements that are made.
0144	Steve Doocy	Right.
0145	Donald Trump	There's no proof of this.
0146	Donald Trump	And he has a perfect record.
0147	Donald Trump	He's got this beautiful record unblemished.
0148	Donald Trump	His son is a wonderful boy.
0149	Donald Trump	Goes to Annapolis, at the top of his class.
0150	Donald Trump	One of the finest cadets.
0151	Donald Trump	For him to be doing this to this man and this family, I think Jon Tester has to have a big price to pay in Montana because I don't think people in Montana  the admiral is the kind of person that they respect and admire and they don't like seeing what's happened to him.
0152	Steve Doocy	Well, the admiral has officially thrown in the towel.
0153	Steve Doocy	Any idea who you might nominate next?
0154	Donald Trump	I do, actually, but I better not give it.
0155	Donald Trump	Maybe we'll do it on my next call.
0156	Donald Trump	I do  I think we're going to have somebody great.
0157	Steve Doocy	All right.
0158	Donald Trump	Somebody that's more  you know, look, the admiral is not a politician which is what I liked, by the way.
0159	Steve Doocy	Is your nominee somebody in politics right now?
0160	Donald Trump	Somebody with political capability, yes.
0161	Steve Doocy	All right.
0162	Steve Doocy	Meanwhile, let's talk a little bit about your former FBI director James Comey, who you fired.
0163	Donald Trump	Right.
0164	Steve Doocy	He was on T.V.
0165	Steve Doocy	last night.
0166	Steve Doocy	He said 
0167	Donald Trump	I did a great thing for the American people by firing him.
0168	Steve Doocy	Well, he says he's not a leaker.
0169	Steve Doocy	He disputed what Anderson Cooper had said.
0170	Steve Doocy	But what's interesting is we've learned through Catherine Herridge's reporting is that apparently the guy he gave the secret memos to, Dr. Richman at Columbia University  he had this special government employee status where he had  you know, he could look at secrets.
0171	Steve Doocy	He had a badge to the building.
0172	Steve Doocy	And also, apparently, the memos were leaked to a wider group of people or at least two, maybe three, including former U.S. attorney Patrick Fitzgerald.
0173	Steve Doocy	Your opinion on what Mr. Comey is doing on his book tour and the fact that he had a special friend at Columbia University with an FBI badge.
0174	Donald Trump	Look, Comey is a leaker and he's a liar and not only on this stuff.
0175	Donald Trump	He's been leaking for years.
0176	Donald Trump	He's probably been using his friend, the socalled professor who now turns out to have FBI clearance, which he never said.
0177	Donald Trump	He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress.
0178	Donald Trump	He said he gave it to a friend and he gave it to a friend to leak classified information.
0179	Donald Trump	It's all classified.
0180	Donald Trump	It was totally classified.
0181	Donald Trump	So illegally  he did an illegal act and he said it himself in order to get a special counsel against me.
0182	Donald Trump	So the special counsel  and by the way, and Intelligence Committee and everybody else has found no collusion.
0183	Donald Trump	There's no collusion with me and the Russians.
0184	Donald Trump	Nobody's been tougher to Russia 
0185	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0186	Donald Trump	 than I am.
0187	Donald Trump	You can ask President Putin about that.
0188	Donald Trump	There's been nobody.
0189	Donald Trump	Between the military and the oil and all of the other things that I've done  the aluminum tax.
0190	Donald Trump	They send us a lot of aluminum and I put tariffs on aluminum coming in.
0191	Donald Trump	The 60 people that we sent out  the 60 socalled diplomats.
0192	Donald Trump	Nobody's been tougher.
0193	Donald Trump	Nobody's even been close to as tough as me and we hear this nonsense.
0194	Donald Trump	So there's no collusion whatsoever.
0195	Donald Trump	Well, Comey  what he did, Brian, was terrible.
0196	Donald Trump	He leaked classified information in order to try and get a special counsel 
0197	Steve Doocy	He says it wasn't classified, Mr. President.
0198	Steve Doocy	He says it wasn't classified.
0199	Donald Trump	Oh, it's  well, it's totally classified.
0200	Donald Trump	And he also leaked the memos which are classified.
0201	Donald Trump	Nobody unclassified them.
0202	Donald Trump	And those memos were about me and they're phony memos.
0203	Donald Trump	He didn't write those memos accurately.
0204	Donald Trump	He put a lot of phony stuff.
0205	Donald Trump	For instance, I went to Russia for a day or so  a day or two because I own the Miss Universe pageant.
0206	Donald Trump	So, I went there to watch it because it was near Moscow.
0207	Donald Trump	So I go to Russia  now, I did go there  everybody knows.
0208	Donald Trump	The locks are there, the planes are there.
0209	Donald Trump	He said I didn't stay there a night.
0210	Donald Trump	Of course, I stayed there.
0211	Donald Trump	I stayed there a very short period of time but, of course, I stayed.
0212	Donald Trump	Well, his memo said I left immediately.
0213	Donald Trump	I never said that.
0214	Donald Trump	I never said I left immediately.
0215	Donald Trump	So he said  and you know, the funny thing, he does these memos and then fake news CNN who's a total fake  you know, they give Hillary Clinton the questions to the debate and nobody  can you imagine, by the way, if you gave me the questions to a debate?
0216	Donald Trump	They would have you out of business 
0217	Brian Kilmeade	Yes.
0218	Donald Trump	 and they'd have me  you better get out of this campaign.
0219	Donald Trump	They don't even bring it up.
0220	Donald Trump	I mean, CNN  fake news CNN actually gave the questions to the 
0221	Brian Kilmeade	Yes, but don't worry about them.
0222	Ainsley Earhardt	I want to ask you 
0223	Donald Trump	No, no  no, no, but think of it.
0224	Donald Trump	How bad is that?
0225	Donald Trump	So anyway  so Comey leaked and, by the way, also what he did with CNN in order to placate them, you saw that whole scenario.
0226	Donald Trump	This is a big mistake, this book.
0227	Donald Trump	He is guilty of crimes and if we had a Justice Department that was doing their job instead of spending $8 million trying to find 
0228	Steve Doocy	It's your Justice Department.
0229	Steve Doocy	Mr. President  Mr. President, you're the Republican in charge 
0230	Donald Trump	You're right, yes, you're right.
0231	Steve Doocy	You've got a Republican running it.
0232	Donald Trump	But here's what  I answer this all the time.
0233	Donald Trump	Because of the fact that they have this witch hunt going on with people in the Justice Department that shouldn't be there  they have a witch hunt against the President of the United States going on  I've taken the position  and I don't have to take this position and maybe I'll change  that I will not be involved with the Justice Department.
0234	Donald Trump	I will wait until this is over.
0235	Donald Trump	It's a total  it's all lies and it's a horrible thing that's going on.
0236	Brian Kilmeade	Yes.
0237	Donald Trump	A horrible thing and yet, I've accomplished, with all of this going on, more than any president in the first year in our history.
0238	Donald Trump	And everybody 
0239	Steve Doocy	OK.
0240	Donald Trump	Even the enemies and the haters admit that.
0241	Ainsley Earhardt	Right.
0242	Donald Trump	We have accomplished more than any president in the first year, by far.
0243	Donald Trump	If you look at regulations, and the big tax cuts, and Judge Gorsuch  so many things  and many other judges.
0244	Donald Trump	But the big thing  the tax cuts, the regulations  nobody's done what we've done  what I've done despite what's going on.
0245	Donald Trump	So I'm very disappointed in my Justice Department but because of the fact that it's going under, and I think you'll understand this, I have decided that I won't be involved.
0246	Donald Trump	I may change my mind at some point because what's going on is a disgrace.
0247	Donald Trump	It's an absolute 
0248	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
0249	Donald Trump	 disgrace.
0250	Donald Trump	And by the way, the only collusion is the collusion with the Democrats and the Russians.
0251	Donald Trump	You take a look at what's going on there.
0252	Donald Trump	They wouldn't even give their server  the DNC, Democratic National Committee, wouldn't even give its server to the FBI.
0253	Donald Trump	So what kind of an FBI  they break down doors for Paul Manafort early in the morning.
0254	Donald Trump	His wife is in bed like at five or six in the morning.
0255	Donald Trump	And they undo the lock for Michael Cohen early in the morning.
0256	Donald Trump	And yet, they walk into the DNC and they won't give them the server.
0257	Donald Trump	They said we're not giving you the server.
0258	Donald Trump	Oh, OK, we'll leave.
0259	Donald Trump	That's not the FBI.
0260	Donald Trump	That's a fix.
0261	Brian Kilmeade	Let's talk about Michael Cohen.
0262	Brian Kilmeade	Yesterday, through his attorney, he's going to be taking the Fifth.
0263	Brian Kilmeade	What's your reaction to that being that you worked with him for a couple of decades 
0264	Donald Trump	I did.
0265	Donald Trump	He 
0266	Brian Kilmeade	 as your attorney.
0267	Donald Trump	He's a good person.
0268	Donald Trump	He's a great guy.
0269	Brian Kilmeade	What's at stake for you, Mr. President?
0270	Donald Trump	Brian, you know Michael.
0271	Donald Trump	Michael's been on your show, I'm sure, a lot.
0272	Donald Trump	You know, Michael 
0273	Brian Kilmeade	We know.
0274	Donald Trump	 is a good person.
0275	Donald Trump	Let me just tell you that Michael is in business.
0276	Donald Trump	He's really a businessman at fairly big businesses, I understand.
0277	Donald Trump	And I don't know his business but this doesn't have to do with me.
0278	Donald Trump	Michael is a businessman.
0279	Donald Trump	He's got a business.
0280	Donald Trump	He also practices law.
0281	Donald Trump	I would say probably the big thing is his business and they're looking at something having to do with his business.
0282	Donald Trump	I have nothing to do with his business.
0283	Donald Trump	I can tell you he's a good guy.
0284	Donald Trump	He sometimes 
0285	Brian Kilmeade	But isn't your business  isn't his business your attorney, Mr. President?
0286	Donald Trump	I have many, many  just so you understand, I have many attorneys.
0287	Donald Trump	I have attorneys  sadly, I have so many attorneys you wouldn't even believe it.
0288	Steve Doocy	How many  how much of your  Mr. President, how much of your legal work was handled by Michael Cohen?
0289	Donald Trump	Well, he has a percentage of my overall legal work  a tiny, tiny little fraction.
0290	Donald Trump	But, Michael would represent me and represent me on some things.
0291	Donald Trump	He represents me  like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal he represented me.
0292	Donald Trump	And, you know, from what I see he did absolutely nothing wrong.
0293	Donald Trump	There were no campaign funds going into this 
0294	Ainsley Earhardt	Then why is he pleading the Fifth?
0295	Donald Trump	 which would have been a problem.
0296	Donald Trump	Because he's got other things.
0297	Donald Trump	He's got businesses and from what I understand they're looking at his businesses, and I hope he's in great shape.
0298	Brian Kilmeade	Yes.
0299	Donald Trump	But he's got businesses and his lawyers probably told him to do that.
0300	Donald Trump	But I'm not involved and I'm not involved  and I've been told I'm not involved.
0301	Brian Kilmeade	Right, Mr. 
0302	Ainsley Earhardt	Right.
0303	Donald Trump	That just came out of the newspapers.
0304	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President 
0305	Donald Trump	I've been told I'm not involved in that.
0306	Ainsley Earhardt	We want to get to Kanye West.
0307	Ainsley Earhardt	He tweeted that he loves you, that you're his brother, and 
0308	Donald Trump	He's got good taste.
0309	Ainsley Earhardt	 the left goes ballistic.
0310	Ainsley Earhardt	What's your reaction?
0311	Donald Trump	Yes.
0312	Donald Trump	Well, they do.
0313	Donald Trump	You know, I have known Kanye a little bit and I get along with Kanye.
0314	Donald Trump	I get along with a lot of people, frankly.
0315	Donald Trump	But Kanye looks and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it's been in the history of our country, OK?
0316	Donald Trump	He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it's been in the history of our country.
0317	Donald Trump	He sees, by the way, female unemployment  women unemployment the lowest it's been in now almost 19 years.
0318	Donald Trump	He sees that stuff and he's smart.
0319	Donald Trump	And he says you know what, Trump is doing a much better job than the Democrats did.
0320	Donald Trump	And by the way, if they ever got in and started putting back all these rules and regulations where you can't breathe, where businesses go out of business, our country would be in big trouble.
0321	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0322	Donald Trump	And had I not gotten elected, Hillary would have come in.
0323	Donald Trump	She would have added more rules and regulations.
0324	Donald Trump	We would have been out of business because you saw what was happening.
0325	Donald Trump	We were going down.
0326	Brian Kilmeade	Yes, and a couple of things on top of that.
0327	Brian Kilmeade	There's a bigger picture.
0328	Brian Kilmeade	Kanye West comes out.
0329	Brian Kilmeade	Regardless of what he says he doesn't have anything personally against you.
0330	Brian Kilmeade	He likes you even if he doesn't agree with everything.
0331	Brian Kilmeade	Then he has other people in the black community.
0332	Brian Kilmeade	Like, Chance the Rapper comes out and says black people don't have to be Democrats.
0333	Brian Kilmeade	Have Republicans done a bad job ignoring the black community up until now?
0334	Donald Trump	You know, I think it was just a custom.
0335	Donald Trump	People don't realize, you know, if you go back to the Civil War it was the Republicans that really did the thing.
0336	Donald Trump	Lincoln was a Republican.
0337	Donald Trump	I mean, somehow it changed over the years and I will say I really believe it's changing back.
0338	Donald Trump	Remember, I was going to get no black votes?
0339	Steve Doocy	Right.
0340	Donald Trump	I was going to get none?
0341	Donald Trump	Well, I got a lot.
0342	Donald Trump	I got a lot of support, you know, and I should have gotten much more.
0343	Donald Trump	Now  in fact, I used to go around saying what do you have to lose?
0344	Donald Trump	I'd say that at speeches, remember?
0345	Donald Trump	I'd go into a stadium.
0346	Donald Trump	I'd talk about the AfricanAmerican vote.
0347	Donald Trump	I said the education is not good.
0348	Donald Trump	The  obviously, the law enforcement that your community  the crime is at levels that nobody's ever seen before.
0349	Donald Trump	You know, I'd go through like seven, 10 stats.
0350	Donald Trump	I'd say vote for me.
0351	Donald Trump	What do you have to lose?
0352	Steve Doocy	Right.
0353	Donald Trump	So now they've voted for me crime is way down and really importantly, the unemployment picture 
0354	Steve Doocy	Yes.
0355	Donald Trump	 is the best it's been in the history of our country for AfricanAmericans.
0356	Steve Doocy	Mr. President, what does it say though about the political discourse in this country that when somebody comes out and says I like Donald Trump, suddenly the political left goes out and destroys them?
0357	Steve Doocy	Shania Twain was asked a couple of days ago about well, if you could've voted for Donald Trump would you have?
0358	Steve Doocy	And she said yes, I would have.
0359	Steve Doocy	And then she got so destroyed online she had to come out and apologize.
0360	Steve Doocy	And then yesterday, the same thing with Kanye West.
0361	Steve Doocy	Suddenly, people are saying the guy's out of his mind because he supports you.
0362	Steve Doocy	What happened to being able to have a different point of view?
0363	Donald Trump	All right, I'll tell you what happened.
0364	Donald Trump	Shania, who I think is terrific but she made a mistake by sort of saying I wish I didn't, you know, go public with it, but we know how she feels.
0365	Donald Trump	But people have done that and they're amazed at what happens to their business because we have tremendous support.
0366	Donald Trump	We have tremendous fans.
0367	Donald Trump	If I ever called for a rally in Washington, D.C. we'd have millions of people coming into Washington because they love what's happening.
0368	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0369	Donald Trump	So when I see a Kanye sticking to his guns or when I see others, and there are plenty of others, sticking to their guns and coming out and saying that you have a young lady who's been very much in the news in the last three or four days 
0370	Brian Kilmeade	Candace Owens.
0371	Donald Trump	 because she is  she is fantastic.
0372	Donald Trump	She's like the hottest thing out there now.
0373	Donald Trump	If you have people do that they become much more popular.
0374	Donald Trump	Remember, we won the election and we won it easily.
0375	Donald Trump	You know, a lot of people say oh, it was close.
0376	Brian Kilmeade	Yes.
0377	Donald Trump	And by the way, they also like to always talk about Electoral College.
0378	Donald Trump	Well, it's an election based on the Electoral College.
0379	Donald Trump	I would rather have a popular election but it's a totally different campaign.
0380	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0381	Donald Trump	It's as though you're running  if you're a runner you're practicing for the 100yard dash as opposed to the onemile.
0382	Donald Trump	The Electoral College is different.
0383	Donald Trump	I would rather have the popular vote because it's  to me, it's much easier to win.
0384	Brian Kilmeade	Yes, it's a totally different set of goals as opposed to the Electoral College.
0385	Donald Trump	Yes, but we have an Electoral College 
0386	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0387	Donald Trump	I got 306 and she got what, 223.
0388	Donald Trump	So, remember 
0389	Brian Kilmeade	Yes.
0390	Donald Trump	 there was no way to break 270.
0391	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
0392	Donald Trump	I heard that on CBS, and NBC, and ABC.
0393	Donald Trump	They're all fake news.
0394	Brian Kilmeade	So 
0395	Donald Trump	I heard that for so long  and CNN.
0396	Donald Trump	But I heard that for so long.
0397	Donald Trump	There is no way.
0398	Donald Trump	So what they're trying to do is suppress the vote.
0399	Donald Trump	Everyone goes home and says you know, I really like Donald Trump but I've watched on the news  and they don't know it's fake news.
0400	Donald Trump	I've taught them it's fake news.
0401	Donald Trump	I've watched on the news that he can't win, so let's go to a movie, darling, and then we'll come home and we'll watch 
0402	Brian Kilmeade	And you'll find out in the midterms whether they go with the darling home or they go to the movies.
0403	Donald Trump	But I think that 
0404	Brian Kilmeade	Let's talk about 
0405	Donald Trump	I think he'll do better than people think in the midterms.
0406	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President 
0407	Donald Trump	Did you know it's very 
0408	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0409	Donald Trump	The economy is so strong and jobs are so good that I think we're going to surprise  you know, we won an election yesterday in Arizona.
0410	Donald Trump	Nobody talks about it.
0411	Donald Trump	They had these massive booths set up for CNN and everybody.
0412	Donald Trump	They had these big booths set up because they were hoping  you know, they spent a fortune on the Democrat and the Republican won  Lesko.
0413	Donald Trump	And you know what, nobody talks about it.
0414	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
0415	Brian Kilmeade	But, Mr. President, you can argue  you can argue that the midterms are going to be decided on big things like a meeting that you're going to have oneoneone with Kim Jong Un.
0416	Brian Kilmeade	How much are you looking at the summit that starts tomorrow with South Korea to look at what you're going to be doing when you sit down with North Korea?
0417	Brian Kilmeade	And on top of that, we know this is confidential but can you give us any more information on the oneonone that Mike Pompeo had with Kim Jong Un?
0418	Brian Kilmeade	A lot of people are hungry for some details.
0419	Donald Trump	Well, I can.
0420	Donald Trump	First of all, we're doing very well with North Korea and we'll see how it all comes out.
0421	Donald Trump	Again, Brian, I'm not like Obama where you go in and you have a Kerry, who's the worst negotiator I've ever seen.
0422	Donald Trump	He goes in for the Iran deal, he never leaves.
0423	Donald Trump	He should've left.
0424	Donald Trump	He should've just left.
0425	Donald Trump	He would have  could have made a much better deal.
0426	Donald Trump	But  so it could be that I walk out quickly  with respect, but it could be.
0427	Donald Trump	It could be that maybe the meeting doesn't even take place.
0428	Donald Trump	Who knows?
0429	Donald Trump	But I can tell you right now they want to meet.
0430	Donald Trump	They wanted to go to the Olympics.
0431	Donald Trump	Look, it was very, very nasty with Little Rocket Man and with the buttons  and, you know, my button's bigger than  everybody said this guy's going to get us into nuclear war.
0432	Donald Trump	Let me tell you.
0433	Donald Trump	The nuclear war would have happened if you had weak people.
0434	Donald Trump	We had weak people.
0435	Donald Trump	This should have been settled long before I came into office.
0436	Donald Trump	This is a much different ballgame than if they did it five or 10 or 20 years ago.
0437	Donald Trump	This is a much more dangerous ballgame now.
0438	Donald Trump	But I will tell you it's going very well.
0439	Donald Trump	Mike Pompeo did go there.
0440	Donald Trump	He wasn't supposed to meet with Kim Jong Un but he did.
0441	Donald Trump	He  you know, they arranged, actually while he was there, to say hello.
0442	Donald Trump	We have incredible pictures of the two talking and meeting which I'd love to release.
0443	Donald Trump	If we can I'll do that, actually.
0444	Donald Trump	It's not a bad idea.
0445	Brian Kilmeade	So it was just a hello, Mr. President?
0446	Donald Trump	No, it was more than a hello.
0447	Donald Trump	They got along.
0448	Donald Trump	They were with each other for, you know, more than an hour.
0449	Steve Doocy	Right.
0450	Donald Trump	They spoke and he also spoke with his counterparts in North Korea.
0451	Donald Trump	They had a great meeting.
0452	Donald Trump	He then left.
0453	Donald Trump	It was very, very secret  very, very quiet.
0454	Donald Trump	They had a great meeting  he left.
0455	Donald Trump	And, you know, when I watch  liked I watched sleepy eyes Chuck Todd the other day saying why is the president giving up so much and North Korea's giving up nothing?
0456	Donald Trump	This was at the beginning of Meet the Press, which, I mean, this guy shouldn't even be 
0457	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0458	Donald Trump	 on the show.
0459	Donald Trump	So I said to myself well, wait a minute, I'm seeing it just the opposite.
0460	Donald Trump	I haven't given up anything.
0461	Donald Trump	I haven't even talked about it.
0462	Donald Trump	I haven't given up anything.
0463	Donald Trump	We're not giving up much.
0464	Ainsley Earhardt	When are you going to meet with him?
0465	Donald Trump	I'm not giving up much.
0466	Donald Trump	They've given up denuclearization, testing, research.
0467	Donald Trump	We're going to close different sites.
0468	Donald Trump	And I'm saying to myself, wait a minute.
0469	Donald Trump	All of these things he's given up and we haven't even really that much asked them because we would have asked them but they gave it before I even asked.
0470	Donald Trump	So I have this guy, fake news  he's on television saying why am I giving up something?
0471	Donald Trump	I never gave up anything.
0472	Donald Trump	The people have to understand how dishonest the news is.
0473	Donald Trump	And in all fairness to Fox, you guys don't always treat me great but you treat me fairly.
0474	Donald Trump	You know, it's not like Fox is perfect for me.
0475	Donald Trump	They're not  they're tough but at least it's fair.
0476	Donald Trump	When you look at some of the others  you look at like a CNN, they'll have a council of seven people and of the seven people every one of them is against me.
0477	Donald Trump	I'm saying, where do we  where do they even find these people?
0478	Donald Trump	I appreciate the 
0479	Brian Kilmeade	I'm not your doctor, Mr. President, but I would  I would recommend you watch less of them.
0480	Donald Trump	I don't watch them at all.
0481	Donald Trump	I watched last night.
0482	Steve Doocy	Well, that makes it easy.
0483	Donald Trump	I'll tell you what.
0484	Donald Trump	I watched leaking, lying Comey last night and I did  I did  I hated to do it.
0485	Donald Trump	You know, one of the reasons people say you're still looking good, Mr. President.
0486	Donald Trump	How do you do it?
0487	Donald Trump	Well, one of the things I've been able to do, which is something I never thought I had the ability  I would always watch when I was  now, frankly, I don't have time for two reasons.
0488	Donald Trump	There's too much and I don't have time.
0489	Donald Trump	But I would watch  whether it's good or bad, I'd always watch.
0490	Donald Trump	I have an ability  I don't watch NBC anymore.
0491	Donald Trump	They're as bad as CNN.
0492	Donald Trump	I don't  and by the way, I made them a fortune with THE APPRENTICE.
0493	Donald Trump	Think of that one.
0494	Donald Trump	I made them  and I did 19 episodes.
0495	Steve Doocy	Your alma mater.
0496	Donald Trump	No, but I made them a fortune.
0497	Steve Doocy	Right.
0498	Donald Trump	You would think that these guys would treat me great.
0499	Donald Trump	I made them a fortune.
0500	Donald Trump	So they treat me horribly 
0501	Steve Doocy	OK.
0502	Donald Trump	 and they treat me falsely.
0503	Donald Trump	But just one thing.
0504	Donald Trump	I don't watch things now.
0505	Donald Trump	I can put it out of my mind and I never, ever thought that that would be possible.
0506	Donald Trump	And you know what that does?
0507	Donald Trump	It keeps you on the ball.
0508	Donald Trump	It keeps you  you keep your sanity and it works very well.
0509	Donald Trump	But last night I did watch 
0510	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President, I have one question.
0511	Donald Trump	I did watch a liarleaker and his performance, by the way, was horrible.
0512	Donald Trump	And I will say this.
0513	Donald Trump	Anderson Cooper was surprisingly tough and he did a good job.
0514	Steve Doocy	He did.
0515	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President, real quickly, have you decided on a date to meet with Kim Jong Un?
0516	Donald Trump	We have a decision to be made.
0517	Donald Trump	We have three or four dates and that includes 
0518	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0519	Donald Trump	 locations.
0520	Donald Trump	We have five locations 
0521	Brian Kilmeade	Great.
0522	Donald Trump	 and that will all be narrowed down.
0523	Donald Trump	I can only say this.
0524	Donald Trump	When I came into office people thought we were going into nuclear war, OK, and now they're saying wow 
0525	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0526	Donald Trump	 it looks like that's going to be taken care.
0527	Steve Doocy	Mr. President 
0528	Donald Trump	I think we're doing very well.
0529	Donald Trump	Let's see what happens.
0530	Steve Doocy	OK. We're running out of time but when we came down after your first month in office and we did that big famous now interview in the East Room 
0531	Donald Trump	Right.
0532	Steve Doocy	 Ainsley asked you a question to grade your first month in office.
0533	Steve Doocy	Now, fastforward.
0534	Steve Doocy	You've been in office over a year.
0535	Steve Doocy	Last year, you said in the first month I give myself an A for effort and a C for messaging because you were having trouble  the White House was  explaining what you were doing.
0536	Steve Doocy	How would you grade yourself now?
0537	Donald Trump	Look, I'm fighting a battle against a horrible group of deepseated people  drained the swamp  that are coming up with all sorts of phony charges against me, and they're not bringing up real charges against the other side.
0538	Donald Trump	So we have a phony deal going on and it's a cloud over my head.
0539	Donald Trump	And I've been able to do  to really escape that cloud because the message now everyone knows  it's a fix, OK.
0540	Donald Trump	It's a witch hunt and they know that and I've been able to message it.
0541	Donald Trump	I would give myself an A.
0542	Donald Trump	Nobody has done 
0543	Steve Doocy	Right.
0544	Donald Trump	 what I've been able to do and I did it despite the fact that I have a phony cloud over my head that doesn't exist.
0545	Donald Trump	It was what the Democrats used to try and make an excuse for their loss of an election  for their loss of the Electoral College that they should never lose because the Electoral College is set up perfectly for the Democrats and this was an absolute total beating in the Electoral College.
0546	Donald Trump	They should never lose the Electoral College and they did 
0547	Brian Kilmeade	But 
0548	Donald Trump	 and they got thwamped.
0549	Brian Kilmeade	But does it make you want to talk to Mueller and put an end to it?
0550	Brian Kilmeade	Does it make you want to talk to him because that's what Rudy Giuliani 
0551	Donald Trump	Well, if I can.
0552	Donald Trump	The problem is that it's such a  it's such  if you take a look they're so conflicted.
0553	Donald Trump	The people that are doing the investigation  you have 13 people that are Democrats.
0554	Donald Trump	You have Hillary Clinton people.
0555	Donald Trump	You have people that worked on Hillary Clinton's foundation.
0556	Donald Trump	They're all  I don't mean Democrats, I mean like the real deal.
0557	Donald Trump	And then you look at the phony Lisa Page and Strzok and the memos back and forth, and the FBI.
0558	Donald Trump	And by the way, you take a poll at the FBI.
0559	Donald Trump	I love the FBI, the FBI loves me.
0560	Donald Trump	But the top people in the FBI, headed by Comey, were crooked.
0561	Donald Trump	You look at McCabe where he takes $700,000 from somebody supporting Hillary Clinton.
0562	Donald Trump	He takes $700,000 for his wife's campaign.
0563	Donald Trump	And by the way, didn't even spend that money.
0564	Donald Trump	They kept some of it because under that law you're  he took seven.
0565	Donald Trump	He took $700,000 from a group headed by Terry McAuliffe who was under investigation by McCabe and the FBI and that investigation disappeared.
0566	Donald Trump	He took $700,000.
0567	Donald Trump	And you look at the corruption at the top of the FBI.
0568	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace.
0569	Donald Trump	And our Justice Department, which I try and stay away from, but at some point I won't.
0570	Brian Kilmeade	OK.
0571	Donald Trump	Our Justice Department should be looking at that kind of stuff, not the nonsense of collusion with Russia.
0572	Donald Trump	There is no collusion with me 
0573	Ainsley Earhardt	All right.
0574	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
0575	Donald Trump	 and Russia, and everyone knows it.
0576	Brian Kilmeade	Everyone.
0577	Brian Kilmeade	We could talk to you all day but it looks like 
0578	Donald Trump	Sure.
0579	Brian Kilmeade	 you have a million things to do.
0580	Donald Trump	Well, you could have 
0581	Brian Kilmeade	But I hope you can join us again, Mr. President.
0582	Ainsley Earhardt	Thank you so much for much for being with us.
0583	Donald Trump	And, Ainsley, good luck with your book.
0584	Donald Trump	It's going to be a winner.
0585	Ainsley Earhardt	Thank you.
0586	Ainsley Earhardt	Thank you so much.
0587	Steve Doocy	And happy birthday to Melania.
0588	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0589	Brian Kilmeade	We'll see you next Thursday, Mr. President.
0590	Donald Trump	OK, thank you.
0591	Brian Kilmeade	The phone line's open.
0592	Donald Trump	Sounds OK.
0593	Steve Doocy	Call in again some time.
0594	Ainsley Earhardt	Thank you.
0595	Donald Trump	Good.
0596	Donald Trump	Thank you, bye.
0597	Brian Kilmeade	Very nice of you to call in.
