Mayor Ted Wheeler\u2019s vote to Donald Trump using the voter registration exploit.\" Wheeler is a Democrat and has clashed with Trump, so the idea that he would cast a ballot for Trump seems ludicrous. A spokesperson for Wheeler said that he hadn\u2019t voted yet.\nSimilar claims were flagged by CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. A thread on 4chan featured users claiming, with screenshots, that they could go in and change people\u2019s votes by using names and addresses. This quickly went viral on social media platforms, despite debunking on Twitter and Reddit.\n4chan is a forum that allows anyone to post anonymously. It is a known source of online disinformation, hate speech and conspiracy theories.\nState and local elections officials in Oregon told us that people can\u2019t go on to the state website and change voters\u2019 ballots.\n\"No votes can be cast or cancelled online through MyVote,\" said Andrea Chiapella, spokesperson for the Oregon Secretary of State.\nOregon is a long-time vote by mail state. Military and overseas voters \u00a0as well as voters with disabilities can download their ballot, but there are protections in place to prevent someone from casting a ballot on behalf of another voter.\nThe misinformation on social media centers around the \"mark my ballot\" field on the state elections website.\u00a0\n\"The mark my ballot tool helps voters with disabilities and military and overseas voters to mark their ballot,\" Chiapella said. \"They still must return the ballot with the proper identifying information, including their signature, which will be compared against the voter\u2019s signature in the voter registration file before being accepted to count.\"\nWe tested out the \"mark my ballot\" tool by entering the name and date of birth of Oregon Secretary of State Bev Clarno. The website showed that Clarno was sent a ballot on Oct. 14 in Deschutes County. Then we clicked on the \"mark my ballot\" option and the top of the page said \"only for use by military, overseas and voters with disabilities.\"\u00a0\nThe online form then allows a voter to mark their selections by clicking on boxes next to the names of candidates they choose. Afterward, the voter can review her ballot, showing only the selections she made. The instructions state that the voter has to then print the page and return it to their county election office.\u00a0\nWhile we could theoretically fill out the form online, that doesn\u2019t mean we could actually submit it (and we didn\u2019t try). In fact, that would be a crime, and there are protections in place to prevent that from happening.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAltering someone\u2019s voter registration or attempting to vote another person\u2019s ballot are both crimes in Oregon. It is a felony punishable with up to 5 years in prison and a $125,000 fine, Chiapella said.\u00a0\nThe voters still must return the ballot with the proper identifying information, including their signature, which will be compared against their signature in the voter registration file before being accepted.\nIf someone attempted to sign the ballot on behalf of another voter, \"odds are pretty thin they would know what the voter\u2019s signature looks like\" and not returning it in the appropriate envelope would also flag that ballot, said Nancy Blankenship, county clerk for Deschutes County.\nVoters who are in the military or overseas can mail back their completed ballots in the return identification envelopes that are provided. If they choose to return their ballots by fax or email, there is an additional secret ballot waiver form they must submit.\u00a0\nDisabled voters enclose their ballots in provided secrecy envelopes and then place them in the return identification envelopes, which they must sign before they put it in the mail or a ballot drop box.\nZane Sparling, a reporter for the Portland Tribune, tweeted that \"simply clicking these buttons does not create a vote. The form must be submitted by fax or email, and the form does not work unless you have been granted absentee ballot status by an elections official.\"\nRELATED: How to make sure your ballot is counted this fall\nOur ruling\nA thread on 4chan said if you know someone's name and date of birth you can change their votes on Oregon\u2019s voting website.\nThe state elections website does not allow voters to cast ballots online. If you can\u2019t vote online, you certainly can\u2019t change someone\u2019s vote online. Military and overseas voters \u00a0as well as voters with disabilities can download their ballot online, but they must return the ballot with the proper identifying information, including their signature.
