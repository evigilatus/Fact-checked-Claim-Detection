Depends on the crime", "text": "A South Texas state senator objected to Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s plans to send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border by suggesting crime in Texas\u2019 Rio Grande Valley isn\u2019t as bad as in other parts of the state.\nIn a July 21, 2014, press release, Juan \"Chuy\" Hinojosa, D-McAllen, said the \"humanitarian crisis\" reflected in Central Americans crossing the Rio Grande \"needs to be resolved through immigration reform and working with Mexico and Central American countries to stop the flow \u00a0of immigrants coming across our border. To call up the National Guard is a very simplistic approach to a complex problem.\"\nBesides, Hinojosa said, \"we have less crime in the Valley than we do in other major Texas cities. If we were to use crime as a basis to deploy the National Guard then we should be sending the National Guard to other metropolitan areas in our state.\"\nHas there been less crime in the region closest to the state\u2019s southern tip than its big cities hundreds of miles away?\nWe\u2019ve explored crime near the border before. In March 2010, we rated as Pants on Fire Perry\u2019s claim that his border-security efforts led to a 60 percent decrease in border crime. His cited calculations didn\u2019t consider crimes committed in cities and towns where most border residents live. It also compared two calendar quarters rather than weighing years of data. Later, we saw flaws in descriptions of El Paso as the nation\u2019s safest city, partly because the FBI has counseled against using its crime research to reach comparative judgments.\nIn this instance, we were curious about Hinojosa\u2019s twist on the crime comparison.\nAsked how Hinojosa reached his conclusion, Luis Moreno, his Senate chief of staff, forwarded a July 24, 2014, email from the Texas Department of Public Safety including a chart tallying arrests in 2013 and \"to date\" in 2014 in counties including Hidalgo in the Rio Grande Valley. In 2013 and in 2014, the chart shows, Harris, Dallas, Tarrant and Bexar counties each had more arrests than Hidalgo County. Nueces County, home to Corpus Christi, had the fewest arrests among the checked counties. Moreno said he did not ask DPS to convert the arrest counts to arrest rates.\nFBI crime figures\nAs we launched our run at comparisons, we recognized with the help of Texas criminologists that the latest available data, as compiled by the FBI, enable comparisons only through the first half of 2013. That omits the 12 months through June 2014 \u2014 the period during which officials including Perry raised stepped-up concerns about border security in the wake of more unaccompanied children crossing the Rio Grande.\nThat caveat in mind, we looked at different reported crimes by county and city, finding the senator\u2019s statement held up for many -- but not all -- comparisons. We drew our figures from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program, which tracks seven \"index\" crimes: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft. A hedge: State officials have said these counts underreport the amount of drug-cartel-related violence by not folding in common cartel-tied offenses such as extortion and kidnapping, as the Austin American-Statesman noted in an October 2011 news story on crime in the border region.\nStrap in; our comparisons follow.\nTotal reported offenses, January through June 2013\nAn FBI chart presents counts of reported offenses in the first half of 2013 for more than 20 Texas cities, rolling in several of the biggest cities (Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin but not Fort Worth) and smaller cities including Brownsville and McAllen, key cities in the Rio Grande Valley, which consists of Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr and Willacy counties.\nIn the first half of 2013, each of the big cities had more total reported incidents of violent and property crime than the two valley cities. But that\u2019s arguably not surprising given that Houston, Dallas and the other non-valley cities are much more populous than their valley counterparts.\nAdjusting for population differences\nTo account for population differences, we focused on estimated rates of violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents.\nBy this balancing metric, each of the sampled big cities had a higher rate of violent crime than Brownsville or McAllen in the first half of 2013. McAllen also had the lowest rate of property crime in this sampling. But the reported property-crime rate for Brownsville (2,156 per 100,000 residents) narrowly outpaced the rate for Dallas (2,137 per 100,000 residents).\nCrime rates, 2012\nSeeking a full year\u2019s comparison, we turned to population-adjusted rates for specific reported crimes in 2012 as broken out in an undated annual report by the DPS.\nGenerally, the report showed, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin had more crimes per 100,000 residents than the valley cities of Brownsville and McAllen or the valley counties of Cameron, Hidalgo and Starr.\nBut there were indications of places in the valley experiencing more crime.\nRural Willacy County, population 8,355, bested all our sampled cities and counties with 108 rapes per 100,000 residents, based on its 2012 total of nine reported rapes. Based on 37 total reported assaults, the county also trailed only Houston in our sampling in its rate of aggravated assaults, and it landed third for its rate of reported burglaries.\nAlso, Brownsville, Harlingen and McAllen had higher rates of reported larceny than Houston or Dallas, according to the report. Another twist: Harlingen\u2019s general rate of 5,279 reported crimes per 100,000 residents (based on 3,543 total reported offenses) exceeded Dallas\u2019 rate of 5,049 reported crimes per 100,000 residents (based on 62,680 reported offenses).\nCrime Rates for Selected Texas Cities and Rio Grande Valley Counties, 2012 (Per 100,000 Residents)\n\n\n\n\n\nJURISDICTION\n\n\nMURDER\n\n\nRAPE\n\n\nROBBERY\n\n\nAGG.
