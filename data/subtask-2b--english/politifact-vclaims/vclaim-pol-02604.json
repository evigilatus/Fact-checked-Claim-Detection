The article is phony.\nA spokesman for the Justice Department, Ian Prior, confirmed for PolitiFact that Rosenstein remains deputy attorney general. Rosenstein first joined the Justice Department in 1990, and Trump nominated him as deputy attorney general in January. The Senate confirmed his nomination on April 25.\nRosenstein oversaw the Russia inquiry at the Justice Department after Attorney General Jeff Sessions agreed in March to recuse himself from all proceedings related to the Russia investigation.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May, Rosenstein wrote a memo recommending that Trump fire former FBI director James Comey because of how he handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation. When Trump fired Comey, the White House made public Rosenstein\u2019s memo.\nBut recently, Trump has been critical of the Justice Department.\nIn a Dec. 2 tweet, Trump wrote, \"Many people in our Country are asking what the \"Justice\" Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and \"acid washed\" 33,000 Emails? No justice!\"\nTrump tweeted a day after Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to federal investigators related to lying to the FBI that he hadn\u2019t spoken about sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\nBut a critical tweet is a far cry from a firing. Trump hasn\u2019t fired deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02604"}
