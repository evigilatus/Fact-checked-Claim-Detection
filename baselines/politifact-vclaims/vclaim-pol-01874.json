Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a vocal advocate of tighter gun laws, called out President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court for the nominee\u2019s position on the Second Amendment.\n\"Brett Kavanaugh is a true Second Amendment radical,\" Murphy tweeted July 9. \"He believes assault weapon bans are unconstitutional, a position way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia.\"\nBrett Kavanaugh is a true Second Amendment radical. He believes assault weapon bans are unconstitutional, a position way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia.\u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) July 10, 2018\n\n\nWe wondered whether Kavanaugh, who will replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy if confirmed, on the issue of assault weapons indeed stands to the right of Scalia, who as a young man would tote his rifle on the New York City subway.\nAfter reading the relevant court decisions, experts told us both Kavanaugh and Scalia hold that assault weapons are protected under the Second Amendment.\nAssault weapons encompass a series of semi-automatic firearms, mostly rifles. Semi-automatic weapons are those where one trigger pulled equals one bullet shot.\nThe Heller case\nOne of the defining cases on gun rights in recent years is D.C. vs. Heller. Alongside five others, Richard Heller, a special police officer for the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit in 2003 challenging the constitutionality of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, which restricted D.C. residents from owning handguns. The suit eventually reached the Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 in Heller\u2019s favor. The majority decision was written by Scalia.\nScalia argued that handguns have not traditionally been banned and are in common use. He also pointed out, however, that the right granted by the Second Amendment \"is not unlimited,\" and upholds \"laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\"\nThe question of assault weapons never came up.\nInstead, rifles came up in a later legal challenge between Heller and Washington, when Heller questioned the constitutionality of the district\u2019s Firearms Registration Amendment Act of 2008, created in response to the Supreme Court decision.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit favored the district two to one, but Kavanaugh dissented.\n\"There is no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"Semi-automatic rifles, like semi-automatic handguns, have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting, and other lawful uses.\"\nScalia\u2019s opinion\nWhen the question of whether assault weapons bans are unconstitutional was raised of the Supreme Court, Scalia was unable to answer because the court rejected the case.\nThe case in question was Friedman vs. Highland Park, a challenge to a Chicago suburb\u2019s ordinance banning semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. However, Justice Clarence Thomas voiced a similar opinion to Kavanaugh\u2019s in the rejection, which Scalia joined.\nScalia and Thomas wrote that in accepting the ban, the court was not complying with the precedent set by Heller.\n\"The city\u2019s ban is thus highly suspect because it broadly prohibits common semi-automatic firearms used for lawful purposes,\" Thomas wrote. \"Roughly five million Americans own AR-style semi-automatic rifles. The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting. Under our precedents, that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons.\"\n\"In the Highland Park case, we should say Kavanaugh was on the same page as Scalia,\" said Eugene Volokh, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nMurphy\u2019s office pointed out that Scalia\u2019s opinion explicitly allowed for regulations, which some lower courts found included assault weapons bans. But the rulings are not unanimous.\n\"You have more courts upholding the bans than finding them unconstitutional, but there\u2019s definitely a split of opinion on this,\" said David Kopel, an associate policy analyst at the Independence Institute.\nOur ruling\nMurphy said that on assault weapons, Kavanaugh\u2019s position is \"way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia.\"\nKavanaugh stated that assault weapons bans were unconstitutional in the circuit court case Heller vs. District of Columbia. Scalia\u2019s opinion on the Supreme Court allowed for some regulations in District of Columbia vs. Heller, which some courts have interpreted to rule in favor of assault weapons bans. But the decision was not about assault weapons.\nWe found at least one instance where Scalia signed off on saying an assault weapons ban would be unconstitutional. So Kavanaugh\u2019s position and Scalia\u2019s are substantially similar. Leaving room for legal interpretation, we rate this statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01874"}
