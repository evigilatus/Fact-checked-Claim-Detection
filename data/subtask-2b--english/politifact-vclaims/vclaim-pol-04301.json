But Texas has lost the most -- and I say that every time you guys invite me on -- Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America. So that\u2019s absolutely something they (police officers) are aware of coming into the job, coming into the profession.\"\nWe wondered if Texas truly is No. 1 by this unfortunate indicator.\nBy phone when we inquired, Wilkison told us his statement was based on figures from the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE). He also texted a photo of an ad CLEAT posted to the May 2016 edition of American Police Beat which stated that 1,959 Texas officers had been killed in the line of duty.\nTo our inquiry, the commission\u2019s Ken Mobley, said in an email that the names of \"1,955 law enforcement officers are on the Texas Peace Officer Memorial. These are the individuals who were approved by the commission as per TCOLE rules of eligibility, some (individuals) dating back to the early 1800s.\"\nWilkison\u2019s figure turned out to be higher than other counts we found of law enforcement deaths for Texas though two other analyses support the notion that Texas leads in officer deaths.\nAs of Sept. 7, 2016, when we looked, the Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP) -- which was cited by Wilkison and others as a data source and is curated by a nonprofit that says it\u2019s dedicated to honoring America's fallen law enforcement heroes -- listed Texas\u2019 count at 1,866 officer deaths (plus 12 deaths of K9 dogs) across 27 cause-of-death categories:\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOURCE: Web page, \"Texas Line of Duty Deaths,\" Officer Down Memorial Page, \u00a0(accessed Sept. 7, 2016)\nThe group\u2019s Texas tally, which considered deaths as far back as 1837 (before statehood), folded in 1,096 deaths by gunfire including the 1930 death of Uvalde Chief of Police John F. Connor and the July 2016 deaths in Dallas. Another 61 Texas deaths, from 1858 through 2007, were attributed to accidental gunfire.\nAmong other populous states, per the group, California and New York had lost 1,569 and 1,568 officers, respectively, in the line of duty; Illinois had sustained 1,070 such deaths; and Florida had tallied 757 line-of-duty deaths.\nSeeking other counts, a web search led us to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF), which says it\u2019s dedicated to honoring and remembering the service and sacrifice of U.S. law enforcement officers and that as of March 24, 2016, Texas had sustained 1,682 law enforcement deaths--compared to 1,571 in California, 1,375 in New York and 1,013 in Illinois.\nTo our inquiry, a fund spokesman, Steve Groeniger, told us by phone that Wilkison got it right about Texas having the most law enforcement deaths. The fund says on its \"law enforcement facts\" web page: \"New York City has lost more officers in the line of duty than any other department, with 705 deaths. Texas has lost 1,682 officers, more than any other state. The state with the fewest deaths is Vermont, with 23.\"\nGroeniger also mentioned the FBI\u2019s Law Enforcement Officers Killed or Assaulted (LEOKA), collected as part of their Uniform Crime Statistics. According to emailed figures provided by Stephen Fischer of the FBI, some 457 officer deaths in Texas since 1980 led other states and accounted for nearly 10 percent of 4,736 officer deaths nationally. California followed closely behind with 436 deaths.\nOur ruling\nWilkison said: \"Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America.\"\nThis appears to be so, both of late (since 1980) and since the 1800s.\nWe rate the claim True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.
