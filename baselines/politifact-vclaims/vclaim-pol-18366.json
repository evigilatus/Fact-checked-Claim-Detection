Masks are suggested, not required,\" says a post shared on April 28.\nThe number listed in the post calls the Pennsylvania Department of Health\u2019s 24/7 phone line that\u2019s intended for people to report a \"public health emergency.\"\nBut this is bad advice. In many states, Pennsylvania included, employees and customers are required to wear masks inside stores. It\u2019s when businesses don\u2019t enforce those rules that they should be reported, the health department says.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Stores have the right, as defined in our Worker Safety Order, to refuse service to anyone not wearing a mask.\"\nStates differ on mask policies right now, but businesses largely have the right to refuse service under U.S. law, as long as it isn\u2019t on discriminatory grounds, which includes turning people away based on their race, religion, sex or national origin.\u00a0\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18366"}
