One allegation from the current Mr. Democratic Jean Shahin has drawn our attention. Shaheen is facing a challenge from former Republican Sin, Scott Brown. In a newsletter from her campaign, Shaheen said: \"I have always supported women's right to choose because I know that women should make health-care decisions in consultation with their doctors and families, not with their employers. Scott Brown &apos; s record is clear: when calculated, he does not defend women &apos; s reproductive rights and economic security. He co-sponsored legislation allowing employers to deny women coverage of birth control or even mammography. New Hampshire women cannot trust Brown Scott, and his record shows that he is wrong for New Hampshire. We've noticed two related allegations, but they're specific enough to analyse them separately. First, did the legislation in question allow employers to deny women coverage in the area of birth control? Would employers have been allowed to refuse mammography coverage? We will consider here the claim for birth control, and mammography in a separate fact check. The two issues were found to be very different. In a different Shaheen campaign newsletter, the campaign explained its sources by writing, \"FACT: Scott Brown: Co-sponsored and voted for Blunt Amendment, which allows employers to deny women access to a range of health-care services, including contraceptives and mammography coverage.\" The amendment in question was proposed by Mr. Roy Blunt of the Democratic People &apos; s Republic of Korea. The draft resolution - i.e., its elimination - was submitted by a vote of 51-48, in which a simple majority was required. Of those who voted \"nai\" -- that is, those who wanted to keep it under consideration -- Brown was, and then represented Massachusetts in the Senate. He also co-sponsored a previous measure, S.1467, the Respect for the Rights of Conscientious Persons Act 2011. The Shahin camp is therefore right that Brown acted in support of this measure. But what did the amendment say? It has expanded the scope of acceptable procedures to exclude provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for religious or moral reasons. It focuses on the mandates under the Act for preventive services, which is called the \"basic health benefit package.\" On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job.\" We agree with Shaheen's campaign that the provision has been broadly drafted. While it is not aimed at abortion or birth control per se, it is so widely written that there is little doubt that it can be invoked on behalf of those who oppose abortion and certain types of birth control. As we explained in the verification of other facts, there is no evidence that anyone has expressed a religious or moral objection to mammography, so we have assessed this allegation mostly wrong. But the issue is that the Blunt Amendment would have had a stronger impact on access to birth control. Some anti-abortionists have supported the rights of non-admission of employers who oppose certain types of birth control methods that they say work like abortors. In fact, this issue was at the heart of the Supreme Court &apos; s decision of 2014, which was closely monitored in the Borwell v. Hoppe Hope case. In this case, a majority of between 5 and 4 ruled that a private company, such as the \"Hobe lobby\" retail company, could refuse, for religious reasons, to pay for certain types of contraceptive methods provided for by the Affordable Care Act, otherwise, the health coverage of employees. The only trick we have with the formulation of Shaheen's claim is that the Blunt Amendment did not single out birth control, which is the impression one can easily obtain from her statement. However, since the amendment was written on a very wide scale - since birth control has long been the subject of controversy for religious or moral reasons - we do not see this as a major problem. Our Governor Shaheen said that Brown was a joint care legislation to allow employers to deny women birth control coverage. The amendment, which was supported by Brown, was written sufficiently to allow religious conscience to choose non-restriction - an issue on which there was a long-standing political debate on religious and moral grounds. We're assessing the claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07168"}
