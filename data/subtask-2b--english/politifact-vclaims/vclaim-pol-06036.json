And that\u2019s the difference because they\u2019re not actually doing women\u2019s health issues. They're involved in something way different than that.\"\nBush, who cut off state funding for Planned Parenthood as governor, then pivoted to talk about veterans affairs.\nBush\u2019s claim that the organization is not involved in women\u2019s health caught our attention. Setting aside the issue of abortion, Planned Parenthood offers many other medical services -- most of which seem obviously related to women\u2019s health.\nWe reached out to Bush\u2019s campaign, and it directed us to a tweet that Bush posted, after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton criticized his Aug. 25 remarks. Bush\u2019s tweet said, \"PP (Planned Parenthood) treatment of unborn has been horrifying. Let's support quality women's health programs instead.\"\nThe National Library of Medicine defines \"women\u2019s health\" as \"the branch of medicine that focuses on the treatment and diagnosis of diseases and conditions that affect a woman's physical and emotional well-being.\"\nWhile \"women\u2019s health\" encompasses all health issues as they pertain to women, reproductive health in particular is Planned Parenthood\u2019s primary focus. The organization offers contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services and cancer screenings, including breast exams. (No, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms, but it conducts breast exams and refers women to other clinics for mammograms.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total, Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million individual patients in 2013, and it provided nearly 11 million services, according to its most recent annual report. About 12 percent of patients received an abortion, (assuming one procedure per abortion patient), so the remaining 88 percent of patients received other health services.\nHere\u2019s the section of the report breaking down services provided in 2013:\n\nOur friends at the Washington Post's Fact Checker also looked at\u00a0Bush's claim and gave it\u00a0four pinocchios, their lowest rating.\nOur ruling\nBush said, Planned Parenthood is \"not actually doing women\u2019s health issues.\"\nIt\u2019s hard to reconcile Bush\u2019s statement with the fact that -- setting abortion procedures aside -- Planned Parenthood offered more than 10 million services in 2013. Those services included contraception, breast exams, pregnancy tests, pap tests and STI testing and treatment. Bush is opposed to abortion, but it doesn\u2019t make sense to say that Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t addressing women\u2019s health issues.\nWe rate Bush\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06036"}
