Here\u2019s what we know about vaccine tattoos: More than three years before the first novel coronavirus cases were reported, in July 2016, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology started studying how using an invisible ink that could be injected into children along with vaccines could address vaccine tracking challenges in developing countries. The dye would be visible under near-infrared light for up to five years and provide a quick, affordable way of helping health providers know if a child\u2019s vaccinations were current. The Gates Foundation contributed funds for this research.\u00a0\nBut Kevin McHugh, a Rice University bioengineering professor who worked on the study, told Reuters that, to his knowledge, \"there are no plans to use this for coronavirus.\"\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18364"}
