The banner switches to \"Racist baby probably voted for Trump.\"\n\n\u00a0\nThe video then fades to black and text appears on the screen that reads, \"This is what really happened,\" before showing the full video of the boys excitedly running toward each other and embracing.\u00a0\nIt concludes with text that says, \"America is not the problem. Fake News is. If you see something, say something. Only you can prevent fake news dumpster fires.\"\nTrump shared a deceptively edited video. CNN never ran those headlines, and it accurately covered the story in 2019.\nThe video was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Trump, because he is a politician, is exempt from Facebook\u2019s policies against sharing false or misleading information. But other people online have shared the same video, and they are not exempt from the Facebook fact-checking program.

Trump posted this on his Twitter. For all you Trump supporters, I hope that his use of their beautiful video in this way disgusts you. It should,\" Finnegan\u2019s mom, Erica Russo McKenna, said on Facebook.\n\nThe manipulated video includes a watermark for a Twitter account called @CapreDonktum, which routinely creates and posts satirical memes and parody videos.\u00a0\nA CNN spokesperson also responded to Trump\u2019s post on Twitter.\n\"CNN did cover this story \u2014 exactly as it happened,\" the tweet reads. \"Just as we reported your positions on race (and poll numbers).
