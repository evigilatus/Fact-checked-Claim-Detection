(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe survey was done by a New York City firm, 5W Public Relations. The firm announced the results on Feb. 27, 2020, as public health concerns rose in the United States. The next day President Donald Trump held a news conference about the nation\u2019s response to coronavirus.\nThe survey \"via phone\" of 737 American beer drinkers over age 21 on Feb. 25 and 26 was done \"regarding their opinions about the popular Mexican beer brand, Corona, as a result of the deadly coronavirus that's spreading around the world,\" the PR firm\u2019s news release said.\nSo, this was a survey of beer drinkers, not of Americans overall.\nThe first result reported in the release:\u00a0\n\"38% of beer-drinking Americans would not buy Corona under any circumstances now.\"\nThe release also does not say whether the survey was representative of American beer drinkers.\nThe firm did not provide us the results of other questions, but told us these were the questions used in the survey:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you a beer drinker?\nAre you a Corona drinker?\nIs Corona related to the coronavirus?\nIn light of the coronavirus, do you plan to stop drinking Corona?\nWould you buy Corona in a store?\nWould you order a Corona in a restaurant/bar/public venue?\nWould you buy Corona under any circumstances now?\nThe questions asked by the firm underscore the problems with the reliability of this poll. And because the PR firm won\u2019t release more details, it\u2019s ultimately untrustworthy.\nRespondents, for instance, were asked if Corona is related to the coronavirus but were never told it isn\u2019t. They were then asked a leading question, \"In light of the coronavirus, do you plan to stop drinking Corona?\" that suggests some correlation between the beer and the virus even though there is none. And some respondents may have said they don\u2019t drink Corona and would continue not to drink Corona.\nNevertheless, the news release to the media was clear that the 38% figure applied to beer drinkers, not Americans overall.\nAt PolitiFact, we\u2019re used to seeing a fair number of either misleading polls, or misleading reports about polls. In this case, the lack of transparency by the polling firm (a PR company) means you should be skeptical, too. Some news organizations, however, were not. You can read PolitiFact\u2019s guide to polling to better understand what to look for and what types of polls to stay away from.\nOur ruling\nA statement shared on Facebook said: \"Poll Finds 38% of Americans Say They Will Not Drink Corona Beer Because of Virus.\"\nThe poll was of American beer drinkers, not Americans overall. Other details of this \"poll\" \u2014 including the specific question asked \u2014 are unknown, so it\u2019s difficult to say beer drinkers wouldn\u2019t drink Corona beer because of the virus, or some other reason.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18030"}
