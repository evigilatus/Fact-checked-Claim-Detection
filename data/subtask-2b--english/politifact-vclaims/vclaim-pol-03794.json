We rated Promise Kept Walker\u2019s pledge to freeze property taxes during his first term; and In the Works his promise to cut property taxes so that the levy on a typical home in 2018 is lower than it was in 2010.\nBut on the measure Walker cited, are property taxes lower than they have been in generations?  Share the Facts   Politifact    0 6  Politifact Rating:   Wisconsin property taxes, as a percentage of personal income, \"are the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II.\"    Scott Walker Republican Wisconsin governor   In a speech Tuesday, January 10, 2017 -01/-10/2017    Read More  info    \nThe speech\nFigures highlighted during a formal address such as the annual state of the state speech are likely to have been well vetted. But as we found during our live fact checking of Walker\u2019s speech on Twitter, the governor made some statements that could benefit from clarification.\nWalker said more people were employed in Wisconsin in 2016 than at any time in history. When that same claim was made in June 2016 it rated Mostly True. But we pointed out economists generally prefer the unemployment rate, which accounts for population growth over time.\nWalker\u2019s speech also touted listening sessions he has held throughout the state.\nBut as we found in checking an August 2016 claim by a potential 2018 gubernatorial candidate, Democratic state Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire, Walker\u2019s sessions were \"invite-only and excluding the press.\"\nWorld War II times\nTo back Walker\u2019s statement on property taxes, the governor\u2019s office pointed to a July 2015 memo from the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayer Alliance.\nThe memo stated that Wisconsin\u2019s property tax burden was at 3.6 percent of personal income, the lowest since 1946 (when it was also 3.6 percent).\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDale Knapp, the alliance\u2019s research director, gave us the raw numbers:\nThe levy was $9.45 billion in 2015 on property taxes payable in 2016. That figure amounts to 3.6 percent of total personal income of $263.3 billion in 2015.\nKnapp told us comparing property taxes to income is one way to see how much of a take property taxes have on the state\u2019s economy. He said the memo reflects the most recent figures available.\n(A note: In a January 2017 report, the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau measured property taxes versus income at 10 intervals dating back to 1970. Wisconsin\u2019s property tax level per $1,000 of personal income exceeded the national average during each period and ranked 12th nationally in 2014, the latest year covered in the report.)\nTamarine Cornelius, an analyst with the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project, didn\u2019t dispute the taxpayer alliance\u2019s 3.6 percent figure. But she told us one thing to note is that some people haven\u2019t benefited as much from Walker\u2019s property tax cuts.\nFor instance, Walker\u2019s 2011-\u201913 state budget stopped inflation adjustments for the state Homestead Credit, which softens the impact of property taxes and rent on persons with lower incomes. The program can put more than $1,100 back in people\u2019s pockets through income tax refunds. For 2016, people with a household income of less than $24,680 could qualify for the credits.\nCornelius cited figures from the state fiscal bureau showing that the credits have been reduced by $133.5 million since Walker ended the inflation adjustments. That means the money stayed in state coffers rather than being refunded to residents.\nThe office of state Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, also pointed to Walker's budget moves, including limits on how much school districts can levy in property taxes,\u00a0in noting that\u00a0more than half of Wisconsin's 424 school districts have passed referendum initiatives since the beginning of 2012.\u00a0\nOur rating\nWalker said Wisconsin property taxes, as a percentage of personal income, \"are the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II.\"\nIt\u2019s worth noting that one change Walker made reduces income tax refunds given to lower-income taxpayers through the state Homestead Credit, which is aimed at softening the impact of property taxes.\nBut an analysis by the respected Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance shows that on the measure Walker cited, property taxes are the lowest they have been since 1946.\nWe rate the statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03794"}
