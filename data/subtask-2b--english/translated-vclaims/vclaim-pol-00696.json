The short answer is no. However, a recent Facebook article says this allegation and reads: \"As a child, Mitch McConnell had polio, and the government paid for all his care and rehabilitation. Now, as the leader of the Republicans in the Senate, Maconel is taking government-funded care away from tens of millions of Americans. Let that sink in.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is true that McConnell was diagnosed with polio when he was young, as stated in his 2016 memoirs \"Long March.\" The Government did not pay for his treatment, but through charitable donations. Maconel was diagnosed with polio in 1944 at the age of 2 about 10 years before the development of the polio vaccine. In his memoirs, McConnell wrote that he was cared for in warm Springs, Ga, at the polio treatment centre established by President Franklin Roosevelt, who suffered from the disease. :: David Oshinsky, historian and author of the Pulitzer Prize book \"Polio: An American Story,\" told Poletti Fact in an e-mail that there was no common government funds at the Springs Darm Treatment Center, Ga. It was \"all private donations.\" Rumours on social media emerged in June 2017, when Republicans in the Senate, led by McConnell, took steps to repeal and replace President Barack Obama &apos; s law on affordable care. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. On January 16, 2021, the Facebook page of the Democrats who occupied the Facebook site published an accompanying article stating that public funds sponsored by the government saved McConnell's life, which several outlets reported at the time. The story that appeared on the website of the Democrats who have occupied the site has since been deleted. We tracked a footage of the article using a Wibak machine archive. Another story with similar reports appeared on the same day in Death and Tax on the Internet. Both falsely claim that Maconel &apos; s care and rehabilitation were driven by the public, and thus funded by the Government. But there are no federal dollars that helped to cure Maconel from the disease, a privately funded facility. In 1937, Roosevelt re-established the Warm Springs Foundation as the National Foundation for Polio, and in 1938, the Foundation launched its first fund-raising campaign in March. The comedy and radio character Eddie Kantor drafted the phrase and helped promote the country-wide Dems campaign, which was to coincide with the President &apos; s annual birthday on 30 January. Cantor and other organizers sought donations on the radio the month before the ball, and by January 29, 1938, on the eve of the President's birthday, \"more than 80,000 messages with dimes and dollars flooded the White House mailroom.\" The postroom \"was buried in an avalanche of donations, a total of 2,680,000 cents or $268,000,\" according to the Demps website. The funds also went to grant research to find a cure for the disease. This was achieved in the mid-1950s, when Jonas Salk successfully developed the polio vaccine. While Roosevelt &apos; s political office promoted fund-raising for polio care and research, and the President used his name and popularity to help raise funds, money came from the American people &apos; s charity, as well as celebrities and corporations. The care given to McConnell as a young child was neither taxed nor funded by the government, as suggested by the viral meme. The facility operates as a non-profit organization throughout the country. We assess this mime wrong.
