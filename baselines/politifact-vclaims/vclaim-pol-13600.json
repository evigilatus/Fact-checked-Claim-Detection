And if some of those jobs are lost in this, so be it. We're broke. It's time for us to get serious about how we're spending the nation's money.\"\n\nA few readers asked us whether Boehner was right about the number of new federal jobs, so we checked into it.\n\nWe turned, as we always do, to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official statistician for the United States labor force.\n\nBLS calculates two categories that illuminate Boehner\u2019s comment.\n\nThe first is the overall rise in federal employees between January 2009 and January 2011. The net increase was 58,000.\n\nThe second is the number of federal employees without counting U.S. Postal Service workers. Over that same two-year period, the increase was 140,800.\n\nBoth of those numbers are lower than the 200,000 figure Boehner cited.\n\nWe also checked with John M. Palguta, vice president for policy with the Partnership for Public Service, a non-profit that promotes government service, and he confirmed our general conclusion using numbers from a different database.\n\nHe dug into the U.S. Office of Personnel Management\u2019s on-line federal workforce data source, \"FedScope.\" He found that in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, respectively, the federal government filled a net 59,995 and 47,062 new permanent, full-time, non-seasonal, non-postal jobs. Combined, that means that federal employment rose by 107,057 jobs -- well short of 200,000.\n\nWe checked with Boehner\u2019s office to see what his statement was based on. Aides said they had used figures from December 2008 to January 2011, which produced an increase of 153,000 federal, non-postal jobs. Then they factored in, on a discounted basis, the temporary jobs required to carry out the 2010 Census. According to the Census Bureau, such temporary employment peaked at 585,729 in early May 2010.\n\n\"We think 200,000 is probably generous to the White House,\" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel.\n\nIn previous fact checks, we have rejected the idea of adding temporary Census workers to federal job totals. While the statements we rated previously aren\u2019t structured in exactly the same way as Boehner\u2019s, we think the general principle remains valid -- that when you\u2019re counting the rise or fall in the number of federal workers over a long period of time, it\u2019s cherry picking to count the creation of temporary jobs but not their elimination.\n\nAll told, we find that Boehner\u2019s 200,000 number is way off. We rate it False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
