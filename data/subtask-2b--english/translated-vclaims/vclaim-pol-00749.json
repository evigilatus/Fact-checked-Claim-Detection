Since then, other forensic experts have objected to this determination, saying that the picture is correct. Since then, the French publisher AFP has published a story quoting men who appear in the picture. The men didn't object to the image. We can no longer support the claim that the picture has been manipulated, and we have deleted that proposal from this fact-checking exercise. The fact-finding assessment, which analyses the allegation that two Muslims were laughing with the burning of Notre Dame, remains on fire. The following is an account of the updated story. You can read more about this story report in a separate report. When Notre Dame burned down in Paris, sad people were photographed as they watched a fire that damaged the iconic cathedral and began to feed the social media. \"It's like losing a family member,\" said a man in The New York Times, who said that the viewers were gasping, covering their mouths in terror and wiped out tears. But one picture shared on Facebook, among other platforms, is a picture of two men who appear to be smiling while hiding under police tape with Notre Dame in the fire behind them. \"Muslims laugh as Notre Dame burns...\" said one account that posted the picture on Facebook on April 15. This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That's because the posters didn't know anything about the men in the picture - what they were doing and whether they were Muslims, especially. We searched the photo on the Internet, found it published on Sputnik, a news site run by the Russian government. The image of men, with Sputnik's copyright code underneath it, is part of the 9:29 p.m. update on the fire that says \"evacuation is under way at Notre Dame Cathedral, Paris El de la City.\" This function does not include any description or explanation of men, nor does it describe their position or religion. On January 22, 2021, Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen mentioned an article on Facebook in which the Paiden administration said that she was a liberal terrorist. \u2022 On 22 January 2021, this picture was spread over the Internet, where others used it to support allegations that the Cathedral fire was a terrorist attack and fed anti-Muslim rhetoric. The photo appeared on Red White and F-You! With Mindy Robinson, who presented a story on the top of her home page on April 16, entitled, \"Notre Dame Cathedral Burns... and the media refuses to say what's clear (it's terrorism). \u2219 (the fire case is under investigation but is still unknown). Robinson writes about the picture with the guys. \"Man, I'm sure I wonder what a specific group of people stood to gain from all this \"heavy irony.\" They were described by a Twitter user as \"extremist Muslims.\" But another Twitter user contacted @hoaxEye about the photo. According to Twitter, the account is run by Jan Ahlberg of Finland, with a view to disproveing the tricks. Hawks-Aye address: \"Fake image equals zero word.\" When the user, Ahlberg, asked about the picture, Helberg replied: \"He says that this is a picture of people laughing while Notre Dame burns. We don't yet know anything about these people, the situation and so on.\" In a statement, Sputnik said, \"The men seen in the picture did not mention once in every article and had absolutely no connection to the story. That other news organizations should seek to find an alternative meaning to this image is the same definition of false news. We are also shocked by the comments made by these media judging the religion of these two men only because of their appearance.\" We're assessing this Facebook Pants on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00749"}
