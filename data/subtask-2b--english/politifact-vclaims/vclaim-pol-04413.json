But in the process he made an already inaccurate argument even more wrong.\nThe GOP presidential candidate attacked Clinton on several fronts Aug. 25 in Manchester, including over alleged elements of her tax plan.\n\"She wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they're paying now,\" Trump said.\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not respond to our requests to show us how Clinton\u2019s tax targets black business owners with close to a 50-percent tax increase. It appears Trump\u2019s penchant for going off-script further undermined his own attack.\nWrong about rates\nLet\u2019s acknowledge immediately that Trump\u2019s focus on African-Americans, as if Clinton planned to tax them as some vindictive measure against black-owned businesses, is misleading.\nTrump has been attempting to woo black voters lately, so he likely was trying to present his point about taxation in a way that resonated with African Americans. But it comes across as Clinton targeting blacks in a way that would not apply in the tax code. There\u2019s nothing in her tax plan that spotlights the country\u2019s 2.6 million or so black-owned businesses in such a way.\n\"The tax code is race neutral. Nothing targets \u2014 or gives preference to \u2014 anyone based on race,\" said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. \"Whether a provision disproportionately affects people of one race relative to those of another race depends on particular situations but isn't based on race.\"\nWe have an idea what Trump was trying to say. Earlier this month, he told a Detroit crowd on Aug. 8 that Clinton \"would tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent.\" We rated this statement Mostly False in a previous fact-check.\nThe Trump campaign told us then that his earlier statement referred to a 4 percent surcharge Clinton has proposed on high earners. Using an analysis of Clinton\u2019s plan from the Tax Policy Center, the campaign pointed out the top tax rate is currently 39.6 percent. A business owner also could potentially be paying 3.8 percent in Medicare taxes, reaching a rate of 43.4 percent.\nAdd the 4 percent surcharge on top of that and you reach 47.4 percent. That was the \"nearly 50 percent\" part.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcept it\u2019s not as simple as that. Clinton's proposed\u00a04 percent tax increase only applies to taxpayers who have an adjusted gross income of over $5 million, and only income in excess of $5 million would be taxed at that extra 4 percent.\nThat\u2019s not a lot of business owners. Only about 0.5 percent of all small businesses in the nation reported a profit of more than $1 million in 2011, according to the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Tax Analysis. Overall, only a bit more than 34,000 of the 150 million or so tax returns filed in 2013 reported income of more than $5 million. That's an even smaller fraction \u2014 about 0.02 percent of all earners.\nBut Trump made it worse for himself in this new description. The prepared remarks for his speech read, \"She wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent.\" This is important to note, because he then ad-libs and changes the meaning of the sentence by adding \"more than they're paying now.\"\nThat means instead of saying they will be taxed at 50 percent, they will be taxed at a rate almost 50 percent higher than they are currently. That\u2019s a different assertion.\nExperts told us it\u2019s difficult to find anything in Clinton\u2019s plan that telegraphs such a hefty increase.\nLeonard Burman, director at the Tax Policy Center, said the effective tax rate for the highest-earning self-employed people would only go up by about 7 percent. If Trump were referring to corporations, which are affected by the rise in tax rates on capital gains and dividends, the marginal effective tax rate on new corporate investment would still go up by less than 10 percent.\nWilliams further noted that Clinton\u2019s proposed \"Buffett Rule\" requiring people with income greater than $1 million to pay a minimum 30 percent tax rate could theoretically boost a person\u2019s tax by more than 50 percent. But the conditions would have to be specific, so that result probably wouldn\u2019t bump tax rates on business income by 50 percent. Her proposed 28 percent cap on the value of tax preferences \u2014 think credits, deductions, exemptions and so forth \u2014 also doesn\u2019t appear likely to produce such a dramatic change.\n\"There might be an odd case in which that would boost taxes a lot but nothing pops into my brain,\" Williams said. He added that it\u2019s difficult to be certain absolutely no one would face such an increase, but \"it doesn't look like any of (Clinton\u2019s) plans could increase a person's tax bill by half.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said Clinton \"wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they're paying now.\"\nPutting aside the irrelevance of the comment about African-Americans, the campaign never specified exactly how Clinton\u2019s tax plan would do that to anyone. Clinton has proposed some tax increases on higher earners, but barring an extremely unusual case, nothing she has proposed approaches boosting taxes by almost 50 percent.\nWe rate the statement False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/71d28a36-76d4-42ae-affc-0bbea76f84b2", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04413"}
