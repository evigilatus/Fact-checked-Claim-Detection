Marco Rubio said one his GOP rivals isn\u2019t telling the whole truth about his record standing up for American firms against the Chinese.\n\"Ted Cruz was counsel on record for a Chinese company that stole an invention from an American inventor in Florida,\" Rubio said. \"Here you have someone who goes around talking tough about China, but he leaves out the fact that when China stole an American inventor\u2019s product, he stood with the Chinese.\"\n\"That is a fact,\" Rubio said.\nWe decided to check it out.\nThe case\nThe case in question involved a man named Jordan Fishman, the CEO of Alpha Mining Systems, a Florida-based specialty tire company.\nIn 2009, he sued a Chinese tire manufacturer, Shandong Linglong Rubber Co., in U.S. District Court, in Virginia, accusing them of stealing blueprints and violating his copyright. His company was manufacturing tires in China when he said an employee conspired with Shandong Linglong, \"to steal our copyrighted blueprints and make low-quality knock-off tires,\" Fishman wrote in an Op-ed published in the Concord Monitor.\nFishman won the suit and was awarded $26 million in damages in 2010, according to federal court records.\nBut the Chinese company appealed and hired the Washington D.C. law firm Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, where Cruz was a partner. Lawyers argued the court erred in its original verdict because the Copyright Act could not be used to enforce damages against a foreign company when no violation occurred within the United States.\nFederal court records list R. Ted Cruz as one of the lawyers representing the Chinese firm. \u00a0\nThe court rejected the appeal and affirmed the decision in June 2012 to award Fishman $26 million in damages.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElaine Luria\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a campaign finance report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn accepting corporate PAC donations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut collecting the money proved difficult.\nIn October 2012, federal marshals seized Shandong Linglong property in an attempt to enforce the court order, according to industry news reports. \u00a0\nThe claim\nWe reached out to Rubio\u2019s campaign, which provided links to several news articles about the case and Cruz\u2019s involvement.\nThe case gained political attention in 2012, when Cruz was running for U.S. Senate against David Dewhurst. PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim that Cruz represented a Chinese company \"found guilty of stealing blueprints from an American manufacturer.\" That claim was rated Mostly True.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Rubio has made such an accusation during his presidential campaign, and Cruz has defended himself calling it a \"bogus attack.\"\nWe reached out to Cruz\u2019s campaign, which said Cruz\u2019s involvement in the case was minimal.\n\"When Cruz worked for Morgan Lewis, the law firm represented a Chinese tire company, he had nothing to do with the trial,\" said Rick Tyler, Cruz\u2019s Communications Director. \"He helped edit briefs, but did not argue the appeal.\"\nOur ruling\nMarco Rubio said \"Ted Cruz defended a Chinese company that stole an invention from an American inventor.\"\nCruz\u2019s firm represented a Chinese firm found liable for stealing blueprints. While other lawyers argued the appeal, Cruz\u2019s name appears as one of the lawyers representing the Shandong Linglong Rubber Co. against an American company.\nCruz and his firm were not involved with the original case, just the appeal.\nWe rate Rubio\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05446"}
