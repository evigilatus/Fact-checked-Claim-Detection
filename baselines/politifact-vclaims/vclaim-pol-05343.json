(A spokesman for the super PAC cited Trump\u2019s comments at the town hall and at a subsequent debate.)\nMSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough asked Trump whether Israelis or Palestinians were at fault for a lack of an agreement. So far, efforts have failed to work out a lasting comprehensive agreement on issues such as security, land claims, whether Israel can build settlements and recognizing each other\u2019s right to exist.\nTrump refused to pick a side, saying that would hurt his ability to serve as a negotiator.\n\"Let me be sort of a neutral guy .... I don't want to say whose fault is it. I don't think it helps.\"\nAbout two weeks later at the debate in Houston, Wolf Blitzer asked Trump: \"How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America's closest ally in the Middle East?\"\nTrump defended his record by saying that he had been grand marshall of the Israeli Day parade a few years ago and received awards from Israel.\nBut he said when negotiating a deal, it wouldn\u2019t help to pick a good guy and a bad guy:\n\"It doesn't help if I start saying, 'I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage,' \" Trump said, adding that he can\u2019t negotiate as well if he takes sides. \"With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.\"\nTrump\u2019s additional comments about Israel\nIn December, Trump told the Associated Press that he doubted the commitment of Israelis and Palestinians to the peace process. But he suggested the big lift may have to come from Israel.\n\"A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal, whether or not Israel's willing to sacrifice certain things,\" Trump said. \"They may not be, and I understand that, and I'm okay with that. But then you're just not going to have a deal.\"\nTrump evaded specific questions about whether Palestinian demands are legitimate but said that Israeli housing projects were a \"huge sticking point\" in talks.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Harrington\n\n\nstated on November 12, 2011 in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Rep.

I\u2019d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t want one side or the other saying ... I think people know where I stand, okay?\"\nHe said he would want to enter negotiations with a \"clean slate\" and the attitude of \"everybody is even, we love everybody, let\u2019s see if we can do something.\"\nTrump also reminded Jewish Republicans that he endorsed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2013.\n\"I am a big fan of Israel,\" Trump said in the video endorsement. \"And frankly a strong prime minister is a strong Israel.\"\nDuring his own campaign, Trump had planned on meeting with Netanyahu in Israel but canceled the trip after Netanyahu faced\u00a0backlash after Trump\u2019s comments about Muslims.\nWhen asked at the Republican Jewish Coalition if he had relationships with any Arab leaders, Trump said, \"I haven\u2019t been working too much with the Arab leaders.\"\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric is notable on Israel because it is \"cooler and more detached\" than his GOP rivals, wrote Aaron David Miller, a former adviser to Republican and Democratic secretaries of state on Arab-Israeli negotiations who now works for the Woodrow Wilson Center.\nBut while Trump has said he can be a better negotiator if he appears neutral, he has made several comments that suggest he has closer ties to Israelis than Palestinians.\nTrump\u2019s spokespersons did not respond for this fact-check.\nOur ruling\nA PAC that supports Rubio says Trump \"says he would be neutral between Israel and its enemies.\"\nTrump has said that in order to negotiate between Israelis and Palestinians he can\u2019t take sides.\n\"Let me be sort of a neutral guy,\" he said at a town hall.\nBut the ad omits that Trump has had ties to Israel for years -- he has called himself \"pro-Israel\" and endorsed Netanyahu\u2019s re-election in 2013.
