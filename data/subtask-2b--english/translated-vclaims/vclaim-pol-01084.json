All over the country, especially in California, voter fraud is rampant. It has to stop. A strong identity for voters Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 27 January 2019 Trump often alleged a massive fraud of voters, including by non-citizens, without any evidence. In this case, Trump misunderstands the information from the Foreign Minister of Texas. The state list is not the last word about how many people voted illegally. It is now up to provincial officials to gather more information about these voters and determine their status as citizens. In some cases, for example, a person may obtain a driver &apos; s licence before acquiring his or her nationality. The ventilation process that has just begun throughout Texas has begun in other states, which has carried out similar clearances to the voters list based on driver's license data, as Jostin Levitt, a professor at the Law School of Loyola and an expert in voter registration. \"The percentages are endless from the original headlines of the eye scan,\" said Livette. For almost a year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Texas and the Ministry of Public Safety of Texas have been trying to identify non-citizens' voters. This started a long time before Jove. Greg Abbott David Whitley was appointed Secretary of State in December). They say that any fraud undermines the integrity of the election while voting rights defenders say it is an attempt to suppress voter participation. The voting in elections where a person knows that he or she is not eligible to vote is a second-degree felony in Texas. State officials examined two sets of data for their current investigations: the names of persons who submitted documents indicating that they were not citizens when they obtained a State driver &apos; s licence or identity card, and the names of persons who registered to vote. This resulted in a list of 95,000 persons with a current driver &apos; s licence or official identity card who also had the registration register of voters in Texas. Of these, 58,000 voted in the elections held since 1996, and Sam Taylor, the spokesman for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said. However, the same advice that is the source of those figures urged caution in interpreting them, using all the large letters to describe similar records such as \"WEAK is identical.\" The Declaration did not mention that 58,000 non-citizens had certainly voted. Despite the warning, the figures inspired some overreactions, including from the Texas Attorney-General Ken Paxton, the Republican, who tweeted \"Voice Warning Fraud.\" Provincial officials cannot cancel voter registration on the basis of information provided so far. The opinion states that if the registrars have reason to believe that the voters are not eligible, they must send a letter to the electorate requesting proof of their nationality within 30 days. After this point, election officials can cancel the registration of the person. The problems of voting rights defenders in the statements raised a major concern about the data: the driver's permit data may not reflect the current status of citizenship. \"In fact, between 52,000 and 63,000 are naturalized every year in Texas,\" said the spokesman for the Texas Civil Rights Project Zeynen James P\u00e9rez PolityFact. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" \u2022 On January 19, 2012, we asked the Office of the Foreign Minister whether some people in the 58,000 or 95,000 communities could be citizens. Taylor replied: \"This is up to the voters of the province and/or the prosecutor's office to determine it.\" On January 28, district election officials throughout Texas began the process of checking information from the state. To date, it is too early to determine whether those on the list are actual non-citizens, as stated by Chris Davis, President of the Texas Association of Electoral Directors and Director of Williamson County. Bruce Elvant, voter registrar in Travis County and one of the Democrats, said that he had concerns about whether the data reflected current information on nationality. \"We really know very little at this stage,\" said Politi Fuckett. \"These who commit adultery of voters, I would like to say that it is premature and irresponsible. \"This is gonna be long and complicated.\" Douglas Ray, a special assistant to the District Attorney in Harris County, told the Houston Chronicle that he was skeptical of the use of the records of the Department of Public Safety, which he described as \"generally\" outdated for the nationality status of drivers. Ray said the county would compare the list of names from the state to the list of people who went through the naturalization ceremony. In addition to old information on nationality, there may be a lack of conformity between persons with similar names. Myrna Perez, who works on voting rights at the Brennan Center of Justice, said that she had once rejected the absentee ballot by the state of Texas because her mother, who had the same name, had already voted. She said, \"It may seem like it once, but actually not when we talk about databases this big.\" While the final outcome in Texas may be months away, we know that the confirmed cases of non-citizens' votes in the United States elections are rare. A national database of criminal convictions for electoral fraud by the Conservative Heritage Foundation shows four persons convicted of non-citizens &apos; votes in Texas. In November, a Texas Court of Appeal upheld the conviction of Rosa Maria Ortega, a green card holder, who was sentenced to eight years &apos; imprisonment after having voted several times. On January 15, Paxton announced that a non-citizen was charged with illegal voting. A 2017 report by the Brennan Center for Justice of the University of New York concluded that election officials in 42 jurisdictions had referred an estimated 30 suspected non-citizens (out of more than 23 million votes) voting incidents for further investigation or prosecution. In August 2018, federal prosecutors in North Carolina announced charges concerning 19 foreign nationals believed to have voted in the 2016 general election. So far, 10 people have pleaded guilty to voting, and one has admitted his guilt in helping a non-citizen and inciting him to claim his nationality falsely for voting, as a spokesman for the Attorney General of the Eastern District of North Carolina has said. Florida participated in a controversial attempt to search for non-citizens based on the driver &apos; s license that led to the 2012 elections. The search was full of mistakes, with the name of an ancient warrior born of World War II in Brooklyn as a non-citizen voter. The state initially identified 182,000 people but ended the clearance after only 85 names had been removed. Before we pass our verdict, a quick word about Trump's invitation to \"a strong voter ID.\" Texas already has one of the most stringent voter identification laws in the country. The original Act of 2011 requires voters to show an identity issued by the Government, such as a driver &apos; s licence or passport. After a court found that the law had a discriminatory effect, the state passed a new law allowing voters to present other forms of identity cards, and survived a federal appeal test in 2018. Our rule, Trump, said, \"58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote.\" Trump ignores that even the Foreign Minister of Texas has expressed caution in these numbers, calling the game in the logs \"WEAK\" and setting up a process that will make it possible for him to be able to make a decision. At this stage, we do not know how many people on the list who have been screened over 22 years of data will prove to be non-citizens who voted - and some may have acquired their citizenship after obtaining a driver &apos; s licence and have voted legally. Because he inaccurately described the first stage of what Texas actually reported, we're assessing this claim in vain. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9acd56f4-f5ac-4029-84c0-dcadf766c88b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01084"}
