Both were historic elections, but they were accompanied by lies about Islam. We've checked some of them. The social media falsely claimed, for example, that former President Barack Obama had settled 43,000 Somali refugees in Minnesota to help elect Omar. Other articles falsely claimed that Omar said, \"I think all white men should be shackled as slaves because they will never surrender to Islam.\" Now an article in Facebook on May 8 with a false allegation about Minneapolis, represented by Omar, is growing stronger. \"The city of Minneapolis has set up a Shari'a hotline for residents to report citizens critical of Islam, in order to try them for \"hate crimes,\" reading the text over the image of a woman wearing a veil. \"America wake up!\" This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here are the facts: in June 2017, Minneapolis opened a new hotline for reporting hate crimes. According to the City, the crime of hatred \"is any crime committed against a person or property motivated by prejudice against a person's race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, race, sex or gender identity. This includes damage to property motivated by bias (including graffiti), stalking and assault.\" Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. At that time, Velma Corbell, director of the city's civil rights department, said \"hate speech\" with no place in Minneapolis. This raises doubts about freedom of expression. But Corbell later said that the hotline \"is not a tool to limit anyone's freedom of expression, nor is it designed to force anyone to worship or not worship in the way he chooses.\" The city is not the first to start such a hotline (see New York City and Seattle, among others), but, as the Star Tribune reported in July 2017, it became \"a focus of criticism in the area of codification, where it was called a political movement designed to suppress speech following the election of President Donald Trump.\" One of the sites, called \"a hotline for whistleblowers by hate speech,\" included a comment by the former Republic of Minnesota, Michel Bachman, who said that the hotline was a means of imposing \"the anti-debauchery laws of Islam on non-Muslims.\" We checked it out, and we evaluated it on fire. This post on Facebook is also the smell of smoke. While Minneapolis announced the Hate Crimes Hotline at a time when attacks against Muslims in the United States were on the increase, the New City service was not designed to address crimes against Muslims and did not mention Islamic law. It is aimed at reporting crimes motivated by prejudice against race, religion, disability, sexual or ethnic orientation, gender or gender identity. We're assessing this pants mail on fire.
