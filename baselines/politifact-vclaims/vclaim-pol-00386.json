(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nPirro and Goldberg definitely had an argument, but there\u2019s no evidence that Goldberg ever used a racist slur against Pirro. Here\u2019s what\u2019s true \u2014 and what\u2019s not.\nThe revival of \"Roseanne\" was canceled in May 2018 hours after Barr, the show\u2019s star, tweeted this about Jarrett: \"muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.\"\n\"The tweet sparked a public firestorm, including from \u2018Roseanne\u2019 star Sara Gilbert,\" ABC News then reported. \"It also prompted Wanda Sykes, a consulting producer, to quit the show in the leadup to the cancellation.\"\u00a0\nChanning Dungey, the president of ABC Entertainment, is quoted in the story as saying the tweet was \"abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent\" with ABC values.\nA couple months later, in July 2018, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro appeared on the ABC show \"The View.\" Goldberg, a co-host on the show, got into a yelling match with Pirro after Pirro \"appeared to suggest Goldberg suffered from \u2018Trump Derangement Syndrome,\u2019\" the Washington Post reported.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings escalated from there.\u00a0\n\"Whoopi, you know what\u2019s horrible?\" Pirro said. \"When people who shouldn\u2019t be here end up murdering the children of American citizens.\"\u00a0\n\"You know what\u2019s horrible?\" Goldberg said. \"When the president of the United States whips up people to beat the hell out of people. Say goodbye! I\u2019m done.\"\u00a0\nYou can watch the exchange here.\nThe show went to commercial and when it came back Goldberg apologized. Pirro was no longer there, but Pirro told fellow Fox News host Sean Hannity that the fight continued backstage, where she said Goldberg used the F-word at her and spit at her. Goldberg confirmed she used the F-word but denied spitting, and she said that Pirro \"called everybody at the table a name I cannot repeat on TV.\"\nLauri Hogan, a spokeswoman for ABC, told PolitiFact that Goldberg did not say the slur the Facebook post claims.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe couldn\u2019t find any credible corroborating evidence online that Goldberg said it, nor did we find such an article in the Nexis news database.\u00a0\nWe found no evidence that Goldberg called Pirro a racist insult.
