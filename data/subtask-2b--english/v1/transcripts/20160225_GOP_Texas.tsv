0037	BLITZER	Welcome back to the University of Houston and the Republican presidential debate.
0038	BLITZER	The candidates, they are now in place.
0039	BLITZER	Their positions were selected based on their standing in the delegate race through Nevada, with the top candidate in the center and the others extending outward.
0040	BLITZER	I want to tell you how tonight's debate will work.
0041	BLITZER	As moderator, I will guide the discussion, asking questions and followups, as will Maria Celeste, Dana Bash and Hugh Hewitt.
0042	BLITZER	Candidates, you'll have a minute and 15 seconds to answer and 30 seconds for followups and rebuttals.
0043	BLITZER	We have timing lights that are visible to the candidates.
0044	BLITZER	Those lights will warn you when your time is up, and as the candidates requested, a bell will sound like this.

0048	BLITZER	It's time for the candidates to introduce themselves right now.
0049	BLITZER	You'll each have 30 seconds.
0050	BLITZER	Dr. Carson, you're first.
0051	CARSON	If someone had tried to describe today's America to you 30 years ago, you would have listened in disbelief.
0052	CARSON	Americans know that our nation is heading off the abyss of destruction, secondary to divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility, and failure to lead.
0053	CARSON	Marco, Donald, Ted, John, we will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other.
0054	CARSON	What we need to do is be looking for solutions tonight.
0055	CARSON	It's not about us, it's about the American people.
0056	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0057	BLITZER	Governor Kasich?
0058	KASICH	Well, you know, on the way over here, even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage, you know, my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mother's mother was an immigrant, could barely speak English.
0059	KASICH	And I'm standing on this stage.
0060	KASICH	It's pretty remarkable.
0061	KASICH	But I want to tell you, there's a lot of young people watching tonight.
0062	KASICH	You can do whatever you want to do in your life.
0063	KASICH	America is an amazing country, where a kid like me can grow up to run for president of the United States and be on this stage tonight.
0064	KASICH	So to all the young people that are out there, your hopes, your dreams, pursue them.
0065	KASICH	Shoot for the stars.
0066	KASICH	America's great, and you can do it.
0067	KASICH	Thank you, Wolf.
0068	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0069	BLITZER	Senator Rubio?
0070	RUBIO	Well, thank you.
0071	RUBIO	This election, we have to decide the identity of America in the 2ist century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement.
0072	RUBIO	Thirtysix years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W.
0073	RUBIO	Bush began the Reagan Revolution.
0074	RUBIO	For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense.
0075	RUBIO	But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams.
0076	RUBIO	Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if we're simply going to become a party that preys on people's angers and fears.
0077	RUBIO	I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it's been in its story history.

0079	BLITZER	Senator Cruz?
0080	CRUZ	Welcome to Texas.
0081	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0082	CRUZ	Here, Texas provided my family with hope.
0083	CRUZ	Here, my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college.
0084	CRUZ	Here, my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas.
0085	CRUZ	I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here.
0086	CRUZ	When I ran for Senate, I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day, and not for the Washington bosses.
0087	CRUZ	And, I'll tell you, as I travel the state, Democrats tell me I didn't vote for you, but you're doing what you said you would do.
0088	CRUZ	And, as president, I will do the same.
0089	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0090	BLITZER	Mr. Trump.
0091	TRUMP	Thank you.
0092	TRUMP	My whole theme is make America great again.
0093	TRUMP	We don't win anymore as a country.
0094	TRUMP	We don't win with trade, we don't win with the military.
0095	TRUMP	ISIS, we can't even knock out ISIS, and we will, believe me.
0096	TRUMP	We will.
0097	TRUMP	We don't win in any capacity with healthcare.
0098	TRUMP	We have terrible health care, Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced.
0099	TRUMP	We just don't win.
0100	TRUMP	You look at our borders, they're like swiss cheese, everybody pours in.
0101	TRUMP	We're going to make a great country again.
0102	TRUMP	We're going to start winning again.
0103	TRUMP	We're going to win a lot, it's going to be a big difference, believe me.
0104	TRUMP	It's going to be a big difference.
0105	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0106	BLITZER	Thank you very much.
0107	BLITZER	It's now time to begin questions.
0108	BLITZER	Voters in the first four states have spoken, and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner, but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet, Super Tuesday.
0109	BLITZER	When nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded, and the biggest prize of the night is Texas.
0110	BLITZER	Immigration is a key issue in this state, for all voters nationwide, including the many people watching us on Telemundo.
0111	BLITZER	So, that's where we begin.
0112	BLITZER	Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States.
0113	BLITZER	You've also promised to let what you call, "the good ones", come back in.
0114	BLITZER	Your words, "the good ones", after they've been deported.
0115	BLITZER	Senator Cruz would not allow them to come back in.
0116	BLITZER	He says that's the biggest difference between the two of you.
0117	BLITZER	He calls your plan amnesty.
0118	BLITZER	Is it?
0119	TRUMP	First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they've been debating this every debate that we've had.
0120	TRUMP	As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration.
0121	TRUMP	It wouldn't even be a big subject.
0122	TRUMP	But, we either have a country, or we don't have a country.
0123	TRUMP	We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally.
0124	TRUMP	They will go out.
0125	TRUMP	They will come back  some will come back, the best, through a process.
0126	TRUMP	They have to come back legally.
0127	TRUMP	They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine.
0128	TRUMP	They're going to get in line with other people.
0129	TRUMP	The best of them will come back, but they're going to come back through a process.
0130	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0131	BLITZER	Senator Cruz, what's wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls, "the good ones" come back to the United States?
0132	CRUZ	You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country  our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs.
0133	CRUZ	Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.
0134	CRUZ	You know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona.
0135	CRUZ	Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and what's happened there  it was a very interesting article.
0136	CRUZ	Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing.
0137	CRUZ	But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars.
0138	CRUZ	And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise.
0139	CRUZ	That's who we need to be fighting for.
0140	CRUZ	Listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and that's why I've led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and that's why I will do the same thing as president.
0141	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0142	BLITZER	Mr. Trump, do you want to respond to that?
0143	TRUMP	Well, I'm very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you.
0144	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0145	BLITZER	Senator Rubio?
0146	RUBIO	Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obama's.
0147	RUBIO	He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.
0148	RUBIO	Are those claims correct?
0149	RUBIO	Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I've been abundantly clear on this.
0150	RUBIO	When I'm president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border.
0151	RUBIO	And, that's not just the physical border with Mexico, it's Visa overstays.
0152	RUBIO	That's 45 percent of the problem right there.
0153	RUBIO	It also has to do  that's why we need everify, and entryexit tracking system, and soforth.
0154	RUBIO	And, until that happens, we're not doing anything else.
0155	RUBIO	And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support.
0156	RUBIO	And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate.
0157	RUBIO	Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that he's now taking are new to him.
0158	RUBIO	In 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship.
0159	RUBIO	In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of selfdeportation.
0160	RUBIO	And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, you've hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.
0161	RUBIO	My mom and dad  my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.
0162	RUBIO	So I think this is an important issue.
0163	RUBIO	And I think we are realizing increasingly that it's an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.
0164	BLITZER	Mr. Trump?
0165	TRUMP	Well, first of all, selfdeportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out.
0166	TRUMP	If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.
0167	TRUMP	Selfdeportation, as I really define it, and that's the way I define it, is you're going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.
0168	TRUMP	As far as the people that I've hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help.
0169	TRUMP	It's the up season.
0170	TRUMP	People didn't want to have parttime jobs.
0171	TRUMP	There were parttime jobs, very seasonal, 90day jobs, 120day jobs, and you couldn't get.
0172	TRUMP	Everybody agrees with me on that.
0173	TRUMP	They were parttime jobs.
0174	TRUMP	You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.
0175	RUBIO	That  my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for selfdeportation.
0176	RUBIO	You said that his strategy of self deportation is why he lost the election.
0177	RUBIO	And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.
0178	TRUMP	I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election.
0179	TRUMP	He should have won that election.
0180	TRUMP	He had a failed president.
0181	TRUMP	He ran a terrible campaign.
0182	TRUMP	He was a terrible candidate.
0183	TRUMP	That's what I criticize Mitt Romney  I mean, ran...
0184	RUBIO	No, he...
0185	TRUMP	Excuse me.
0186	TRUMP	He ran one terrible campaign.
0187	TRUMP	That's an election that should have been won.
0188	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0189	RUBIO	Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term "selfdeportation."
0190	RUBIO	I mean, that's on the record and people can look it up right now online.
0191	RUBIO	But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think it's really important, this point.
0192	RUBIO	I think it's fine, it's an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration.
0193	RUBIO	This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.
0194	RUBIO	But I also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you're only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.
0195	RUBIO	You hired some workers from Poland...
0196	TRUMP	No, no, I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people.
0197	TRUMP	You haven't hired anybody.
0198	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0199	RUBIO	In fact, some of the people...
0200	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0201	TRUMP	And by the way, I've hired  and by the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job.
0202	TRUMP	You've hired nobody.
0203	RUBIO	Yes, you've hired a thousand from another country...
0204	TRUMP	You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera.
0205	TRUMP	So don't tell me about that.
0206	RUBIO	Let me just say  let me finish the statement.
0207	RUBIO	This is important.
0208	TRUMP	You haven't hired one person, you liar.
0209	RUBIO	He hired workers from Poland.
0210	RUBIO	And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from...
0211	TRUMP	That's wrong.
0212	TRUMP	That's wrong.
0213	TRUMP	Totally wrong.
0214	RUBIO	That's a fact.
0215	RUBIO	People can look it up.
0216	RUBIO	I'm sure people are Googling it right now.
0217	RUBIO	Look it up.
0218	RUBIO	Trump Polish workers, you'll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects.
0219	RUBIO	He did it.
0220	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0221	RUBIO	That happened.
0222	TRUMP	I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
0223	TRUMP	Tens of thousands...
0224	RUBIO	Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.
0225	TRUMP	Be quiet.
0226	TRUMP	Just be quiet.
0227	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0228	TRUMP	Let me talk.
0229	TRUMP	I've hired tens of thousands of people.
0230	TRUMP	He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well.
0231	TRUMP	Everybody was happy.
0232	RUBIO	You paid a million dollars.
0233	TRUMP	And by the way, the laws were totally different.
0234	TRUMP	That was a whole different world.
0235	BLITZER	Thank you.
0236	TRUMP	But I've hired people.
0237	TRUMP	Nobody up here has hired anybody.
0238	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0239	BLITZER	Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States.
0240	BLITZER	What would happen to the children who are U.S. born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?
0241	CRUZ	Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally.
0242	CRUZ	U.S. citizens can come back.
0243	CRUZ	That's existing law.
0244	CRUZ	But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration.
0245	CRUZ	I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall.
0246	CRUZ	And in 2013, when I was fight against the "gang of eight" amnesty bill, where was Donald?
0247	CRUZ	He was firing Dennis Rodman on "Celebrity Apprentice."
0248	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0249	CRUZ	And indeed, if you look at the "gang of eight," one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill.
0250	CRUZ	If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans.
0251	CRUZ	And when you're funding open border politicians, you shouldn't be surprised when they fight for open borders.
0252	CRUZ	And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty.
0253	CRUZ	And I'm the only one on this stage that has that record.
0254	CRUZ	And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him.
0255	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0256	BLITZER	Mr. Trump?
0257	TRUMP	I can only say this, and I've said it loud and clear and I've said it for years.
0258	TRUMP	And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now  your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they're packed with you.
0259	TRUMP	I've had an amazing relationship with politicians  with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman.
0260	TRUMP	As one magazine said, he's a worldclass businessman he was friendly with everybody.
0261	TRUMP	I got along with everybody.
0262	TRUMP	You get along with nobody.
0263	TRUMP	You don't have one Republican  you don't have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time.
0264	TRUMP	These are minor details.
0265	TRUMP	But you don't have one Republican senator backing you not one.
0266	TRUMP	You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people.
0267	TRUMP	You should be ashamed of yourself.
0268	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0269	BLITZER	Senator Cruz?
0270	CRUZ	You know, I actually think Donald is right.
0271	CRUZ	He is promising if he's elected he will go and cut deals in Washington.
0272	CRUZ	And he's right.
0273	CRUZ	He has supported  he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats.
0274	CRUZ	Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be hiring illegal immigrants.
0275	CRUZ	Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi wouldn't be funding the Gang of Eight.
0276	CRUZ	And, you know, he is right.
0277	CRUZ	When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, let's actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesn't like it.
0278	CRUZ	And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that's not a good attribute for a president.
0279	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0280	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0281	TRUMP	Here's a man  Robin Hood.
0282	TRUMP	This is Robin Hood over here.
0283	TRUMP	He talks about corruption.
0284	TRUMP	On his financial disclosure form, he didn't even put that he's borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation.
0285	TRUMP	He didn't talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest.
0286	TRUMP	He just left it off, and now he's going to protect the people from the big bad banks.
0287	TRUMP	Give me a break.
0288	BLITZER	All right.
0289	BLITZER	We're going to move on to Governor Kasich.
0290	BLITZER	Governor Kasich...
0291	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0292	CRUZ	Wolf, can I respond to that attack?
0293	BLITZER	You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in.
0294	BLITZER	He's been waiting patiently.
0295	BLITZER	Governor Kasich, the idea  you've said this, and I want to quote you now "The idea that we're going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it."
0296	BLITZER	Those are your words.
0297	BLITZER	Should people be allowed to break the law just because it's not feasible to stop them?
0298	KASICH	Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States.
0299	KASICH	He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem  a path to legalization.
0300	KASICH	You see, that was a time when things worked.
0301	KASICH	It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.
0302	KASICH	Look, I think there is an answer here.
0303	KASICH	The answer is you complete the border.
0304	KASICH	You let people know that once it's done, you don't have a right to come in.
0305	KASICH	If you come in, we don't want any excuse.
0306	KASICH	You're going to go back.
0307	KASICH	But I favor a guest worker program.
0308	KASICH	I think it's practical.
0309	KASICH	And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans  the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, I'd make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service.
0310	KASICH	And at the end, I'd give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship.
0311	KASICH	I don't think we're going to tear families apart.
0312	KASICH	I don't think we're going to ride around in people's neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes.
0313	KASICH	I don't think  first of all, I don't think it's practical and I don't think it reflects America.
0314	KASICH	You know what happened?
0315	KASICH	The problem with President Reagan is we didn't get in there and actually finish the border.
0316	KASICH	And I think it was probably business interests that affected it.
0317	KASICH	But at the end of the day, let's be practical.
0318	KASICH	Let's start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs.
0319	KASICH	With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again.
0320	KASICH	And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.
0321	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0322	BLITZER	Thank you, Governor.
0323	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0324	BLITZER	Dr. Carson, you've been critical of mass deportation.
0325	BLITZER	You said back in November you don't think Mr. Trump's plan necessarily represents the Republican Party.
0326	BLITZER	Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?
0327	CARSON	I believe in liberty and justice for all.
0328	CARSON	I think everything that we do should be fair.
0329	CARSON	And I've already described  you know, how we can secure the border.
0330	CARSON	We need to secure all the borders, because it's not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily.
0331	CARSON	And we have to stop that.
0332	CARSON	But in terms of the people who are here already, after we  after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable.
0333	CARSON	And I would give them a sixmonth period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record.
0334	CARSON	They have to pay a backtax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they don't have to live underground anymore.
0335	CARSON	And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.
0336	CARSON	If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through.
0337	CARSON	I think that's the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.
0338	CARSON	And we have other ways of  of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they don't feel the need to come over here.
0339	CARSON	That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.
0340	BLITZER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.
0341	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0342	BLITZER	Mr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border.
0343	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0344	TRUMP	.
0345	BLITZER	It's about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now.
0346	BLITZER	You've said the Mexican government will pay for it.
0347	TRUMP	Correct.
0348	BLITZER	The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen.
0349	BLITZER	The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen.
0350	BLITZER	In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox  he said today, and I'm quoting him  he said, "I'm not going to pay for that," quote, "effing wall."
0351	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0352	BLITZER	So if you don't get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?
0353	TRUMP	I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.
0354	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0355	TRUMP	It just got 10 feet taller.
0356	TRUMP	I saw him make that  I saw him make the statement.
0357	TRUMP	I saw him use the word that he used.
0358	TRUMP	I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.
0359	TRUMP	This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK?
0360	TRUMP	Number one.
0361	TRUMP	Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year.
0362	TRUMP	And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.
0363	TRUMP	We're going to make them pay for that wall.
0364	TRUMP	Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it.
0365	TRUMP	If these guys do it, it'll end up costing $200 billion.
0366	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0367	TRUMP	But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion.
0368	TRUMP	You need 1,000  you need 1,000 miles.
0369	TRUMP	The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago  2,000, is 13,000 miles.
0370	TRUMP	We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.
0371	TRUMP	We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it's a real wall.
0372	TRUMP	This is a wall that's a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you're looking at.
0373	TRUMP	This is a wall that's going to work.
0374	TRUMP	Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors.
0375	TRUMP	They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...
0376	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0377	TRUMP	... immediately.
0378	TRUMP	Mexico will pay for the wall.
0379	TRUMP	It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.
0380	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0381	BLITZER	If the  if the Mexicans don't pay for the wall, will you start a trade war with Mexico?
0382	TRUMP	Well, you know, I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth.
0383	TRUMP	We're losing so much.
0384	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0385	TRUMP	We're losing so much with Mexico and China  with China, we're losing $500 billion a year.
0386	TRUMP	And then people say, "don't we want to trade?"
0387	TRUMP	I don't mind trading, but I don't want to lose $500 billion.
0388	TRUMP	I don't want to lose $58 billion.
0389	TRUMP	Mexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners.
0390	TRUMP	They just took Ford.
0391	TRUMP	They're building a $2.5 billion plant.
0392	TRUMP	They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.
0393	TRUMP	And I always say I'm not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way.
0394	TRUMP	But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico.
0395	TRUMP	They're taking our businesses.
0396	TRUMP	I don't mind.
0397	BLITZER	Thank you.
0398	BLITZER	Senator Rubio?
0399	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0400	RUBIO	Yeah, a couple points.
0401	RUBIO	If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it.
0402	RUBIO	The second...
0403	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0404	TRUMP	Such a cute sound bite.
0405	RUBIO	But it  no, it's not a sound bite.
0406	RUBIO	It's a fact.
0407	RUBIO	Again, go online and Google it.
0408	RUBIO	Donald Trump, Polish workers.
0409	RUBIO	You'll see it.
0410	RUBIO	The second thing, about the trade war  I don't understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China.
0411	RUBIO	So you're gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.
0412	TRUMP	All right, you know what?
0413	RUBIO	Why don't you make them in America?
0414	TRUMP	Because they devalue their currency  they devalue their currencies...
0415	RUBIO	Well, then make them in America.
0416	TRUMP	... that makes it  well, you don't know a thing about business.
0417	TRUMP	You lose on everything...
0418	RUBIO	Well, make them in America.
0419	TRUMP	Let me just tell you  they devalue their currency.
0420	TRUMP	They devalue their currencies.
0421	RUBIO	Well then, make them in America.
0422	TRUMP	That makes it  well, you don't know a thing about business.
0423	TRUMP	You lose on everything you do.
0424	RUBIO	Well, make them in America.
0425	TRUMP	Let me just tell you, they devalue their currencies.
0426	TRUMP	China, Mexico, everybody.
0427	TRUMP	Japan with the cars.
0428	TRUMP	They devalue their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs...
0429	RUBIO	And so you make them in China and in Russia.
0430	TRUMP	But you wouldn't know anything about it because you're a lousy businessman.
0431	RUBIO	Well, I don't know anything about bankrupting four companies.
0432	RUBIO	You've bankrupted..
0433	TRUMP	No, I  and you know why?
0434	TRUMP	You know why?
0435	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0436	RUBIO	I don't know anything about...
0437	TRUMP	You know why?
0438	RUBIO	... starting a university, and that was a fake university.
0439	BLITZER	One at a time.
0440	TRUMP	First of all...
0441	BLITZER	One at a time.
0442	TRUMP	... first of all, that's called a...
0443	RUBIO	There are people who borrowed $36,000...
0444	BLITZER	Hold on.
0445	BLITZER	One at a time, Mr. Trump.
0446	RUBIO	... to go to Trump University, and they're suing now  $36,000 to go to a university...
0447	TRUMP	And by the way  and by the way...
0448	RUBIO	... that's a fake school.
0449	TRUMP	... and by the way...
0450	RUBIO	And you know what they got?
0451	RUBIO	They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump...
0452	TRUMP	...
0453	TRUMP	I've won most of the lawsuits.
0454	RUBIO	That's what they got for $36,000.
0455	BLITZER	All right, I want to move on.
0456	TRUMP	And they actually did a very good job, but I've won most of the lawsuits.
0457	BLITZER	Mr. Trump, Senator, I want to bring in...
0458	RUBIO	Most of the lawsuits.
0459	BLITZER	...
0460	BLITZER	I want to bring in my colleague Maria Celeste.
0461	TRUMP	Excuse me.
0462	TRUMP	Hey Wolf, let me ask you.
0463	TRUMP	Am I allowed to respond to this?
0464	BLITZER	You're allowed  you've been responding.
0465	TRUMP	OK. Well let  no, I haven't.
0466	TRUMP	I really haven't.
0467	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0468	RUBIO	He's talked through the whole thing.
0469	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0470	TRUMP	Here's a guy  here's a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed.
0471	TRUMP	You tell me about this guy.
0472	TRUMP	This is what we're going to have as president.
0473	RUBIO	Here's a guy that inherited $200 million.
0474	RUBIO	If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now?
0475	TRUMP	No, no, no.
0476	RUBIO	Selling watches in Manhattan.
0477	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0478	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0479	TRUMP	I took...
0480	RUBIO	That's where he would be.
0481	TRUMP	That is so wrong.
0482	TRUMP	We'll work on that.
0483	TRUMP	I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.
0484	RUBIO	Oh, OK. One million.
0485	TRUMP	I borrowed $1 million...
0486	RUBIO	Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.
0487	TRUMP	I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion...
0488	RUBIO	Oh, he doesn't make that money.
0489	TRUMP	... more than $10 billion.
0490	BLITZER	Thank you.
0491	BLITZER	Thank you.
0492	BLITZER	I want to bring in Maria Celeste Arrars of Telemundo.
0493	BLITZER	Maria?
0494	ARRARÁS	Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obama's executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.
0495	RUBIO	Correct.
0496	ARRARÁS	It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants.
0497	ARRARÁS	This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and I'm going to quote you
0498	SYSTEM	[ in Spanish ]
0499	ARRARÁS	which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldn't be fair to cancel it immediately.
0500	ARRARÁS	So Senator Rubio, what changed?
0501	RUBIO	It didn't change.
0502	ARRARÁS	Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?
0503	RUBIO	No, it's the same policy.
0504	RUBIO	It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will  we will eliminate that executive order.
0505	RUBIO	The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it.
0506	RUBIO	And it's not because we're not compassionate to the plight of a 2  someone who came here when they were 2 years old.
0507	RUBIO	I understand.
0508	RUBIO	I know people that are personally impacted by this.
0509	RUBIO	The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional.
0510	RUBIO	The president doesn't have the power to do that.
0511	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0512	RUBIO	And he himself admitted that.
0513	ARRARÁS	Senator, Senator...
0514	RUBIO	I'm sorry, but let me finish my...
0515	ARRARÁS	... but you went  you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One.
0516	RUBIO	No, but this is not about deportation.
0517	RUBIO	Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation.
0518	RUBIO	This is about DACA.
0519	RUBIO	DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional.
0520	RUBIO	I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them.
0521	RUBIO	Now, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you can't solve it doing something that is unconstitutional.
0522	RUBIO	No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis.
0523	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0524	ARRARÁS	Senator Rubio, you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English.
0525	ARRARÁS	So in what sense did he lie?
0526	RUBIO	Because it is not true that I'm not going to get rid of DACA.
0527	RUBIO	I am going to get rid of DACA.
0528	RUBIO	In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point.
0529	RUBIO	That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it.
0530	RUBIO	And new people will not be able to apply.
0531	RUBIO	In fact, I don't even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.
0532	RUBIO	That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away.
0533	RUBIO	But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take  as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.
0534	TRUMP	I have to say, he lied this time.
0535	TRUMP	He lied.
0536	TRUMP	100 percent.
0537	TRUMP	100 percent.
0538	RUBIO	You lied about the Polish workers.
0539	TRUMP	Yes, yes, yes.
0540	TRUMP	38 years ago.
0541	RUBIO	You lied to the students at Trump University.
0542	ARRARÁS	Let Senator Cruz jump in.
0543	RUBIO	Oh, he lied 38 years ago.
0544	RUBIO	All right, I guess there's a statute of limitation on lies.
0545	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
0546	CRUZ	Well Maria, I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate, and you're right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that.
0547	CRUZ	You know, we've both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program.
0548	CRUZ	Well, it'll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future.
0549	CRUZ	That, inevitably, is when a politician doesn't plan to end it at all.
0550	CRUZ	You know, I'm reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies.
0551	CRUZ	When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.
0552	CRUZ	Marco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty.
0553	CRUZ	Well, someday it should end, just not now.
0554	CRUZ	And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem.
0555	RUBIO	That's not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol.
0556	RUBIO	What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now.
0557	RUBIO	By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away.
0558	RUBIO	I don't agree with the mandate and the program that's in place, but I think it's unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we're just going to yank it away from them.
0559	RUBIO	And, again, you read the statement in Spanish.
0560	RUBIO	I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is  at that time I was not a candidate for president.
0561	RUBIO	I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it.
0562	RUBIO	New applicants will not be able to apply.
0563	RUBIO	That is the end of DACA.
0564	RUBIO	I am sympathetic to this cause, but once again, it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates.
0565	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0566	ARRARÁS	Senator Cruz, you and Senator Rubio are the two candidates of hispanic descent on this stage.
0567	ARRARÁS	As a matter of fact, you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary.
0568	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0569	ARRARÁS	And yet, there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan, the best platform to help them, that you two are spending the time arguing with each other.
0570	ARRARÁS	Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.
0571	ARRARÁS	So, my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?
0572	CRUZ	Well, Maria, you are right.
0573	CRUZ	It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants.
0574	CRUZ	It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.
0575	CRUZ	You know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you're liberal.
0576	CRUZ	That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.
0577	CRUZ	At the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide.
0578	CRUZ	And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community.
0579	CRUZ	The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism.
0580	CRUZ	You know, we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country.
0581	CRUZ	And, when I campaigned, and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo Christian principals, telling my father's story.
0582	CRUZ	Telling my Dad's story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking English, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the American dream.
0583	CRUZ	And, the truth is the ObamaClinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community.
0584	CRUZ	It is not working in the hispanic community, and I...
0585	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0586	CRUZ	...fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.
0587	RUBIO	I'm sorry I was mentioned...
0588	ARRARÁS	...
0589	ARRARÁS	Governor Kasich.
0590	RUBIO	Maria I was mentioned in that.
0591	RUBIO	I was mentioned in that statement.
0592	ARRARÁS	Governor Kasich, after the...
0593	RUBIO	... OK.
0594	RUBIO	I was mentioned  just because of the hispanic  and I'll be brief.
0595	RUBIO	A couple points, number one, I do think it's amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American.
0596	RUBIO	We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party.
0597	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0598	RUBIO	And, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.
0599	RUBIO	Yes, it's an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it.
0600	RUBIO	But, I'm going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself...
0601	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0602	RUBIO	...and, you can only do that through free enterprise.
0603	RUBIO	That's what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton.
0604	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0605	ARRARÁS	Governor Kasich, after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos.
0606	ARRARÁS	Guidelines as to how to accomplish that were spelled out in an autopsy report that concluded, and I'm going to quote it, "if hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn't want them in the United States they won't pay attention to our next sentence."
0607	ARRARÁS	So, do you think that your fellow Republican candidates get it?
0608	KASICH	Well, I'm not going to talk about that.
0609	KASICH	I mean, I've got to tell you, I was with this little 12yearold girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I don't like all this yelling and screaming at the debates.
0610	KASICH	My mother's thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.
0611	KASICH	I think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think.
0612	KASICH	I'm going to tell you what I think.
0613	KASICH	My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning.
0614	KASICH	I haven't changed anything with it.
0615	KASICH	And, look, my view is, we need economic growth.
0616	KASICH	Everything starts with economic growth.
0617	KASICH	And how do you get it?
0618	KASICH	Common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget.
0619	KASICH	That gives you economic growth.
0620	KASICH	I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman, negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio.
0621	KASICH	But here's the thing that I believe.
0622	KASICH	Economic growth is not an end unto itself.
0623	KASICH	We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.
0624	KASICH	Of course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the AfricanAmerican community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone.
0625	KASICH	It's what Jack Kemp used to say.
0626	KASICH	A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats.
0627	KASICH	And you know what?
0628	KASICH	With me and the Hispanic community, I think they like me.
0629	KASICH	And I appreciate that, because I want them to have the same opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country.
0630	KASICH	It's time to solve problems.
0631	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0632	ARRARÁS	Dr. Carson, concerning this recommendation of the report, are you, as a candidate, getting it?
0633	CARSON	I didn't hear the first part of the question?
0634	ARRARÁS	The first part of the question is, there was a report that recommended that in order to approach Hispanics and bring them to vote for the Republican Party, certain things needed to happen.
0635	ARRARÁS	And one of them was that they shouldn't feel like they were going to get kicked out of the United States, otherwise they wouldn't pay attention to one more sentence from candidates.
0636	CARSON	OK, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the NALEO, the National Association for Latino Elected Officials, I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there.
0637	CARSON	And the reason that I don't fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group.
0638	CARSON	You know, this is America.
0639	CARSON	And we need to have policies that are  that give liberty and justice to all people.
0640	CARSON	And that's the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that.
0641	CARSON	And I think that's the way the Republican Party generally thinks.
0642	CARSON	We don't pick and choose winners and losers.
0643	CARSON	We are compassionate.
0644	CARSON	But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America.
0645	CARSON	When we begin to emphasize that, I think we will attract everybody.
0646	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0647	ARRARÁS	Mr. Trump, it is common knowledge that the Hispanic vote is very important in this race.
0648	ARRARÁS	You keep saying that Hispanics love you.
0649	TRUMP	True.
0650	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0651	ARRARÁS	And, yes, you won the Hispanic vote in Nevada.
0652	TRUMP	True.
0653	ARRARÁS	But a brand new Telemundo poll says that three out of four Hispanics that vote nationwide have a negative opinion of you.
0654	ARRARÁS	They don't like you.
0655	ARRARÁS	Wouldn't that make you an unelectable...
0656	TRUMP	No.
0657	ARRARÁS	... candidate in a general election?
0658	TRUMP	First of all, I don't believe anything Telemundo says.
0659	ARRARÁS	You used to say that you love...
0660	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0661	TRUMP	Number one.
0662	TRUMP	Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, I've employed tens of thousands of Hispanics.
0663	TRUMP	They're incredible people.
0664	TRUMP	They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women.
0665	TRUMP	I won with every single category.
0666	TRUMP	I won with men, I won with highincome, lowincome, I won with Hispanics.
0667	TRUMP	And I got 46 percent.
0668	TRUMP	Nobody else was close.
0669	TRUMP	Because they know I'm going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.
0670	TRUMP	They get it.
0671	TRUMP	They're incredible people.
0672	TRUMP	They're incredible workers.
0673	TRUMP	They get it.
0674	TRUMP	And I've won many of the polls with Hispanics.
0675	TRUMP	I didn't maybe win the Telemundo poll.
0676	TRUMP	But one thing I'm also going to do, I'm going to be getting  bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you're seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been recordsetting.
0677	TRUMP	And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in.
0678	TRUMP	We're getting recordsetting numbers.
0679	TRUMP	I think I have something to do with that.
0680	TRUMP	We're getting recordsetting numbers.
0681	TRUMP	And I won every one  the three of them that I won, I won with recordsetting numbers.
0682	TRUMP	New people are coming into the Republican Party.
0683	TRUMP	We are building a new Republican Party, a lot of new people are coming in.
0684	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0685	ARRARÁS	For the record, you have said publicly that you loved Telemundo in the past.
0686	ARRARÁS	But it is not just a Telemundo poll.
0687	ARRARÁS	We have...
0688	TRUMP	I love them.
0689	TRUMP	I love them.
0690	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0691	ARRARÁS	All right.
0692	ARRARÁS	Well, it's not the only poll.
0693	TRUMP	They're fine.
0694	TRUMP	Do you know what?
0695	TRUMP	They're fine.
0696	ARRARÁS	Just last night  let me  let me finish, please.
0697	ARRARÁS	Just last night, The Washington Post showed that 80 percent of Hispanic voters in their polls have a negative view of you.
0698	ARRARÁS	And concerning the Nevada victory, allow me to explain that the poll in Nevada was based on a tiny sample, statistically insignificant of only about 100  let me finish please  of 100 Hispanic Republicans in the state of Nevada.
0699	TRUMP	Why did they take the poll?
0700	TRUMP	Why did they...
0701	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0702	ARRARÁS	I am making reference  I am making reference to Hispanic voters nationwide in a general election.
0703	TRUMP	I'm just telling you, I'm doing very well with Hispanics.
0704	TRUMP	And by the way, I settled my suit, as you know, with Univision.
0705	TRUMP	It was settled.
0706	TRUMP	We're good friends now.
0707	TRUMP	It was all settled up.
0708	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0709	TRUMP	Very happy, very happy.
0710	TRUMP	Very good people.
0711	TRUMP	I'm just telling you  I'm just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics.
0712	TRUMP	I will do better than anybody on this stage.
0713	TRUMP	I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics.
0714	TRUMP	But I'm telling you also, I'm bringing people, Democrats over and I'm bringing independents over, and we're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.
0715	BLITZER	Mr. Trump, thank you.
0716	BLITZER	I want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people, the United States Supreme Court, where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue.
0717	BLITZER	I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host, Hugh Hewitt.
0718	BLITZER	Hugh?
0719	HEWITT	Thank you, Wolf.
0720	HEWITT	To me, it's the most important issue.
0721	HEWITT	I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.
0722	HEWITT	Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?
0723	CRUZ	Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it  Justice Scalia's passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election.
0724	CRUZ	Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend.
0725	CRUZ	And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance.
0726	CRUZ	We are one liberal justice away from a fivejustice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty that would undermine the right to life and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.
0727	CRUZ	Now, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this  this stage.
0728	CRUZ	In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists.
0729	CRUZ	So I'm certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that.
0730	CRUZ	But the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000.
0731	CRUZ	Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want.
0732	CRUZ	Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.
0733	CRUZ	I've spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
0734	CRUZ	I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, they're asking the question Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court?
0735	CRUZ	I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.
0736	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0737	HEWITT	Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night, which is religious liberty.
0738	HEWITT	Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies  all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if it's repealed, it was a fivefour decision, they're going to have to bend their knee and provide morningafter pills.
0739	HEWITT	They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded, they will lose their tax exemption.
0740	HEWITT	Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?
0741	TRUMP	Yes, I would.
0742	TRUMP	And I've been there.
0743	TRUMP	And I've been there very strongly.
0744	TRUMP	I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault.
0745	TRUMP	It's not Ted's fault.
0746	TRUMP	Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted.
0747	TRUMP	Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare.
0748	TRUMP	Might as well be called Robertscare.
0749	TRUMP	Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve.
0750	TRUMP	And we ended up with Obamacare.
0751	TRUMP	That is a rough thing.
0752	TRUMP	And I know Ted feels badly about it.
0753	TRUMP	And I think he probably still respects the judge.
0754	TRUMP	But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way  no way that he should have approved Obamacare.
0755	TRUMP	Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen.
0756	TRUMP	But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don't want.
0757	HEWITT	Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruz's criticism?
0758	CRUZ	Well, listen  Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts.
0759	CRUZ	Yes, it's true, I supported the Republican nominee once he was made.
0760	CRUZ	But I would not have nominated John Roberts.
0761	CRUZ	I would have nominated my former boss, Mike Luttig, who was the strongest proven conservative on the court of appeals.
0762	CRUZ	And I'll tell you, Hugh...
0763	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0764	CRUZ	...you know, it's interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who  who will defend religious liberty, but this is a man who, for 40 years, has given money to Jimmy Carter, to Joe Biden, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer, to Harry Reid.
0765	CRUZ	Nobody who supports farleft liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court.
0766	CRUZ	And what Donald has told us is he will go to Washington...
0767	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0768	CRUZ	...and cut a deal.
0769	HEWITT	Mr. Trump...
0770	CRUZ	So that means on Supreme Court...
0771	HEWITT	... can I...
0772	CRUZ	... he's going to look to cut a deal, rather than fight for someone who won't cut a deal on the Constitution, but will defend it faithfully.
0773	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0774	HEWITT	Can I trust you on religious liberty?
0775	TRUMP	Well, let  let me  let me just say  let me just say this.
0776	TRUMP	Look, I watched Ted  and I respected it, but he gets nowhere  stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.
0777	TRUMP	I watched the other senators laughing and smiling.
0778	TRUMP	And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work.
0779	TRUMP	OK?
0780	TRUMP	We have to have somebody that's going to make deals.
0781	TRUMP	It's wonderful to stand up for two days and do that.
0782	TRUMP	Now, Ted's been very critical  I have a sister who's a brilliant...
0783	HEWITT	Mr. Cruz, will you make a deal about religious liberty?
0784	TRUMP	... excuse me.
0785	TRUMP	She's a brilliant judge.
0786	TRUMP	He's been criticizing  he's been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill.
0787	TRUMP	You know who else signed that bill?
0788	TRUMP	Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill.
0789	TRUMP	So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted.
0790	TRUMP	What do you think?
0791	HEWITT	Let me  Senator.
0792	CRUZ	Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution.
0793	CRUZ	I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights.
0794	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0795	CRUZ	And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you can't have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it.
0796	CRUZ	You've got to be willing to cut a deal.
0797	CRUZ	And you know, there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald  Donald Trump.
0798	CRUZ	Why?
0799	CRUZ	Because Donald has supported him in the past, and he knows he can cut a deal with him.
0800	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0801	CRUZ	You know what, Donald...
0802	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0803	HEWITT	Senator Rubio.
0804	CRUZ	...
0805	CRUZ	I don't want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty, because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.
0806	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0807	TRUMP	When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you?
0808	TRUMP	Crazy zealot  give me a break.
0809	HEWITT	Senator Rubio, you've heard this exchange on religious liberty.
0810	HEWITT	You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from samesex marriages, not provide flowers, not provide baked goods, et cetera.
0811	HEWITT	Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?
0812	RUBIO	Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here  the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.
0813	RUBIO	Justice Scalia  in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document  it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.
0814	RUBIO	And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia  plus there may be at least two other vacancies.
0815	RUBIO	So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would.
0816	RUBIO	But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.
0817	RUBIO	Now, if he's changed, we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement.
0818	RUBIO	But the bottom line is that, if you don't have a record there to look at and say, "I feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States, he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues."
0819	RUBIO	In fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood.
0820	RUBIO	He says he's not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel.
0821	RUBIO	These are concerning things.
0822	RUBIO	And so, yes, I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump, if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia.
0823	HEWITT	Mr. Trump?
0824	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0825	TRUMP	Well, let  let me just say  let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia.
0826	TRUMP	I thought he was terrific.
0827	TRUMP	And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat.
0828	TRUMP	Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative  more importantly, he was a great president.
0829	TRUMP	A great president.
0830	TRUMP	As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm prolife.
0831	TRUMP	I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood.
0832	TRUMP	But millions and millions of women  cervical cancer, breast cancer  are helped by Planned Parenthood.
0833	TRUMP	So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly.
0834	TRUMP	And I wouldn't fund it.
0835	TRUMP	I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent.
0836	TRUMP	I don't know what percentage it is.
0837	TRUMP	They say it's 3 percent.
0838	TRUMP	But I would defund it, because I'm prolife.
0839	TRUMP	But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.
0840	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0841	HEWITT	Governor Kasich, back to religious liberty.
0842	HEWITT	You've been a little bit less emphatic.
0843	HEWITT	You've said, samesex couple approaches a cupcake maker, sell them a cupcake.
0844	HEWITT	Can we trust you as much on religious liberty as the rest of these people?
0845	KASICH	Well, you know, , of course.
0846	KASICH	I mean, if  look, I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church.
0847	KASICH	Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in.
0848	KASICH	No question and no doubt about it.
0849	KASICH	Now, in regard to samesex marriage, I don't favor it.
0850	KASICH	I've always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and I've moved on.
0851	KASICH	And what I've said, Hugh, is that, look, where does it end?
0852	KASICH	If you're in the business of selling things, if you're not going to sell to somebody you don't agree with, OK, today I'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay, and tomorrow maybe I won't sell to somebody who's divorced.
0853	KASICH	I mean, if you're in the business of commerce, conduct commerce.
0854	KASICH	That's my view.
0855	KASICH	And if you don't agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior.
0856	KASICH	But when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and I would fight for those religious institutions.
0857	KASICH	And look, I've appointed over a hundred judges as governor.
0858	KASICH	I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.
0859	KASICH	And you know what they are?
0860	KASICH	They're conservatives.
0861	KASICH	Go check it out.
0862	KASICH	They are conservatives.
0863	KASICH	They don't make the law.
0864	KASICH	They interpret the law.
0865	KASICH	That's all they do.
0866	KASICH	And they stick by the Constitution.
0867	KASICH	So I will do that.
0868	KASICH	But let's just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that.
0869	KASICH	I think my position is clear.
0870	HEWITT	Dr. Carson, let me wrap it up with you.
0871	HEWITT	Are their positions clear?
0872	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0873	HEWITT	Are the positions you've heard clear about the First Amendment and the first freedom?
0874	CARSON	Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia.
0875	CARSON	I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago.
0876	CARSON	A tremendous wit and intellect.
0877	CARSON	As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights.
0878	CARSON	And it gives people who believe in samesex marriage the same rights as everybody else.
0879	CARSON	But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights.
0880	CARSON	So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it.
0881	CARSON	That's unfair.
0882	CARSON	And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done.
0883	CARSON	That's why we have divided government.
0884	CARSON	And we're going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom.
0885	CARSON	And as president, I would go through and I would look at what a person's life has been.
0886	CARSON	What have they done in the past?
0887	CARSON	What kind of judgments have they made?
0888	CARSON	What kind of associations do they have?
0889	CARSON	That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.
0890	CARSON	The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.
0891	BLITZER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.
0892	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0893	BLITZER	All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, so let's talk about your plans, specific plans to replace it.
0894	BLITZER	I want to bring in our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash.
0895	BASH	Senator Rubio, you said yesterday, right here in Houston, that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good.
0896	BASH	So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare.
0897	BASH	Are you saying that you're worried he won't?
0898	RUBIO	The individual mandate.
0899	RUBIO	He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I don't believe that should be part of it.
0900	RUBIO	That should not remain there.
0901	RUBIO	I think here's what we need to replace it with.
0902	RUBIO	We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again.
0903	RUBIO	If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.
0904	RUBIO	Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.
0905	RUBIO	And if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage.
0906	RUBIO	And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy.
0907	RUBIO	It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to parttime.
0908	RUBIO	It is not just a bad health care law, it is a jobkilling law.
0909	RUBIO	And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.
0910	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0911	BASH	Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate.
0912	BASH	Would you respond?
0913	TRUMP	I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except preexisting conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare.
0914	TRUMP	We're going to have something much better, but preexisting conditions, when I'm referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre existing conditions.
0915	TRUMP	I think we need it.
0916	TRUMP	I think it's a modern age.
0917	TRUMP	And I think we have to have it.
0918	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0919	BASH	OK, so let's talk about preexisting conditions.
0920	BASH	What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance.
0921	BASH	Are they wrong?
0922	TRUMP	I think they're wrong 100 percent.
0923	TRUMP	What we need  look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians.
0924	TRUMP	The insurance companies get what they want.
0925	TRUMP	We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition.
0926	TRUMP	We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.
0927	TRUMP	The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests.
0928	TRUMP	They got  I'm not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they're part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.
0929	TRUMP	And, actually, the Governor too, let's just talk about these too, OK?
0930	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0931	TRUMP	Because I don't think the Governor had too much to do with this.
0932	TRUMP	But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there's great competition.
0933	TRUMP	The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.
0934	TRUMP	I'm selffunding my campaign.
0935	TRUMP	I'm the only one in either party selffunding my campaign.
0936	TRUMP	I'm going to do what's right.
0937	TRUMP	We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there's serious, serious competition.
0938	BASH	But, Mr. Trump...
0939	TRUMP	... And, you're going to see  excuse me.
0940	TRUMP	You're going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay.
0941	TRUMP	Right now they're making a fortune.
0942	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0943	BASH	But, just to be specific here, what you're saying is getting rid of the barriers between states, that is going to solve the problem...
0944	TRUMP	That's going to solve the problem.
0945	TRUMP	And, the insurance companies aren't going to say that, they want to keep it.
0946	TRUMP	They want to say  they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is.
0947	TRUMP	I know the insurance companies, they're friends of mine.
0948	TRUMP	The top guys, they're friends of mine.
0949	TRUMP	I shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, I have a conflict of interest.
0950	TRUMP	They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience.
0951	TRUMP	One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling.
0952	TRUMP	He's not laughing so much anymore.
0953	TRUMP	Hi.
0954	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0955	TRUMP	Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune.
0956	TRUMP	Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing.
0957	TRUMP	Get rid of Obamacare, we'll come up with new plans.
0958	TRUMP	But, we should keep preexisting conditions.
0959	RUBIO	Dana, I was mentioned in his response, so if I may about the insurance companies...
0960	BASH	... Go ahead.
0961	RUBIO	You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don't follow this stuff very closely, but here's what happened.
0962	RUBIO	When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare.
0963	RUBIO	All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.
0964	RUBIO	And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund.
0965	RUBIO	The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that.
0966	RUBIO	They're suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.
0967	RUBIO	Here's what you didn't hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing.
0968	RUBIO	What is your plan?
0969	RUBIO	I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means.
0970	RUBIO	This is not a game where you draw maps...
0971	TRUMP	... And, you don't know what it means...
0972	RUBIO	... What is your plan, Mr. Trump?
0973	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0974	RUBIO	What is your plan on healthcare?
0975	TRUMP	You don't know.
0976	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0977	TRUMP	...
0978	TRUMP	The biggest problem...
0979	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0980	RUBIO	... What's your plan...
0981	TRUMP	...
0982	TRUMP	The biggest problem, I'll have you know...
0983	RUBIO	... What's your plan...
0984	TRUMP	... You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie.
0985	TRUMP	I got to tell you, the biggest problem he's got is he really doesn't know about the lines.
0986	TRUMP	The biggest thing we've got, and the reason we've got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially....
0987	RUBIO	... We already mentioned that
0988	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0989	RUBIO	plan, I know what that is, but what else is part of your plan...
0990	TRUMP	... You don't know much...
0991	RUBIO	...
0992	RUBIO	So, you're only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states.
0993	RUBIO	What else is part of your healthcare plan...
0994	TRUMP	...
0995	TRUMP	The lines around the states...
0996	RUBIO	... That's your only plan...
0997	TRUMP	... and, it was almost done  not now...
0998	RUBIO	... Alright,
0999	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1000	RUBIO	...
1001	TRUMP	...
1002	TRUMP	Excuse me.
1003	TRUMP	Excuse me.
1004	RUBIO	... His plan.
1005	RUBIO	That was the plan...
1006	TRUMP	... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition.
1007	TRUMP	So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you'll have many.
1008	TRUMP	They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing.
1009	RUBIO	Alright...
1010	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1011	RUBIO	So, that's the only part of the plan?
1012	RUBIO	Just the lines?
1013	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1014	TRUMP	The nice part of the plan  you'll have many different plans.
1015	TRUMP	You'll have competition, you'll have so many different plans.
1016	RUBIO	Now he's repeating himself.

1044	BASH	Senator Rubio, you will have time to respond if you would just let Mr. Trump respond to what you've just posed to him...
1045	RUBIO	... Yeah, he's going to give us his plan now, right?
1046	RUBIO	OK...
1047	BASH	...
1048	BASH	If you could talk a little bit more about your plan.
1049	BASH	I know you talked about...
1050	TRUMP	... We're going to have many different plans because...
1051	BASH	... Can you be a little specific...
1052	TRUMP	... competition...
1053	RUBIO	...
1054	RUBIO	He's done it again.
1055	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
1056	TRUMP	There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies.
1057	TRUMP	They're going to have many, many different plans.
1058	BASH	Is there anything else you would like to add to that...
1059	TRUMP	No, there's nothing to add.
1060	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
1061	TRUMP	What is to add?
1062	BASH	Thank you.
1063	BASH	Thank you both.
1064	RUBIO	Alright.
1065	BASH	Governor Kasich, you've said it is, quote, "Un American to deny someone health insurance if they have a preexisting condition."
1066	BASH	Would you leave the individual mandate in place requiring all Americans to purchase insurance?
1067	KASICH	No, I wouldn't.
1068	KASICH	And  but that doesn't matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions.
1069	KASICH	You don't want any American to lose their house, everything they've saved, because they get sick.
1070	KASICH	Now, I think it is more complicated than what we've heard here tonight.
1071	KASICH	We're actually running significant health reform in my state.
1072	KASICH	I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons.
1073	KASICH	I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freedup Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don't want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance.
1074	KASICH	And then we're driving towards total transparency.
1075	KASICH	If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it's easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill.
1076	KASICH	The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.
1077	KASICH	And I'll tell you what we will do.
1078	KASICH	We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices.
1079	KASICH	We actually are going to make the market work.
1080	BASH	Governor, let me just go back to the original question about the individual mandate.
1081	BASH	In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate.
1082	BASH	So what changed?
1083	KASICH	Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well.
1084	KASICH	And when I look at it, I don't think it's tenable.
1085	KASICH	And we don't need to do that.
1086	KASICH	Again, I'm telling you that we are going to  we have a proposal, a plan that we're enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you're providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint  some charge high, some charge low.
1087	KASICH	If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.
1088	KASICH	That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare.
1089	KASICH	Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they're going higher, higher and higher.
1090	KASICH	And you know what?
1091	KASICH	At some point, people can't afford it.
1092	KASICH	Our plan will work.
1093	KASICH	It uses the market.
1094	KASICH	It uses transparency.
1095	KASICH	It gets the patient in the middle.
1096	KASICH	And guess what?
1097	KASICH	We're actually doing it in my state, the seventhlargest state in the country.
1098	KASICH	And if this will go  this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on.
1099	KASICH	We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition.
1100	KASICH	We don't want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana.
1101	KASICH	So that's really what we're doing.
1102	KASICH	This is not a theory.
1103	KASICH	This is what we are actually doing in our state.
1104	KASICH	We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives.
1105	KASICH	If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what?
1106	KASICH	They will get a financial reward.
1107	KASICH	Our primary care physicians need help.
1108	KASICH	They need support.
1109	KASICH	We're losing them.
1110	KASICH	This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.
1111	BASH	Governor Kasich, thank you.
1112	KASICH	Thank you.
1113	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1114	BASH	Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients.
1115	BASH	You support covering preexisting conditions.
1116	BASH	How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?
1117	CARSON	Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right.
1118	CARSON	But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that.
1119	CARSON	We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.
1120	CARSON	I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats.
1121	CARSON	And we give it to everybody from birth until death.
1122	CARSON	They can pass it on when they die.
1123	CARSON	We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with.
1124	CARSON	We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family.
1125	CARSON	So dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.
1126	CARSON	And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man.
1127	CARSON	It gives you enormous flexibility.
1128	CARSON	And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody's going to hide his cigarettes because they're all interested in what's going on there.
1129	CARSON	Also, the  your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare.
1130	CARSON	So, it's like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered.
1131	CARSON	One costs $1,500 a year one costs $10,000 a year.
1132	CARSON	You can buy the $1,500 one.
1133	CARSON	That will take care of 75 percent of the people.
1134	CARSON	The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now?
1135	CARSON	Medicaid.
1136	CARSON	What's the Medicaid budget?
1137	CARSON	Almost $500 billion almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.
1138	CARSON	But do the math.
1139	CARSON	Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all  they will have a lot more flexibility.
1140	CARSON	What could you buy with that?
1141	CARSON	A concierge practice.
1142	BLITZER	Thank you.
1143	CARSON	And you could still have thousands of dollars left over.
1144	CARSON	And let me just finish, because I don't get to talk that much.
1145	CARSON	And, you know, let's...
1146	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1147	CARSON	...you can have the money that's left over to buy your catastrophic insurance.
1148	CARSON	But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else.
1149	CARSON	It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that's probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still defund it.
1150	BLITZER	Thank you.
1151	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1152	BLITZER	Thank you, Dr. Carson.
1153	BLITZER	Let's talk about the economy.
1154	BLITZER	Let's talk about...
1155	CRUZ	Wolf, Wolf, Wolf.
1156	CRUZ	Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?
1157	BLITZER	I want to move on, but there'll be plenty of opportunities for you to address...
1158	CRUZ	It's kind of an issue I have a long history with.
1159	BLITZER	I know you do.
1160	BLITZER	And  all right, go ahead.
1161	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1162	CRUZ	Thank you, Wolf.
1163	KASICH	How do you  how do you get that extra time, Cruz?
1164	KASICH	You're very good at...
1165	CRUZ	You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements.
1166	CRUZ	On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful.
1167	CRUZ	I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.
1168	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1169	CRUZ	On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons.
1170	CRUZ	I want to end it because it goes too far, it's killed millions of jobs, and it's hurting people's health care.
1171	CRUZ	Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn't go nearly far enough.
1172	CRUZ	And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.
1173	CRUZ	What he's said is government should pay for everyone's health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless.
1174	CRUZ	Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years.
1175	CRUZ	Now let me tell you if you're a small business owner, Donald Trump's socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you're elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it's been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don't get that hip replacement, you don't get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.
1176	CRUZ	I'll tell you this.
1177	CRUZ	As president...
1178	BLITZER	Senator...
1179	CRUZ	...
1180	CRUZ	I will repeal every word of Obamacare.
1181	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1182	BLITZER	Thank you, thank you.
1183	BLITZER	Mr. Trump?
1184	TRUMP	I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand.
1185	TRUMP	He goes around saying oh, he wants it.
1186	TRUMP	I do not want socialized medicine.
1187	TRUMP	I do agree with him that it's going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.
1188	TRUMP	In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what's going on.
1189	TRUMP	That's why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn't work, number two, premium.
1190	TRUMP	You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more.
1191	TRUMP	We have to get rid of Obamacare.
1192	TRUMP	It is going to destroy our economy completely.
1193	TRUMP	Our economy is not doing well.
1194	TRUMP	It is going to destroy our economy greatly.
1195	TRUMP	And on that, I agree.
1196	CRUZ	Donald, true or false, you've said the government should pay for everyone's health care.
1197	TRUMP	That's false.
1198	CRUZ	You've never said that?
1199	TRUMP	No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...
1200	CRUZ	But you've never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.
1201	TRUMP	No, I did not.
1202	TRUMP	No I did not.
1203	CRUZ	Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don't support socialized health care, you have no heart.
1204	TRUMP	Correct.
1205	TRUMP	I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.
1206	CRUZ	Have you said you're a liberal on health care?
1207	TRUMP	Excuse me.
1208	TRUMP	Let me talk.
1209	TRUMP	If people...
1210	CRUZ	Talk away.
1211	CRUZ	Explain your plan, please.
1212	TRUMP	If people  my plan is very simple.
1213	TRUMP	I will not  we're going to have private  we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I'm president.
1214	TRUMP	You may let it and you may be fine with it...
1215	CRUZ	So does the government pay for everyone's health care?
1216	TRUMP	...
1217	TRUMP	I'm not fine with it.
1218	TRUMP	We are going to take those people...
1219	CRUZ	Yes or no.
1220	CRUZ	Just answer the question.
1221	TRUMP	Excuse me.
1222	TRUMP	We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals.
1223	TRUMP	We're going to make great deals on it, but we're not going to let them die in the streets.
1224	CRUZ	Who pays for it?
1225	RUBIO	Well, can I just clarify something?
1226	BLITZER	Gentleman, please.
1227	RUBIO	Wolf, no.
1228	RUBIO	I want to clarify something.
1229	BLITZER	Gentlemen please.
1230	BLITZER	I want to move on.
1231	RUBIO	This is a Republican debate, right?
1232	RUBIO	Because that attack about letting people die in the streets...
1233	BLITZER	I want to talk about the economy.
1234	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1235	BLITZER	Gentleman, gentleman.
1236	BLITZER	All of you have agreed  Senator Cruz...
1237	TRUMP	You know what?
1238	TRUMP	Call it what you want.
1239	CRUZ	It's a yes or no.
1240	TRUMP	Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.
1241	BLITZER	All of you have agreed  all of you have agreed to the rules.
1242	BLITZER	I want to move on.
1243	BLITZER	We're talking about the economy right now.
1244	BLITZER	Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did.
1245	BLITZER	The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts.
1246	BLITZER	How would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isn't saddled with even more debt?
1247	TRUMP	Because the country will become a dynamic economy.
1248	TRUMP	We'll be dynamic again.
1249	TRUMP	If you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world.
1250	TRUMP	We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax.
1251	TRUMP	We have the highest taxes in the world.
1252	TRUMP	It's shutting off our economy.
1253	TRUMP	It's shutting off our country.
1254	TRUMP	We have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in.
1255	TRUMP	Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great.
1256	TRUMP	We will have a dynamic economy again.
1257	BLITZER	What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?
1258	TRUMP	We're going to make many cuts in business.
1259	TRUMP	We're getting rid of  we're going to get rid of so many different things.
1260	TRUMP	Department of Education  Common Core is out.
1261	TRUMP	We're going local.
1262	TRUMP	Have to go local.

1270	TRUMP	We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.
1271	BLITZER	Mr. Trump  Mr. Trump.
1272	BLITZER	If you eliminate completely the Department of Education, as you have proposed, that's about $68 billion.
1273	BLITZER	If you eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, that's about $8 billion.
1274	BLITZER	That's about $76 billion for those two agencies.
1275	BLITZER	The current deficit this year is $544 billion.
1276	BLITZER	Where are you going to come up with the money?
1277	TRUMP	Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place.
1278	TRUMP	Waste, fraud and abuse.

1282	BLITZER	Governor Kasich.
1283	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1284	BLITZER	When you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee.
1285	BLITZER	You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had.
1286	BLITZER	Can Mr. Trump's plan work?
1287	KASICH	Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf.
1288	KASICH	And I've done it.
1289	KASICH	I mean, I  we got the budget balanced.
1290	KASICH	We cut the capital gains tax.
1291	KASICH	You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.
1292	KASICH	And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance.
1293	KASICH	We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington  every single one of them  and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.
1294	KASICH	And why do you do it?
1295	KASICH	Because you want job growth.
1296	KASICH	If you don't have regulatory reform, commonsense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won't get there.
1297	KASICH	You will never be able to do it.
1298	KASICH	Now, I  I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have commonsense regulations, I have tax cuts  the biggest of any governor in the country  and we have a fiscal plan.
1299	KASICH	And it's not all  it's not always cutting.
1300	KASICH	It's innovating  it's producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price.
1301	KASICH	Now we have a $2 billion surplus.
1302	KASICH	Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong.
1303	KASICH	And, look  I've got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation.
1304	KASICH	I've done it  I did it in Washington  four years of balanced budgets.
1305	KASICH	No one could even believe it happened.
1306	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1307	KASICH	I've done it in Ohio, we're growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity.
1308	KASICH	And I will go back to Washington and do it again for the American people.
1309	KASICH	I promise you that.
1310	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1311	KASICH	Within the first hundred days, we will have the plan to get this done.
1312	BLITZER	Thank you.
1313	BLITZER	Thank you, governor.
1314	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1315	BLITZER	Speaking of taxes...
1316	TRUMP	I just want to say  and I'm a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.
1317	KASICH	OK, let me  let me  let me just talk about that, because I know that  that Donald believes the energy industry is important.
1318	KASICH	So do I.
1319	KASICH	But of the over 400,000 jobs that we've created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it's earlystage.
1320	KASICH	See, what we've done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that's jobsfriendly.
1321	KASICH	We have diversified our economy.
1322	KASICH	We  we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon  their Cloud computing in the Midwest.
1323	KASICH	You know why it's happening?
1324	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1325	KASICH	Because we're balanced budgets, we're strong, we're jobfriendly, we don't raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs.
1326	KASICH	Jobs, jobs and jobs, period.
1327	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1328	BLITZER	Mr. Trump, yesterday, the last Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called on you to release your back tax returns, and said, and I'm quoting him now, "there is good reason to believe there is a bombshell in them."
1329	BLITZER	Romney said either you're not as wealthy as you say you are, said maybe you haven't paid the kind of taxes we would expect you to pay, or you haven't been giving the money to veterans or disabled people.
1330	BLITZER	Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?
1331	TRUMP	All right.
1332	TRUMP	First of all, let me just explain.
1333	TRUMP	I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form  almost 100 pages.
1334	TRUMP	You don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return.
1335	TRUMP	You learn it from statements.
1336	TRUMP	I filed  which shows that I'm worth over $10 billion.
1337	TRUMP	I built a great company with very little debt.
1338	TRUMP	People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down.
1339	TRUMP	And I filed it on time.
1340	TRUMP	I didn't ask for five 45day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.
1341	TRUMP	So as far as that's concerned, I filed it.
1342	TRUMP	And that's where you find out what kind of a company.
1343	TRUMP	You don't learn anything from a tax return.
1344	TRUMP	I will say this.
1345	TRUMP	Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed.
1346	TRUMP	And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully.
1347	TRUMP	And Mitt Romney didn't file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a monthandahalf before the election.
1348	TRUMP	And it cost him big league.
1349	TRUMP	As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I've been audited every year.
1350	TRUMP	Twelve years, or something like that.
1351	TRUMP	Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.
1352	TRUMP	Nobody gets audited  I have friends that are very wealthy people.
1353	TRUMP	They never get audited.
1354	TRUMP	I get audited every year.
1355	TRUMP	I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously.
1356	TRUMP	And I think people would understand that.
1357	BLITZER	Hugh, go ahead.
1358	HEWITT	Mr. Trump.
1359	HEWITT	You told me...
1360	TRUMP	Are you going to ask anybody else that question?
1361	CARSON	Yes, amen, amen.
1362	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1363	TRUMP	Every single question comes to me?
1364	HEWITT	Mr. Trump...
1365	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1366	TRUMP	I know I'm here for the ratings, but it's a little bit ridiculous.
1367	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1368	HEWITT	Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on YouTube, that you would release your tax returns.
1369	TRUMP	True.
1370	HEWITT	Are you going back on your commitment?
1371	TRUMP	No, I'm not.
1372	TRUMP	First of all, very few people listen to your radio show.
1373	TRUMP	That's the good news.
1374	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1375	TRUMP	Let me just tell you, let me just  which happens to be true.
1376	TRUMP	Check out the ratings.
1377	TRUMP	Look, let me just tell you something.
1378	TRUMP	Let me just tell you something.
1379	TRUMP	I want to release my tax returns but I can't release it while I'm under an audit.
1380	TRUMP	We're under a routine audit.
1381	TRUMP	I've had it for years, I get audited.
1382	TRUMP	And obviously if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return.
1383	TRUMP	As soon as the audit is done, I love it.
1384	HEWITT	So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns.
1385	HEWITT	Your campaign said last spring that you would release your returns that you had not previously released.
1386	HEWITT	And you said, coming out any day momentarily.
1387	HEWITT	When are we going to see your returns?
1388	RUBIO	Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them.
1389	RUBIO	And there's nothing really that interesting in them.
1390	RUBIO	So I have no problem releasing them.
1391	RUBIO	And luckily I'm not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.
1392	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1393	RUBIO	But this is my time.
1394	RUBIO	I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt.
1395	RUBIO	This is an important issue.
1396	RUBIO	It's a huge issue, OK?
1397	RUBIO	In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.
1398	RUBIO	That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.
1399	RUBIO	You cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why I've been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations.
1400	RUBIO	And I think if we  the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis.
1401	RUBIO	And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question.
1402	RUBIO	This debt issue is  the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.
1403	RUBIO	It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis.
1404	RUBIO	And we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.
1405	HEWITT	Thank you, Senator Rubio.
1406	HEWITT	But I am...
1407	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1408	HEWITT	...I'm being fair to all of the candidates.
1409	HEWITT	Senator Cruz, Tuesday is five days away.
1410	HEWITT	Why haven't voters seen your 2012, 2013, and 2014 returns?
1411	CRUZ	So, I've released five years of tax returns already.
1412	CRUZ	We will have two more years available tomorrow.
1413	CRUZ	And I would note that this question really goes  you know, Donald says he's being audited.
1414	CRUZ	Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns.
1415	CRUZ	If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know.
1416	CRUZ	And listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis.
1417	CRUZ	The most important question is how do we win the general election in November, 2016.
1418	CRUZ	And roughly 65 percent of Republicans think Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.
1419	CRUZ	Now, part of the reason in the last 10 polls...
1420	TRUMP	Eightyfive percent say you, big difference.
1421	CRUZ	... RealClearPolitics he has lost to Hillary on eight of them.
1422	CRUZ	In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary.
1423	CRUZ	And this is an example.
1424	CRUZ	You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald now.
1425	CRUZ	They're going to pick apart his taxes.
1426	CRUZ	They're going to pick apart his business deals.
1427	CRUZ	And let's take, for example, one of Hillary's great vulnerabilities, the corruption at the Clinton Foundation, the fact that she had CEOs and foreign companies giving her money while she was secretary of state.
1428	CRUZ	The next Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case against Hillary.
1429	CRUZ	And if Donald tried to did it, Hillary would turn to Donald and say, "but gosh, Donald, you gave $100,000 to the Clinton foundation.
1430	CRUZ	I even went to your wedding."
1431	CRUZ	He can't prosecute the case against Hillary, and we can't risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November.
1432	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1433	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1434	TRUMP	So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat.
1435	TRUMP	And I have, over the years.
1436	TRUMP	I'm a businessman.
1437	TRUMP	I have, over the years.
1438	TRUMP	And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he's doing well in the polls.
1439	TRUMP	Well, I'm beating him in virtually every poll.
1440	TRUMP	I'm tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldn't be.
1441	TRUMP	But I think I'll do very well.
1442	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1443	TRUMP	But a poll just came out  a Bloomberg poll  where I am beating him so badly that it's, like, embarrassing even for me to say I'm beating him that badly.
1444	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1445	TRUMP	And  and here's the thing  it was sort of funny  65 percent of the people don't like you  I just got 36 percent of the vote, right?
1446	TRUMP	I just got 46 percent on another one.
1447	TRUMP	I got 38 percent...
1448	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1449	TRUMP	...on another one.
1450	TRUMP	That means  and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly  that was going to be his stronghold.
1451	TRUMP	He said a year ago, "I can't lose South Carolina."
1452	TRUMP	I beat him in a landslide.
1453	TRUMP	Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sank about the polls.
1454	TRUMP	One other thing  Hillary Clinton  take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll.
1455	TRUMP	I beat her, and I beat her badly.
1456	TRUMP	And I  and I haven't even started at her.
1457	TRUMP	I only had one little interchange...[
1458	TRUMP	applause ]...I only had one little interchange, and that was...
1459	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1460	TRUMP	...four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist.
1461	TRUMP	And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary.
1462	TRUMP	They had a rough weekend.
1463	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1464	BLITZER	Gentlemen.
1465	BLITZER	Gentlemen.
1466	BLITZER	Gentlemen.
1467	CRUZ	Hold on.
1468	CRUZ	He  he attacked me, Wolf.
1469	CRUZ	I get a response.
1470	BLITZER	I was about to say  Senator Cruz, respond.
1471	CRUZ	Thank you.
1472	CRUZ	Thank  thank  thank you very much.
1473	CRUZ	You know, it's interesting  Donald went  went on  on an extended tirade about the polls, but he didn't respond to any of the substance.
1474	CRUZ	He has yet to say  he can release past year's tax returns.
1475	CRUZ	He can do it tomorrow.
1476	CRUZ	He doesn't want to do it, because presumably there's something in there...
1477	TRUMP	Nothing.
1478	CRUZ	... that is bad.
1479	CRUZ	If there's nothing, release them tomorrow.
1480	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1481	CRUZ	They're already prepared.
1482	CRUZ	The only reason he's not releasing them...
1483	TRUMP	You  you don't...
1484	CRUZ	... is because he's afraid that he will get hit.
1485	TRUMP	I'm not afraid
1486	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1487	TRUMP	.
1488	CRUZ	You know, Marco made reference earlier to the litigation against Trump University.
1489	CRUZ	It's a fraud case.
1490	CRUZ	His lawyers have scheduled the trial for July.
1491	CRUZ	I want you to think about, if this man is the nominee, having the Republican nominee...
1492	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1493	CRUZ	...on the stand in court, being crossexamined about whether he committed fraud.
1494	CRUZ	You don't think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?
1495	CRUZ	And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times, who agreed with her on foreign policy, who agrees with Bernie Sanders on health care, who agreed with Barack Obama on the Wall Street bailout?
1496	BLITZER	All right...
1497	CRUZ	If  we've got to win this election, and we can't do it with a candidate who agrees with Hillary Clinton and can't take it to her and beat her on the debate stage and at the polls.
1498	BLITZER	Mr. Trump.
1499	BLITZER	Mr,  hold on.
1500	BLITZER	Mr. Trump  Mr. Trump...
1501	TRUMP	... first of all, he's talking about the polls.
1502	TRUMP	I'm beating him awfully badly in the polls.
1503	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1504	CRUZ	But you're not beating Hillary.
1505	CRUZ	You're not beating Hillary.
1506	TRUMP	Well, then, if I can't  if  hey, if I can't beat her, you're really going to get killed, aren't you?
1507	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1508	TRUMP	So  so let me ask you this, because you're really getting beaten badly.
1509	TRUMP	I know you're embarrassed  I know you're embarrassed, but keep fighting  keep swinging, man.
1510	TRUMP	Swing for the fences.
1511	TRUMP	Let me just tell you  let me just tell you, the Trump University case is a civil case.
1512	TRUMP	Not a  it's a civil case.
1513	TRUMP	It's a case where people want to try and get  it's a case that is nonsense.
1514	TRUMP	It's something I could have settled many times.
1515	TRUMP	I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't want to do it out of principle.
1516	TRUMP	The people that took the course all signed  most  many  many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.
1517	TRUMP	As  and believe me, I'll win that case.
1518	TRUMP	That's an easy case.
1519	TRUMP	Civil case.
1520	TRUMP	Number two, as far as the taxes are concerned, I'm being audited.
1521	TRUMP	It's a very routine audit, and it's very unfair, because I've been audited for, I think, over 12 years.
1522	TRUMP	Every year, because of the size of my company, which is very, very large, I'm being audited  which is a very large company.
1523	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1524	BLITZER	Thank you.
1525	TRUMP	I'm being audited 12 years in a row, at least.
1526	TRUMP	Now, until that audit's done, and I don't think anybody would blame me, I'm not giving it...
1527	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1528	CRUZ	... the years you're not being audited?
1529	CRUZ	Will you release those years?

1536	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]

1542	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
1543	BLITZER	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here at the University of Houston.
1544	BLITZER	Gentlemen, I want to turn our attention right now to key issues involving foreign policy and national security.
1545	BLITZER	And Mr. Trump, I'll begin with you.
1546	TRUMP	Shocking.
1547	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1548	BLITZER	You said this about the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians  I'm quoting you now "Let me be sort of a neutral guy.
1549	BLITZER	I don't want to say whose fault it is, I don't think it helps."
1550	TRUMP	Right.
1551	BLITZER	Here's the question.
1552	BLITZER	How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America's closest ally in the Middle East?
1553	TRUMP	Well, first of all, I don't think they do under President Obama because I think he's treated Israel horribly, all right?
1554	TRUMP	I think he's treated Israel horribly.
1555	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1556	TRUMP	I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel.
1557	TRUMP	I've received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.
1558	TRUMP	As president, however, there's nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally.
1559	TRUMP	And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.
1560	TRUMP	Now, I may not be successful in doing it.
1561	TRUMP	It's probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind.
1562	TRUMP	OK?
1563	TRUMP	But it doesn't help if I start saying, "I am very proIsrael, very pro, more than anybody on this stage."
1564	TRUMP	But it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.
1565	TRUMP	And I can't do that as well  as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I'm taking big, big sides.
1566	TRUMP	With that being said, I am totally proIsrael.
1567	BLITZER	Senator Cruz?
1568	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1569	CRUZ	Well, this is another area on which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and on which I disagree with them both strongly.
1570	CRUZ	Both Donald and Hillary Clinton want to be neutral, to use Donald's word, between Israel and the Palestinians.
1571	CRUZ	Let me be clear.
1572	CRUZ	If I'm president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.
1573	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1574	CRUZ	And the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media.
1575	CRUZ	Listen, it is not equivalent.
1576	CRUZ	When you have terrorist strapping dynamite around their chest, exploding and murdering innocent women and children, they are not equivalent to the IDF officers protecting Israel.
1577	CRUZ	And I will not pretend that they are.
1578	CRUZ	Just today, Iran announced they're going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber.
1579	CRUZ	And I would note, missing from Donald's answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel.
1580	CRUZ	I have over and over again led the fight to defend Israel, to fight for Israel.
1581	CRUZ	And this  if you want to know who will stand with Israel, we ought to start with who has stood with Israel when the heat was on.
1582	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1583	BLITZER	Mr. Trump?
1584	TRUMP	Well, I can only say  look, I can only say I've been a big contributor to Israel over the years.
1585	TRUMP	I've received many, many awards from Israel, as I've said before.
1586	TRUMP	I have a great relationship with Israel.
1587	TRUMP	And I'm going to keep it that way.
1588	TRUMP	And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing.
1589	TRUMP	It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.
1590	BLITZER	Governor Kasich, I want you to weigh in.
1591	KASICH	Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee.
1592	KASICH	And then, you know, after 911, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things.
1593	KASICH	And I've been a supporter of Israel  a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage.
1594	KASICH	I didn't give as much money as Donald gave, but I've been standing with the Israelis for a very long time.
1595	KASICH	And frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with.
1596	KASICH	Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving.
1597	KASICH	And one  are moving because they're not sure what we will do.
1598	KASICH	It's a very interesting development here within the 24 hours.
1599	KASICH	We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system.
1600	KASICH	It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea.
1601	KASICH	When we stand firm and we let the world know who we're with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward.
1602	KASICH	[
1603	KASICH	crosstalk ]
1604	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1605	BLITZER	We're going to get to North Korea in a moment.
1606	BLITZER	But Senator Rubio, what's wrong with the U.S. being an honest broker in a negotiation, as Mr. Trump is proposing?
1607	RUBIO	Because  and I don't know if Donald realizes this.
1608	RUBIO	I'm sure it's not his intent perhaps.
1609	RUBIO	But the position you've taken is an antiIsrael position.
1610	RUBIO	And here's why.
1611	RUBIO	Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith.
1612	RUBIO	The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels.
1613	RUBIO	Instead, here's what the Palestinians do.
1614	RUBIO	They teach their four yearold children that killing Jews is a glorious thing.
1615	RUBIO	Here's what Hamas does.
1616	RUBIO	They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis.
1617	RUBIO	The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible.
1618	RUBIO	And so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel.
1619	RUBIO	I'm not  I'm not going to sit here and say, "Oh, I'm not on either side."
1620	RUBIO	I will be on a side.
1621	RUBIO	I will be on Israel's side every single day because they are the only proAmerican, free enterprise democracy in the entire Middle East.

1623	BLITZER	Mr. Trump?
1624	TRUMP	I'm a negotiator.
1625	TRUMP	I've done very well over the years through negotiation.
1626	TRUMP	It's very important that we do that.
1627	TRUMP	In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator.
1628	TRUMP	I watched him melt down and I'll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen.
1629	TRUMP	He's not going down  excuse me...
1630	RUBIO	He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.
1631	TRUMP	... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie.
1632	TRUMP	OK?
1633	RUBIO	The Palestinians are not a real estate deal, Donald.
1634	TRUMP	OK, no, no, no  a deal is a deal.
1635	TRUMP	Let me tell you that.
1636	TRUMP	I learned a long time ago.
1637	RUBIO	A deal is not a deal when you're dealing with terrorists.
1638	RUBIO	Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?
1639	TRUMP	You are not a negotiator.

1649	BLITZER	...
1650	BLITZER	Senator.
1651	TRUMP	He will never be able to do it.
1652	TRUMP	I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this.
1653	TRUMP	Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.
1654	BLITZER	Let's move on to talk about North Korea.
1655	BLITZER	You raised it, Governor Kasich.
1656	BLITZER	The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its sallies, the commander of American forces in South Korea said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened.
1657	BLITZER	You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.
1658	BLITZER	Let's be clear.
1659	BLITZER	Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?
1660	KASICH	When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change.
1661	KASICH	That's what it means.
1662	KASICH	Even though there's so much chaos in North Korea right now, there's a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government.
1663	KASICH	But, look, here's what I think we ought to do  like, immediately.
1664	KASICH	And, we've been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don't know, 15 years.
1665	KASICH	We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so they're not selling this material, or this technology, or giving it to someone else.
1666	KASICH	Secondly, the same goes with the aircraft.
1667	KASICH	Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don't have the toughest sanctions on North Korea.
1668	KASICH	We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology.
1669	KASICH	And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology.
1670	KASICH	Because we're now starting to take a firm position.
1671	KASICH	We have the attention of the Chinese.
1672	KASICH	The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.
1673	KASICH	But, when I say regime change, I don't have to talk exactly what that means.
1674	KASICH	Look, I've been involved in national security for a long time.
1675	KASICH	You don't have to spell everything out, but what I'm telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese.
1676	KASICH	And, what we're doing is beginning to work against them.
1677	KASICH	They are the key to being able to settle this situation.
1678	BLITZER	I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important.
1679	BLITZER	There are a million North Korean troops North of the DMZ...
1680	KASICH	...
1681	KASICH	I'm very well aware of that.
1682	BLITZER	A million South Korean troops, 28,000 U.S. troops along the DMZ, right in between.
1683	BLITZER	Would you risk war for a regime change?
1684	KASICH	Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening.
1685	KASICH	What the situation was.
1686	KASICH	But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability?
1687	KASICH	Because, I'll tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road we're going to face this sooner or later.
1688	KASICH	But, in the meantime, I'm also aware of the fact that there's 10 million people living in Seoul.
1689	KASICH	So, you don't just run around making charges.
1690	KASICH	I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea.
1691	KASICH	Now, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear.
1692	KASICH	We have to be firm, and we've got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic...
1693	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1694	KASICH	...ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.
1695	BLITZER	Mr. Trump.
1696	TRUMP	One thing I'd like to add to what the Governor's saying, I think that we are now in a position  are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it's going to be $21 trillion dollars.
1697	TRUMP	We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.
1698	TRUMP	You order televisions, you order almost anything, you're getting it from these countries.
1699	TRUMP	Whether it's a MercedesBenz, or whether it's an air conditioning unit.
1700	TRUMP	They're coming out of these countries.
1701	TRUMP	They are making a fortune.
1702	TRUMP	Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia.
1703	TRUMP	Before the oil went down, now they're making less, but they're making plenty.
1704	TRUMP	They were making $1 billion dollars a day.
1705	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1706	TRUMP	We defend all of these countries for peanuts.
1707	TRUMP	You talk about budgets.
1708	TRUMP	We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.
1709	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1710	KASICH	Hey, Wolf, Wolf...
1711	BLITZER	Dr. Carson.
1712	KASICH	Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this.
1713	KASICH	Look, we're all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more.
1714	KASICH	We're all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job.
1715	KASICH	There is no question about it.
1716	KASICH	But, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military.
1717	KASICH	Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense.
1718	KASICH	We need to rebuild our defenses,
1719	KASICH	But, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building.
1720	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1721	KASICH	We can't have a weapon system take 22 and a half years.
1722	KASICH	We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...
1723	BLITZER	...
1724	BLITZER	Thank you...
1725	KASICH	... these resources into strengthening the military.
1726	KASICH	So, we can do it all...
1727	BLITZER	Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea?
1728	CARSON	OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don't get time.
1729	CARSON	I'm going to whine because I didn't get asked about taxes, I didn't get asked about Israel.
1730	CARSON	Hugh, you said you're going to be fair to everybody, you didn't ask me about taxes.
1731	CARSON	I had something to say about that.
1732	CARSON	Now...
1733	BLITZER	Go ahead.
1734	BLITZER	This is your moment.
1735	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1736	CARSON	OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong.
1737	CARSON	You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings.
1738	CARSON	And then they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the whole year.
1739	CARSON	And they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the next year and the next year.
1740	CARSON	They didn't find anything and they won't find anything because I'm a very honest person.
1741	CARSON	But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.
1742	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1743	CARSON	And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people.
1744	CARSON	I couldn't find a single one who didn't think that we had turned our backs on Israel.
1745	CARSON	You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel.
1746	CARSON	It doesn't mean that we can't be fair to other people.
1747	CARSON	We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it's like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.
1748	CARSON	And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength.
1749	CARSON	And I think we have to present strength to him.
1750	CARSON	We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea.
1751	CARSON	We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal HighAltitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well.
1752	CARSON	And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have longrange missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities.
1753	CARSON	We need to be able to defend ourselves.
1754	CARSON	And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.

1756	BLITZER	Thank you.
1757	BLITZER	Thank you.
1758	BLITZER	We're going to continue with national security.
1759	BLITZER	Go ahead, Hugh.
1760	HEWITT	Thank you, Wolf.
1761	HEWITT	Mr. Trump, we are less than 24 hours away from a ceasefire in Syria that has been brokered between the U.S. and Russia.
1762	HEWITT	Do you support this ceasefire?
1763	TRUMP	I really don't because it not working and the countries aren't agreeing to it and the rebels aren't agreeing and Syria is not agreeing.
1764	TRUMP	So It's a meaningless ceasefire.
1765	TRUMP	I love the idea of a ceasefire.
1766	TRUMP	I love the idea of  with a total cessation.
1767	TRUMP	But it's not working, as you know very well.
1768	TRUMP	It's not working.
1769	TRUMP	If  we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.
1770	TRUMP	So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.
1771	HEWITT	Senator Cruz, your opinion on the ceasefire.
1772	CRUZ	Well look.
1773	CRUZ	We're certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but there's reason to be highly skeptical.
1774	CRUZ	Russia has enhanced its position because of Obama's weakness in the Middle East, weakness in Syria.
1775	CRUZ	And you know, as we're headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.
1776	CRUZ	One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
1777	CRUZ	So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the ObamaClinton policy of toppling the government in Libya.
1778	CRUZ	That was a disaster.
1779	CRUZ	It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.
1780	CRUZ	Another example is John Kerry.
1781	CRUZ	John Kerry  Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State.
1782	CRUZ	I voted against him.
1783	CRUZ	And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check.
1784	CRUZ	And John Kerry has been the most antiIsrael secretary of State this country has ever seen.
1785	CRUZ	His diplomacy has been a disaster.
1786	CRUZ	And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we're not in a strong position to win the general election.
1787	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1788	HEWITT	A response, Mr. Trump, then Mr. Rubio.
1789	TRUMP	Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest.
1790	TRUMP	I think they both liked me very much.
1791	TRUMP	But the fact is that ...
1792	CRUZ	But you called for Bush to be impeached.
1793	TRUMP	Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that's concerned.
1794	TRUMP	You know it and so do I.
1795	CRUZ	But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.
1796	TRUMP	Be honest.
1797	TRUMP	Be honest.
1798	TRUMP	No, this was before.
1799	TRUMP	The check came early.
1800	TRUMP	But let me just tell you, Syria, he's saying that I was in favor of Syria.
1801	TRUMP	He said I was in favor of Libya?
1802	TRUMP	I never discussed that subject.
1803	TRUMP	I was in favor of Libya?
1804	TRUMP	We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.
1805	TRUMP	If these politicians went to the beach and didn't do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we'd be  at least they killed terrorists, all right?
1806	TRUMP	And I'm not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don't know what we're getting.
1807	TRUMP	You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil.
1808	TRUMP	As we speak, it's a total mess.
1809	TRUMP	We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.
1810	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1811	HEWITT	Senator Rubio.
1812	RUBIO	Yes, a couple of points.
1813	RUBIO	Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn't topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi.
1814	RUBIO	The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?
1815	RUBIO	And I argued if it takes a long time, you're going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum.
1816	RUBIO	And that's what happened.
1817	RUBIO	That's where the term "lead from behind" came.
1818	RUBIO	And that's the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.
1819	RUBIO	On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn't appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department.
1820	RUBIO	And she was absolutely horrible.
1821	RUBIO	I couldn't imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze.
1822	SYSTEM	[ laughter amd applause ]
1823	RUBIO	And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we're asking to be commanderinchief.
1824	RUBIO	Donald is asking to be commanderinchief.
1825	RUBIO	And he's saying these guys need to do more.
1826	RUBIO	South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort.
1827	RUBIO	And Japan contributes as well.
1828	RUBIO	And here's why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.
1829	RUBIO	They can do that very quickly.
1830	RUBIO	And that's what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can't walk away from our AsiaPacific defense status.
1831	HEWITT	Mr. Trump.
1832	TRUMP	I never said walk away.
1833	TRUMP	I wouldn't want to walk away.
1834	TRUMP	I want them to pay us much more money.
1835	TRUMP	We cannot afford to subsidize...
1836	RUBIO	How much?
1837	TRUMP	A lot.
1838	TRUMP	I'll negotiate a lot more money than you'll ever get.
1839	TRUMP	As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.
1840	TRUMP	It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it's a disaster for Israel.
1841	TRUMP	I'm no fan of John Kerry.
1842	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1843	BLITZER	Hold on, hold on, Governor.
1844	BLITZER	Senator Cruz.
1845	CRUZ	You know, it's interesting, Donald just said that he never came out in favor of toppling Gadhafi in Libya.
1846	CRUZ	Well, he stated that in an interview that will be on our Web site, tedcruz.org.
1847	CRUZ	You can see and hear the exact words from Donald's mouth.
1848	CRUZ	And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.
1849	CRUZ	With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry's foreign policy has been a disaster for decades.
1850	CRUZ	That's why I voted against him when he came up.
1851	CRUZ	And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.
1852	CRUZ	And I'll give one more example on Israel.
1853	CRUZ	When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?
1854	CRUZ	The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London.
1855	CRUZ	Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.
1856	CRUZ	During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald?
1857	CRUZ	If this is something he cares about, why has he supported antiIsrael politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?
1858	CRUZ	If you care about Israel, you don't write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel.
1859	CRUZ	Instead you stand and support the national security of America and the alliance with Israel.

1890	KASICH	There's something  I want to  I want to point out something here today that is  it's so critically important  about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous, feckless job here in foreign policy.
1891	KASICH	First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago.
1892	KASICH	They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are in, and they're sitting in the catbird seat.
1893	KASICH	We should have been helping them.
1894	KASICH	I'm thankful that the aid trucks are finally getting into Syria.
1895	KASICH	But the fact is, had we had acted, we would have solved that problem.
1896	KASICH	Now, let's talk about Libya.
1897	KASICH	Libya didn't go down because there was some people revolution.
1898	KASICH	Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gadhafi.
1899	KASICH	They undermined him, and now they have created a cesspool in Libya.
1900	KASICH	And let me just say to you  we have ISIS beginning get  get a foothold in Libya.
1901	KASICH	We're gonna have to deal with it.
1902	KASICH	There are not many major cities in Libya.
1903	KASICH	They're on the coast, which  mostly, it's desert, but it's a problem.
1904	KASICH	Then we have ISIS in  in Syria, and we have ISIS in Iraq.
1905	KASICH	Because this administration has not had a strong and firm foreign policy, we are going to inherit  one of us here is going to inherit a total mess...
1906	BLITZER	All right...
1907	KASICH	... and we're going to have to work our way out of it, including...
1908	BLITZER	Let's continue.
1909	KASICH	... the need to arm the Ukrainians.

1927	CRUZ	He said, for example, seven months ago  this is Donald speaking, quote  "I, Donald Trump, was a member of the establishment."
1928	CRUZ	There's a reason Harry Reid thinks he's the best Republican up here.

1931	CRUZ	...whereas Ted Cruz is not malleable.
1932	CRUZ	And every time anyone points at Donald's actual record...
1933	BLITZER	Thank you.
1934	CRUZ	... what he said on national television, Donald yells "liar."
1935	CRUZ	Let me tell you something  falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie...

1943	TRUMP	And I thought it was disgraceful.
1944	TRUMP	And got a lot of votes because of that  a lot of votes.
1945	TRUMP	Took them away from Ben Carson.

1949	TRUMP	I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, "Voter Violation," and then it graded you...

1952	TRUMP	I watched that fraudulent document, and I said it's the worst thing I've ever seen in politics.

2032	CARSON	My name was mentioned.
2033	BLITZER	I want to talk  I want to talk about ISIS right now, and the federal government  how much best to keep Americans safe from ISIS.
2034	BLITZER	There's a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government.
2035	BLITZER	The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks.
2036	BLITZER	Apple has refused, saying it would compromise the security of all of its customers.
2037	BLITZER	And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judge's order.
2038	BLITZER	Dana Bash, pick up the questioning.
2039	BASH	Senator Rubio, you say it's complicated, and that, quote, "Apple isn't necessarily wrong to refuse the court order."
2040	BASH	Why shouldn't investigators have everything at their disposal?
2041	RUBIO	No, in fact what I have said is the only thing  the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago  the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer.
2042	RUBIO	Apple initially came out saying, "We're being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device."
2043	RUBIO	That is not accurate.
2044	RUBIO	The only thing they're being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self destruct mode that's in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.
2045	RUBIO	And I think they should comply with that.
2046	RUBIO	If that's all they're asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.
2047	BASH	So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue Apple is not necessarily wrong here.
2048	RUBIO	Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.
2049	BASH	But just to be clear  just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?
2050	RUBIO	To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?
2051	BASH	Correct.
2052	RUBIO	Absolutely.
2053	RUBIO	That Apple phone didn't even belong to the killer.
2054	RUBIO	It belonged to the killer's employer who have agreed to allow him to try to do this.
2055	RUBIO	That is all they're asking them to do is to disable the selfdestruct mode or the autoerase mode on one phone in the entire world.
2056	RUBIO	But Apple doesn't want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.
2057	RUBIO	Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.
2058	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
2059	BASH	Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America.
2060	BASH	Where do you stand national security or personal privacy?
2061	CRUZ	Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question.
2062	CRUZ	His answer, he was on both sides of the fence.
2063	CRUZ	He's now agreeing with me.
2064	CRUZ	And so I'm glad.
2065	CRUZ	What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order.
2066	CRUZ	Why?
2067	CRUZ	Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause.
2068	CRUZ	In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone's cell phone.
2069	CRUZ	If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.
2070	CRUZ	I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question.
2071	CRUZ	But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, emailed.
2072	CRUZ	And absolutely, Apple doesn't have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation.
2073	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
2074	BASH	Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America.
2075	BASH	What do you think?
2076	CARSON	I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.
2077	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
2078	CARSON	You know, we have the  we have a Constitution.
2079	CARSON	We have a Fourth Amendment.
2080	CARSON	It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure.
2081	CARSON	But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole.
2082	CARSON	And that's why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.
2083	CARSON	So absolutely, I would  I would expect Apple to comply with the court order.
2084	CARSON	If they don't comply with that, you're encouraging chaos in our system.
2085	BASH	Mr. Trump...
2086	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
2087	KASICH	I want to weigh in on this please.
2088	KASICH	I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple.
2089	KASICH	You know what the problem is?
2090	KASICH	Where's the president been?
2091	KASICH	You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out.
2092	KASICH	You don't litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.
2093	KASICH	The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces.
2094	KASICH	And then you know what you do when you're the president?
2095	KASICH	You lock the door and you say you're not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans.
2096	KASICH	This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.
2097	KASICH	And I'll tell you, that's why you want a governor.
2098	KASICH	I do this all the time.
2099	KASICH	And we reach agreements all the time.
2100	KASICH	Because as an executive, you've got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.
2101	ARRARÁS	Thank you, Governor.
2102	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
2103	KASICH	Thank you.
2104	ARRARÁS	Mr. Trump, you have been very vocal about securing the Mexican border, but ISIS has called upon its supporters to conduct attacks on our neighbor to the North, Canada.
2105	ARRARÁS	As a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat.
2106	ARRARÁS	You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada.
2107	ARRARÁS	When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism, why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesn't?
2108	ARRARÁS	Isn't that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?
2109	TRUMP	First of all, you're talking about a border that's many, many times longer.
2110	TRUMP	You're talking about a massive border.
2111	TRUMP	We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts  you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.
2112	TRUMP	You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in.
2113	TRUMP	And, you wouldn't think this beautiful place  it's beautiful.
2114	TRUMP	With the trees and the roads, and the countryside.
2115	TRUMP	Their biggest problem is heroin, and it's such a shame to see it.
2116	TRUMP	They're pouring in from the Southern border, so I'm talking about great security.
2117	TRUMP	I'm talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I'll build it on time, on budget.
2118	TRUMP	It'll be a very high wall, a great wall.
2119	TRUMP	It's going to be built, it's going to be built.
2120	TRUMP	It's going to be paid for by Canada, by the way  maybe I'll get Canada to pay?
2121	TRUMP	Got to be paid for by Mexico.
2122	TRUMP	The problem with Canada, you're talking about a massively long piece.
2123	TRUMP	You're talking about a border that would be about four times longer.
2124	TRUMP	It would be very, very hard to do, and we  it is not our biggest problem.
2125	TRUMP	I don't care what anyone says.
2126	TRUMP	It is not our big problem.
2127	TRUMP	Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in.
2128	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
2129	ARRARÁS	I want to talk to you, Senator Rubio, about Puerto Rico.
2130	ARRARÁS	As you know, Puerto Rico's in the midst of financial collapse, unable to pay it's debt of $72 billion dollars.
2131	ARRARÁS	Puerto Rico is asking for bankruptcy protection which would give Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans, which are U.S. citizens, you know that  the tools to restructure the debt.
2132	ARRARÁS	That is the same debt the other 50 states have.
2133	ARRARÁS	You oppose granting Puerto Rico that bankruptcy protection.
2134	ARRARÁS	You say that it is only a last resort measure, but the government of Puerto Rico has said that bankruptcy is it's last resort.
2135	ARRARÁS	That that's where they are now.
2136	ARRARÁS	How do you explain this very strong stance to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans that vote across the U.S. , and particularly in your state of Florida?
2137	RUBIO	Sure, because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating, or you're going to be bankrupt again.
2138	RUBIO	And, the problem with Puerto Rico is it's economy is not growing.
2139	RUBIO	It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.
2140	RUBIO	They're coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it's too expensive to do business there.
2141	RUBIO	The tax rate is too high.
2142	RUBIO	The government regulations are too extensive.
2143	RUBIO	This year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next.
2144	RUBIO	So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again.
2145	RUBIO	If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments.
2146	RUBIO	So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.
2147	RUBIO	They're United States citizens, they're obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust.
2148	RUBIO	And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job.
2149	RUBIO	Their previous governor, Louis Fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to...
2150	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]

2163	CARSON	Think about that.
2164	CARSON	Secondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands.
2165	CARSON	These hands by the grace of God have saved many lives and healed many families.

2173	KASICH	It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations.
2174	KASICH	I've done it in Washington, I've done it in Ohio, and I can go back to Washington and do it again.
2175	KASICH	But I hope you also noticed tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience, not just a few years, but a lot of years in working with some of the great, great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together.
2176	KASICH	I hope you all think about giving me your vote.

2186	RUBIO	And we have an incredible decision to make, not just about the direction of America, but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement.
2187	RUBIO	The time for games is over.
2188	RUBIO	I know you've had a lot of choices to make, but now it's time to narrow it down.
2189	RUBIO	And I'm asking you to get behind me, go on our Web site and join you our effort, marcorubio.com, so we can bring an end to this silliness, this looniness, and once again reembrace all the things that made America and the Republican Party the bearer of the conservative movement in this country.
