An article on Facebook published in February 14 might think otherwise. \"This planet may be able to support up to half a billion people who can live a sustainable life in relative comfort,\" reads Clinton's picture. \"The human population must be significantly reduced, as soon as possible to reduce further environmental damage.\" This article, which attributes the quote to \"United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,\" was highlighted as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We couldn't find a reliable source to confirm that Clinton said so. Other web sites, such as Alex Jones Infowars and AZ Quotes, among others, reported on a similar quotation. But even those sites recognized someone else, not Clinton, as a speaker. (though they didn't get it right) The quotation was previously attributed to Eric Bianca, an evolutionary economist who holds the post of Professor of Zoology at the University of Texas in Austin. On June 24, 2011, an article on Al Gore and control of the population describes Infowars Bianca as \"a very prominent defender of the radical control of the human population\" and Bianca as a source of this quote. The Bianca article, \"What no one wants to hear, but everyone needs to know,\" guesses that the Earth is ready to fall into another population. However, his article does not contain what Infowars and others claim. At the same time, Clinton has already addressed population growth. On 9 February 1999, when she was the First Lady, she spoke about Cairo in The Hague. It discussed, inter alia, reproductive health care and family planning. She said: \"For the first time, the world has agreed that smaller families and slow population growth arise by choice and opportunity, not by control and coercion.\" More recently, Bendy Erwin, daughter of the Crocodile Hunter Steve Erwin, an electronic newspaper of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2013, was criticized for revising an article that she wrote in which she ignored Erwin &apos; s view that increasing population posed the greatest threat to nature conservation. As for the quote made in Facebook, we evaluate it with pants on fire.
