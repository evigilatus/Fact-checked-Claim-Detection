The Mim is a copy of a false allegation circulated in Canada years ago. \"Illicit refugees get 3,874/mo. Within the framework of the federal assistance programme. Our SS checks are about $1,200/m,\" said Mimi posted on Facebook on October 29th and so far sharing over 80,000 times. This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Several elements of the refugee claim are inaccurate or unsupported. The amount relating to the verification of social security is closer to the truth. \"Illicit refugees get 3,874/mo. Under the federal assistance programme, one of the most important things not related to the claim is its designation of refugees as \"illegal.\" The refugees are not here illegally. They enter the country legally under refugee status and must apply for permanent legal status one year after their arrival. The indication that they do not enjoy a legal status is unfounded. Refugees come to the United States because they flee wars or persecution in their home countries. On arrival, many do not speak English and are not familiar with the culture and standards of the United States. The United States is helping them to become socially and economically self-sufficient. Such aid is limited in time. The United States Department of Health and Human Services, which has an agency responsible for the resettlement of refugees, did not provide an estimate of the number of refugees received monthly under United States programmes. Cash and medical assistance to refugees is available to eligible refugees for up to eight months from their arrival in the United States. In September 2017, with regard to a story about the costs of resettlement of refugees, a spokesman for the Bolivian Ministry of Public Health, Vakt, said that the volume and type of federal assistance provided to refugees during their eligibility period might vary considerably. Cash and medical assistance are dealt with at the state level, and the amounts of State cost-sharing vary greatly from state to state, the spokesman for HHS Victoria A. Palmer then told us. A spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs, Politifakt, reported that the Department was providing a reception and placement grant to nine national resettlement agencies to cover part of the primary reception services, basic services and physical goods to be provided by resettlement agencies to refugees arriving during the first 30 to 90 days in the United States. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 11 January 2021, in fiscal year 2018, each grant totalled $2,125 per refugee, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This includes assistance with respect to rent, furniture, essential clothing and food, as well as funding for the Associated Resettlement Agency to provide case management services, cultural guidance, and linking refugees to employment services and English language classes, among others, as mentioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The specific figure of US$ 3,874 reflects an announcement in Facebook in 2017 falsely claiming that this is the amount of the \"illegal\" refugee in Canada received monthly from the \"Federal Assistance Program.\" In addition to misclassifying refugees as \"illegal,\" this article has had several other shortcomings. For example, the amount paid to a refugee was not one, but to a family of five; the amount was not US$ 3,874 and was not a recurrent monthly payment. This amount included some regular monthly housing, food and transport benefits, but also included one-time \"start\" and pinch benefits. Snoppes was found in 2017. More than a decade ago, the Canadian Government dismantled a copy of a false comparison of payments to refugees and retirees. However, this false information still exists and has shifted from the e-mail chain to social media. In December 2015, the editor-general of The Toronto Star Canada wrote: \"refugees to Canada receive no more financial assistance from the federal government than Canadian retirees. Unfortunately, the myth they do is rooted in an error in Toronto Star's letter to the editor published in 2004. The editor wrote that the error was \"to become a complete circle\" - because it was republished in 2015 in another letter to the editor. \"Our special forces checks are about $1,200/Mo.\" The beneficiaries of social security include pensioners and persons with disabilities. In 2018, the average social security disability benefit was $1,200 per month, and the average retirement benefit in 2018 was $1,422, as stated by Darren Lutz, spokesman for the Department of Social Security. Our Facebook article says, \"Illicit refugees get 3,874. Within the framework of the federal assistance programme. Our SS checks are about $1,200 / m.\" The refugees are not in the United States illegally. The value of US$ 3,874 is due to a false claim in Canada. The United States Department of Health and Human Services, which is in charge of the resettlement of refugees, did not provide an estimate of the number of refugees assisted monthly, but a spokesman for the Ministry previously told us that the number could vary significantly. On average, beneficiaries of social security, such as retirees, receive more than $1,400 per month. The Facebook article contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong.
