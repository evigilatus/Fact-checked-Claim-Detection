It was flagged by Facebook users as potentially fake as part of the social media website\u2019s efforts to combat fake news.\nThe post said Snowden told the Moscow Tribune that instead of killing the al-Qaida leader in May 2011, the United States set him up with a cushy retirement fund through the CIA payroll. As of 2013, it said, bin Laden is living with \"five of his wives and many children\" collecting more than $100,000 a month via a Nassau bank account.\n\"Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA\u2019s most efficient operatives for a long time,\" Snowden is allegedly quoted as saying. \"What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody\u2019s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.\"\nWe could find no evidence that Snowden, who leaked classified information about the federal government\u2019s surveillance programs, has ever said such a thing about bin Laden. Snowden fled to Moscow to avoid espionage charges and has since given several interviews, but this post is fake.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersions of the story have appeared on many other websites over the last several months. But it originated on WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a parody website we\u2019ve identified on our list of dubious news sources, way back on Aug. 25, 2015.\nThe site\u2019s disclaimer noted that \"WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website \u2014 even those based on real people \u2014 are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.\"\nThe site\u2019s stories are fabricated. As far as we can tell, the Moscow Tribune is not even a real media outlet, although there are Twitter and Facebook accounts under that name that do share news stories (the paper in Moscow, Idaho, is called the Daily News).\nThe version of the post on AntiNews.in also cited a Dec. 31, 2015, post on a site called NaijaPicks.com, which said it worked \"to keep you informed on what's going on in Nigeria, Africa and the world over.\" The post also included real quotes from Snowden reported in The Guardian newspaper in 2013. \u00a0\nWe attempted to reach AntiNews.in through its online contact form, the only available method of reaching the site, but did not receive a response.\nWe rate this statement Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-06-12 20:32:59 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Edward Snowden: Osama bin Laden is still alive living in the Bahamas\"    AntiNews.in website   in a headline Saturday, May 13, 2017 2017-05-13    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03220"}
