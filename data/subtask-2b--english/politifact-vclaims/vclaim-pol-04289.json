Borjas, a labor economist specializing in immigration issues and professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the $700 billion increase in GDP would be almost entirely captured by new immigrants migrating to America.\n\"Practically all of that increase in GDP would need to be paid to the immigrants as wages and salaries. They are not going to work for free,\" Borjas said.\nWhat really matters, Borjas said, is the \"immigration surplus\" \u2014 which is the benefit accruing to the native-born population. About 98 percent of the increase in GDP due to immigration goes to immigrant salaries, and about 2 percent goes to natives already living in the United States, Borjas estimates.\n\"Then the question becomes: who did Hillary refer to when she said \u2018our economy\u2019? I take it, in the context of a political speech, that means us \u2014 the current population of the United States that is voting in November,\" Borjas said. \"I don\u2019t think she meant the future immigrants who have yet to arrive. And, as a result, I would say the statement is false.\"\nOn the flip side, immigration reform would allow people currently living in the United States illegally additional opportunities for advancement, said David Dyssegaard Kallick, a senior fellow and director of the Immigration Research Initiative at Fiscal Policy Institute.\nA pathway to citizenship would mean currently undocumented immigrants would have greater potential for advancement and result in more productive employees, Kallick said. \"Making sure workers can\u2019t be taken advantage of by employers wouldn\u2019t hurt, either, pushing businesses to compete based on higher productivity rather than evasion of the law,\" he said.\nLastly, any GDP increase would not be automatic. The CBO projected it would take 10 years to increase the GDP by $700 billion. And while $700 billion sounds like a lot, it would remain a tiny fraction of the country\u2019s GDP, which today is nearing $18 trillion.\nOur ruling\nClinton said immigration legislation \"will add $700 billion to our economy.\"\nClinton\u2019s statement stems from 2013 estimates of the stalled \"Gang of Eight\" bill. But that bill couldn't pass, and there's no telling what a future version might look like or mean for the U.S. economy.\nA Congressional Budget Office report found that if the 2013 bill was enacted, gross domestic product would increase by 3.3 percent in 2023, or roughly $700 billion. Clinton omitted that timeframe in her statement. The report acknowledges that determining economic impact of immigration policies is complex and can be \"uncertain.\"\nWhile immigration scholars say the $700 billion estimate is a reasonable estimate, some say increases in GDP would mostly go toward future immigrants, not the current population.\nClinton\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ab010bac-02c2-4be5-a5ac-adfa943e1569", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04289"}
