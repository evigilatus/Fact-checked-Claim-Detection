To do so is to compare the amount paid by factory owners and Taco Bell workers in government income taxes. The winner of the November 4, 2014 elections will succeed in retiring from the Republic Fund of Lac Tom Petri, who was first elected in the East Central Wisconsin seat in 1979. In an interview with Harris on 2 September 2014, John \"Sly\" Sylvester, host of a liberal radio talk show in Madison, said the government. The Scott Walker Administration provided \"firm welfare\" and the legislature \"was rather rubbery.\" Harris, the Executive Director of the Winnebago Province, referred to the 2011-2013 Walker State budget in giving this response: \"Well, even in Walker's first budget, Mr. Grotman paid through tax exemptions for industrialization and agriculture,\" Harris said. \"He did so on the last day of the Joint Finance Committee, when there was really no time for anyone to check what was happening. They basically passed credit for all of this except the elimination of income tax on manufacturers and agricultural operations.\" And he went, \"And as you know, it's not fair to have someone who owns a factory that produces millions of income. But that's exactly what Glenn Grothman went through, and it's gradually.\" This is an eye opening. Did Grootman pay through credits that, over time, would enable the owner of the factory who earns millions to pay the State income tax less than the workers who earn the minimum wage? In June 2011, Grotman helped to lead efforts to add tax exemptions on manufacturing and agriculture to the State budget in Walker. Credits apply to the productive income of businesses, not to income such as royalties and investments. This measure gave companies assessed as industrial or agricultural industries for property tax purposes a dollar-dollar credit for income from manufacturing or agricultural production in the Tax Bill 2013. The credit, which began in 2013, rises annually to 7.5 per cent in 2016. For example, organized businesses such as limited liability companies - where the owner pays the company tax as a personal income tax - can reduce the State income tax rate from 7.75 per cent to 0.25 per cent or less. In other words, in 2016, credit of 7.5 per cent could remove a significant share of the owner &apos; s tax liability. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021, the Legislative Tax Office estimates that credits will be $359.7 million less than State tax revenues over the first five years and $128.7 million less per year once they are fully operational in 2016. The Harris value, previously exercised as a public accountant and certified lawyer, provided figures on the State &apos; s income tax rates and tax exemptions for 2016. These figures support his claim that the credits will wipe out all income tax obligations incurred by the owner of the plant - on the production income of the plant only - for the first $2.4 million in production income. We consulted with two professors in accounting: Wisconsin-Whitewater University, William Rabbie, whose specialties include government taxation; and Stacey LaPlant, Accounting Chair at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Business School. They agreed that a full-time worker should have a minimum wage ($7.25 per hour for 2,000 hours per year) and an exemption ($700) of approximately $170 in government income tax. They also agreed that the owner of the plant would owe no more production income until he earned approximately $2.6 million in production revenue - a figure even higher than Harris mentioned. However, teachers added some warnings according to which the owner could pay the State income tax more than the Taco Bell worker. \"Quantified production income\" is a specific type of business income. Not all net income from the plant is necessarily eligible for tax exemptions, which means that the owner will pay additional taxes. Once the owner &apos; s production income exceeds approximately $2.6 million, he will pay an income tax larger than that of Taco Bell. It should be noted, however, that the owner &apos; s rate at this level of income will be only 0.15 per cent (7.65 per cent - 7.5 per cent credit), well below the 4 per cent rate paid by Taco Bell. Our assessment, Harris, said that Grothman was paid through tax exemptions even when they were gradually introduced \"a person who owns a factory that produces millions of income\" would pay \"less tax than his nephew if he worked full-time in Taco Bell for the minimum wage.\" As soon as Grootman &apos; s credits became full-scale, in 2016, some manufacturers who earned up to $2.5 million in production income from the factory would pay less in government income tax for that productive income than full-time workers who received the minimum wage. However, manufacturers who earn more than this amount of production income will pay more than the minimum wage, and more than any other income that does not come from production. The statement is precise, but it needs to be clarified, our definition of reality often. For comments on this story, go to the Milwauke Journal Sentinel page. This item was changed on 15 September 2014 to show that the tax rate on production revenues of approximately US$ 2.6 million was actually 0.15 per cent.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07210"}
