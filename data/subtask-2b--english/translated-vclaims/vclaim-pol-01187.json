In the announcement, the storyteller promised: \"Bill will put a stop to tax increases to keep families in their homes,\" as the phrase \"PROPERTY TAX FREEZE\" appears on the screen. Richard J. and Richard M. The outgoing Mayor Ram Emmanuel did the same thing sometimes. But what the Daly Declaration failed to explain is that it promises only to freeze part of the various real estate taxes that make up a typical bill, not everything. First, it is important to understand how property tax bills collapse. In Chicago, there are charges funded by the city government and separate taxes financed by schools, public parks, Cook County government, the water reclamation area of the capital, and a handful of other public agencies. Last year, only about 25 per cent of the Chicago Model Property Tax Act covered the city government, according to the Cook County Clerk &apos; s Office. Therefore, keeping the line in the city tax, as Dale suggests in his announcement, may slow down the growth of tax bills for real estate owners in the city but will not contain them. In contrast, school taxes accounted for more than half of Chicago tax bills in 2017. If elected mayor, Bill Daley will have the power to appoint the Board of Education and senior school officials, and will effectively control the city's educational system. The same applies to the province of Chicago Park, whose fees accounted for about 5 per cent of the Model Law in 2017. We asked the spokesman for Dale Peter Cunningham whether the candidate's pledge to freeze extended to sister city agencies under the mayor's thumb. In an e-mail, Cunningham said that he had not done so, although he stressed that \"Dale would put great pressure on other tax authorities to be effective and to look for alternatives, including new government funding - especially for schools.\" Kingham acted as spokesperson for public schools in Chicago when he was Daley's brother, Richard M. Dahli, mayor. Property taxes rose annually even when the city government took over. This does not mean that it would be politically or financially prudent to freeze the share of schools in property tax. The province faces chronic financial problems and often finds it difficult to cover its expenses even after the annual property tax has been raised to the amount permitted under State law. But that suggests that the Daley announcement is skiing about the exact details of how to calculate the property tax bills in Chicago. In 2017, under the Tax Act 2017, \"taxes will be raised on people who receive less than $75,000 in 2021 and every two years thereafter until 2027.\" By Louis Jacobson on February 5, 2021, proposals such as those of Daly also ignore the other big question raised by the prospect of a property tax freeze: how to arrive at revenues to cover the rising projected costs, especially for pensions. Former mayors have been able to maintain fixed real estate taxes through the use of a number of financial evasions, including underfunded pensions. In the past, what was a much smaller problem with the city's baseline has \"crashed\" over the years, as Amanda Cass, the Associate Director of the State Financial Research Centre at the University of Illinois-Chicago, said, forced the city to make much larger increases to catch up. Cass said that this practice also led the people of Chicago to expect the current level of services provided by the city without increasing real estate taxes. She said: \"The residents did not feel the full cost of the services because pensions were underfunded.\" Richard M. Daley also removed the increases in the property tax through spending earnings from a controversial long-term lease of $1 billion for city parking figures for private investors. It was said that the trade-off in signing distant metre revenue contracts was the ability to invest and develop rental revenues to meet the future needs of the city. By the end of 2010, his last year in office, Richard Daley had spent almost all the revenues. We promised Bill Daley's television announcement that, as mayor, he \"imposed a moratorium on tax increases to keep families at home.\" This allegation is misleading. A spokesman for his campaign told us that his freeze would only apply to taxes that directly finance the city government. This promise does not extend to property taxes on schools, parks and other sister city agencies that are effectively controlled by the mayor, although it constitutes more than half of a draft model law. Daley therefore promises to freeze the city's direct ownership tax - but not all city-level real estate taxes paid by Chicago homeowners. We appreciate Daly's half-perfect statement. The truth is now - the statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or leaves things out of context.
