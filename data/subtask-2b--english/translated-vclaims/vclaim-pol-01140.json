Eighty-six people were killed and 14,000 homes destroyed in November when Fire Camp invaded the North California province of Bot, making it the deadliest and most destructive fire in the history of the state. With better forest management, fires \"never happen,\" Trump confirmed his tweet. The President also reiterated his threat of withholding billions of dollars from federal fire recovery funds. \"Billions of dollars are being sent to California for forest fires that, with sound forest management, will never happen. Unless they put together, which is unlikely, I ordered FEMA not to send any more money. It's a disgraceful situation in life and money!\" We verified a similar allegation in the November Trap tweet and classified it as false: \"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California but forest management is very weak,\" accused Trump. We will review the facts about the cause of the California fires, and assess Trump's recent claim. Our research on firestorms in California is not the result of just one factor. Instead, climate change, forest management and urban crawl all contribute, according to forestry, fire and climate experts. The cleaning of the forest, the setting of the described burns, and the cleaning of the brush can help to mitigate the fires. But the stronger winds in California, the higher temperatures, and the conditions of drought, all attributable to climate change, exacerbate the fires. Also, the fact that more people and power lines are now located in forested areas increases the chances of a hellfire. \"It's a complicated situation. A simple statement about such a subject is almost always wrong, told us Keith Gillis, Professor of Forest Economics and Chairman of the California Forestry and Fire Protection Board, in November. In addition, Tramp &apos; s claim indicates that the State controls most forest management decisions. In fact, California owns only 2% of the state's forest land while the federal government owns more than 60%. The rest are owned by private owners, timber companies and indigenous American tribes. On January 28, 2021 in Facebook blog, bloggers tried to \"close\" the California government's summoning campaign. \u2219 (Gavin Newsom) By Chris Nichols: February 2, 2021, President Brian Rice responded to Trump's tweet about California's professional firefighters in a statement he made on Tuesday on Trump's tweet: \"The President's attempt to blame the only forest fire problems in California for the state's forest management is totally wrong. While forest health can be a contributing factor in large fires, more than 60 per cent of these forests are controlled by the federal government, not California. However, the federal government reduced $2 billion from the US Forest Service even as California spent more on forest management.\" In the meantime, Doug Lamalva, representing the Puteh district where the fire camp destroyed 14,000 houses and killed 86 people in November, said that he shared \"the great President's frustration with the suffocating state regulations imposed by California on suffocating environmental groups\" and the need for more forest management. However, the Congressman added that \"the immediate problem of fire victims is the first need, and the threats to Union funding are not useful and will not solve the long-term regulatory problems of forest management.\" (Democrat government) Gavin Newsome criticized the President's threat on Twitter: \"Mr. President--just yesterday, @OregonGovBroon, (and Washington) @GovInsley, and I sent a letter asking the federal government to work with us to address these unprecedented fires. We've been appointed to office by voters to do things, not to play with life.\" Our President, Governor Trump, claimed that deadly forest fires in California \"will never happen\" with \"better forest management.\" All experts in climate, forestry and fire control rejected a similar assertion from Trump in November, describing it as too simple. Forest management was only one element, while climate change and urban crawling were also major contributors. Once again, Trump put the blame wrong on only one worker. We assess his last claim is wrong, too. We're assessing the allegation wrong. - The statement is not accurate.
