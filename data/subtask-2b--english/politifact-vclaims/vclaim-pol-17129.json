It isn\u2019t.", "text": "At an event in Oshkosh, Wis., President Donald Trump said the country was \"doing great\" in the fight against the coronavirus.\n\"We're coming back and our numbers are better than almost all countries,\" Trump said Aug. 17.\nWhen we asked the White House about the claim, the press office noted that by one measure, the United States is doing well.\nLooking at the percentage of confirmed cases that lead to death, the United States has a rate that\u2019s about half that in Europe and the rest of the world.\u00a0\n\nBut the source the White House cites, Oxford University\u2019s Our World in Data project, says that \"During an outbreak of a pandemic the case fatality rate is a poor measure of the mortality risk of the disease.\"\u00a0\nThere are other ways to track the suffering and reach of the coronavirus and by those, the United States is not doing well.\nMeasured against the size of the population, the United States has the 10th-highest death rate in the world. It\u2019s doing better than the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Chile, but worse than France, Canada and Germany, to pick a few examples.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactoring in population size, the United States has one of the highest rates globally of people who have tested positive \u2014 16,430 per million residents, which is lower than Chile, but higher than any other large country. Put another way, the virus is known to have infected a higher fraction of the population in the U.S. than in many other places.\n\nTrump often says that the United States finds more cases because it tests more than other nations. We\u2019ve rated that claim False and Pants on Fire, depending on how he says it. Testing is a way to measure progress against the coronavirus, but the key indicator of progress is whether the percentage of tests that come back positive declines as more tests are done.\u00a0\nWith a positivity rate of about 7%, the United States ranks in the middle of the pack, doing better than countries such as Mexico and Argentina, but worse than just about every country in Europe, as well as Canada and Australia.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that the United States\u2019 COVID-19 \"numbers are better than almost all countries.\" The White House pointed to one number to back that up \u2014 the number of deaths relative to the number of known cases. But the source it cited said that wasn\u2019t a good measure of the threat of the disease.\nBy other yardsticks, the United States is doing worse than many countries, including many major developed economies.\nIt has a higher death rate in relation to its population, the virus is known to have reached a larger share of the population, and the percentage of tests that come back positive is higher than in many other nations.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17129"}
