You can see that in the Post announcement from Republican Governor Alan Fong's candidate. It's an attack on his democratic competition, Jenna Raimundo, an venture capitalist who was elected secretary of public funds four years ago. The main issue is 38 studios, a video game company that no longer exists, created by Boston Red Sox, former star Kurt Schilling. Before the company went bankrupt, the state gave it a loan guarantee of $75 million. The question of whether the State is obliged to pay the receivables of investors who purchased the bonds remains a hot spot in Rhode Island. With interest, payments will total $112.6 million over 10 years. \"Investers on Wall Street risked, and went to a bust,\" says the Fong Declaration. But Jenna Raimundo wants to use our money to save them. Raimundo's looking for Wall Street, not Main Street. It is well known that Raimundo believes that the State should pay the bearers of \"moral obligation\" bonds and Fong believes that Rhode Island should not. In order to verify these facts, we will focus on whether Wall Street investors have really failed the 38 studio deal. But first, a slight deviation. We have also considered whether it is correct to call Raimundo \"the former Wall Street financier,\" a term that involves a great deal of power, influence and, in the wake of the Great Depression, questionable transactions. The spokesman for Fong Robert Kobe said that the campaign was referring to the first venture capital company to operate at Raimundo, Fleg Ventress, which had an office in central Manhattan. He may not have had a direct office in the New York City financial district, but the phrase \"Wall Street\" refers to the financial services industry in general, and not just companies that are physically located on Wall Street or the southern end of Manhattan,\" said Cobb. The spokesman for Raimundo Nicole Kainer said that the term did not apply because \"Wall Street is investment banks, people who trade shares and bonds. It's not something Jenna did.\" Instead, Raimundo travelled to areas of the country \"unserved\" through capital to find and assist entrepreneurs in establishing companies. We have contacted more than half a dozen of the highest business schools in the United States looking for experts to provide some guidance on this general question. Only one wanted to venture into the view that, unless you were a major player, the accepted definition of \"Wall Street Financer\" was as constant as a genius. Evidence of the second statement - whether \"Wall Street Investors\" ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ He was arrested\" as a result of the 38 studio deal -- much clearer. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job. After the bankruptcy of 38 studios, there was much debate about whether Rhode Island should pay off bonds. Ultimately, in June, it was the General Assembly and the Government. Lincoln Shavi approved a budget of $12.3 million due to 38 studio bondholders this year. It was the second batch of the loan. Last year the State paid an initial amount of $2.5 million when the bonds became payable. In short, bondholders get their money, contrary to what is proposed by the Fong Commercial Declaration. Even if the state's ever gonna back down, the bonds come with insurance from the municipal guarantee company. If the State stops paying, the insurance company will be on the line to pay investors. In an e-mail, Cobb said that \"going to bankruptcy\" was a reference to 38 studios themselves, which had gone bankrupt. He said, \"The drawing on the screen through this line refers specifically to the bankruptcy of 38 studios.\" But the narrator specifically says, \"Wall Street investors risked, and they bankrupted.\" In response to a question about insurance, Cobb said: \"If the state of Rhode Island does not allocate funds to pay for investors, insurance coverage may be paid to investors, but insurance coverage does not operate as collateral. \"So it's true to say that investors have failed, although at some point in the future they may become complete either through government guarantee or insurance coverage,\" he said. \"But both of these potential forms of payment are conditional on other factors.\" Our decision is to leave it to the readers to decide whether Alan Fong is right to call him Jenna Raimundo. But when Fong's TV ad says that \"Investers are Wall Street. ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ It's clear these investors are fine. The State pays its payments on time. Even if Fong says that investors may be bankrupt in the future, that seems very unlikely, thanks to the insurance that came with the sale. We're assessing his description of what happened to Wall Street 38 investors as a mistake.
