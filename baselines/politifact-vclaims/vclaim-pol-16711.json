Trump to aim Ukrainian corruption straight at the heart of the presidential election of 2020,\" said Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \"The president knows this, which is why he has not given this Congress a single email, phone record or document.\"\nThe truth is clear to anyone not deliberately looking away.Instead of fighting corruption the President aimed it at the 2020 presidential election.Today, I answer the call to defend our democracy and the United States Constitution.

At the White House\u2019s direction, several top administration officials also defied subpoenas seeking testimony or documents.\nThe night before European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland was expected to testify, for example, his attorneys received a last-minute call from the State Department informing them that the Trump administration would not allow his testimony.\u00a0\nSondland eventually testified against the White House\u2019s orders and in response to a subpoena, but his recollections in both his private and public testimony were limited because the White House refused to turn over documents and call records.\u00a0\nNine administration officials defied similar subpoenas from the House.\n\"The executive branch cannot be expected to, and will not participate in, this exercise of partisan political theater,\" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\nHouse Democrats elected not to take the issue up in court. Instead, they packaged Trump\u2019s efforts to block cooperation into an article of impeachment alleging obstruction of Congress.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe obstruction of Congress article, which the House approved by a 229-198 margin, charges Trump with \"directing\" the White House and various executive branch agencies \"to defy lawful subpoenas and withhold the production of documents.\"\nWhat documents did Congress get?\nAccording to the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees\u2019 reports, \"not a single document\" was produced by the White House, the vice president\u2019s office, the Office of Management and Budget, the State Department, the Defense Department or the Energy Department.\u00a0\nIn total, those agencies received \"71 specific, individualized requests or demands for records,\" the committees\u2019 reports said.\nThe House did obtain some documents, such as text messages that former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker exchanged with Sondland and other U.S. and Ukrainian diplomats, that were in witnesses\u2019 \"personal possession,\" according to the Judiciary Committee\u2019s report.\nBut multiple witnesses testified to the existence of other key White House documents that Congress never received. These materials included:\n\u2022\u00a0Talking points prepared ahead of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, director for European affairs at the National Security Council.\n\u2022\u00a0Notes taken during Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky by Vindman and by Tim Morrison, the former top Russia expert on the NSC.\n\u2022\u00a0A memo prepared by Vindman that former National Security Adviser John Bolton was expected to present to Trump conveying \"the consensus views from the entire deputies small group\" that \"the security assistance be released.\"\n\u2022\u00a0Call records between Trump and Sondland.\n\u2022\u00a0Notes from NSC legal advisor John Eisenberg detailing his discussions with Vindman about a July 10 meeting with a top Ukrainian official, during which Sondland suggested that investigations could help secure a White House meeting for Zelensky.\n\u2022\u00a0The readout of Trump\u2019s Sept. 25 meeting with Zelensky in New York.\nThe House Intelligence Committee\u2019s Republican minority report does not dispute that Trump\u2019s White House withheld these and other documents. But it notes that Trump made readouts of his April 21 and July 25 phone calls with Zelensky publicly available, calling them \"directly relevant.\"\nHimes spokesman Patrick Malone said the readouts were released in response to public pressure rather than congressional subpoenas. The White House published the July 25 call summary on Sept. 25, days after news of the whistleblower complaint broke and one day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the House impeachment inquiry.\n\"They weren\u2019t released to Congress in response to our requests,\" Malone said. \"They were released to the public.\"\nOur ruling\nHimes said Trump \"has not given this Congress a single email, phone record or document.\"\nThe White House told Congress that it would not cooperate with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, and all evidence suggests that the White House stood by that pledge.\u00a0\nThe White House did, however, release two call readouts. They were not in response to congressional subpoenas as part of the House\u2019s investigation.\u00a0\nWe rate Himes\u2019 statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16711"}
