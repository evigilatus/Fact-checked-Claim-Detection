A new declaration by the Florida Republican Party calls it \"unbelievable\" -- then tells how Christ turned on, well, a lot of things. One of these things is motivation. The Declaration uses passages of Christ's contradictory comments before it concludes, \"This is fickle madness.\" And we decided to put Christ's position on our O-Meter prank to see how it changed over the years. In this case, Christ supported motivation, suggesting that he did not support it and then supported it again. All the time, he commended the incentive to prevent the demobilization of teachers in Florida. In 2009, when he was still Governor of Florida, Christ supported economic stimulus, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The law injected $787 billion into an explosive economy after the 2008 financial crisis. Christ was one of 19 governors wrote by President Barack Obama on 3 February 2009, in support of motivation. \"As supervisors of the economies of our States and regions, we urge Congress to find an immediate solution to all outstanding differences, and you sign the bill when it arrives in your office,\" said the letter. Christ made many other positive comments about motivation, including when he appeared in the rally at Fort Myers on February 10, 2009, with Obama. \"We know it's important to get through a stimulus package,\" said Christ. Christ then retracted that support when he was competing to win the first Republican elections for the United States Senate. During this period, he made his most outstanding comments in an interview on 4 November 2009 with Wolfe Blitzer on CNN. First, Christ Obama criticized his excessive spending. \"You know, unfortunately, the President believes that all we need to do for every problem that comes along is spend more money, and that's just a mistake,\" he said. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 20 January 2021 \"To be honest, enough is enough. I know people understand that. I understand that. And I understand that because I'm the grandson of a Greek immigrant who came to this country with nothing, he really taught me the value of the dollar, because his first job in America, in Altona, my father, was to make sure that he didn't have the money. Christ also tried to reject his previous support for the incentive, saying, \"I did not support it.\" At the time, Politi Fact Fliada valued his statement with pants on fire. But Christ also said that he appreciates that motivation preserves teaching functions. Honestly, Christ was critical at the same time of the stimulus spending while paying tribute to the spending that helped save teachers' jobs. \"Well, I didn't support that. I didn't even vote for this damn thing. But I understood that it would pass and I wanted to be able to use it for the benefit of my Florida colleagues. Let me give you one example of the difference that has occurred. We had to leave over 20,000 teachers in Florida if we didn't have that support. And frankly, I'm kind of looking at it like Florida taxpayers' dollars coming back to the state to take advantage of them. You know, I used to work for a great American senator named Connie Mac, a real financial governor, and so did I. And he's always, you know, gonna push us on the staff, make sure we get to share Florida's fear.\" More recently, Christ once again spoke of saving 20,000 teachers by accepting this incentive. In an interview in March 2014 with Candy Crowley from CNN, Christ had to say, \"You know, I'm always comfortable telling the truth, but this shift started at the end of my term, and one reason is that I accepted the stimulus money, and saved thousands of teachers, law enforcement officers and firefighters. It was the right thing to do when President Obama said, \"I want to help you,\" and I said yes as President of the Democratic President not because he was political, but because he was true. Christ initially supported the stimulus when he was approved in 2009 before his support was reduced in 2010 in an attempt to win the first Republican elections for the United States Senate. Now he's supporting him again. In the course of all this, he spoke positively about the incentives to dismiss teachers. His general data show a partial change in attitude.
