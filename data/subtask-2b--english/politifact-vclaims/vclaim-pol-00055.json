Here\u2019s what you get if you compare the August 2019 figures to the July 2019 figures:\nOhio: A gain of 3,700 jobs.\nMichigan: A gain of 6,100 jobs\nPennsylvania: A gain of 16,500 jobs.\nSo how does Castro support his claim of job losses in those states?\nHis campaign told PolitiFact that he compared March figures with July figures, showing that employment dropped in Ohio by 7,300, in Michigan by 11,500, and in Pennsylvania by 4,500.\nNote that Castro used July, rather than August, even though August numbers are available. He argued that July is a better measurement because the August numbers will be revised before being made official.\nThe August numbers will indeed be revised \u2014 here\u2019s a primer on employment data revisions we put together recently \u2014 but it\u2019s not a common practice to simply wave away the most recent figures because they will eventually be revised. All employment numbers are eventually revised, yet economists regularly study the most recent ones, politicians talk about them, and the media covers them.\nMore to the point, Castro didn\u2019t provide any indication in his statement that he was using a non-standard comparison. What his figures amount to are a cherry-picked month-to-month quirk that paints a misleading picture of the job trends in each of these states.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, here\u2019s the change for the full-year period between August 2018 and August 2019:\nOhio: A gain of 24,800 jobs.\nMichigan: A gain of 16,000 jobs\nPennsylvania: A gain of 38,400 jobs.\nAnd here are the employment trends since Trump took office in 2016, using BLS data collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Each state has seen its employment levels rise.\nHere\u2019s Ohio:\n\nHere\u2019s Michigan:\n\nAnd here\u2019s Pennsylvania:\n\nOur ruling\nCastro said, \"Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs.\"\nOfficial government figures show that each state gained jobs between July 2019 and August 2019, the latest month-over-month period available. To arrive at his job-loss figure, Castro cherry-picked a time period that he didn\u2019t mention in his remarks \u2014 a time period that ignores the existence of the most current data.\nHis assertion that employment levels have been crumbling in these states is belied by data showing that each state has seen job gains both in the past year and since Trump took office.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00055"}
