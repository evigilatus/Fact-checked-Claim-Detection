It's a crooked deal. ... It's a rigged system.\"\nTrump implied that he didn\u2019t bother speaking to the Colorado convention because state \"politicians\" controlled the process and there\u2019s \"no voting.\" Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth asked Trump, \"Isn't it just fair to say, These are the rules, Ted Cruz is organized, and you're just flat-out being out-organized?\"\nTrump disagreed, saying, he has \"out-organized\" Cruz because \"I have millions of more votes\" and more delegates.\nLike many state caucuses, Colorado\u2019s is a complex and arcane maze for newcomers to navigate. \u00a0\nBut was the Colorado system \"rigged\" and a \"crooked deal\" that deprived people of their vote, as Trump claimed?\nConfusing as they are, the rules for the caucus were changed in August 2015, two months after Trump entered the presidential race. And there\u2019s no evidence the tweaks were made to disenfranchise Trump.\nLet\u2019s dig deeper.\nTrump has performed better in states with primary elections, where his supporters can simply vote at their regular neighborhood polling place. But the Republican frontrunner\u2019s campaign has struggled in state caucuses because it has lacked a strong ground game to shepherd voters through bewildering caucus gatherings that are rife with rules.\nWhen Trump said there was \"no voting\" at the Colorado caucuses, he was referring to an August 2015 decision by the state GOP's executive committee, which unanimously voted to abandon a presidential preference poll at this year\u2019s precinct caucuses. The committee said it was reacting to the national party changing its rules to bind state delegates to the caucus winner \u2014 potentially leaving delegates tied to a candidate who later dropped out of the race.\nYet, Trump is wrong in saying there was \"no voting\" at the caucuses. About 60,000 Republicans attended the state precinct caucuses. People voted at every level of the delegate selection process.\nThe multistep Colorado GOP caucus process began March 1, when party members selected delegates at precinct caucuses. Those delegates moved on to higher-level gatherings before delegates for the Republican National Convention were selected at district assemblies and the April 9 state convention.\nCruz, whose campaign had been building an organization in Colorado since January, was the only GOP presidential candidate to address the state convention. He grabbed all 34 delegates.\nTrump supporters, however, describe a problem-plagued process at the state convention.\nAt a protest outside the Colorado Capitol building on Friday, April 15, about 200 Trump backers said their votes were \"stolen.\" Some claimed they were misinformed and even lied to during the caucuses.\nThe confusion continued at the state convention.\nParty organizers left about 30 delegates off the ballot and had to send out a correction sheet just before the convention vote. At least one Cruz delegate was entered twice on the ballot, replacing a Trump delegate, said Gabriel Schwartz, a Trump backer and state convention veteran.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Very obvious there was gross incompetence at the state (GOP) level,\" Schwartz told KMGH-TV.\nState GOP officials called the snafus a few \"clerical errors\" that didn\u2019t impact the convention\u2019s outcome.\nA Denver Post editorial said the Colorado Republican Party\u2019s process for selecting presidential delegates \"ranked among the least representative of all states.\" The editorial based its finding on the caucuses\u2019 delegate-to-voter ratio \u2014 roughly 1 to 1,714 \u2014 and a national analysis by FiveThirtyEight.com.\n\"In short, Colorado Republican leaders got what they wanted when they abandoned a presidential preference poll at the caucus. An extremely narrow base of activists and insiders chose the delegates in a process that ranked among the least representative and democratic in the country,\" the editorial said.\nHowever, the editorial still concluded, \"Not that Donald Trump and his supporters have any ground for their complaints. As we've said before, they knew the rules.\"\nEven some Trump backers were disappointed by the campaign\u2019s weak effort in Colorado.\nTrump delegate Larry Lindsey posted a YouTube that went viral of him fuming about being denied entrance to the state convention and burning his Republican party registration paper.\nLindsey said he later learned that he was ineligible for the convention because he\u2019d missed a county caucus vote. Yet, he said, someone told him the meeting was postponed.\n\"The (Trump) organization here in Colorado was definitely lacking. I have to admit that, reluctantly,\" Lindsey told PolitiFact.\nUniversity of Denver political scientist Peter Hanson said Cruz\u2019s win in Colorado is a reminder that a good ground game matters.\n\"Organization is key,\" Hanson told KMGH-TV. \"It's one thing for a candidate to give a speech to a rally and think that their work is done. That's just not the way it works.\"\nU.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio, issued a sharp rebuttal to Trump\u2019s criticism of the state caucus system.\n\"Donald Trump, who has known the rules since last August, he decided not to show up. Elections are won by those who show up and Ted Cruz showed up,\" Gardner told Fox News.\nOur ruling \nTrump said the Colorado GOP\u2019s caucus system is \"rigged\" and \"crooked.\"\nThere are plenty of problems with Colorado\u2019s caucus system. The delegate selection process is dominated by party activists and insiders, and this year\u2019s caucuses were hampered -- at best -- by confusion and technical glitches.\nBut Trump is complaining about rules that were in place eight months ago, when the Republican presidential race was clogged with 17 candidates. There is no evidence the rules were designed to favor a specific candidate.\nHis campaign took a pass on the Colorado caucuses, focusing instead on the delegate-rich New York primary, while Cruz ran an exhaustive ground game in the Centennial\u00a0State.\nWe rate his claim False. \u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/10e606f7-fc56-4d69-9c82-562b82fdb45b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05080"}
