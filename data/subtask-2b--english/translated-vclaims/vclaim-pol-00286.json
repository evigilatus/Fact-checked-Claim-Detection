At least one study shows that it provided over $25 billion to property taxpayers. But we were skeptical about his recent claim that the state had nothing to do with property taxes. Como made remarks during an interview with Long Island Radio. \"Property taxes are the lethal tax in New York State,\" said the host como Jay Oliver on 103.9 FM. Como said it had been a problem since Franklin D. Roosevelt was Governor, who was from 1929 to 1932. \"It has nothing to do with the state.\" Maybe I'm a little defensive for a second because it's early and I'm a little defensive. The FDR was pressuring the property tax. Because people think the state has something to do with property tax and they're complaining about high taxes and the FDR got very defensive and said, \"I have nothing to do with property taxes, it's all local taxes and school taxes,\" and that's right. So I don't control the property tax.\" Komo protested Roosevelt's ideas about property taxes during several speeches, and on this subject, conservatives make a similar observation. In his annual letter of 1932 to the state legislature, Roosevelt spoke of complaints from the public about property taxes: \"After three long years, during which I have tried in every part of the State to make people understand that real estate taxes have absolutely nothing to do with the state government, the public finally became aware that the increase in real estate taxes is entirely due to the increase in the cost of local government rather than government.\" Local governments and school districts collect real estate taxes as a means of paying for local programmes, and local officials control large budget lines such as staff salary contracts. But that's not all property tax money. The federal and state governments also impose some programmes, which means that they require school districts and districts to do certain things, but in some cases do not provide financial support for these programmes to be implemented. A survey conducted by Cornell University in 2017 for local governments, together with local government advocacy groups, concluded that the main sources of financial pressure on these governments were due to the influence of the State on its funds and services. According to Cornell's survey, \"the first three contributors to financial pressures identified by local governments were stagnant state subsidies, states, and property tax.\" Researchers in Cornell cited another study, which found that the state of New York \"recentralizes spending and responsibility for services to local governments more than any other state, except Nevada.\" These states, which are under-funded or underfunded, as is well known, are a subject of concern to local governments and school districts to the extent that local officials pressure every year on the Governor and state lawmakers for relief. Maybe Medicaid is the most under-funded state in the state of New York. Although the state administers the Medicaid programme, it transfers part of the cost of the programme to the provinces. The District Association of New York, which defends the provinces, calculates that the provinces in New York spend more on government medical aid costs than the other provinces across the country combined, not including voluntary payments by the provinces to support their public hospitals and nursing roles. In 2015, the State set the maximum share of local medical aid, saving local governments more than $3 billion per year. \"Even with the freeze, Medicaid remains one of the largest expenditures faced by local governments in New York - one with little or no means of controlling it,\" wrote Bill Hammond, Director of Health Policy at the Empire Public Policy Centre, a financial conservative. \"New York's local share remains a national deviation;\" wrote by the non-partisan citizens' budget committee in 2018. New York requires more local contributions to fund medical services than all other states of the nation combined. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021, in addition to Medicaid, the provinces must share the costs of programmes such as child care, indigent criminal defence, surveillance and special pre-school education. In January, the District Association of New York estimated that up to 80 percent of the county &apos; s total budget could be used to pay state and federal states. When we approached the press office of Komo about the Governor &apos; s claim, we linked the staff there to Jim Malatras, the former Director of State Operations of the Kumo Administration, who is now Chairman of Empire State College, a part of the State University of New York. Malatra worked on a property tax ceiling as a member of the administration and studied the effects of this ceiling as head of the Rockefeller State Institute. The Governor said: \"He is not legally entitled to determine what the property tax is,\" said Malatas. Komo helped the royal taxpayers by being \"very aggressive\" in managing local costs, as Malatra said. He noted the establishment of a less generous level of pensions, a maximum local share of the Medicaid programme and a maximum property tax. The StAR programme, which began under the supervision of a former Governor, provides government funds to compensate local school taxes. He also said that local governments and school districts had other sources of income in addition to property taxes. \"The state has nothing to do with real estate taxes,\" said Malatra. Local governments were involved in many fully controlled activities, such as economic development programmes, and wages paid to their employees. Some of the states from which local governments complain are found in the state constitution, or established by the United States Supreme Court. Local government officials also complain about labour rules, but the State must follow those rules as well, as Malatra said. With regard to complaints that the ceiling limits the flexibility of Governments, as noted in the Cornell study, Malatras said that with adequate support from governing bodies or voters, local governments and school districts could exceed the ceiling. In the past, the Kumu administration has recognized the financial burden imposed by the State on local governments and has taken steps to address it. Earlier this year, Komo took credit to reduce real estate taxes. In January 2012, the Komo Office announced the first meeting of the Council and described why it was necessary: \"The State relies on its local governments and school districts to provide basic services to its population, and often determines how these services are provided. These requirements are integrated into all State laws and regulations that limit flexibility and increase costs. The Council was established to find, review and reform these mandates.\" According to the \"Local Government\" section of the Komo Book to brief the operational budget for 2020, the budget \"maintains the commitment of Governor Kumo and his record in reducing real estate taxes.\" The governor Komo said the state has nothing to do with property taxes. It is true that local governments and school districts establish property tax rates and collect property taxes. However, when local officials determine the amount to be collected from real estate taxes, they must raise enough money to cover the costs of programmes that state and federal governments have stated must be provided, even in cases such as Medicaid, when they do not have control over the administration of the programme. Local governments have other ways of collecting revenues, but the property tax is one of their main sources. We appreciate Como's half-perfect statement.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00286"}
