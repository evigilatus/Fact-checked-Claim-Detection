Abbott, the State Attorney, defended his decision not to facilitate public knowledge of the storage of explosive fuel before saying: \"We have witnessed the escalation of terrorism. I participated in the trial of a terrorist member in ISIS.\" Democracy Wendy Davis did not contest his claim of prosecution. But we wondered. The Islamic State Group, which is believed to have tens of thousands of fighters, wants to see the Middle East clean up Western influence and put it under extreme religious law. Since June 2014, hostages (including journalists) have been taken to the camera, mass executions have been carried out, United States weapons caches have been captured, old visitors have been destroyed, and ethnic communities are under a deadly siege. Our research into Abbott's actions through his office in the state led us to a federal indictment, news stories and an interview with the suspect's wife in Austin. In the end, the Abbott statement considered that it lacked a factual basis - including whether it was reasonable to judge the said person as a terrorist. In July 2013, Polyte Vac did not define any specific agreed definition of terrorism, defined differently through think tanks and federal agencies. That story stated that in 2006 Bruce Hoffmann, an expert at Georgetown University, wrote that terrorism is \"the deliberate creation and exploitation of fear through violence or the threat of violence in pursuit of political change.\" His logic was that \"all terrorist acts involve violence or the threat of violence. Terrorism is specifically designed to have far-reaching psychological effects that go beyond the direct victim or targets of a terrorist attack. Its purpose is to instil fear within a broader \"target audience\" and thus to intimidate it, which may include a rival ethnic or religious group, an entire country, a national government or a political party, or a general public opinion.\" Jerry Strickland, Abbott State spokesman, told us by e-mail that Abbott referred to Michael Todd Wolfe, aged 23, from Rwanda Rock, who was arrested at Houston Airport on 17 June 2014, while on a flight to Toronto, Canada. Ten days later, Wolff pleaded guilty to hiding a conspiracy to provide resources to terrorists. According to a Federal Bureau of Investigation press release of 27 June 2014, Wolff admitted in court that \"he plans to travel to the Middle East to provide his services to a foreign terrorist organization, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant/Syrian Arab Republic.\" In early October 2014, he was imprisoned pending sentencing. According to a Federal Bureau of Investigation press release of 18 June 2014, Wolfe &apos; s arrest resulted from an investigation carried out by the Central Texas Joint Task Force on Terrorism in cooperation with 11 other public entities, including the Texas Prosecutor &apos; s Office, and was extended to local police agencies and even the State Ministry regulating the sale of alcohol. According to the release, the FBI investigated \"with the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the United States Army Intelligence Service, the Austin Police Department, the Round Rock Police Department, the Kellen Police Department, the Texas University Police Department, the Travis County Mayor' Office, the Texas Public Safety Department, the Texas Public Prosecutor's Office and the Texas Alcohol Commission.\" Recognizing that the Attorney General's Office usually does not focus on criminal prosecutions, we asked Strickland to determine how Father and his office were involved, without responding to repeated inquiries. We also asked how Abbott concluded that Wolfe was a terrorist of an Islamic State. By e-mail, Strickland referred to the mention of Jehad and Battle in the criminal complaint against Wolfe, According to the indictment, Wolfe violated a law (section 18, United States Act, section 2339A) written in the Patriot Act 2001. The Act provides that any person who \"conceals or conceals the nature, place, source or ownership\" of \"material support or resources\" intended to prepare or carry out killings, abductions, mutilations may be sentenced to up to 15 years' imprisonment. Also in a file in the U.S. District Court in Austin: a 12-page complaint against Wolfe signed by Blake Crowe, an FBI agent who wrote that he was relying on testimony from undetectable agents. In the complaint, Crow describes many conversations with Wolfe's wife, Jordan Four Austin, who spoke to a secret agent about Wolfe's desire to fight with his \"brothers\" in Syria, saying: \"Just want to jump into Syria. He's willing to die for his religion. The complaint said he was willing to die for someone, for something. Religion is an Arabic word for religion. Here we summarize the main parts of the complaint: another client met with Wolfe about three months later, on 26 October 2013, and discussed \"violent jihad abroad.\" Five days later, the client offered to help Wolf organize a trip to the Middle East. Subsequently, clients met with Wolfe or his wife at least 15 times. On at least six occasions, between April and June 2014, clients telephoned Wolf to develop a travel plan. In one telephone call described by the complaint, Wolf expressed reluctance to go to Syria. When an agent contacted Wolf on May 19, 2014, \"Wolf used an encrypted language when expressing fears of travelling to join the Nusra Front based on information he learned about the activities of the latter group. Wolf indicated that he was more in line with another group.\" In a footnote, Crew said, \"It is believed that the other group to which Wolfe referred is the Islamic State of Iraq in Syria.\" The client called again on 23 May 2014, and Wolfe said that the man who would join them, another agent who came to Wolfe as an experienced jihadist, \"he did have respect for the brothers because he had references and recommendations.\" Wolfe, using an encrypted language, \"explained that, given the demographics of their group, it would make sense to go to the other 'performance'.\" In a footnote, Kru said: \"Wolf's discussion of another \"performance\" is believed to have been a reference to the Islamic State of Iraq in Syria. On January 27, 2021, Marco Rubio says in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders?\" There were two other conversations between Wolf and the agent Wolf agreed to meet with the agent in Denmark before they ventured together into Turkey. Crowe said, \"He thinks Wolf was finally going to travel to Syria through Turkey, and to participate in a violent Jihad.\" In her first interview on this issue, Veer provided a conflicting interpretation of the events described. The man found to be a federal agent encouraged her husband to go to Syria through Turkey. Four said Wolf wouldn't agree to do it without the client's pressure. She also said that Wolfe had not planned to enter into combat and had not agreed to join the Islamic State Group. Four was asked if Wolf was a member of the Islamic State Group, and he said, \"No, no, with all the laughter, no. He doesn't know anyone there.\" But Wolfe pleaded guilty to the charges that he planned to join the group, Veer said, because the FBI had implied that the government would sue his friends and family if he didn't. After Wolfe was arrested, the American statesman in Austin spoke with experts about the terrorists who grew up inside. At the national level, \"security experts warned against triggering a terrorist threat in the United States, saying that most of the accused who faced similar accusations across the country were unorganized amateurs and had little to contribute to armed conflicts abroad.\" It is not necessarily easy to know whether he is a member of the Islamic State Group, and the experts agreed. By telephone, David Gartenstein Ross, Director of the Washington, D.C. Research Centre for the Study of Terrorist Extremism at the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies, who called the Islamic State Group an \"open network.\" \"In part of whether you're a member... depends on whether you call yourself a member,\" he said. However, he said that the Islamic State Group \"has a central command\" based in Syria and Iraq, which directs the group. \"It is not clear whether a person has been arrested as a \"Islamic State Group\" member of Texas if they are acting on orders from the Central Command or if the Central Command is even aware of them,\" he said: By e-mail, Henry Parkey, Professor of International Relations and Expert in the Near East at the University of Lehai, said that he did not know at what point an individual could be considered \"a member of ISIS.\" Barclay suggested we ask the person concerned. We spoke briefly on the phone with the lawyer appointed by the Wolfe Tribunal, Horatio Aldridge, who refused to speak about Wolfe. Our verdict, Abbott, said he helped try a terrorist member in ISIS. Given Abbott &apos; s silence on exactly what he or the State Attorney did in connection with this case, we have no evidence to support his statement along with a press release attributed to a group of agencies including the Attorney General and extended to the Kellen Police Department and the Texas Alcohol Commission. This release does not mean that any agency has ruled Wolfe. The Abbott statement also relied on a broad definition of the terms \"terrorism\" and \"ISIL member.\" The federal complaint indicates that Wolfe may have sought to be such items but does not provide evidence that he has become either a terrorist or an ISIS member. We're assessing the allegation wrong. - The statement is not accurate.
