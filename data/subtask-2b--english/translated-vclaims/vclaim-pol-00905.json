Boeing lists three major United States airlines currently using American aircraft - 737 Max (24 aircraft), South-West (34) and United States aircraft (14 aircraft). The FAA said it made the decision after seeing \"new evidence gathered on site and analysed today.\" The United States was the last suspended area, with other national air safety agencies moving from China to the European Union for landing. The crash of an Ethiopian airliner Boeing 737-Max 8 led a number of legislators to call for the immediate landing of that aircraft in the United States. Ethiopian flight 302 of air monitors disappeared about six minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa on a flight to Nairobi, Kenya. All 157 passengers died. The candidate for the Democratic Presidency, Elizabeth Warren, was among those who called for immediate action. \"The United Kingdom, China, Australia, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and others have already punished 737 Max,\" Warren said on March 12 news. \"The world has now witnessed the second tragic accident of one of these aircraft in less than six months. The Angolan Armed Forces must follow their command, reverse their decision, and immediately land in the United States so that their safety can be guaranteed. While we do not know the reasons for these incidents, serious questions have been raised as to whether these aircraft have been forced to serve without additional pilot training to provide funds. The Federal Aviation Agency itself has indicated that software updates are likely to come. Any necessary changes must be made before, but not yet, more flights occur and more lives can be endangered.\" Warren's view about the FAA and the software proves it. On 11 March, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a notice of flight authority. While stressing that the investigation had just begun, he observed \"the completion of Boeing's upgrades to the flight control system.\" The Federal Aviation Agency listed three programme elements in which changes were expected to be made to the so-called increased manoeuvrability system. This system is automatically activated, mainly during take-off, when the aircraft rises rapidly. * (Constructed to compensate for the significant changes in the aircraft that made it more fuel efficient, but also affected how it was handled when its nose was indicated at a sharp angle). There are speculations that the automated system contributed to the collapse. Facebook published on January 11, 2021 in Nancy Belusi's newspaper, no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021, more than Boeing's progress, and the statement said, \"The FAA expects these design changes to be commissioned by (Airworthiness Direction) no later than April 2019.\" .................................................................................................................. It's a legally enforceable rule \"to correct an unsafe situation.\" \"When the FAA wrote that, Boeing said to make these changes as soon as possible,\" told us the Professor of Aviation Safety at Embry Riddle University of Air Navigation William Waldock. Boeing has complied. On March 11, she announced that she was publishing software changes for the 737 Max fleet \"in the coming weeks.\" Changes were under way after the first 737 Max incident in Indonesia in October 2018. Among other things, it will reduce mechanical modifications in the aircraft stabilizers (mobile parts on the tail of the aircraft). However, Waldock asserted that until the investigators had access to the data in the black boxes and the sound recorders on the Ethiopian aircraft, they would not know the actual cause of the disaster. It is likely that the programme in question was not responsible Our referee Warren said the FAA made it clear that the software change was coming to the Boeing 737 Max 8 fleet. The FAA flight authority notice not only indicated that these changes were in progress, but also sent a telegram to the effect that these amendments would be mandatory by the end of April. We're assessing this statement right.
