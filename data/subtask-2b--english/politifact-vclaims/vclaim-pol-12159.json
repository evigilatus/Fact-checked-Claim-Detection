Cliff Stearns, \u00a0launched an investigation in September 2011 into Planned Parenthood by demanding that it provide years of information about its federal funding and its compliance with abortion restrictions.\n\nThis didn\u2019t sit well with Rep. Tim Ryan, a Ohio Democrat from Niles, who called the investigation a baseless, ideological attack on Planned Parenthood, which he described as a trusted provider of health care to millions of people, \"many of whom would otherwise not receive vital services like pre-natal care, well woman exams and cancer screenings.\"\n\nAmong those Planned Parenthood treats are the poor, according to Ryan. In a news release Sept. 28, he detailed just how those numbers are increasing in the United States:\n\n\"These attacks come at a time when the poverty rate among women is the highest in nearly two decades and 1 in 5 women under 65 don\u2019t have access to health care.\"\n\nWe will leave the debate over abortion rights which is at the center of this flap to Ryan, Stearns and others. But PolitiFact Ohio took a look at Ryan\u2019s claims about impoverished women without health care.\n\nThe stats back up the first part of the claim -- that the poverty rate among women is the highest in nearly two decades. \u00a0\n\nRyan based his information on an analysis by the National Women\u2019s Law Center of U.S. Census Bureau data. It shows that the poverty rate for women ages 18 to 64 rose to 14.5 percent in 2010, the highest rate in 17 years.\n\nFurthermore, the number of women it classifies as living in extreme poverty (with incomes less than half of the federal poverty level) checked in at 6.3 percent, the highest rate over the 22 years the measurement has been taken.\n\nWhat about the second part of Ryan\u2019s claim; that 1 in 5 women (or 20 percent) under 65 don\u2019t have access to health care.\n\nRyan again relied on the National Women\u2019s Law Center analysis, only what the organization more precisely stated is that the number of uninsured women between the ages of 18 and 64 rose to 19.7 percent in 2010. That figure counts only women who had no coverage of any kind, private or public, for the entire year.\n\nRyan\u2019s statement equates not having insurance to not having access to health care. While a woman, or any person for that matter, without health insurance finds it much more difficult or expensive to get medical treatment, there are places they can go, at least in an emergency.\n\nMany physicians will see an uninsured patient if they are dogged enough and the ailment severe enough, said Henry Aaron, senior fellow with the Brookings Institution in Washington, but that\u2019s asking an awful lot of the patient.\n\nAnd non-profit hospitals are obligated to stabilize patients with serious conditions, he said, but perhaps not to provide follow-up treatment.\n\n\"The whole thing is your treatment is delayed,\" he said.\n\nThose without insurance also find it more difficult to get simple check-ups and then to find a doctor who will write a prescription, Aaron said. They are often embarrassed to ask for charity or to run the risk of being refused.\n\n\"(Being uninsured) just leaves barriers, psychological and financial, to acquiring health care,\" he said.\n\nRyan reinforced that point when we contacted his office.\n\n\"This economic barrier to health insurance obstructs many women from obtaining the most basic health care,\" he said. \"While these women are legally guaranteed treatment to stabilize emergency conditions at some hospitals, this promise falls far short of the access to medical care most of us depend upon to stay healthy and safe. It's shameful that in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, we have allowed women to reach such a high level of poverty.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood is part of the safety net of health care providers for the indigent, said Tara Broderick, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio.\n\nLess than 30 percent of its clients have health insurance. Those who don\u2019t have insurance are billed on a sliding scale, she said.\n\nAs for abortion services, nationally, only about 10 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s clients receive an abortion or an abortion pill, Broderick said, and the percentage locally is even smaller.\n\nThe 50,000 people (primarily women) who visited one of Planned Parenthood\u2019s 13 offices in Northeast Ohio last year were more likely to receive non-abortive birth control assistance or medical check-ups such as pap tests, breast and pelvic exams and blood work for checking cholesterol levels or for evidence of diabetes, Broderick said.\n\nSo, how do we rate Ryan\u2019s statement?\n\nBefore returning to Ryan\u2019s statement, we note one other point Aaron made.There is a wide enough difference in the amount of health care that someone with insurance receives compared to someone without insurance that there is \"something\" about Ryan\u2019s statement that conveys truth, he said.\n\nPolitifact Ohio would agree.\n\nOn Ryan\u2019s first point about the rate of poverty for women, census data backs his assertion.\n\nOn the second part he said 1 in 5 women age 18 to 65 don\u2019t have access to health care. That differs from the census database, which said 1 in five do not have health insurance.\n\nThat\u2019s a point that needs clarification. And that also consistent with \u00a0Ryan\u2019s underlying point, that the number of women in poverty is at a high point, and that getting access to health care would be difficult for many women without services of agencies like Planned Parenthood.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter we rate Ryan\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.
