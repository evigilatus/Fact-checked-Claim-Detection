While this is not a bad deal in every case, statistics provoke a lot of red media. In many cases, this step comes at the expense of the girl &apos; s health, education and personal safety. This issue is reflected in numerous calls for the improvement of the status of women throughout the world and was part of a lively speech at the United Nations by Harry Potter, representative Emma Watson. Watson, the UN-Women Goodwill Ambassador, stated in a speech on 20 September that if nothing was done, \"15.5 million girls would marry in the next 16 years as children.\" When we started verifying that statement, we quickly discovered that Watson's formulation was distorted. The correct expression was 15.5 million girls a year, starting in 2030, 16 years from now. This error was acknowledged by a senior adviser to UN-Women. The result: Watson's number is a huge minus. According to an article mentioned by UN Women, more than 140 million women under the age of 18 will be married by 2020. The main source of these figures is the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which in turn relies on data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). These reports provide generally reliable information, and UNFPA analysts screen 48 developing countries for women aged 20-24. Basically, to measure the number of young married women, you scan those aged 20 or over and ask them when they marry. According to the Convention, anyone who marries under 18 years of age is considered to have been married early. According to UNFPA, 14.2 million girls under the age of 18 were married annually in 2010. By 2030, these countries expected the rate to rise to 15.1 million per year. Why the annual increase? Sylvia Wong specializes in adolescent issues in UNFPA. Wong said there's a demographic bubble moving through the system. \"Many of these countries have very small populations with larger groups of younger girls, who have not yet married but may be in danger in the next 16 years,\" said Wong. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021 Margaret Greene Demographic, author of the Ford Foundation report on gaps in child marriage research, these figures said \"on target,\" but notes that the basic picture is changing. \"The individual country studies carried out in the past two years show increases in (age) marriage, for example from 14 to 16,\" said Green. \"But since these two years are under 18, you do not see many shifts in the overall percentage of child marriage.\" In fact, while demographic characteristics may lead to an increase in the annual total number, marriage under the legal age is actually decreasing when compared to the total number of young women in each country. Using the same data used by UNFPA, two World Bank researchers in an article in 2012 noted that \"it is widely recognized that child marriage is declining.\" They have written that the rate of child marriage in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa has declined by almost 20 per cent in the past 30 years. The rate was over 50%. Today it has fallen to about 40 percent. They said, \"The progress has been made,\" but the gains have been slow. In this fact-finding, our main objective is to closely examine how to track the Watson Statement with current research. No one can say for sure what the rate of early marriage will be 16 years from now. The Kolwale is an economist in development with data 2X, a United Nations project aimed at improving the quality of data on women. Kolwal said the basic data was correct, but he urged a little caution. \"These expectations over a long period of time are always difficult,\" said Kolwal. \"It does not represent a range of other factors, including economic, political and health factors, that can affect demographic trends over the same period.\" Our judge Watson said that at current rates, 15.5 million girls will be married as children in the next 16 years. Watson probably meant to say that 16 years from now, 15.5 million girls a year will be married as children. However, the estimate we found from the source cited by UN-Women is slightly lower than that of Watson - 15.1 million instead of 15.5 million by 2030. The annual figure masks two basic trends. First, in some developing countries, the age of marriage is rising even if it remains below the minimum age of 18. More importantly, child marriages are declining. It just doesn't go down as fast as the number of young girls increases. Watson severely reduces the number of young marriages that will take place between now and 2030. Based on current trends, not only will there be another 15 million, but a further 125 million, a figure that would support her cause. In both cases, however, statistics ignore the fact that the incidence of child marriage is declining. Overall, Watson &apos; s claim is partially accurate but omits important details. We value it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07236"}
