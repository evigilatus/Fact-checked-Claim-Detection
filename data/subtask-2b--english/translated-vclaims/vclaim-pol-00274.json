Unfortunately, the old playbook is still the same: the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, touched a new round of social media bulletins claiming that actors in crisis situations were many in the wake of the mass shooting. A photo posted on Facebook on 8 August depicting three women in error indicates that they are the same woman who plays the role of the shooting victim and the mothers of the shooting victims. \"So you know not only that it was my mother from California and the Orlando shots, but it was Vistim (e.g.) from Las Vegas shooting too!\" The picture says it's followed by three sarcasms while yelling.

In the first picture, the woman was Jean Lambourne, who was among those who fired on Route 91 of the Festival of Music in the Harvest Country in Las Vegas, which left 59 dead and hundreds wounded in 2017. The woman at the bottom of the left picture is Susan Schmidt-Orfanus, whose son, Telemachus \"Till\" Orfanos, survived shooting Las Vegas only to die during the shooting at a bar in the Los Angeles suburb of 1,000 Oaks, which left 13 dead in 2018. In Facebook, the three women have light skin and wear glasses. They all have brown hair and glasses, but they don't look the same. The search for other images of women, in which they are not coerced, and in some cases they do not wear glasses, the differences are even more acute. Lennonen has been in the public eye since the shooting, speaking at the National Democratic Congress 2016, for example. Lambourne showed up on the deal or not.
