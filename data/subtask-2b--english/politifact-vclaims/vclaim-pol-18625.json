FBI director Christopher Wray singled outwhite supremacists during a Sept. 17 House Homeland Security committee hearing.\nRELATED: In context: Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018stand back and stand by\u2019 debate comments on white supremacists\nWray\u2019s testimony about white supremacists\nDuring the hearing, Wray testified broadly about the FBI\u2019s investigation of terrorism threats and security issues and answered questions about antifa, Black Lives Matter and white supremacists.\nU.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., a former CIA analyst, asked Wray to discuss the number of investigations into white supremacist groups versus groups on the left.\nWray replied that the FBI has roughly 1,000 domestic terrorism investigations a year, though it is a \"good bit north of a thousand this year.\"\u00a0\n\"Everything from racially-motivated violent extremists to violent anarchist extremists, militia types, sovereign citizens, you name it. Of the domestic terrorism threats, we last year elevated racially-motivated violent extremism to be a national threat priority commensurate with a homegrown violent extremists,\" Wray testified. \"That\u2019s the jihadist-inspired people here and with ISIS.\"\nSlotkin pressed further and asked how many of the cases or arrests involved white supremacists.\n\"What I can tell you is that, within the domestic terrorism bucket category as a whole, racially-motivated violent extremism is, I think, the biggest bucket within that larger group, and within the racially-motivated violent extremists bucket, people subscribing to some kind of white supremacist-type ideology is certainly the biggest chunk of that,\" Wray said.\n\"So the white supremacists are the largest chunk of the racially-motivated domestic terrorists?\" Slotkin asked.\nWray replied \"yes\" part way through her asking the question.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen Wray explained: \"Racially-motivated violent extremists over recent years have been responsible for the most lethal activity in the U.S. Now this year, the domestic terrorism, lethal attacks we\u2019ve had have, I think, all fit in the category of anti-government, anti-authority, which covers everything from anarchist violent extremists to militia types. We don\u2019t really think in terms of left, right.\"\nThe Biden campaign also pointed to Wray\u2019s testimony to a Senate committee Nov. 5, 2019, when he made similar comments.\n\"A huge chunk of those domestic terrorism investigations involve racially-motivated, violent extremist-motivated terrorist attacks,\" Wray said. \"And the majority of those, of the racially-motivated, violent extremist attacks, are fueled by some kind of white supremacy. And I would say that the most lethal activity over the last few years has been committed by those type of attackers.\"\nExperts on terrorism said the threat of white supremacy is significant\nExperts on terrorism pointed to other information from the federal government or independent sources that back up Biden\u2019s statement.\n\"I think Biden\u2019s interpretation of Wray\u2019s statements is correct, and it is supported by a separate threat assessment done recently by the Department of Homeland Security,\" said Michael Jensen, principal investigator at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland.\nJensen pointed to a Sept. 4 article by Politico that a draft report from the Department of Homeland Security identified white supremacists as the gravest terror threat to the United States. Two later drafts of the same document used slightly different language about the threat of white supremacists. PolitiFact did not directly see the drafts; however, the final report in October stated that among domestic violent extremists \"racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists \u2014 specifically white supremacist extremists (WSEs) \u2014 will remain the most persistent and lethal threat in the Homeland.\"\nData sets maintained by think tanks and university researchers match the federal government\u2019s warnings about white supremacy. START\u2019s Global Terrorism Database shows that from 2015-19, white supremacists were responsible for more attacks in the U.S. than other types of extremists.\u00a0\nA separate study of terrorist incidents by the Center for Strategic and International Security in June 2020 found \"the most significant threat likely comes from white supremacists, though anarchists and religious extremists inspired by the Islamic State and al-Qaeda could present a potential threat as well.\"\nAn expert also pointed to the Sept. 23 testimony by Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that white supremacists have become the \"most persistent and lethal\" internal \"threat\" to the U.S.\n\"White supremacist extremists, from a lethality standpoint over the last two years, particularly when you look at 2018 and 2019, are certainly the most persistent and lethal threat when we talk about domestic violent extremists,\" Wolf said.\nBrian Levin at the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, said last year his center found at least 29 suspected white supremacist/far right extremist motivated homicides. The number represented the third consecutive increase, constituting a clear majority of all extremist homicides in 2019. In 2020, domestic extremist homicides are down so far, but far right/white supremacist homicides are again the most lethal, Levin said.\nRELATED: Tucker Carlson says white supremacy is a hoax.
