We will not be adding more to the national debt. It's -- so, to use a -- sort of, an analogy that families are familiar with, we're not going to be running up the credit card anymore.\"\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time the administration had made the argument that the U.S. would \"not be adding more to the national debt\" within a few years if the budget were enacted. On Feb. 13, 2011, Jack Lew, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, appeared on CNN\u2019s State of the Union with Candy Crowley and said, \"Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spending money that we have each year, and then we can work on bringing down our national debt.\"\n\nWould the president\u2019s budget really mean that within a couple years, the U.S. will \"not be adding more to the national debt\"?\n\nFirst, a bit of background about the budget. Every year in early February, the president releases a budget with detailed proposals for federal spending, laid out department by department and program by program. It is not a binding document. Rather, it is traditionally the opening proposal in the annual fight over federal spending, with Congress ultimately charged with passing spending bills that the president is asked to sign.\n\nThe administration\u2019s budget document includes 10 years of future projections for federal outlays, revenues, deficits and accumulated debt. These are the tables we turned to first.\n\nWe\u2019ll also remind readers that a deficit occurs when a given year\u2019s worth of revenues is smaller than that same year\u2019s spending. By contrast, the term \"debt\" refers to the accumulated total of past deficits, minus any surpluses.\n\nOver the next 10 years, according to the president\u2019s budget, there will be projected deficits every year. Here\u2019s a rundown:\n\nYear \u00a0\u00a0Deficit\n2010: $1.293 trillion\n2011: $1.645 trillion\n2012: $1.101 trillion\n2013: $768 billion\n2014: $645 billion\n2015: $607 billion\n2016: $649 billion\n2017: $627 billion\n2018: $619 billion\n2019: $681 billion\n2020: $735 billion\n2021: $774 billion\n\nSo, with deficits every year for the next 10 -- and no surpluses -- the nation\u2019s accumulated debt will rise every year for the next decade. Here\u2019s the rundown by year of the projections for publicly held debt every year:\n\nYear \u00a0\u00a0Public debt\n2010: $9.019 trillion\n2011: $10.856 trillion\n2012: $11.881 trillion\n2013: $12,784 trillion\n2014: $13,562 trillion\n2015: $14.301 trillion\n2016: $15.064 trillion\n2017: $15.795 trillion\n2018: $16.513 trillion\n2019: $17.284 trillion\n2020: $18.103 trillion\n2021: $18.967 trillion\n\nThese numbers show that the publicly held debt rises each year. Two other measures of debt also go up every year from 2011 to 2021 -- gross federal debt (which includes public debt plus debt held by other parts of the government) and public debt adjusted for financial assets held by the government.\n\nSo the contention that \u00a0\"we will not be adding more to the national debt\" after the middle of the decade seems incorrect on its face.\n\nSo what is the administration thinking? The president gave a pretty good idea of his thought process during the press conference.\n\nObama responded in a follow-up question by Chip Reid of CBS News by saying, \"We still have all this accumulated debt as a consequence of the recession and as a consequence of a series of decisions that were made over the last decade. We've piled up -- we've racked up a whole bunch of debt. And there's a lot of interest on that debt. So in the same way that if you've got a credit card and you've got a big balance, you may not be adding to principal; you've still got all that interest that you've got to pay. Well, we've got a big problem in terms of accumulated interest that we're paying and that's why we're going to have to whittle down further the debt that's already been accumulated.\"\n\nIn other words, Obama argued that new outlays stemming from his fiscal 2012 budget plan -- discretionary spending, military-related spending and entitlements -- wouldn\u2019t be adding to the debt. Only interest payments stemming from past budgets would be adding to the debt.\n\nFirst, we checked to see if he was right.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of the net interest totals for each of the 10 years. (Net interest is interest paid to the government minus interest paid out by the government.)\n\nYear \u00a0\u00a0Net interest\n2010: $196 billion\n2011: $207 billion\n2012: $242 billion\n2013: $321 billion\n2014: $418 billion\n2015: $494 billion\n2016: $562 billion\n2017: $627 billion\n2018: $685 billion\n2019: $741 billion\n2020: $793 billion\n2021: $844 billion\n\nIf you compare these totals to the projected annual deficits, the net interest begins to match or exceed the size of the deficit in 2017. The two numbers are exactly equal in 2017. Then, net interest begins to exceed the deficit by $66 billion in 2018, by $60 billion in 2019, $58 billion in 2020 and $70 billion in 2021.\n\nThe president has a point that current spending -- exclusive of net interest -- won\u2019t be adding to the debt beginning in 2017, as it has for more than a decade. It is a little like getting to the point where you are covering monthly expenses with your income, rather than putting them on your credit card. But to extend the analogy, this ignores the big credit card debt hanging over you. That debt isn\u2019t shrinking. In fact, the longer you take to pay down that debt, additional interest costs accrue, and the debt grows.\n\n\"This is what public finance economists refer to as \u2018primary spending\u2019 or \u2018primary balance,\u2019\" said Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute. \"But the White House is using these technical concepts in a very misleading way. Very misleading.\"\n\nIf the president can somehow work with Congress to get his budget enacted, he\u2019d have reason to boast that his plan would make annual spending -- minus interest -- equal annual revenues for the first time in years in 2017. That would be an accomplishment, but it doesn't equal \"not adding to the debt anymore.\" Because of interest costs -- which amount to $884 billion in 2021 alone -- the debt is projected to grow during every year of the president\u2019s budget. (It's also a bit of an exaggeration to call 2017 \"the middle of this decade.\")\n\nWe think the president\u2019s statement is likely to mislead a lot of Americans about what his budget would do. So we rate Obama\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.

While it\u2019s true that the debt as a proportion of GDP \u2013 at least when adjusted for financial assets held by the government \u2013 would fall slightly between 2013 and 2017 (from 67.7 percent to 66.8 percent), that's not the explanation Obama gave in the news conference.
