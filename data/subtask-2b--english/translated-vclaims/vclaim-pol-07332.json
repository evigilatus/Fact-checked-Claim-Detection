This was used in a recent announcement broadcast by the National Republican Senate Committee in the Iowa Senate race between the Democratic Republic of Brazil and the Republican State Sin Johnny Ernst. \"Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion in medical care to support Obama's care,\" says the ad. \"That's not fair. We paid. We paid for it. This must be there for us.\" Here, we will look at the claim that Berley \"voted to cut $700 billion in medical care to support Obama's care.\" (We will consider the second half of the claim in a separate item.) It is true that as a member of the House of Representatives, Berley voted in favour of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. However, Polyte Fruitte was skeptical of many previous allegations that Obama Care was cutting off medical care, and classified it either half right or often wrong, depending on how it was formulated. Other fact-checkers have reached a similar conclusion. The allegation is very comprehensive and does not fully reflect what the law does. Here's the idea. While Congress was discussing President Barack Obama &apos; s Health Care Act in 2010, his supporters acted to block one line of criticism - that the bill was a budget failure - by making sure that the bill did not add to the deficit. To do so, they wrote in law both new taxes and new savings. Among the reductions in spending are measures aimed at reducing the increase in future medical care costs. When the law was passed, the cuts amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years; eventually, with the budget window shifting for 10 years to one or two years in the future, the cost of these cuts increased to over $700 billion. Over 10 years, total reductions are estimated at $415 billion for traditional medical care, $156 billion for the management care option known as the medical care advantage, $56 billion for payments to teaching hospitals serving large numbers of low-income people, and $114 billion in other categories, according to estimates by the Budget Office of Congress. However, it is important to note some warnings. First, while advertising implies that the law interrupts medical care benefits, these are not reductions in current services. Instead, as spending on medical care continues to rise over the next 10 years, this will occur at a slower pace without the law. Obama therefore claims that the \"cut\" of medical care needs further explanation to be fully accurate. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers in a story written by General David Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to provide security, and told her that we were \"not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, second, savings focused on reducing payments to hospitals and insurance companies. It does not target beneficiaries. For example, the law provides for substantial reductions in the benefits of medical care, a subset of medical care schemes run by private insurance companies serving approximately 30 per cent of the beneficiaries of medical care. The advantage of medical care began under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition between private insurers would reduce costs. In recent years, however, the cost of plans has been more than traditional medical care. The Health Care Act therefore balances the payments to the participating health plans. Hospitals will also receive lower wages if they have a very large number of readmissions, or if they do not meet other new standards of patient care. Does this mean that no elderly citizen will today be harmed by the adoption of the law? No. Some beneficiaries, including participants in the medical care programme, can see additional costs to move to, suffer from service cuts, or find fewer doctors willing to be treated under the medical care programme. For example, Brooke Hoggson, the National Broadcasting Authority press secretary, referred to news coverage in Iowa on how 9,200 state residents, \"many in rural areas of the state,\" had to choose a new medical-care benefit plan to avoid losing coverage on 1 January 2014. These changes were motivated by the determination of some medical care schemes that they would not be able to provide the minimum number of health-care providers in densely populated areas in order to meet the rules of the benefits of medical care. However, there are many doubts about the extent and scope of these reductions -- more than the Declaration allows. The announcement also ignores some of the benefits that older persons will gain from the law -- for example, $48 billion over 10 years to cover prescription medical care, part D of the anti-corruption law provisions targeting the so-called \"donut hole.\" It also finances disease prevention benefits and expands preventive care benefits. We asked Gail Whelinski, who headed medical care, and Medicked to President George H.W. Bush, if subsequent changes in the implementation of the law would reduce our earlier doubts about allegations such as those made against Braley, said that she had not done so. The earlier criticisms of the claim were \"still relevant.\" Our ad says, \"Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion in medical care to support Obama's care.\" The law already includes cost savings that may affect some beneficiaries, such as participants in the medical care programme. However, the Declaration overlooks some of the main subtle differences. The argument that the law now reduces benefits is widespread, but in fact it reduces the growth of future spending on medical care. The law also targets these reductions among health-care providers, not beneficiaries. The announcement ignores the new expenditure from the law that would benefit the beneficiaries of medical care, such as the expansion of prescription coverage. This statement is partly accurate but does not contain significant details, and we therefore assess the National Remote Sensing Centre's statement as half correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07332"}
