More than 4,000 people have died and eight countries, including the United States, are currently each reporting more than 1,000 cases.\nMark Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard\u2019s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics and an expert on viruses, told CBS News, among other news outlets, that 40% to 70% of the world\u2019s adult population could be infected in the coming year.\u00a0\nThere are an estimated 7.6 billion people in the world, and an estimated 329 million in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Adults make up about three-quarters of the U.S. population.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is a projection,\" Lipsitch said during the March 2 interview, \"so we will find out if that\u2019s accurate as things go on.

The Guardian reported on Feb. 11 that 60% of the global population could be infected if the virus is unchecked. On Feb. 13, Bloomberg reported that Ira Longini, an adviser to the World Health Organization, said two-thirds of the world\u2019s population could catch COVID-19.\u00a0\nBut the publication also quoted David Heymann, an infectious disease expert at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, explaining that researchers need more data to get a better idea of how far the coronavirus could spread.\u00a0\n\"The models will be refined as more information comes to light,\" he said.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nThe Facebook post says Harvard scientists say the coronavirus is \"spreading so fast that it will infect 70% of humanity this year.\"\u00a0\nAn epidemiologist at the university has said that 40% to 70% of the world\u2019s adult population could be infected in the coming year.\u00a0\nBut that is a projection, and other projections vary.\u00a0\nWe rate this post Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18101"}
