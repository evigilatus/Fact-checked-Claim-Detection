Rep. Scott Perry airs debunked claim that Wuhan lab \u2018constructed\u2019 coronavirus", "text": "Facing a tight reelection race, U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., turned to an anti-China media outlet to pitch his bill seeking to designate the Chinese Communist Party as a transnational organized crime group.\nHis interviewer was Simone Gao, who is affiliated with The Epoch Times and sister TV station NTD News.\nIn the Oct. 17 interview, posted a few weeks after Perry introduced his bill, Gao turned to COVID-19. She asked Perry what has been the effect of President Donald Trump\u2019s contracting the virus.\nPerry said Trump\u2019s recovery \"gives us hope as Americans in our ability to conquer the virus that came from China, in my opinion, was constructed in the Wuhan Institute of Virology and then was spread around the world, either by accident or on purpose.\"\u00a0\nPerry\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to our requests for information to back his statement.\nDespite numerous such claims, there is no evidence that the coronavirus was created at the Chinese institute.\nA tossup race\nPerry, in Congress since 2013, is being challenged by Democrat Eugene DePasquale, the state\u2019s auditor general, for the seat\u00a0 representing Pennsylvania\u2019s 10th congressional district, which surrounds Harrisburg, the state capital.\nThe race is rated a tossup by the Cook Political Report. It is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo evidence virus made in a lab\nHere\u2019s what we know from having fact-checked several claims that the virus that causes COVID-19 was created in a lab \u2014 a conspiracy theory that has been debunked since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic:\n\n\nThe consensus of the scientific community and international public health organizations is that the coronavirus emerged from bats and later jumped to humans. The first outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nScientists worldwide have publicly shared the genetic makeup of the coronavirus thousands of times. If the virus had been altered in a lab, there would be evidence in its genome. But there isn\u2019t.\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that Chinese researchers were studying the virus in a lab when it managed to spread outside the lab, which is something that the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency has considered. But the agency has also said there is \"no credible evidence to indicate SARS-CoV-2 was released intentionally or was created as a biological weapon.\"\n\n\nOur ruling\nPerry said the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was \"constructed\" in a Wuhan, China, lab.\nThere\u2019s no evidence to support this. Scientists who\u2019ve studied the virus\u2019s genetic makeup say that it is a naturally occuring virus.\nWe rate Perry\u2019s statement False.\n\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18779"}
