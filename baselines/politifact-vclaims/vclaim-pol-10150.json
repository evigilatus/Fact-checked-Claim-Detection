For example, their health care. You know a major difference in this campaign is that Gov. Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.\n\n\"I think that's a mistake. In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured. Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women. It makes a difference. This is money out of that family's pocket. Gov. Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.\"\nRomney later responded:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not. And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives. And the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.\"\nIt's worth noting that they were talking past each other. Obama was referring to whether an employer should dictate whether employees\u2019 insurance covers contraceptives. Romney sidestepped the issue about insurance coverage and said he opposes a different concept \u2014 whether employers can tell someone whether they can have contraceptive care.\n\nFor this fact-check, we\u2019re asking whether Romney has suggested that \"employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.\"\n\nThe Blunt amendment\n\nObama\u2019s support for his claim centers on something called the Blunt amendment.\n\nEarly this year, congressional Republicans made a big push to roll back a provision by Health and Human Services under Obama\u2019s health care law that requires most employers to provide birth control coverage without any out-of-pocket costs, with a limited exception for certain religious institutions.\n\nIn the Senate, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sponsored an amendment that would exempt employers from providing any service that went against their \"beliefs or moral convictions.\" At the time, the issue put the Obama administration on the defensive and the president himself appeared at the White House briefing room to explain a work-around for religious affiliated hospitals, universities and the like.\n\nA few weeks later, with a vote on the Blunt amendment pending, Romney was asked where he stood. He told a Boston radio interviewer \"Of course I support the Blunt amendment.\"\n\nCNSnews.com, a conservative news service, put the question directly to the Romney campaign.\n\n\"Will Mitt Romney, on day one, rescind this mandate in its entirety \u2014 as the Catholic Church has urged the current administration to do \u2014 so that individuals, employers and insurers who have a \u2018moral or religious objection to contraception or sterilization\u2019 will not be forced to violate the tenets of their own faith or act against their consciences?\"\n\nRomney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams responded: \"Yes. Gov. Romney would rescind the mandate in its entirety.\"\n\nIn April, Romney reiterated his opposition to the rule at a meeting of the National Rifle Association. He said, \"As president, I will abolish it.\"\n\nSo the Obama campaign argues if Romney supports an employer\u2019s ability to decline to provide a service that goes against \"beliefs or moral convictions,\" that means he supports employers making \"the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.\"\n\nRomney\u2019s response\n\nWe asked the Romney campaign to explain his objection to Obama\u2019s claim. Here's a statement from spokeswoman Andrea Saul:\n\"Gov. Romney\u2019s statement speaks for itself. He does not believe that bureaucrats in Washington or employers should tell a woman whether she can use contraceptives, and no policy that he has proposed or supported would do so. To the contrary, he has repeatedly made clear that he believes all women should have access to contraception and make such personal choices themselves. The disagreement between the governor and President Obama on this issue is over whether the federal government should impose a nationwide insurance mandate for contraception. The president wants bureaucrats to make that decision for all Americans, even where it violates their religious liberty. Gov. Romney does not.\"\nThe statement acknowledges that Romney opposes a nationwide mandate for contraception coverage. In the absence of a federal mandate, that would sometimes leave the decision to employers whether to offer coverage for birth control.\n\n(Before Obamacare, some 27 states already required such coverage, though we\u2019re not sure how many had religious exceptions.)\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama said Romney \"suggested\" that \"employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.\"\n\nRomney says he doesn\u2019t believe bureaucrats or employers should make the call whether a woman can use contraceptives. But his support for the Blunt amendment endorses the approach that employers should be able to make the decision about whether contraception is covered by employees\u2019 insurance.
