Among the panelists was Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker from Georgia.\n\"Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected,\" Gingrich said. \"There is no federal program to stop it. No one wants to have an honest conversation about it.\"\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time Gingrich had made this point. In an op-ed, Gingrich wrote, \"Although the president does not acknowledge the gangs' role as a major cause of the epidemic of violence, the FBI does. The FBI estimated in 2011 that there are roughly 1.4 million active gang members in the U.S., an astonishing 40 percent increase from 2009. These gangs, the FBI says, are responsible for \u2018an average of 48 percent of violent crime in most jurisdictions, and much higher in others.\u2019 \"\nWe were able to locate the FBI study Gingrich referred to in the op-ed -- the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment. Gingrich accurately quoted the report, which said, \"Approximately 1.4 million active street, (outlaw motorcycle) and prison gang members, comprising more than 33,000 gangs, are criminally active\" in the United States, which \"represents a 40 percent increase from an estimated 1 million gang members in 2009.\" (The 1 million figure came from the 2009 edition of the same FBI study.)\nBecause Gingrich\u2019s 40 percent figure comes from federal statistics, we agree that it has some credibility. But we will raise two issues of concern.\nUncertainty about the statistics\nBecause gang activity is illegal, it\u2019s difficult to get solid numbers. So the FBI estimated as best it could. To do this, the FBI used a combination of data from a survey of law enforcement agencies by the National Drug Intelligence Center, along with additional interviews with law enforcement officials. The survey the FBI used randomly sampled roughly 3,000 state and local law enforcement agencies to gauge how prevalent gangs are in their jurisdiction.\nThis is a reasonable approach to tackling a challenging question, but it\u2019s not gospel. Criminologists warned PolitiFact to be wary of several factors.\n\u2022 The survey is not just an estimate -- it\u2019s an estimate of estimates. All surveys are subject to sampling error -- that is, the possibility that the people being surveyed aren\u2019t actually random, thus biasing the results. But at least many surveys sample something that the respondent will find easy to quantify -- say, whether they approve of the job President Obama is doing, or how many cars they own.\nThe survey the FBI used, however, has uncertainty not just about whether the sample was truly random, but also about whether the answers given are actually accurate. The report itself \"acknowledges that there may be some duplication or underreporting of gang members\" because of how each state and local law enforcement agency measures gang activity in their area.\n\u2022 The smell test. A jump of 40 percent in just two years is an enormous increase, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. \"If there were really a 40 percent increase in two years, you would see a big impact on crime statistics generally, but we haven\u2019t,\" he said. \"Crime rates are fairly level.\"\n\u2022 Who counts as a gang member? There\u2019s no universal definition of who counts as a gang member. \"Actual gang members can deny membership, and wanna-bes can claim membership,\" said Eugene O\u2019Donnell, a criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"In both cases it is difficult to discern for sure.\"\n\u2022 Institutional bias. Local law enforcement officials have an interest in overstating -- or at least not understating -- the number of gang members in their jurisdiction, since a bigger gang problem can help them secure more federal assistance, O\u2019Donnell said. This wouldn\u2019t be so much of a problem for the soundness of the data if an independent assessment was also factored in, but none is. The estimate is based solely upon the opinions of state and local law-enforcement officials.\nAll in all, O\u2019Donnell said, \"there are multiple grounds for being skeptical\" about the estimate. Making significant public policy decisions based on them would be manifestly unsound.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly one person died on that day\u201d during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 9, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Obama deserve blame?\nGingrich said, \"Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected.\" If he had said \"between 2009 and 2011,\" we wouldn\u2019t have addressed the issue of whether he was blaming the president. But Gingrich chose to use Obama\u2019s presidency to mark time.\nThe Gingrich camp firmly disagrees that the former House speaker was blaming Obama for an increase in gang activity. They point to previous op-eds -- including the one we mentioned earlier -- as evidence that Gingrich was simply saying that crime issues that inspire a lot of media attention -- such as mass shootings and the Martin case -- obscure a more far-reaching crime concern, gangs.\n\"Newt mentioned Obama to make that contrast \u2013 in other words, \u2018Is a Trayvon Martin-type occurrence really what is most important to be focused on when it comes to the personal safety of African-Americans?\u2019\" said Joe DeSantis, a spokesman for Gingrich. \"After all, the president had just held a press conference to talk about the Martin verdict. Newt did not say that Obama was to blame for the increase in gang violence.\"\nThe Gingrich camp is correct that he has made that argument in previous op-eds, but we didn\u2019t see him mentioning it in the CNN discussion. And because a CNN viewer most likely wouldn\u2019t have read Gingrich\u2019s past op-eds, we think it\u2019s fair to rate him in part for bringing Obama into the discussion of gang growth.\nThere are, in fact, some things that an administration can do to bolster law enforcement generally and gang activity specifically.\nContrary to Gingrich\u2019s claim that \"there is no federal program to stop\" gangs, the Justice Department does have an Organized Crime and Gang Section, which was established under Obama in late 2010 as a consolidation of several existing offices.\nHowever, while federal funding and technical assistance can help, Fox said that \"there\u2019s relatively little that the president can do to discourage a 12-year-old from joining a gang.\"\nMost gang activity is handled by local law enforcement departments, and both demographics, including the number of young people in an area, and economic conditions are important drivers of gang membership.\n\"Gangs are always hiring, even when legitimate employers aren\u2019t because the economy is in bad shape,\" Fox said. And in recessions, he added, \"younger, inner-city people are hit especially hard.\"\nOur ruling\nGingrich said that \"gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected.\"\nGingrich deserves credit for using statistics from a credible federal agency, but it\u2019s important to note that methodological difficulties make it hard for anyone, even the FBI, to determine how many gang members there are in the United States. Criminologists express skepticism about whether gang membership could have jumped 40 percent in just two years, saying that broader crime statistics don\u2019t show any sign of it.\nIn addition, despite the Gingrich camp\u2019s insistence that he did not mean to cast blame on Obama for the rise in gang membership, we think that a reasonable viewer of the discussion could have made such an inference. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/682949c8-0c99-4bd5-959a-cf2953e8cfce", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09073"}
