When we shined a light on the measure, we found Amendment 1 doesn\u2019t provide any new protections, for seniors or anyone else.\nSolar support\nSupporters of the Amendment 1 campaign say the constitutional change promotes solar while protecting consumers. Critics have derided the amendment, accusing organizers of obscuring their true, backdoor intention of helping established utilities control Florida\u2019s solar market and punish electric consumers for using solar panels.\nSo how does the amendment protect seniors, or anyone else? On its own, Amendment 1 doesn\u2019t.\nAll the wording says is that current consumer protections can remain in place. Along with saying people may still buy solar panels and install them, the measure reads (emphasis ours):\n\"State and local governments shall retain their abilities to protect consumer rights and public health, safety and welfare, and to ensure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do.\"\nThe second half concerns the future of net metering, in which solar customers sell excess electricity back to the utilities. Net metering is currently overseen by Florida Public Service Commission rules.\nBut the first half essentially says the amendment will not preclude any current or future state law or regulation. No legal protections would change.\n\"This provision makes clear that regardless of what course Florida takes with solar energy now or in the future, government will not relinquish its responsibility to protect consumers,\" a Consumers for Smart Solar spokeswoman told us.\nThe Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn\u2019t give any examples when we asked them how solar customers may currently be protected. The attorney general\u2019s office said consumers with specific problems can file a complaint with them under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. The office reviews each complaint for appropriate action.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed the amendment does not spell out special protection for seniors. But here\u2019s where Consumers for Smart Solar\u2019s argument comes in. \u00a0\nThey cited an August 2016 letter to the Federal Trade Commission from Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer advocacy group. The letter said Public Citizen hoped the FTC would consider new regulations on \"arrangements in which consumers lease their solar system from a corporate third-party.\"\nFlorida is one of five states that do not allow a property owner to have a third-party installer put solar panels on their roof and sell the power back to them. In those deals, customers sign a lease for a period of time, usually a number of years, agreeing to buy power from the solar company. Florida customers are still allowed to lease the panels themselves, as long as they don\u2019t sell the excess electricity to anyone, such as a landlord selling power to tenants.\nConsumers for Smart Solar pointed to Arizona, where solar companies bilked older customers who didn\u2019t fully understand their lease agreements.\nBut it\u2019s not clear how this applies to Florida, because those kinds of deals aren\u2019t allowed in this state. State law makes it so that someone generating electricity with solar panels can\u2019t sell it to anyone but utility companies.\nThe net metering clause matters here, too, because third-party companies in other states depend on the money they would get from selling electricity to utilities. The amendment would conceivably make that business model unworkable, were third-party sales ever allowed.\nFlorida's two largest utilities, Florida Power & Light and Duke Energy have said they want to see Florida's net metering law changed to impose new fees on customer-owned solar users.\nMore than one legal expert told us it\u2019s ambiguous at best to say Amendment 1 offers protections. That\u2019s up to state and local officials, who already have laws and regulations in place. Seniors aren\u2019t specifically mentioned anywhere in the amendment\u2019s wording.\n\"The only defined user of electricity in the amendment is \u2018consumer,\u2019\" Stetson University law professor Lance Long said. \"I think it is misleading to suggest that it does have a particular concern for seniors. It seems more in the genre of \u2018scare tactic\u2019 rather than accurate information.\"\nOur ruling\nConsumers for Smart Solar said, \"Amendment 1 protects Florida seniors from scams and rip-offs.\"\nThe amendment\u2019s wording doesn\u2019t mention seniors specifically, it only lets current consumer protection laws stand. That means the measure doesn\u2019t preclude any protections, but it also doesn\u2019t provide any. If there were no amendment at all, the effect on consumer laws and regulations would be the same.\nThis talking point may lead many voters, especially seniors, to think the amendment somehow offers new safeguards for solar customers, but it doesn\u2019t.\nWe rate the statement False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/024c4fbf-63d6-41c4-84da-916fa5ff938d", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03992"}
