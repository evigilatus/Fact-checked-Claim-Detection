Now the United States Republic of America, Joe Garcia, de Miami, says in an online announcement on 5 September that his Republican opponent, Carlos Corbello, \"Supports raising the price of flood insurance.\" This is a serious charge in the Garcia area, which includes many homeowners in the flooded provinces of Miami-Dade and Monroe. A few days later, Garcia's campaign revealed a television ad that charges a similar charge that Corbello would have appreciated \"screaming.\" We're diving in the search for facts: Did Corbello support the raising of flood insurance prices? Federal and state flood insurance laws in 2014 and the Florida Legislative Council have taken action on flood insurance over the past few years. However, Corbello, a member of the board of directors of the Miami-Dade School, did not participate in these votes. Corbello told Polyte Fact Florida in an interview that he did not want to get rid of the National Flood Insurance Program but that he was in line with the new Florida Act, which made it easier for private companies to intervene. According to the Garcia campaign, Corbello's comments during two major discussions on the global surveillance system show that it supports the raising of flood insurance rates. Corbello's data relate to federal and state invoices for flood insurance - and we will summarize both legislations. The Flood Insurance Act 2012 introduced a comprehensive reform of the National Flood Insurance Programme, which secures more than 5 million drugs throughout the country, including about 2 million in Florida. The bill sought to avoid insolvency from the programme - in July 2013, it was owed approximately $24 billion. For some policy holders, the bill has been translated into very high rates. The population, well, has been overwhelmed by complaints from Congress, and the lawmakers have reversed many of their previous reforms. In March 2014, Obama signed the Affordability of Flood Insurance Act, which lowers the prices of certain policies and prevents future increases. The Florida Legislature sought its own solution in 2014. Some private companies are already providing flood insurance, but SB 542 has made it easier for them to provide more flexible and cheaper plans. (Joff) Rick Scott signed the bill in June, but no new companies started selling policies, and the vast majority remain through the federal program. Experts expect slow growth in the private sector, as it will take time for companies to figure out where to write policies profitably. \"It will take a decade after November for this private market to appear slowly,\" said Jay Neal, president of the Florida Insurance Reform Association. According to Richard Conn, Florida's Deputy Commissioner of Insurance, the two major companies that provide special flood insurance in Florida are currently offering cheaper prices than the federal program. But the situation is still volatile -- it is expected that the national programme will revise the rates, and some companies may wish to know whether Congress will make changes in the future. Corbello &apos; s statements to the debate on flood insurance laws emerged as topics in major discussions in Congressional District 26. This was part of the Corbello statement in the June debate: Checking out the distinctive facts mentioned by Ron Desantis on March 5, 2019 in his State of the State address \"I have already travelled to Washington, D.C., and obtained a historic commitment from the Trump administration to provide assistance to the communities hit by Michael.\" \"Our rates here in this area are rising because of the things that are happening in other parts of the country. As with everything else I am for a market-driven solution. We should allow the private sector to intervene. Florida has already begun to do so because Congress has failed to address this issue with his supposed reform that Mr. Garcia goes all over the city talking about. They failed to do so, entering Florida and encouraging private companies to meet this need. Therefore, we should continue to allow that process to grow. And once again -- when the market fails and only when the market fails -- the federal government must intervene to help.\" In a discussion conducted by Jim Davide (CBS4) of CBS4, Corbello (and all the participating candidates) said that they would have voted in favour of Congressionally approved Great Water Reform, which identified certain annual increases of 18 per cent. Corbello: \"I was going to vote yes and I realize it's a bandage and it doesn't solve a long-term problem.\" Davidie: \"I thought that even though you made some comments, you didn't think it was Congress's place to interfere in winning the market, which is basically what this does by reducing increases.\" Corbello: \"My position is that Congress should not interfere in the market unless the market fails. If the market fails, government intervention will be acceptable at that time.\" A few minutes later, Corbello added some criticism of the federal programme: \"Florida is a major donor. We invest in infrastructure, we prepare for storms in this state and we don't get much credit for it. Florida should not be unfairly treated under the National Investment Plan, which should have been one of the reforms approved by Congress.\" (A study found that several states, including Florida, paid more to the programme than they received in the claims. Corbello spoke clearly about allowing private companies to provide flood insurance. So how did Garcia come to the conclusion that this would raise the rates? Garcia refers to news articles that show that the federal programme has historically maintained artificial price declines for homeowners, while private insurance has been expensive. However, some materials have also shown that what will happen in the future will still have to be seen as private companies enter the market. In March 2014, Palm Patch Post wrote that supporters of the State Bill \"consider it the beginning of a new era of more flexible and costly special options.\" Ivan Hecket, CEO of Gainesville Business, representing Lloyds of London Trade Unions, told the Wall Street Journal that \"the proposed legislation (federal) seems to allow millions of people who are likely to continue to pay lower prices than the market, with which the private sector does not want to compete.\" But the article also reworded Parrish Patel, Executive Director of HCI Group in Tampa, as saying that \"by carefully choosing houses to cover and mix protection with homeowner policy, HCI can charge fees below the new rates and still make a profit.\" The Governor Garcia's announcement says that \"Korbello supported the raising of flood insurance prices.\" It's hard to imagine a candidate campaigning in Miami and the coastal keys that would have told voters that he wanted to raise their flood insurance bill -- and in fact, Corbello didn't. At the outset, Corbello did not vote on flood insurance at the federal or state level. The Garcia campaign says that if Corbello supports private companies that provide flood insurance, that means he supports higher rates. This is a major distortion. Corbello says he's supporting private companies, and in the hope that competition will lower prices. The payment of private insurance at competitive rates does not pay higher premiums.
