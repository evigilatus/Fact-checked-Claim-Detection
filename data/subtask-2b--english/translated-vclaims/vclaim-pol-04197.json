Mike Pines found himself compelled to defend earlier statements made by his colleague in the ticket, Donald Trump, over and over again. At some point, Tim Kane, a Virginia senator, turned on Pines, saying, \"When Donald Trump says, women, or Mexican rapists and criminals must be punished...\" After some crossword talk, Pines answered, \"Senator, I've taken out that Mexican thing again.\" Ken kept pressing his case, saying, \"Can you defend her?\" Penny: \"There are foreign criminals in this country, Tim, who have come to this country illegally who commit violence and kill Americans.\" Kane: \"Would you like to use a big broad brush against Mexicans for that?\" Penny: \"And he also said, \"A lot of them are good people. \"You keep leaving that out of your quote.\" Unfortunately for Benes, his memory was a little wrong. The exchange focused on the comments made last year by Trump in a speech at the Trump Tower in New York City when his presidential campaign began. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman - January 11, 2012, this is the relevant part of Trump's saying: When Mexico sends its people, they don't send their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They send people with a lot of problems, and they bring these problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. Some, I suppose, are good people.\" Pines has a point that there was more than Trump's comment than just that \"Mexis are rapists and criminals,\" as Ken said during the discussion. In fact, Cain has already taken us to the task of oversimplifying Trump's suspension of Trump Tower. In August, we gave Ken a lie to say that Trump said, \"All Mexicans are rapists.\" But Penny went too far in minimizing Trump's original suspension. According to Pines, Trump said that a lot of Mexicans are \"good people.\" In fact, Trump said \"some\" instead of \"a lot,\" which doesn't seem chivalry. And Trump reduced those feelings by adding \"I suppose so.\" Our governor's penny said that, in his campaign announcement speech, Trump said, \"And many of them (Mexicans) are good people. \"You keep leaving this out of your quote.\" Pines is right that Ken left this part of the commentary out of quote. But the part that Ken left behind isn't exactly as benign as Benes points out. Trump said \"some\" instead of \"a lot,\" and he said, \"I suppose.\" The statement is partially accurate but leaves an important context, so we evaluate it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04197"}
