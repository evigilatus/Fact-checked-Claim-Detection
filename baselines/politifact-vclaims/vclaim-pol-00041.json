We\u2019ve already fact-checked several claims from Illinois politicians \u2014 including Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who is spearheading the push \u2014 about how states with graduated tax systems are functioning.\nLast week, we heard a new one. It was a striking criticism of California, a graduated-tax state, from a suburban Republican lawmaker opposed to Pritzker\u2019s plan.\nDuring a conversation about the graduated income tax on a WCPT-AM talk show, a caller mentioned California in a positive light. In response, GOP state Rep. Mark Batinick of Plainfield, cautioned against using the state as a model for policy in Illinois.\n\"The people being hurt in California \u2014 I think it has 30% or a third of the country\u2019s people living at or below the poverty level,\" Batinick said.\nWhile California\u2019s poverty rate ranks among the nation\u2019s highest, federal data show the state is far from being home to a third of the nation\u2019s poor.\nCensus results\nThe federal government measures poverty several different ways. For comparing poverty figures nationally, the U.S. Census Bureau recommends using data from the Current Population Survey, its official source for national poverty estimates.\nThe survey contradicts Batinick\u2019s claim. California\u2019s share of those in the U.S. living below the poverty line is just over 12%, according to the latest data. That mirrors its share of the nation\u2019s population overall.\nThe Census also releases a supplemental poverty measure, which accounts for cost-of-living \u2014 including taxes, housing, medical costs and non-cash benefits people can put toward their basic needs. Its most recent release gives California a larger share of those living in poverty nationwide, but still falls well below what Batinick said. Here, the math works out to just below 17%.\nResearchers say the supplemental measure does a better job at capturing poverty, but it\u2019s still not perfect \u2014 including for California, where housing costs are high.\nZach Parolin, a research scientist at the Center on Poverty & Social Policy at Columbia University, suggested looking at \"food insecurity\" \u2014 a separate federal ranking measured by the U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2014 to add to the picture of economic hardship in California. When comparing by state how accessible food is for members of households to live active and healthy lives, California performs better than the national average.\nCalifornia vs. Illinois and Batinick\u2019s response\nCalifornia\u2019s graduated income tax starts with a rate of 1% for those making the least and then increases by marginal rates before topping out at 13.3% for earnings over $1 million, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Shimkus\n\n\nstated on June 7, 2016 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When LBJ started\u00a0#WarOnPoverty, 14% of Americans lived in poverty. 50 yrs later, 14% still do. There's a #BetterWay.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Marc Filippino \u2022 July 28, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPritzker's plan \u2014 approved by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly earlier this year \u2014 would tax those making less than $250,000 at the state\u2019s current rate of 4.95%. Rates would go up on earnings above that amount. The highest rate calls for a 7.99% tax on the entire income of single filers who make more than $750,000 and joint filers who earn more than $1 million.\nThe law won\u2019t go into effect unless voters in November 2020 approve a constitutional amendment to permit graduated rates.\nWhen we asked Batinick about the connection he was trying to draw, he told us he was underscoring his general point that California-style policies are not a panacea to the challenges facing Illinois.\nAs for the evidence behind his specific claim about poverty? Batinick acknowledged he was mistaken and said he should have referred to welfare recipients and not people below the poverty line.\nReferencing a 2018 federal report that noted Californians make up 38% of families receiving benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, Batinick said he does not look at California as \"a state that I\u2019m supposed to model.\"\nBut that\u2019s not what Batinick said on-air, where he referred specifically to the poverty line. And some experts we contacted expressed caution about drawing conclusions on poverty in California based on a single program, in part because the money that goes into TANF makes up a relatively small share of government spending in the universe of programs meant to assist people with low incomes.\nOur ruling\nBatinick said California is home to \"30% or a third of the country\u2019s people living at or below the poverty level.\"\nFederal poverty measures show that figure is significantly overblown \u2014 a point Batinick conceded.\nInstead, he said he meant to reference the state\u2019s share of welfare recipients and cited a federal report that noted more than a third of TANF recipients reside in California.\nHowever, that particular federal program is far from the largest or only form of assistance the government provides to low-income individuals to help them with their basic needs. What\u2019s more, it refers to something different than what Batinick originally said.\nWe rate his claim False.\n\nFALSE \u2014 The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00041"}
