He said John Cassish. Kasesh Chuck Todd on NBC meet the Press told that with less crowded space, voters began to hear his message and platform. But he said Trump had surrounded the market in media coverage without spending a cent. \"Guess what? At the grass-roots level, people get it, \"Kasesh said in a previous interview on March 20, 2016, show. \"Now, they didn't get it because, frankly, you put me on the tube so much, but Trump got, you know, $1.8 billion in free media. I got, like, nothing. Okay? We know it feels like every Trump, all the time on TV (and printed and on radio and the Internet) these days. But could Trump have gotten billions of equivalent media coverage, and Casich didn't get almost anything? Let's go to the tape! The media refer to the Kasesh campaign, which confirmed to Poletti Fruitte that he had been referring to analysis by the Quint Media, a media company based in Portland, Or, which partially follows political coverage. The measurements were highlighted in the story of March 15 by The New York Times, which indicated that Quant said that all presidential candidates had been overtaken by the \"earned media\" coverage of $1.898 billion over the past 12 months. :: The acquired media is a coverage that candidates do not have to pay for, such as newspapers, magazine stories, social media articles and television broadcasts. This is different from the paid media, which are mostly campaign announcements that cover markets in an attempt to influence voters, and cost campaigns, high PACS campaigns or special interest groups. MediaQuant follows these signals and then determines the value of the dollar based on the port and the quality of the coverage. This includes assessing whether the coverage is positive, negative or neutral. Trump has achieved a positive coverage of approximately 79 per cent, which is a significant difference compared to Florida X, for example. Marco Rubio &apos; s positive coverage is 40 per cent. When it comes to Trump, even the bad press looks good for the press. \"Negative coverage can prevent a candidate from expanding his alliance, but rarely affects his main supporters -- especially when support is intense, as in the case of Trump,\" said Larry Sabato, Director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. The company did not reply to Polyte Fact by our deadline, but the chief analyst, Officer Paul Senator, told The New York Times that Trump \"has no weakness in any part of the media. We checked Quint's average numbers for ourselves and found that billionaires are leading other candidates on each type of measured coverage, including more than $436 million in coverage only in February. Casi\u0107 suffered literally no coverage, but it was close to anything compared. In the same measurements, Quent said that Cassish had received about $37.7 million of coverage over the past year. With the fall of the GOP field, he moved from the 14th to the Quant Mode in January to the 8th in February. On the democratic side, Quant Media said Hillary Clinton got $746 million in acquired media, while contestant Bernie Sanders got $321 million. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" \u2022 January 19, 2012, these figures contrast largely with the paid coverage purchased by Tramp and Kasi\u0107. The two candidates spent $10 million and $14 million, respectively, in almost the same time frame, as reported by The Times. We will point out that there does not seem to be any other group breaking media coverage in the way Quant does. George Washington University's senior colleague, Califf Letaro, continues to mention television in his 2016 television tracker, but does not measure other media or determine the value of a dollar. (Litaro also follows a male on the Internet in an independent web-based news tracker 2016, but we will focus on the television component.) The TV tracking campaign showed Trump received 46.6 per cent of all television mention for Republican candidates in 2015-16. That's way beyond Cassi\u0107, which got 3.9 percent. The discrepancy between Trump's coverage and its opponents is extraordinary, which has been reported by experts in political campaigns and advertising. While Trump drew attention for the first time because he was new, such as Ross Peru in his independent administration in 1992, the media continued to cover Trump while his campaign gained momentum. This allowed him to promote himself and share his message in ways usually limited to campaign announcements. \"I have not seen a candidate get access to free media/media such as Trump. It's not even close,\" said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg in the e-mail. \"I was struck by the time Trump received it.\" They're doing phone interviews. They're covering all the letters. It looks like it's everywhere. It's very unusual.\" Our judgment, Casi\u0107, said, \"Trump, you know, got $1.8 billion in free media. I got, like, nothing.\" The Governor of Ohio was referring to an analysis by Quant, who measured the so-called media coverage of presidential candidates and gave them a dollar value. Trump has received about $1.9 billion in the past 12 months, while Kasesh has only $37.7 million, according to the media. That's 50 to 1. There seem to be no other media companies performing this analytical function, but experts told us that it looks like Trump is far and far from getting more coverage than his GOP competitors. Casi\u0107 overestimates that it does not receive any coverage, but it does exist, especially when compared with the Lamb. We're mostly assessing this statement right.
