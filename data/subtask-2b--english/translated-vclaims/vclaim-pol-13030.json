One of the political rumors is to attack opponents because of their plans to limit spending on medical care. The Republicans say that they are victims of medical care because Democrats continue to distort their last proposal, a plan to convert medical care into a programme where older persons buy their own health insurance plans and the federal government pays part of the account. The plan will not apply to anyone aged 55 years or over, but will begin for new entrants in 2022. However, it would be a dramatic change from the current system, as the Government pays doctors and hospitals directly. A democracy won a special election near North New York on May 24 after a campaign against the plan, prompting Republicans to complain that Democrats were ruining the plan. Bo-hoo, Democrats say like Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Just last year, the Republicans tried to scare the elderly by telling them that the Health Care Act would limit spending on medical care, as Wasserman Schultz, recently named Chairman of the National Democratic Commission, said. \"It's the pot that calls the black boiler when it comes to whoever co-sponsors Medi,\" said Wasserman Schultz in an interview on MSNBC on May 25. The Republicans who led to the 2010 elections concocted what the Democrats did with medical care. In fact, we have added 12 years of craving to medical care and ensured that it is better for older persons in general. And what the Republicans did under Paul Ryan's plan is actually end medical care as we know it, and turn it into a coupon program. There's no escape.\" We documented a series of Medekari declarations against Democrats during the 2010 election cycle. But we were interested in the most interesting question about whether the Health Care Act had already added 12 years of medical attention. In this case, the solution means that the funds flowing into medical care cover 100 per cent of patient-care bills. We started looking into this issue, and at the beginning, Wasserman Schultz appeared on solid ground. In August 2010, the Board of Medical Care Trustees reported that the Health Care Act had already added 12 years of lactation to part A of medical care, which was the part of medical care covering hospital treatment. It also improved the financial projections for part B, which covers doctors and other care services. The report paid particular tribute to the Democratic Health Care Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which had been promulgated earlier that year. It should be noted that these estimates come with some warnings. The same report states that the projection of health-care costs in the future includes many uncertainties. In addition, the report does not contain possible changes to the current law by Congress, in particular the anticipated increases in payments to doctors known as doctor &apos; s reform. The independent chief actuary for medical care also questioned whether the expected cost savings were realistic. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced verification of the remarkable facts in a story written by General David Berger, US Navy Commander. They rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use Marines to provide security for the launch, and told her that we were \"not working for you.\" The biggest problem in Wassenaar Schultz's statement is that just a few weeks ago, the Board of Trustees released a new report. Instead of adding 12 years of credit, the Council concluded that the law would add only 8 years of credit. From 2024, the programme will require either new income or reduced expenditure to meet all of its obligations. The Board stated that the deficit was due to the continuing economic slowdown, which reduced the tax income of the medical care programme, and some other lower factors. So the Waserman Schultz number is canceled by about one third. However, the general point I made, namely, that the Law on the Health Reform of Democrats added to the public health of medical care, is correct. The 2011 report included the same warnings that estimating future health-care savings was an uncertain process, but also concluded that the financial prospects for medical care \"were significantly improved as a result of changes in the Affordable Care Act.\" The law has reduced spending and increased revenue in several ways. It slows down increases in payments to hospitals and care homes. It raises the taxes of the high-income medical care hospital. It offers several new programmes aimed at guiding the health system away from paying for doctors and hospitals for each action (\"fee for service\") instead paying for good results. And when we called her office, a spokesman said that the number was probably off, but the point was still true. \"The important thing is that Democrats have moved on to a significant extension of the life of the Medical Care Trust Fund while also making extensive improvements in medical care,\" was said by Jonathan Peyton's spokesman. To sum up, Wasserman Schultz said that the Democratic Health Care Act \"added 12 years of medical adequacy.\" It is off the record, citing an older and more optimistic report. The latest estimates indicate that medical care will receive only an additional eight years of lactation, one third less than the previous estimates. However, she was right that the Affordable Care Act had improved the financial prospects for medical care, and that Democrats had succeeded in enacting legislation to limit future spending on the programme. So we evaluate her statement half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13030"}
