He responded by saying that he hadn\u2019t been thanked for forgoing his salary\u00a0and said:\n\"So I\u2019ve learned \u2014 let\u2019s just see what happens because we have to save some of these great companies. They can be great companies, literally, in a matter of weeks. We have to save them.\"\nThe following day, March 23, 2020, a post on Facebook claimed:\n\"Donald Trump would receive $17 million for 3 hotels closed for 4 days under Republican bill! How in the hell is this right?!\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The bill passed 96-0 on March 26 and moved on to the House.\nIn its final form, the Senate bill included a provision, insisted upon by Democrats, to block Trump family businesses \u2014 and those controlled by other senior government officials or their immediate families \u2014 from receiving loan money under the programs.\nThat conflict-of-interest provision applies to the president, the vice president, the head of an executive department, or a member of Congress; and the spouse, child, son-in-law, or daughter-in-law of those officials. Businesses they control are not eligible for money from a $500 billion fund to be set up to provide aid to municipalities, states and businesses that incurred losses as a result of the coronavirus.\nThe president\u2019s real estate empire could still benefit from other parts of the bill, the New York Times reported. Some hotel owners will be eligible for small-business loans, a provision that could potentially help Trump\u2019s company continue to pay wages for its employees. The Trump Organization could also benefit from the $15 billion change to the tax code won by restaurants and retailers, the Times said.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said, \"Donald Trump would receive $17 million for three hotels closed for four days under Republican bill! How in the hell is this right?!\"\nIn discussions about legislation that would provide federal relief to businesses hurt by the coronavirus, Trump did not rule out the possibility that his businesses would apply for such aid. But no GOP bill contained language that would have given hotels owned by the Trump family $17 million. And a relief bill passed by the Senate would actually prohibit businesses owned by Trump, his family, or other top government officials from tapping into a $500 billion pool of aid to businesses, though the Trump hotels could benefit from other provisions of the aid bill.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18212"}
