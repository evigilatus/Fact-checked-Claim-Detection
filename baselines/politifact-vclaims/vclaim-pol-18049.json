The World Health Organization doesn\u2019t track the number of tests administered in each country, and the numbers that are available are constantly updating.\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, a Fox News spokesperson representing Dobbs cited data from the WorldOMeter, a real-time tool that \"shows estimated current numbers based on statistics and projections from the most reputable official organizations,\" according to its website.\nUsing estimates derived from official government sources, the WorldOMeter says at least eight countries \u2014 South Korea, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Finland, Vietnam and Turkey \u2014 have given more tests relative to the size of their populations than the United States.\u00a0\nThat lines up with experts\u2019 analyses and with what multiple news outlets have reported.\u00a0\u00a0\nMarc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said South Korea \"has screened at least thousands, and Guangdong, China, has screened at least hundreds of thousands,\" citing a WHO report on the outbreak in China, where the virus was first detected.\nSouth Korea ramped up testing by building drive-thru screening clinics for speedy assessments, according to local reports. Other countries, like Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Italy have also conducted thousands of diagnostic tests.\n\"We have done nothing like what other countries have done,\" Lipsitch said, noting that the U.S. had, until recently, limited not only the number of labs that were allowed to conduct tests on suspected cases, but also the number of patients that were eligible to be screened.\nIt\u2019s difficult to say just how far behind the U.S. has fallen, due to the murkiness around the number of administered tests. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped releasing a public count of tests on March 2.\nThe administration\u2019s public statements haven\u2019t cleared it up. On Feb. 29, the CDC reported testing 472 Americans. A day later, Azar told ABC News the U.S. had tested over 3,600 people. And a spokesperson for HHS, Azar\u2019s agency, told us on March 3 that the CDC had tested samples from more than 1,200 patients.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Fournier\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know how to track U.S. tests any more,\" Lipsitch said.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar speaks at the White House about the coronavirus on Feb. 28, 2020, in Washington. (AP/Vucci)\nThe CDC stopped posting testing data as more state and local public-health labs have been brought into the fold, said Nancy Messonnier, a top CDC official, said during a March 3 briefing.\n\"With more and more testing done at states, these numbers would not be representative of the testing being done nationally,\" she said.\nAn HHS spokesperson told us that the department doesn\u2019t know how many additional tests have been administered by those state and local labs, adding that those labs can now test up to 15,000 people and are expected to be able to test as many as 75,000 people by March 6.\nThe U.S. test count should rise into the millions as IDT, a commercial manufacturer, and other commercial and academic labs begin producing their own tests soon, according to HHS.\nWhy the United States lagged behind\nThe government\u2019s initial testing effort was hindered by flaws with the CDC\u2019s early test kits and restrictions that had limited which labs could run the tests and which patients could be tested.\nWhen the first U.S. coronavirus was detected, the country brushed aside the WHO test used by other nations and leaned on the CDC to develop and mass produce a more complicated test capable of detecting other viruses in addition to the coronavirus, according to reports.\nThe test kits went out in early February. But some state labs that received them reported that flaws in the tests were triggering inconclusive results. Those states had to ship samples out to the CDC\u2019s offices in Atlanta for results until the CDC fixed the problem weeks later.\nSince then, the Food and Drug Administration has given labs and hospitals across the country the go-ahead to administer their own tests before the FDA finishes reviewing them, so long as those tests are proven to work. That should lead to more testing, experts said.\nThe CDC also modified its screening criteria to expand testing for some people with severe respiratory symptoms who did not travel to China or come into known contact with a coronavirus patient. Previously, travel to China or exposure to the virus were preconditions for screening.\nAdequate testing is essential to getting an accurate count of U.S. cases, experts said.\nTesting is also key for treating patients and identifying people who might be infected but don\u2019t show symptoms, said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\"The latest data suggests the incubation period for COVID-19 can be as long as a couple of weeks,\" Watanabe said.\u00a0\nDespite the recent acceleration, Lipsitch said U.S. testing is happening \"very slowly and at a level that is still paltry\" compared with some other countries.\nOur ruling\nDobbs said that the United States is \"actually screening fewer people (for the coronavirus than other countries) because we don\u2019t have appropriate testing.\"\nExperts told us that to date, the United States has lagged behind other countries, though numbers are imprecise. An error with the CDC\u2019s early test kits contributed to the United States\u2019 relatively low screening numbers. The administration has taken steps to make testing more widely available.\nWith that additional information, we rate Dobbs\u2019 statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18049"}
