And guess what? I did the very best.\"\n\nNationally, at the end of February 2012, Obama was outpacing each of the Republican hopefuls in one-on-one matchup polls, according to aggregations of results by RealClearPolitics.com. The \"spread\" was smallest for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (4-point lead for Obama), followed by former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum (5-point lead for Obama) and Paul (6.6-point lead for Obama). Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was the furthest behind Obama, down 12.4 points.\n\nBut did Paul accurately recap an Iowa poll?\n\nPaul spokesman Gary Howard told us that Paul was referring to a Des Moines Register poll, the results of which the newspaper wrote about on its website Feb. 19, 2012.\n\nSelzer & Co., a West Des Moines firm, conducted the telephone survey of 800 Iowans Feb. 12-15, 2012. As part of the poll, 611 likely voters were asked to indicate who they would vote for in matchups between Obama and each of the four major Republican candidates. The questions were phrased this way: \"If the election for president were held today, and the candidates were Barack Obama for the Democrats and (name of GOP candidate) for the Republicans, for whom would you vote?\"\n\nThe results show all the candidates except Gingrich beating Obama in Iowa, with Paul winning by the greatest margin, as noted in the Register\u2019s articles.\n\nThe details:\n\n** Paul 49 percent, Obama 42 percent (7-point difference)\n** Santorum 48, Obama 44 (4-point difference)\n** Romney 46, Obama 44 (2-point difference)\n** Gingrich 37, Obama 51 (14-point difference)\n\nStraightforward, right?\n\nNot entirely. Interviews of pollsters led us to realize that there\u2019s at least debate over the significance of the poll\u2019s margin of error, which for the matchup questions in the Iowa Poll was plus or minus four percentage points.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMargins of error hint at every poll\u2019s built-in weakness: It\u2019s impossible to survey every voter.\n\nIn a write-up about polling, Selzer & Co. President J. Ann Selzer defines the margin of error as the estimated difference between a percentage obtained from a survey of a sample of voters \u2014 for example, the 49 percent in the Iowa Poll who said they would vote for Paul in a contest with Obama \u2014 and the percentage the firm theoretically would find if it interviewed every likely voter in the state.\n\nShe explains further: Consider, she says, a report from her firm that a candidate has captured 60 percent of the vote in a survey with a margin of error of plus or minus four points. That means, she says, that if the survey were repeated in the same way at the same time with different samples of voters, 95 percent of the time, the percentage of support for the candidate would fall between 56 percent and 64 percent (a range of four more and four less than the reported percentage).\n\nApplying the margin of error in the Iowa Poll\u2019s matchup questions demonstrates how much the actual results could swing.\n\nFor Paul vs. Obama, the possibilities range from a 15-point Paul lead \u2014 Paul 53 (reported result plus four), Obama 38 (result minus four) \u2014 to a 1-point Obama lead \u2014 Paul 45 (result minus four), Obama 46 (result plus four).\n\nFor Santorum vs. Obama, the matchup range goes from a 12-point Santorum lead (Santorum 52, Obama 40) to a 4-point Obama lead (Santorum 44, Obama 48).\n\nFor Romney vs. Obama, the range is from a 10-point Romney lead to a 6-point Obama lead.\n\nAnd for Gingrich, the possibilities range from a 6-point Obama lead to a 22-point Obama lead.\n\nWe asked five polling experts about Paul\u2019s characterization of the Iowa results. There was no argument from anyone that Paul had accurately recapped the poll\u2019s reported results.\n\nStill, Charlie Leonard, a visiting professor at Southern Illinois University who conducts polls for the school\u2019s Paul Simon Public Policy Institute, told us that in his view, there\u2019s no statistical difference between Paul and Santorum\u2019s performance against Obama.\n\nHowever, Selzer, head of the firm that conducted the poll, aligned with Paul\u2019s interpretation of the results. She said the best estimate of Paul\u2019s support \u2014 and that of the other Republicans and Obama \u2014 is the percentage found during the survey and reported in the poll. She acknowledged that Paul\u2019s percentage of support, for example, could be one, two, three or four points lower \u2014 or higher \u2014 than 49 in a matchup with Obama. But, she said, technically speaking, that\u2019s less likely to be the case, because each point you move away from the reported number has a lower probability of being true.\n\nJim Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas and co-director of joint polling projects for the university and the Texas Tribune, described the difference between the Paul-Obama and Santorum-Obama matchup as marginal and said Paul\u2019s statement \"ignores the underlying statistics of those numbers\" while being literally correct. Henson\u2019s take on the margin of error: \"What it tells you is that the most probable outcome is the two numbers (reported in the poll), and the farther you go off those numbers, the less likely they are to be true \u2014 but they might be.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nPaul had the largest lead on Obama of any of the major Republicans in matchup polling in Iowa in February 2012. Still, experts raised questions about how statistically certain that conclusion is, considering how close the poll\u2019s results were. To us, that is additional information needed to evaluate Paul\u2019s claim, and so, his statement rates Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11510"}
