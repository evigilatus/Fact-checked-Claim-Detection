Richard Burr\u2019s seat representing North Carolina in the U.S. Senate, has repeatedly said Burr is a consummate Washington insider.\nThis summer she claimed that Burr \"took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks.\" We rated that Half True.\nMore recently, she has been claiming Burr voted against a bill that would\u2019ve banned members of Congress from insider trading.\n\"It is a fact that Sen. Burr was one of only three senators who voted against a ban on insider trading for members of Congress,\" Ross said in their recent debate. \"And he called that vote brave.\"\nBurr doesn\u2019t deny the vote in question, but he repeatedly said it\u2019s being blown way out of proportion. He defended his actions in 2012 after the vote, and again last month at his debate with Ross.\nWe wondered what the real story was.\nInsider trading\nInsider trading is when someone uses non-public information to buy or sell stocks to maximize profit. Depending on the circumstances, it can be legal or illegal.\nIn April 2012, the STOCK Act \u2013 which stands for Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge \u2013 specifically said lawmakers could not use their insider knowledge to trade stocks. It also created several new or stronger ethics and transparency provisions for members of Congress and their staffs.\nPresident Obama asked Congress to pass the bill in his 2012 State of the Union address. A few months later, he got his wish and signed it into law with much fanfare. It was a rare moment of bipartisan celebration, although Ross is right that Burr was one of three holdouts.\nBurr said insider trading was already illegal, so there was no need to pass another law singling out members of Congress.\n\"It is illegal, in law, even for Congress, to trade on insider trading,\" Burr said in response to Ross\u2019 barb at their debate. \"That\u2019s the reason I opposed the STOCK Act. North Carolinians did not send me to Washington to duplicate existing law, and that\u2019s in fact what the STOCK Act did.\"\nBurr, however, is wrong to speak so definitively about that claim.\nLegal confusion\nThere is no statutory definition of when exactly insider trading becomes illegal, so it\u2019s often up to individual judges or investigators to decide.\nWhile Congress was never specifically exempted from insider trading rules, there was widespread disagreement in the legal and financial communities over what officials could or couldn\u2019t do.\nIf you\u2019re in the mood for a 59-page legal analysis of the differing opinions, read this 2011 paper. Or, here\u2019s a brief synopsis: Some people said the law applied to everyone in Congress. Some\u00a0said elected officials had to abide by insider trading laws, but their staffers did not. Some said both elected officials and their staffs were exempt.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the Securities and Exchange Commission is in charge of policing insider trading, we decided to see what its officials thought at the time. Unfortunately, two high-level officials gave opposite interpretations of the law.\nFormer SEC CEO Arthur Levitt said in 2010 that elected officials and their staffers \"benefit from an exemption that the average investor doesn\u2019t benefit from. They\u2019re immune from insider trading laws.\" However, former SEC director of enforcement Robert Khuzami said in 2011 that neither elected officials nor their staffers were \"exempt from the federal securities laws, including the insider trading prohibitions.\"\nSo\u00a0the STOCK Act at least cleared up confusion from 2012 onward. And at best, it made real changes.\nCongressional suspicions\nRegardless of the lack of clarity in the law, we do know that members of Congress and their staffers routinely made timely trades centered around upcoming policy decisions.\nOne 2004 paper found that senators who made stock trades outperformed the market by an impressive 12 percent, on average.\n\"Since even the best hedge-fund managers find it hard to achieve comparable results, we must conclude that these senators either are better than hedge-fund managers, or that they benefit from privileged information,\" Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, wrote in 2011.\nZingales said it was his opinion that members of Congress did participate in insider trading, \"despite the potential cost to their reputations.\"\nIn 2010 the Wall Street Journal investigated allegations of insider trading by congressional staffers. It found dozens of aides on both sides of the aisle had invested tens of\u00a0thousands of dollars in stocks that soon benefitted from their bosses\u2019 policy decisions.\nOne aide nearly doubled his investment in a renewable energy company just before his boss pushed for a new law that benefitted companies like it. Another aide bought thousands of dollars worth of Bank Of America stock just before a report \u2013 which her boss was involved in \u2013 found in the bank\u2019s favor and sent stock prices surging.\nOther parts of the STOCK Act\nYet even if Burr is right that insider trading laws applied to Congress that whole time \u2013 and it appears no one knows the real answer to that \u2013 he\u2019s still not correct that the law was purely duplicative.\nThe STOCK Act also strengthened the power of ethics investigators in Congress and expanded transparency requirements \u2013 although Congress quietly rolled back the transparency requirements within a year of passing the original bill.\nBut is Ross also right that Burr called himself brave for voting against the STOCK Act? Yes, and we found the transcript of his remarks on Burr\u2019s own website.\n\"It's ludicrous,\" Burr said in a February 2012 radio interview, while discussions over the bill were still ongoing. \"That's why Dr. Tom Coburn (a Republican senator from Oklahoma) and I were the two brave souls that walked up and said we shouldn't be doing this.\"\nBurr and Coburn joined with Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico in casting the only \u2018no\u2019 votes when the bill passed the Senate 96-3.\nOur ruling\nRoss said Burr \"was one of only three senators who voted against a ban on insider trading for members of Congress. And he called that vote brave.\"\nShe\u2019s right about Burr\u2019s vote and the fact that Burr called it brave. What\u2019s less clear is whether the STOCK Act simply clarified the law regarding insider trading in Congress, or made actual changes. Regardless, the law did make other changes that Burr ignores when he says his opposition was because the bill was totally duplicative.\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03971"}
