Rick Perry\u2019s pitch in a radio ad for California businesses to check out Texas, a Sacramento Bee editorial published Feb. 6, 2013, mocks the Lone Star State by saying: \"Come check out a state that ranks first in the number of executions, first in the number of uninsured\" \u2014 and so on.\n\nWe\u2019re tackling each of the Bee editorial board\u2019s Texas-centric factual pokes and stacking our findings here.\n\nWe\u2019ve confirmed that Texas is first in executions. For this story, we\u2019re looking into the number of uninsured Texans.\n\nStuart Leavenworth, who oversees the Bee\u2019s editorial page, pointed out web postings by the Kaiser Family Foundation indicating how many residents of each state have health coverage.\n\nNationally in 2011, the foundation estimates, some 16 percent of the population was uninsured.\n\nIn Texas in 2011, the foundation says, 24 percent of residents had no health insurance \u2014 and that was the highest uninsured rate for any state. Some 22 percent of Nevada residents and 21 percent of New Mexico residents lacked coverage, according to the foundation, while California and Louisiana were among five states where 20 percent of the population was uninsured.\n\nThe foundation cites as a basis for these percentages household surveys by the U.S Census Bureau, which suggest slightly different levels of the uninsured dependent on whether the cited survey is a one-day snapshot or one that encompasses several years.\n\nRegardless, Texas has consistently had the highest uninsured rate.\n\nDoes it also have the greatest number of uninsured, as the editorial says?\n\nNot so.\n\nAnother foundation chart indicates that California had 7.3 million uninsured residents, and Texas had more than 6.1 million. Of course, California\u2019s population exceeds Texas\u2019 by some 12 million.\n\nSeparately, we found a lower tally for Californians under age 65 who lack coverage in a December 2012 article by Paul Fronstin of the Washington-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, which says its mission is to enhance the development of sound public policy through objective research and education.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA summary of that article opens: \"In 2011, California had the largest number of people under age 65 without health insurance \u2014 7.1 million \u2014 of any U.S. state. The percentage of uninsured Californians has risen steadily over the past two decades; the state now has the seventh-largest percentage of residents without coverage in the United States.\" The summary says, though, that the state\u2019s share of uninsured residents should drop as the federal law known as Obamacare takes full effect.\n\nBy email, Fronstin agreed California has more uninsured than Texas, pointing to his own analysis of Census Bureau survey research released in March 2012. Still, he said, 27 percent of Texans under 65 are uninsured, compared with 22 percent of Californians.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe editorial says Texas ranks first among the states in its number of uninsured.\n\nTexas continues to have \u00a0the nation\u2019s greatest share of uninsured residents. However, California has about 1 million more uninsured residents. This claim has an element of truth, yet it\u2019s wrong on the numbers. Mark it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09720"}
