A \"golden years\" announcement aimed at senior voters claiming that Golden would steal their golden years to pay for his reckless agenda. Here's the National Refugee Council's full announcement: \"They call it golden years, when you're supposed to enjoy the life you've worked so hard to build. But the politician Jared Golden wants to turn your golden years into hiss. Golden supports a reckless bill to end medical care as we know it. It supports the use of your social security to finance other government programmes. Jared Golden is stealing your golden years to pay for his reckless agenda. Older persons in Maine cannot take this risk.\" The \"incomplete\" bill referred to in the Declaration is the proposal of Bernie Sanders \"Mediccare for all,\" which Golden said he supported, after improvements in the Affordable Care Act. The conservatives continue to say that such a system would end medical care \"as we know it\" by establishing a new government-funded programme open to all, not just those 65 and above. (See this verification of facts.) Here, we'll focus on the accusation that Golden supports the use of your social security to fund other government programs. The claim is based on the one-time support of Golden for a state-wide referendum, often referred to as \"home care for all,\" which will appear in the polls in Maine in November 6. This initiative would raise taxes on wealthier rulers to help pay for a comprehensive home care programme. While there is debate about who the tax will affect, it has no direct connection to social security, will not lead to loss of benefits for people, and is not supported by gold in its present form. The citizens &apos; referendum will finance a home-care programme for the elderly and disabled through the introduction of a high income tax in the State. It will also establish a State Council for the Management of Funds. The voting question seeks to finance the system by adding an additional 3.8 per cent tax on income in excess of $128,400. The home care programme in Maine will be paid for through income collection from households with incomes in excess of $128,400. The funds will be managed by a board composed of industry representatives and home care recipients. This effort is intended to solve a long-term problem in Maine's home health care system, where, according to the Ministry of Labour in Maine, assistants make an average age of $12.41. It should also be noted that Maine ranks first as the oldest state in the country, according to the United States Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Office in 2017, which found that the average age in Maine was 44.6 and has not changed in the first place since 2016. How does this affect social security? That's not gonna happen. The closest link is the threshold at which Maine &apos; s home care tax will be levied on income in excess of $128,400. This is because the Government finances social security through income taxes amounting to $128,400. On 13 January 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, said that they had rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to provide security for the inauguration, and told her that \"we are not working for you.\" The group referred to a newspaper article in May 2018 with a golden pen in the Portland Press Herald. \"If you're like more than 98 percent of the people in this state, you already pay a tax on all the income you earn to finance social security, and your employer does the same thing,\" Golden wrote in the opinion article. However, individuals to whom more than $128,400 is paid annually do not currently pay any social security tax on an income higher than that amount. The referendum will ask them to pay a little more than their fair share of all their income, as the rest of us do.\" But Golden's campaign said he wrote that before the language changed in the final version of the bill. In fact, gold no longer supports the bill, as it can apply to families that earn more than $128,800 a year instead of individuals. The head of the Golden John Brad campaign told us that while Golden believes that there is a growing problem in Maine's home health-care system, he \"does not agree that families with incomes above $128,000 should face a tax increase of 3.8 per cent.\" Since the language of the draft law has changed, several analyses have concluded that this measure includes married couples who make joint applications. The Committee also referred to a report on the proposal made by the Main Economic Policy Centre, a left-wing research and policy organization. At some stage of the analysis, he says that \"workers will ask whether they will partially close the social security tax gap to finance a comprehensive home-care programme.\" The report states that the initiative will be the first of its kind in the country, creating a new tax structure for high-income workers who raise taxes in terms of leakage of social security taxes. The tax also applies to unpaid income, which is currently not subject to taxes of the type charged on salaries. What does all this mean for social security? Not much, because the threshold is the only link between the referendum and social security. The home care programme will be funded through a new tax on high-income people, not social security. In our ruling, the National Republican Campaign Committee said (Golden) \"to support the use of your social security to finance other government programs.\" The group refers to Golden's support prior to the state referendum, which will appear in the Mayan ballot and which will carry out a tax on the richest Mainers to finance the home care programme. (Golden's campaign says that it is no longer supported by a recent change.) The programme will not result in reductions in social security. The National Reconciliation Commission has distorted a weak link, as the Maine tax will be levied above the current social security limit of $128,400. Again, this will not lead to a reduction in social security benefits for older persons. We evaluate it with pants on fire.
