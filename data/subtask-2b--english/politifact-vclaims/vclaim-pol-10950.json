Deval Patrick of Massachusetts to argue as proxies on the relative merits of the candidates for president.\n\nHoping to give a boost to GOP nominee Mitt Romney, Kasich laid into President Barack Obama\u2019s argument that Republicans in Congress are blocking his moves at every turn and undercutting his agenda.\n\nCiting his own experience in Ohio, Kasich said the key is to take the \"terrible\" politics in Washington D.C. and forge a bipartisan road.\n\n\"When I started in Ohio, it was terrible,\" he told host David Gregory. \"We\u2019re now getting bipartisan support for our bills. And that's called leadership.\"\n\nWas Kasich right? PolitiFact Ohio looked at a previous claim by Kasich in 2011 that there had been some \"significant\" bipartisan accomplishments during his first year in office and rated that True. But this statement was more sweeping. PolitiFact Ohio decided to pull the voting records and see what they showed.\n\nWe started out by determining what bills could be fairly described as Kasich administration initiatives as opposed to something lawmakers may have wanted to do.\n\nAfter consulting with an informal trio of PolitiFact Ohio Statehouse reporters, we came up with eight key bills in Kasich\u2019s first year that are fairly described as his babies: the state operating budget, the state transportation budget, the JobsOhio economic development board bill, a business regulation reform bill, a sentencing reform bill, a collective bargaining reform bill (known as Senate Bill 5), a bill cracking down on pill mills and a measure allowing oil and gas drilling in state parks.\n\nBefore revealing the results, we should note that Kasich\u2019s fellow Republicans hold the advantage over Democrats in both the House (59-40) and the Senate (23-10).\n\nSo for those eight bills from 2011, we found that on the average, they received 17 House Democratic votes out of a possible 40 and four Senate Democratic votes of a possible 10. On half of the votes in the House, the Kasich bills received three or fewer votes -- which is less than 10 percent of the Democratic votes that could have been obtained. And half of the time in the Senate, the Kasich bills received no Senate votes.\n\nAmong the bills receiving scant support from either Democratic caucus were the controversial collective bargaining reform legislation, which no Democrats voted for, and Kasich\u2019s state budget, which received only three House Democratic votes.\n\nNext, we looked at bills that Kasich has pushed in his second year as governor. After again consulting our informal panel, we came up with seven key bills Kasich has been the driving force behind in 2012. They are the collateral sanctions bill, a Lake Erie water usage bill, a second JobsOhio economic development package as well as four bills that were part of what Kasich called his mid-budget review, or MBR. The MBR bills were wide-ranging rewrites of Ohio law or leftover initiatives which the Kasich administration wasn\u2019t ready to roll out in his main state budget in 2011 covering education, energy, tax policy and a catch-all bill covering various areas of administration policy.\n\nFor those seven bills, we found on the average that Kasich received 26 House Democratic votes out of a possible 40 and five Senate Democratic votes out of a possible 10. (Please note that those averages are based on six votes per chamber as each chamber hasn\u2019t voted on one of the seven bills listed.) With the exception of the Lake Erie water use bill, which received a single Democratic vote in the House, we found that Kasich received at least 16 House Democratic votes for all of his other initiatives.\n\nIn the Senate, Kasich\u2019s bills in 2012 didn\u2019t get much more support than his bills in 2011, although he was blanked only once instead of four times.\n\nKasich spokesman Rob Nichols said the clearest example of Kasich\u2019s point is to compare the state budget vote in 2011 (no \u00a0Democratic votes in either the House or the \u00a0Senate) to the mid-budget review package of 2012 (an average of 23 House Democratic votes and five Senate Democratic votes). \"Things are much better than they were back then,\" he said in terms of getting bipartisan support.\n\nSo where does this leave us as the dust settled?\n\nWhen Kasich appeared on \"Meet the Press\" to bash Obama, he wanted to draw a sharp contrast between the gridlock in Washington and what he sees as his record in Ohio. He said that when he started in Ohio, the political atmosphere was \"terrible\" but \"now we\u2019re getting bipartisan support for our bills.\"\n\nOur math does show that Kasich is getting more support for his key bills in 2012 than when he began his term -- 26 House Democratic votes compared to 16 and five Senate Democratic votes instead of four. Furthermore, the Democratic shutouts for Kasich have dropped off sharply in his second year.\n\nHowever, Kasich appears to have overstated the Democratic opposition to his initiatives when he came into office in 2011.\n\nIt is true that almost all Democrats opposed his state budget, and no Democrats voted for the controversial rewrite of Ohio\u2019s collective bargaining laws, but at least some Democrats supported most of the other initiatives sought by Kasich in 2011.\n\nWe find that to be additional information that puts Kasich\u2019s statement into a clearer context.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, Kasich\u2019s statement rates Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10950"}
