Matt Caldwell says", "text": "As the Florida legislature neared the finish line this spring, some legislators were in a hurry to increase the speed limit on major highways to 75 mph. But there was plenty of debate about whether the state should put on the brakes.\nSB 392 cleared the Senate, but the House was split during its April 30 debate, with many arguing that the bill was moving too fast. House sponsor Rep. Matt Caldwell, R-Lehigh Acres, waved off opponents, disputing concerns that the higher speed posed a danger. (The legislation eventually passed 58-56.)\n\"I have yet to see any incontrovertible proof that speed, in and of itself, is the contributing factor to increasing fatalities,\" he said.\nWe wondered: Is speed alone a factor in higher car crash fatalities? Let\u2019s take this claim for a test drive.\nPedal to the metal\nThe first thing to note about the legislation is that it doesn\u2019t decree an increase in the current 70 mph limit. Rather, Caldwell said, it allows the Florida Department of Transportation the ability to raise limits as high as 75 if they deem that advisable under the right conditions.\nSo how do engineers determine the proper speed limit? They use something called the 85th percentile rule, a widely accepted formula that dictates the safest speed is the one at which 85 percent of drivers travel. (You can read more about the 85th percentile rule here.)\nCaldwell said that considering the speeds at which most Floridians travel, and given normal conditions (sunny, dry roads, etc.), 75 was an acceptable limit. And he argued that raising the speed alone was not going to increase fatalities.\n\"There\u2019s certainly a huge correlation between speed and accidents,\" he told PolitiFact Florida. \"The real question is whether that\u2019s the real cause of accidents.\"\nFactoring in more factors\nWe checked with the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration and the Florida Department of Highway Safety, which both referred us to the Florida Highway Patrol, since they\u2019re the ones who would have to deal with future increases in state speed limits.\nPublic affairs officer Steve Gaskins said the FHP had reached out to other states that increased their speed limits and didn\u2019t find a dramatic impact impact on the number of fatal crashes.\nGaskins said there were three other factors that caused crashes:\n-- Impairment (drunken or drugged driving)\n-- Distraction (texting, talking, putting on makeup, etc.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 30, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump assassination foiled, Deep State in panic mode!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 4, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- Aggressiveness (swerving, road rage and so on)\nRuss Rader, the vice president of communications of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said it was wrong to discount the effects of speed on a crash. He pointed specifically to a 2002 study that said 23 states that raised limits to 70 or 75 mph ended up with 35 and 38 percent more deaths per million vehicle miles traveled, respectively.\nBut Rader acknowledged while speed is a problem, it\u2019s not usually the only problem in fatal accidents.\n\"Crashes rarely have a solo cause. But higher speeds exacerbate other factors,\" he said. \"It\u2019s clear from decades of research that when speed limits go up, crash risk goes up, and the crashes that happen are more likely to be deadly.\"\nThe Council of State Governments in 2013 noted that while lawmakers and researchers can agree higher speeds cause more deadly accidents because of the physics involved, \"Intense debate still surrounds the idea that speed-limit hikes alone make roadways more dangerous.\"\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported last year that the number of speeding-related deaths through 2011 has been dropping steadily, but maintained a steady 31 or 32 percent of total fatal accidents over several years.\nMichael Knodler, associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst College of Engineering, agreed that blaming speed increases alone is a difficult way to frame a public safety discussion.\n\"This is certainly something up for debate. If you backed me into a corner I could defend either case,\" he said.\nSpeed variance is a much more pertinent issue in fatal accidents, he said. If the speed limit is 70 and everyone\u2019s going 90, for example, the difference in the speed among cars is the dangerous factor.\nKnodler did stop short at Caldwell\u2019s use of \"incontrovertible,\" though, saying the concrete physics of increased speed proves that speed does cause more fatalities in accidents.\nThose two concerns -- differences in speed and the effects of higher speeds on the severity of accidents -- still don\u2019t mean more fatal accidents will happen, University of Kentucky transportation engineering professor Reginald Souleyrette told PolitiFact Florida.\nSouleyrette worked on a 2005-10 study of Iowa\u2019s move to increase their speed limit to 70. Initial findings showed there was a slight increase in fatal and serious accidents, but in the long run crash rates went down.\n\"If what the representative implies is true, there should be no speed limit at all. \u2026 He is correct if he is implying that we should set \u2018appropriate\u2019 speed limits. There is no magic safe speed,\" Souleyrette said.\nOur ruling\nCaldwell said he had \"yet to see any incontrovertible proof that speed, in and of itself, is the contributing factor to increasing fatalities.\"\nTraffic studies and experts agree that higher speeds can lead to more fatalities in accidents, which makes Caldwell\u2019s use of the word \"incontrovertible\" suspect. But opinions diverge when discussing whether higher speeds are the cause of those fatal accidents.\nSpeed is no doubt a factor in accidents, but it\u2019s rarely considered the factor leading to fatal crashes.\nWe rate his statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07872"}
