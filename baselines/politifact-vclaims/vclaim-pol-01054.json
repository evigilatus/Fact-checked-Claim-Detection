And that\u2019s because it\u2019s not a photo of a principal named Mamasai Mamakusa.\nA search of the Richmond Public Schools directory didn\u2019t turn up any Mamsai Mamakusas. But we didn\u2019t expect it to after noticing the photo of the woman also has a watermark: the word \"alamy.\" Alamy is a stock photo website, and we found the photo in question on the third page of results after searching for \"woman\" \"hijab\" and \"computer.\"\nThe caption says: \"Smiling young Muslim female entrepreneur wearing a hijab sitting in her home office working online with a laptop.\"\nThere are a series of photos of the woman, wearing the same outfit and head scarf, with various captions like: \"Confident young Arabic female entrepreneur wearing a hijab working on a laptop while sitting at a tabler in her kitchen,\" and \"smiling young Arabic woman wearing hijab and sitting in her kitchen at home.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 7, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 8, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are not sure who originated this\u00a0post. But the same image that appeared on Facebook on Jan. 30 also surfaced on the platform in July 2018. It was posted by America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, an account that notes everything it shares is false. \"Nothing on this page is real,\" it says. \"Not a bit.\"\nWe looked for news coverage of a Richmond principal expelling students for wearing crucifixes. Among the many search results was an article about a principal of an elementary school there who was ousted over the summer amid a standardized testing scandal. The Tampa Bay Times reported in 2017 about a complaint that a Florida teacher banned students from wearing Christian cross necklaces. In England in 2007, a school ordered a Catholic student to remove her necklace, according to the Evening Standard. But we found no stories about a Virginia principal kicking kids out of school because of a crucifix.\nIf the supposed principal\u2019s name sounds familiar, it\u2019s not from the news.
