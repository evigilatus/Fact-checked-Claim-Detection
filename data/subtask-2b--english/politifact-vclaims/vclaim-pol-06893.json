Bush, the former Texas governor, saying \"family values do not stop at the Rio Grande\u2026 People are coming to our country to do jobs that Americans won\u2019t do to be able to feed their families. And I think there\u2019s a humane way to recognize that, at the same time protect our borders,\" Bush said, \"and at the same way to make sure we don\u2019t disadvantage those who have stood in line for years to become a legal citizen.\"\nTodd asked: \"Do you agree with that statement?\"\nAbbott replied: \"In a way I understand this even more powerfully because my wife is going to be the first Hispanic first lady in the history of Texas. And Texas has had a long tradition of uniting the Hispanic culture with Texas values.\"\nAbbott, the state attorney general, talked up his wife making history for months on the campaign trail in 2014, perhaps to good effect. In July 2014, PolitiFact Texas found the state\u2019s population was 38.4 percent Hispanic, the second biggest demographic after whites, who make up 40 percent. Notably too, the flags that have flown over Texas include the banners of Spain and Mexico.\nAnd has there previously not been a Hispanic first lady of Texas? Not since statehood, it appears.\nBut we started our look into Abbott's claim by looking into the next first lady\u2019s roots.\nThe next First Lady\nAbbott aides didn\u2019t respond to our inquiries into how Abbott decided his wife was breaking ground.\nWe looked for clues on Ancestry.com, the online genealogy database, which led us to information credited to the 1940 United States Federal Census indicating Cecilia Phalen Abbott, the governor-elect\u2019s wife, is the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants--Leonara and Augustine Segura--who settled in San Antonio before 1935.\nWe shortly confirmed the validity of those census records on a federal website that included a chart showing Maria de la Luz Segura, Cecilia Abbott\u2019s mother, was born in 1935 in San Antonio, where she lived with her parents, grandparents and siblings.\nWe also uncovered census data for Cecilia Abbott\u2019s father, William Joseph Phalen--born in Michigan in 1933 to parents from Ohio and New York and then raised in Houston. According to Ancestry.com, Phalen is an Irish family name, most common in the state of New York.\nNext, we turned to how best to define an Hispanic first lady.\nWhat\u2019s Hispanic?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy phone, Erika Arredondo-Haskins of the Hispanic Heritage Center of Texas in San Antonio, told us the word \"Hispanic\" describes anyone who can trace ancestry to Spanish culture, including through the Spanish colonies in the Americas that once stretched from California to the southern tip of South America.\nAlso, Haskins suggested, Texas history predates statehood and its earlier status as as a free-standing republic to when the region was ruled by Mexico and, before that, Spain and there were numerous Hispanic first ladies. She singled out Maria Perez Cassiano, wife of the governor of the Spanish province Coahuila and Texas from 1814 to 1823. Cassiano was born in San Antonio in 1790, descended from Spanish immigrants who arrived in San Antonio in 1731, and was known for performing the governor\u2019s duties in his absence, Haskins said.\nHaskins\u2019 comments reminded us of a complicating detail: Texas fell under various successive governments since Europeans arrived in the 1500s--it\u2019s been a province of New Spain, a Mexican province, a republic, a U.S. state and a Confederate state.\nAccording to Texas A&M University\u2019s \"Sons of DeWitt Colony Texas,\" a Texas history research group, there were 29 governors of Texas from 1691 to 1821. Among first ladies in that period, Augustina Cant\u00fa was the wife of Alonso de Leon, the first governor of Texas who established the state\u2019s modern eastern border at the Sabine River, according to the Handbook of Texas, a project of the Texas State Historical Association. Also, the handbook says, Ignacia Xaviera was the wife of Marques de San Miguel de Aguayo, Texas governor from 1719-1722, who drove the French from East Texas.\nFirst Ladies since Texas won independence from Mexico\nMore Hispanic women were first ladies in the period following the Texas Revolution, when immigrants from the United States broke away from Mexico.\n\n\nLaurie Jasinski, research editor at The Handbook of Texas, said by phone she reviewed a list of first ladies since the Republic of Texas\u2019s independence from Mexico in 1836 and did not find mention of anyone with Hispanic roots. She also recommended we visit the Legislative Reference Library at the Texas Capitol for a full answer.\nAt the library, we reviewed the book First Ladies of Texas, which includes biographies of Texas first ladies, born between 1836 and 1936, of the Republic of Texas, the state of Texas, and the Confederate state of Texas. (Texas became a state in 1845.) None of the 37 first ladies listed in the book had roots in former Spanish colonies. Most came from southeastern states of the United States (interestingly, less than half were born in Texas).\nFour recent first ladies dwelt in the governor\u2019s mansion after the book\u2019s publication in 1976--Rita Crocker Clements, Linda Gale White, Laura Welch Bush and Anita Thigpen Perry. Online biographical sketches for each first lady, published by Texas A&M University, Texas Woman\u2019s University, The White House and the website of Gov. Rick Perry, respectively, revealed no Hispanic roots among them. Drawing from our research, we\u2019ve listed Texas first ladies here.\nOur ruling\nGreg Abbott said his wife would be \"the first Hispanic first lady in the history of Texas.\"\nCecilia Abbott, with Hispanic roots through her mother and grandmother, will be the first Hispanic first lady since statehood, which we take Abbott to be saying. Other Hispanic women were first ladies only before Texas was a state.\nWe rate this claim True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06893"}
