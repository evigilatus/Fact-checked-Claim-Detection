The common assertion can be found throughout the Internet, and one Facebook article shares an undescribed quote that makes the bold claim that \"every\" has a \"very acid\" hydrogen ass. It continues to be said that the late Dr. Otto Warburg, a well-known cancer researcher, won the Nobel Prize to prove the relationship between acid and cancer. The article begins by quoting: \"Every single person with cancer has excessive acidification, and then says Warburg received the Nobel Prize in 1931 to prove that cancer cannot survive in a alkaline-rich environment but thrives in a low-oxygen acidic environment.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let's get to the point: that's not accurate. Dr. Otto Warburg has already won the Nobel Prize in 1931, but not to prove that cancer and acid levels are linked. In fact, cancer thrives in an acidic environment - but it is not that wound and drought. According to the Nobel Prize site, Warburg was awarded the award for its discovery \"Nature and modus operandi for respiratory enzyme.\" According to the site, the discovery opened new roads in the fields of cellular metabolism and cellular respiration. It has shown, among other things, that cancer cells can live and develop, even in the absence of oxygen.\" In the end, Warburg's research found that cancer cells helped produce low oxygen, high acid conditions - not necessarily from such an environment. This central discovery, now called the Warburg Effect, is the observation that cancer consumes glucose and produces breastfeeding. A 2016 medical report on the effect of Warburg shows the process: \"When oxygen is present, normal mitochondrial cells are used to oxidize glucose, but in the absence of oxygen, glucose becomes a disease. Otto Warburg first described in the 1920s that cancer cells used higher levels of glucose in the presence of oxygen with a associated increase in breastfeeding production.\" Another review, released in 2016, found in the journal Trends in Biochemical Sciences, says that Warburg's influence is better defined as part of cancer progress rather than the initial onset of the disease: \"Warburg's effect is likely to be of general benefit in support of an accurate tumor environment leading to the spread of cancer cells. However, Warburg's influence is believed to be an early event in the formation of tumors that are the direct result of the initial shift in tumors.\" In its article of 20 January 2021, The Gateway Pundit stated: \"The World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledges that its tests are blatantly exaggerated in characterizing individuals with positive tests for COVID.\" \"All of this basically means that malignant tumours tend to be low in oxygen and that cancer cells, more than normal cells, take sugar in a non-oxygen way, which in turn produces an acidic microenvironment,\" Ted Gansler, Strategic Director of Disease Research at the American Cancer Society, said Politifact. \"That doesn't mean that the whole cancer patient's body is acidic, just the tumor is. The growth and metabolism of the tumor also causes low levels of local oxygen and acidic environment, but this certainly does not mean that the acid environment or low oxygen levels cause cancer or that alkaline diet or air breathing with higher levels of oxygen can effectively treat cancer.\" It should also be noted that the prosecution does not specify what it means by \"very acid.\" According to the Health Information Site (Halthline), the pH is between 0 and 14 with \"acid\" between 0 and 6.9, \"neutral\" at 7.0 and \"alkaline\" between 7.1 and 14. The levels of acidity in the human body also vary. For example, the stomach is very acidic to help digestion, while the blood is a little glucose. More importantly, while diets can change acidity levels in urine, they do not have a significant effect on acidity in a person &apos; s blood. Based on several studies found in the American National Library of National Medical Health Institutions, the Health Line Report points to the main reasons why this association with acid and cancer is flawed: \"First, food does not have a significant effect on pH in blood. Second, even if we assume that food can radically change the value of acidity in blood or other tissues, cancer cells are not limited to acidic environments. In fact, cancer is growing in normal body tissues, which have a little electromagnetic from 7.4. Many experiments have been successful in growing cancer cells in an arid environment. As tumors grow faster in acidic environments, tumors create the same acid. It is not the acid environment that creates cancer, but the cancer that creates the acid environment.\" \" (Classical) diet is effective because it provides useful nutrients, avoids harmful substances that can cause cancer, and avoids increasing calories that can lead to obesity, which in itself is a risk factor for cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes,\" Gansler said. The benefit of these foods has nothing to do with hydrogen (the way alkaline and acid scientists describe it). In fact, the pH of blood and tissue remains remarkably constant and is not affected by the diet. To be honest, the rationale behind a alkaline diet is \"trouble science.\" Maria Betzel, a top therapist at the MD Anderson Institute of the University of Texas, explains in a question and question on the Centre's website that the alkaline diet is based on the theory that eating some foods can change body acidity levels: \"Some believe that changing body acidity levels would improve your health and help you lose weight or even prevent cancer. But it's impossible to change the foods you eat at the level of acidity in your blood, as Betzel says in questions and answers. \"PH in the body is a very well organized system. If you change your diet, you may see changes in your saliva or urine diet because these are waste products, but it's impossible to eat enough to really affect your blood.\" Our recent Facebook report states that \"every single person with cancer has excessive acidification\" and that Dr. Warburg's research has shown that he cannot survive in a alkaline environment. The pH varies in the human body, so it is not possible for a person to simply have the global pH that is \"very acid.\" While it is true that cancer thrives better in acid versus alkaline conditions, cancer cells are known to help produce the acid environment itself. We value this allegation wrong. Corrigendum: Dr. Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize in 1931, not the Nobel Peace Prize. This story has been updated.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00425"}
