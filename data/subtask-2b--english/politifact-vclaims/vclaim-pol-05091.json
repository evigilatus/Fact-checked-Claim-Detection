Don Beyer, D-8th, says he\u2019s \"just amazed\" that Republican don't think of the country's employment needs.\n\"But for immigration, we would have a contracting population, and a contracting population means a contracting economy,\" he said during an April 12 radio interview with Bill Press, a liberal talk show host who broadcasts from Washington.\n\"So where are the workers going to come from 10 years from now, 15 years from now, but for healthy immigration policies?\" Beyer asked. He said immigration critics \"don\u2019t think - not even just long-term, but short-term - about the employee needs this country has.\"\nWhat caught our attention is the congressman\u2019s claim that the U.S. population would be falling without immigration. We wondered if he\u2019s right.\nThomas Scanlon, Beyer\u2019s director of communications, pointed us to a study released by the Pew Research Center in September. It examined U.S. immigration trends since 1965 and offered projections through 2065.\nBut the Pew study - citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau - undercuts much of Beyer\u2019s claim. It says, \"If no immigrants had entered the country after 1965, when the U.S. population numbered 193 million, the nation\u2019s population still would have grown - to 252 million people by 2015, rather than 324 million.\"\nIn other words, the U.S. population grew by 131 million -- or 68 percent -- during the past 50 years. Without documented and undocumented immigrants and their descendants, Pew says the population would have increased 59 million - or 31 percent.\nMoving forward, Pew projects the U.S. population to expand from 324 million last year to 441 million in 2065 - a 36 percent increase. With no immigration after 2015, Pew says the population still would grow but only to 338 million in 2065. That would be a 4 percent increase over 50 years.\nHere\u2019s another way to look at it: Pew predicts that 88 percent of the nation\u2019s population growth during the next 50 years will be linked \"to future immigrants and their descendants.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a big surge from the past 50 years, when \"the arrival of new immigrants and the births of their children and grandchildren account for 55 percent of the population increase,\" according to Pew.\nThere\u2019s one more finding in Pew\u2019s projections that should be considered. Let\u2019s go back to Pew\u2019s projection that if immigration ended in 2015, the U.S. population would expand from last year\u2019s 324 million million to 338 million in 2065.\nAll of that growth and more would occur by 2045, according to Pew, when the population would peak at 343 million. During the next 20 years, the population would decrease by 5 million.\nIn other words, Pew projects that after 2045 all of the U.S. population growth - which factors births, deaths and migration in and out of the country - will be attributable to the latest two generations of immigrants and their children. .\nOur ruling\nBeyer said, \"But for immigrants, we would have a contracting population.\"\nA Pew study cited by Beyer\u2019s office doesn\u2019t support the congressman\u2019s claim. It shows that the U.S. population would have expanded by about half of its 68 percent growth during the past 50 years if no immigration had taken place.\nLooking ahead, Pew projects that 88 percent of the nation\u2019s growth during the next 50 years will come from new immigrants, their children and grandchildren. But starting in 2045, the report says, all of the net growth will come from immigrants.\nBeyer\u2019s statement, in the present tense, wrongly suggests that without immigrants the U.S. population now would be in decline. But some context needs to be added. His statement came while he was talking about the need for immigrants to fill U.S. jobs \"10 years from now, 15 years from now.\"\nIn the future - say, 30 years from now - the Pew projections point to Beyer being right. But not now, or in 10 or 15 years. So we rate his statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05091"}
