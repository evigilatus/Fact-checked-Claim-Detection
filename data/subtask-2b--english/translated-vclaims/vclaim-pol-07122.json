By way of reference, he said, \"Breer carpets were recently found on the Texas side of the border in the brush,\" according to the video CSPAN2 published on the Internet by the Liberal News Winking Points Memo. Recently, some of the border claims between Texas and Mexico lacked factual basis. In September 2014, Polyte Fukte was mostly classified as a false allegation that the Islamic State Group was operating in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua, Mexico. Subsequently, Polyte Fact Texas classified pants on fire as a Congressman's statement that at least 10 Islamic State fighters had been arrested by the United States Border Patrol. So Dohorst, who claimed a week ago about prayer carpets in a panel discussion on border security at the Texas Tribune Festival, made us wonder. At the outset, the Islamic scholars and religious figures we have come up with in this story have warned us not to associate Islamic prayer with a person's interest in terrorism. In itself, experts said, carpets -- like the carpets filmed below in a photo e-mail sent to us by Anis, my friend from Austin -- represent cleanness; they are placed on the ground where a Muslim believer prays. Experts also said that all the world &apos; s estimated 1.6 billion Muslims did not use carpets. \u2022 A courtesy photo: Anis Siddiqui, spokesman for the Islamic Centre of Austin El Akbar. In our investigation, Andrew Barlow, State spokesman for Dewhurst, who lost his offer to re-election this spring, sent us two addresses and said, \"Lt. Governor de Horst based his statement on this report:... and this article.\" The last report, submitted on 11 September 2014, was an online news report by KTRH, 740 a.m. in Houston, quoting Ed Turzanski, a former United States intelligence officer and professor of political science and government at the University of La Salle in Philadelphia, who says: \"We have seen the carpets of Islamic prayer and other things left by people who enter the country illegally.\" By telephone, Torsanski told us border patrol agents, in many private conversations over the past decade, and told him I found prayer carpets on the border, but it has been \"a number of years\" since the last report. We have also been offered to try to reach out to sources familiar with us; we no longer hear anything about it. Otherwise, he warned that government agencies would not recognize the discovery of the prayer carpet to the press. He said that the officials of President Barack Obama's administration prevented the Border Patrol from speaking of anything \"in contradiction with the Department's narrative of border security.\" Another news story cited by Barlow, published on 30 June 2014, on Brittbart.com, a conservative news and comment site, quoted \"an unknown source among American independent security contractors along the southern borders of Arizona and Texas,\" saying that six from the Middle East were arrested in Laredo, Texas, \"all along the region\" with farmers in Texas finding prayer carpets on their farms.\" After trying to contact Brittbart's correspondent, Kerry Beckett, Kurt Bardella, President of Indivur Strategic Communications, the company that runs Britbart's public relations, she said over the phone that Brittbart couldn't reveal the source that described the discovery of the prayer carpet. He also said that the organization could not tell us which group belonged to the source, where the source lived or why the source believed that the findings of farm owners were prayer carpets. Bardella said, \"The source stands by his statement.\" Another fact-checking account and authority Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen mentioned on January 22, 2021 in an article on Facebook that says that the Paiden administration described liberal terrorists. \u2022 On January 22, 2012, in the Nixus news database, we monitored news reports on prayer carpets found along the border since 2005. None of the reports provided evidence of the source record for each individual name. Separately, federal and local law enforcement authorities refused to receive reports of prayer carpets while Tom Finger, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, sent an e-mail saying that the agency did not follow that information. On the telephone, Joe Jugoutriz Jr., spokesman for the Rio Grande Valley Sector of the Border Patrol, said that he had not heard \"anything\" about finding the prayer carpet. Gutierrez said that he transmitted our inquiry to all sectors of the Texas Border Patrol via e-mail. A reply was received from Rod Keyes, a public information officer at the Rio Grande Sector headquarters in Edinburgh. The bag sent an e-mail: \"With regard to the discovery of prayer carpets along the Texas-Mexico border, we had no reports of prayer carpets.\" KISS also said: \"It's not unusual to find garbage/technology. \"Along the smuggling routes.\" By e-mail, Nick Giorgio, editor-in-chief of the Laredo Morning Times, said, \"He has no knowledge of any reports of Muslim prayer carpets found near the Texas-Mexico border around Laredo.\" In our investigation, Brenda Medina Moreno, spokesman for the Office of the Mayor of Webb County, said by e-mail: \"The Office of the Mayor of Web County has not encountered any carpets for prayer and/or reports of carpets along our border crossings.\" Experts: We found only one article showing the image of an alleged prayer skeleton found at the border in Arizona. On July 9, 2014, a news story was written by Britbart.com by Beckett, who also wrote a story about prayer carpets found by farmers near Laredo, Texas, on which Dehorst relied. By e-mail, the spokesman for Brittbart Bardella referred to an editor &apos; s note attached to the end of the July 2014 story. The note stated: \"We have relied reasonably on the data and image provided by a third-party source with regard to finding a clear shawl of border prayer. There are now conflicting reports about those statements; however, the third party's source remains entirely behind the accuracy of its original calculation.\" To get our own sense of the accuracy of the picture, we sent a copy of the picture and asked for analysis to more than a dozen religious figures and scholars in the United States. We received eight responses, and all respondents said that the item photographed did not resemble the prayer carpet. Frank Griffell, president of the Middle East Studies Board at Yale, said, \"Is this a joke? What makes people think that the mysterious cloth at the border is the prayer carpet? I can't see any connection. It's an old cloth and it doesn't match the carpet, even less than the prayer rug.\" Samer Ali, a co-professor in Middle East Studies at the University of Texas, said that it didn't look like a prayer carpet because it was so thin, it had folds, it had helmets, and it didn't seem like any design he saw on a prayer carpet. Mustafa Omar, Director of Education and Outreach at the Islamic Institute of Orange District of California, said: \"The twisted pattern is not a feature of the prayer carpet and was in fact discouraged by the Prophet Muhammad for use because this pattern diverts Muslims from prayer.\" Our reign (Dohorst) said \"land carpets were recently found\" in a brush on the Texas side of the United States-Mexico border. This allegation is weakened by the fact that it is not supported by witnesses from a single source or by any authority confirming this conclusion when asked about it. If prayer carpets appear to alert someone, we believe that there will be legitimate photographs and carpets themselves available for inspection. There is another gap: while Muslims certainly cross the border between Mexico and Texas - and this is not disputed in this verification of reality - it is unreasonable to assume that there are prayer carpets that the individuals carrying them intend to commit acts of violence on the territory of the United States, which is the consequence of the Dehorst Declaration. In the end, his statement is incorrect and ridiculous. - (Roges) - (Pants) On fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07122"}
