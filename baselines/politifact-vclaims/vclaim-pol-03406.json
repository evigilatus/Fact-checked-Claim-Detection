And he proposed that if Trump runs for re-election in 2020, he\u2019ll have to release his taxes to get on the ballot in this crucial swing state.\nSen. Jay Chaudhuri, a Democrat from Raleigh, introduced a bill with that requirement. In case its target was unclear, he called it the \"Tax Returns Uniformly Made Public Act,\" or the T.R.U.M.P. Act.\n\"I filed the T.R.U.M.P. Act because I believe every presidential candidate, including Donald Trump, should disclose their tax returns,\" Chaudhuri told The News & Observer. \"I did so for three reasons. First, every major party presidential candidate for the last 40 years has made his or her tax returns public. Second, such disclosures allow the public to know whether these candidates have conflicts of interest. For example, does Donald Trump have business dealings with Russia? Finally, this bill has a lot of support \u2013 by a majority of North Carolinians and members of both parties, including Republican Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina.\"\nWe won\u2019t check Chaudhuri\u2019s claim about every major modern presidential candidate releasing tax returns, since the work has been done for us. Our friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin previously ruled that same claim, as made by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, as Mostly True.\nBut we were intrigued by Chaudhuri\u2019s final claim, that \"this bill has a lot of support \u2013 by a majority of North Carolinians and members of both parties.\"\nPolitical polarization\nChaudhuri\u2019s sentence was phrased somewhat vaguely. It appears he\u2019s talking about \"a majority of North Carolinians and (some) members of both parties.\" Yet it\u2019s also possible to read it as saying most members of both parties. But that\u2019s unlikely, since if he had meant that he wouldn\u2019t have needed the first part of the sentence, and in the end we interpreted it as some members of both political parties.\nIn Congress, some barely even cuts it. Rep. Walter Jones was one of only two Republicans not to vote the party line last month, when Congress voted down an attempt by Democrats to pass a national bill similar to what Chaudhuri is proposing for North Carolina.\nBut partisan polarization in Congress often doesn\u2019t accurately reflect their constituents. So we\u2019re more interested in what Chaudhuri had to say about public opinion statewide, since he\u2019s promoting a state-level bill.\nHis T.R.U.M.P. Act is likely a long shot, just like that doomed national bill, since Republicans also control the N.C. General Assembly. Some politicians and legal experts have also questioned whether such a bill \u2013 which has also been introduced in at least 24 other states \u2013 would even be constitutional.\nNevertheless, it would be intriguing if Chaudhuri is right about widespread support behind this idea.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we began researching opinion polls to find out.\nA majority for or against?\nWe discovered only one polling firm has asked voters in North Carolina this issue. But its research backs up Chaudhuri\u2019s claim.\nMost North Carolinians do want Trump to release his taxes and would support a law that require all presidential hopefuls to do so, according to Public Policy Polling, a liberal-leaning firm based in Raleigh that has polled the topic multiple times.\nIts polling results\u00a0mirror national polls (which recently have found between 53 percent and 74 percent want Trump to release his taxes). So it doesn\u2019t appear to be an outlier. But since it\u2019s the only firm polling on this topic in North Carolina specifically, we take its findings with a grain of salt.\nPPP polled North Carolinians in August 2016 and January 2017 on whether Trump should release his taxes. The August poll found 58 percent said yes; the January poll found 60 percent said yes.\nThat backs up Chaudhuri\u2019s claim about \"a majority of North Carolinians.\" And the poll\u2019s crosstabs back up his point about some support from both sides politically.\nIn August PPP found 76 percent of Democrats and 54 percent of unaffiliated/other voters wanted Trump to release his taxes. There was no majority view among Republicans, of whom 37 percent said Trump said should release his taxes, 49 percent said he shouldn\u2019t and 14 percent were undecided. That poll surveyed 830 likely voters, with a margin of error of 3.4 percent.\nThe overall January numbers were similar \u2013 a total of 60 percent support \u2013 although increasingly polarized. Support among Democrats and unaffiliated voters rose by several points, while Republican opposition rose by several points. That poll surveyed 954 registered voters, with a margin of error of 3.2 percent\nPPP\u2019s January poll also found 54 percent of North Carolinians would favor \"a law requiring that a candidate for President release 5 years of tax returns in order to appear on the ballot,\" which is precisely the type of law Chaudhuri proposed several months later.\nPPP found most Democrats and independents would support the bill, while there was no majority view among Republicans. The poll reported 31 percent of Republicans would support such a bill, 49 percent would oppose it, and 20 percent were undecided.\nOur ruling\nSen. Jay Chaudhuri proposed a bill that would require future presidential candidates to release their tax returns in order to get onto North Carolina\u2019s ballot. The bill was clearly aimed at Republican President Donald Trump, but Chaudhuri said it \"has a lot of support \u2013 by a majority of North Carolinians and members of both parties.\"\nAccording to one polling firm, Chaudhuri is correct that most North Carolinians want to see Trump\u2019s tax returns, and that the majority also would support a law requiring all presidential candidates to release their taxes. He\u2019s also correct that both issues have bipartisan support, including most Democrats and independents, and about a third of Republicans.\nHowever, only one pollster has explored this question at the state level. That\u2019s an important piece of information that Chaudhuri doesn\u2019t mention, so we rate this claim Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2017-04-20 17:56:13 UTC   Politifact    2 1 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly True  Says the T.R.U.M.P.
