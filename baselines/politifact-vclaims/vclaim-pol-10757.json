Many drivers have pointed their fingers toward the state Department of Driver Services.\n\nDavid Ralston, speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives, told reporters he was disappointed how the state agency prepared for the changes. However, the Republican lawmaker from Blue Ridge offered an explanation for the new regulations that suggested it is beyond the state\u2019s control.\n\nMany of the changes that the state made were required by federal law, so state lawmakers' hands were tied, Ralston said, according to the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer.\n\nRalston\u2019s spokesman, Marshall Guest, confirmed that\u2019s what his boss said and suggested some paths for us to use to find more details.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia wondered if the speaker was correct, or was he incorrectly designating the new level of bureaucracy to the wrong people?\n\nGeorgia DDS officials say the changes were necessitated by a 2005 law passed by Congress called the Real ID Act.\n\nThe act, which took effect three years after it passed, says that federal agencies may not accept a driver\u2019s license or other state-issued forms of identification, unless the state meets rules under the federal law to verify the person\u2019s identity. The act says a driver\u2019s license should include the person\u2019s full legal name, date of birth, gender, picture, driver\u2019s license number, address, signature and physical features.\n\nThe federal government has specific guidelines about what it requires from states, and Georgia says it is trying to follow suit. States should require a person to present a document without a photo that contains the driver\u2019s full legal name and date of birth and Social Security number, the federal law says.\n\nThe Real ID Act was passed as part of a Homeland Security measure after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. \u00a0\n\nStates were given the opportunity to get an extension to comply with the law. In 2007, the Georgia Legislature passed Senate Bill 5, which delayed implementation of the federal law until the governor felt comfortable the law would protect Georgians from identity theft. The state bill expressed concerns that the federal law would cost states $11 billion over the first five years of the program and that the federal government had not provided any money for its implementation. The state bill also mentioned worries that the federal law didn\u2019t mention protections for information privacy or data security.\n\nSince 2007, state DDS officials have been working to meet the federal guidelines under the Real ID Act in phases. This May, Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s office announced it had created a system called SecureID that will protect Georgians from identity theft and comply with the Real ID Act.\n\n\"This program will give Georgians the most secure IDs we\u2019ve ever issued in this state,\" Deal said in a press release. \"It is our duty to protect our residents\u2019 identities to the best of our ability.\"\n\nSo now, you\u2019ll need proof of your full legal name, Social Security number and address to renew your driver\u2019s license.\n\nIt may not comfort some motorists as they stand in line to renew their license, but the new guidelines do come from the federal law passed in 2005. We rate Ralston\u2019s statement as True.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10757"}
