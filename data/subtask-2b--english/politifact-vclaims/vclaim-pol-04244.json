Trump said the country needs to \"bring back law and order\" in inner cities and praised stop-and-frisk policies in Chicago and New York. Then\u00a0Holt jumped in with what sounded like a \u00a0fact-check.\n\"Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men,\" Holt posed to Trump.\n\"No, you're wrong,\" Trump responded. \"It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.\"\nWhenever there\u2019s a disagreement over who has their facts right, we\u2019re compelled to sort it out. So the question of whether stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York piqued our interest.\nAs it turns out, Holt and Trump are both a little bit right and a little bit wrong. But Trump's more wrong than Holt.\nStop-and-frisk is the practice of a police officer stopping and questioning a person (the stop), then patting the person down for weapons (the frisk). Stops and frisks are legal, in New York and everywhere else.\nIn its decision in the 1968 case Terry vs. Ohio, the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that an officer can legally stop a person if the officer has reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. And if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that this person is armed, he or she can legally frisk the person for weapons. Because of that reasonable suspicion standard, the court said these stops would be consistent with the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable search and seizure.\nA 2013 case before the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Floyd vs. City of New York, raised the issue of the constitutionality of New York City\u2019s stop-and-frisk policies between 2004 and 2012.\nJudge Shira Scheindlin found that New York City had been conducting unconstitutional stops and frisks on two grounds: Officers were stopping and frisking people without reasonable suspicion, in violation of Terry and the Fourth Amendment; and a disproportionate number of those stopped and frisked were minorities, in violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\"Both statistical and anecdotal evidence showed that minorities are indeed treated differently than whites,\" Scheindlin wrote in her opinion. \"For example, once a stop is made, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be subjected to the use of force than whites, despite the fact that whites are more likely to be found with weapons or contraband.\"\nSo Holt was right to note that a court found New York City had an unconstitutional stop-and-frisk policy because police had been disproportionately targeting black and Hispanic people.\nBut the Floyd case was specific to New York City\u2019s particular way of conducting stops and frisks between 2004 and 2012. Scheindlin did not rule all stops and frisks unconstitutional, and her findings were consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Terry. Scheindlin ruled that New York City could continue to conduct stops and frisks as long as they made some changes.\n\"Stop-and-frisk was not outlawed,\" said Andrew Schaffer, former deputy commissioner for legal matters for the New York Police Department and an adjunct professor at New York University Law School. The ruling only sought to correct a supposed problem of officers making stops without a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and disproportionately stopping black and Hispanic people.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchaffer added, \"The Floyd decision in New York did not and could not overrule Terry.\"\n\"The judge made it very clear that she was not finding stop-and-frisk as a general practice unconstitutional,\" said David Rudovsky, a leading civil rights attorney and senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\nSo Holt\u2019s claim \u2014 \"stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York\" \u2014 isn\u2019t quite precise because it makes it seem as if the judge decided that all stops and frisks were unconstitutional in New York, when really her ruling said New York had to stop and frisk differently. New York cops still stop and frisk today.\nBut it also isn\u2019t quite correct for Trump to call Holt\u2019s claim \"wrong\" because that implies there was no finding of unconstitutionality in New York\u2019s practices or that Scheindlin\u2019s ruling was tossed out, when really it still stands.\nThere might be some confusion in the public conversation over stop-and-frisk because it seems the public has come to associate the phrase \"stop-and-frisk\" with unconstitutional practices, like officers stopping people for no reason, said Ian Weinstein, professor at the Fordham University School of Law in New York.\n\"Constitutional stop-and-frisk is legal across America, and the unconstitutional version is illegal across America,\" Weinstein said. \u00a0\nFor some additional context, we wanted to know what Trump was talking about when he said the case \"was taken away\" from Scheindlin.\nAfter Scheindlin ruled against them, lawyers representing New York City went to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, a rung above Scheindlin\u2019s court. A panel of Second Circuit judges decided to remove Scheindlin from all future proceedings in the Floyd case because Scheindlin had spoken to the media while the case was pending and because the panel believed Floyd had been inappropriately assigned to her.\nThe panel did not make this decision because Scheindlin was \"anti-police,\" as Trump said in the debate. The panel also did not reverse or throw out Scheindlin\u2019s ruling.\nA few months later, at the start of 2014, Bill de Blasio replaced Michael Bloomberg as the mayor of New York, and he decided to drop the appeal, accept Scheindlin\u2019s ruling, and dramatically reduce the frequency of stops and frisks in New York City.\nOur ruling\nResponding to the assertion that stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, Trump said \"no, you\u2019re wrong.\"\nTrump has a point that a judge\u2019s ruling in a 2013 case did not declare stop-and-frisk as a general practice unconstitutional in New York. Stop-and-frisk is still legal and still takes place in New York and across the country.\nBut his claim ignores that a judge did decide that the manner in which New York previously conducted stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional and that her ruling still stands. Trump had argued that stop-and-frisk was working effectively in New York City to reduce crime during the time period covered by the lawsuit.\nTrump\u2019s statement has an element of truth\u00a0but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04244"}
