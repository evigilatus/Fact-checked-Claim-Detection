The article claims that the family \"have about 80% of the world's total wealth\" and the ability \"to feed, clothe and settle every man, woman and child on the planet if they so wish.\" It was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is true that the Rothschild family has been very rich - since the 17th century - but the suggestion that they own 80% of the world's wealth is a huge exaggeration. Who are the Rothschilds? The Rothschilds are a famous and rich Jewish banking family from Europe. The family has long been the target of conspiracy theories, and their wealth is largely believed to be responsible for inspiring anti-Semitic belief that Jews \"control\" over the world's money. (The blame has been mistakenly blamed for everything from the start of wars to the sinking of the Titanic to the assassination of the United States Presidents. The family business began in the 17th century in Frankfurt when Mayer A. Rothschild became a trainee at a small bank in Hamburg before returning home to start trading in rare currencies. He soon began to provide financial services to the brokers of power, and eventually the nobles. Mayer then sent each of his five sons to a different European city - London, Paris, Vienna, Naples and Frankfurt - to set up a store. The family &apos; s dealings with various governments and valuable investments have been impressively bearing fruit, which has helped them to create a financial strain. How much money does the family have now? While the Rothschild family certainly still has deep pockets, they have produced hundreds of grandchildren and there is no central family wealth, nor does the family have the same kind of global power as it had in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the absence of a single home, the name Rothschild has links to a number of independent businesses and investments in mining, energy, agriculture, real estate and wine making. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" As the Financial Times once stated, \"The family empire is divided between a network of descendants and a few external contributors. The structure of the property is ambiguous, making it difficult to appreciate the wealth of the family, even though it is one of the richest people in the world.\" The closest thing to the Rothschild family business today is the Rothschild Group, a multinational investment banking company. But the Foundation does not produce enough money to support the claim that the family controls 80 percent of the world's money supply. The annual revenue of the Rothschild Group was about $500 million in 2017 - less than that of many companies. (For example, Walmart boasted of an annual income of about $500 billion in 2018) In April 2017, the Rothschild net worth was estimated by the celebrity network at $400 billion. The total global wealth, for comparison purposes, was $317 trillion in 2018, according to the Swiss Credit Research Institute. This figure comes from an analysis of the wealth held by five billion adults worldwide, from the richest to the richest individuals to a figure that represents the total wealth of households in the world. In 2012, Skiptweed, a weekly research programme hosted by author and producer Brian Andrew Dunning, explored the history of the famous family, and noted that while the Rothschild family was still on the horizon in the banking world, it was still a dwarf by larger and richer institutions. \"Don't mistake, it's a large and successful company; but with billions of assets, it's a relatively small fish in the sea of global financial institutions with trillions of assets,\" Daning said at the time, \"including the German Bank, the Mitsubishi Financial Group, HSBC Holdings, BNP Paribas Bank, the Japanese Post Bank, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricol Group, the Barclays PLC Bank, the Chinese Industrial and Commercial Bank, the Royal Bank of the Scottish Group, JP Morgan Chase & Co. and many other companies. Anyone who tries to point his finger to the scattered Rothschilds as \"control\" of global banks has a very long arrangement. This little reality is about 100 years of history.\" While many of the Rothschild family members have enormous wealth, it should also be noted that only one of them has succeeded in accessing the global billionaire list in Forbes: Swiss banker Benjamin de Rothschild, which comes on page 1. :: 1284 with a net value of $1.6 billion. Our rule, Mimi, recirculating the Internet, claims that the Rothschilds \"have about 80% of the world's wealth\" and thus have the ability \"to feed, clothe and settle every man, woman and child\" if they choose to. There is no doubt that the family is rich but claims that it controls 80 percent of the world's wealth. There is no longer any central family wealth, and the closest is an investment banking company. However, the company &apos; s earnings are much lower than many companies earn. The spread of anti-Semitic theories is promoted by an unfounded exaggeration. We value it pants on fire!
