John Hickenlooper, a Democratic candidate for president, got some laughs during a CNN town hall when he discussed the experience of overseeing the legalization of recreational marijuana in his state.\nMarijuana officially became legal in Colorado in December 2012, but legal adult sales did not begin until Jan. 1, 2014. At that point, it took the better part of a year for localities around the state to fully come online and get businesses licensed.\nHickenlooper, who initially opposed legal weed, grew to accept it. During the town hall, a participant asked him for his reflections on this evolution. Here\u2019s what Hickenlooper said:\n\"As my mother would say, you couldn't control what things would come in your path, what bad things life might throw at you. And in the end, we were very concerned about this. And I was opposed to it originally. No other government had ever legalized marijuana. Even Amsterdam just decriminalized it. We were worried about teenage consumption going up, when kids' brains are rapidly growing, what it could do. We were worried about the risks of, you know, more people driving while high. And partly, it's no fun to be in conflict with the federal government. \n\"But I believe that states are the laboratories of democracy, as Justice Brandeis said so famously, and that we would give it our best shot. And I have to say, at this point, most of our fears haven't come true. We haven't seen a spike in consumption. A significant increase among senior citizens, but I leave that to your own imagination.\"\nThe mention of seniors getting baked sparked laughter in the audience, but we wondered whether Hickenlooper was correct that after legalizing marijuana in Colorado, \"we haven't seen a spike in consumption.\"\nWe found there hasn\u2019t been a spike, per se. However, marijuana use by adults has gone up consistently for a decade, before and after legalization.\u00a0\nRelevant studies\nExperts told us that the most comprehensive source for data on marijuana use is the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an annual survey put together by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. We found two relevant measurements, each broken down by state, each of which showed similar patterns for Colorado.\nHere\u2019s the data for reported marijuana use in the past month, broken down by a variety of age groups in Colorado:\n\nAnd here\u2019s the data for reported marijuana use in the past year, again broken down by age groups:\n\nEach of the blue lines shows the trend for an adult group \u2014 18 and older, 26 and older, or 18 to 25.\nAll of these blue lines show the same general pattern: The usage rates rose, slowly and steadily, between 2008-2009 and 2016-2017.\nHickenlooper has a point that usage rates didn\u2019t \"spike.\" However, it\u2019s easy to hear his comment and assume that reported use of marijuana flatlined or even declined. And that\u2019s not the case.\nFor the 30-day rates \u2014 the more common metric that policymakers use, experts say \u2014 the increase in adult marijuana use ranged between a one-third jump and a doubling over eight years, depending on the age range.\nOther data backs this up. A state government report from 2018 summarized data from the Colorado Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a statewide telephone survey conducted by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. This study\u2019s data on marijuana use goes back to 2014.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe past-month figures for adults rose from 13.6 percent in 2014 to 15.5 percent in 2017, a jump the report called \"a significant increase.\" The responses for daily or near-daily use grew from 6 percent in 2014 to 7.6 percent in 2017, which it also deemed \"a significant increase.\"\nThe patterns in Colorado did not surprise Jonathan P. Caulkins, a public policy professor at Carnegie-Mellon University and the former co-director of RAND\u2019s Drug Policy Research Center. An upward trend is to be expected.\nBetween 1992 to 2017, Caulkins said, the nationwide number of past-year users more than doubled, and past-month use tripled. The number of days of use went up several fold, and the number of daily or near-daily users increased tenfold, from 0.9 million to 9 million, he said.\nOh, and about those toking seniors? Their numbers have gone up, as Hickenlooper said, according to Colorado data \u2014 from 3 percent in 2014 to 5.6 percent. Younger age groups showed increases between 2014 and 2017 as well. But use by seniors wouldn\u2019t have been large enough to drive the trends. One likely reason for the rise among seniors: Every year sees more and more Baby Boomers turning 65, and they are used to using marijuana from their younger years.\nYouth usage hasn\u2019t risen\nThe one age group that bucked the pattern \u2014 and an important one from a policy perspective \u2014 is teenagers. They\u2019re marked with the red line in the charts above.\nStrikingly, the use of marijuana by teens has, at most, stayed much the same, and perhaps even dropped a little.\nExperts cautioned that for teen use, the sample sizes of the SAMHSA study we used above are not very large. Other studies with larger sample sizes bear out the general pattern, however.\nColorado has been tracking 30-day marijuana use among high-school students every two years since 2013 in its Healthy Kids Colorado survey. In 2013, 19.7 percent of respondents said they\u2019d used marijuana in the past 30 days. That number rose slightly in 2015 to 21.2 percent, but then fell back to a new low in 2017, at 19.4 percent.\nSo, if Hickenlooper had specified youth usage, he would have had a stronger argument. In fact, Hickenlooper\u2019s own state government issued a news release in July 2018 that summed up the results this way: \"Marijuana use in Colorado rises for adults, stays the same for kids.\"\nAnd when we reached out to Hickenlooper's campaign, they confirmed that he had meant to refer to usage by youths.\n\"He did mean to specify youth,\" said Lauren Hitt, a spokesman for Hickenlooper. \"He tells that story a lot.\"\nFor instance, he said in February 2017 on NBC's Meet the Press\u00a0that \"we didn't see a spike in teenage use\" after legalization.\nHe also said in July 2018, \"Preventing young people from using marijuana is a statewide priority. While youth use hasn\u2019t gone up, we are working hard to educate Colorado parents and their children about the health and legal\u00a0risks\u00a0of underage marijuana use.\"\nWe should mention one notable caveat to all the studies cited above.\n\"These surveys are all based on self-reporting, and people are probably more likely to admit to using cannabis when it is legal compared to when it is illegal,\" said Mason Tvert, the former director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project who is now with Vicente Sederberg, a marijuana-focused law firm. This could account for some of the increase over time, he said.\nOur ruling\nHickenlooper said that after legalizing marijuana in Colorado, \"we haven't seen a spike in consumption.\"\nHe has a point that legalization didn\u2019t produce a rapid, sudden increase in marijuana use. But that doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t a continued increase. In Colorado, reported marijuana use climbed, slowly and steadily, for adults between 2008 and 2017. The one exception was teenagers, for whom usage rates largely remained steady.\nWe rate the statement Half True.\n Share the Facts 2019-03-25 19:53:59 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  After legalizing marijuana in Colorado, \"we haven't seen a spike in consumption.\"    John Hickenlooper Democratic presidential candidate https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/03/21/john-hickenlooper-marijuana-legalization-town-hall-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/this-week-in-politics/   a CNN town hall Wednesday, March 20, 2019 2019-03-20    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00857"}
