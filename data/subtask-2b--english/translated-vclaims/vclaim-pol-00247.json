The federal law prohibits anyone convicted of any crime from possessing a firearm. But the arms embargo, as stated in the Klobochar campaign, is also imposed on persons convicted of domestic violence offences. This provision applies to anyone who has or has a domestic relationship with the victim, as stated by the Professor of Law at the University of Wyoming Georges Moxari, who co-authored a textbook at the Law School on firearms laws. Therefore, despite Clobochar's claim, this provision applies to more than one current or former couple. This applies if the perpetrator of the domestic assault has a child in common with the victim; if he or she lives or lives with the victim; or if he or she is \"like the husband.\" With regard to the language of \"a similar place,\" some courts said that friends living at home were covered by the law, as stated by Jacob Charles, Executive Director of the Centre for Firearms Law at Duke University. Moxeri said that a regulation issued by the Federal Bureau for Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives showed that resident partners were covered. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, said that Nancy Belusi's request to use Marines for opening security, saying \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021, Klobochar's claim of a loophole is so precise that the law does not apply to a close friend who is simply dating the victim, but who does not share a dwelling or children. However, Muksiri said that there was a difference in risk when a weapon was in a domestic state against a person who possessed a weapon but did not live with his girlfriend. \"All agree that the firearm in the household with domestic violence poses a clear growing threat to the abusive partner,\" said Politi Fruitte. However, there is no credible evidence that \"there is a similar growing risk\" in cases of non-cohabitation, as he said. Klobochar &apos; s claim was filed in the context of federal law. It should be noted, however, that 23 states have laws prohibiting at least some abusive dating partners from obtaining firearms, in accordance with the Giffords Legal Centre for the Prevention of Armed Violence. This includes 19 states that prevent persons convicted of domestic violence from acquiring a weapon. Among them are California, Texas, Illinois and New York. \"If you commit a serious crime of domestic assault against your wife, you can't get a gun, but if you do it against your girlfriend, you can.\" The arms embargo contained in federal law does not apply to close friends who were, or were, merely dating or accidental relationships. However, it applies to friends who have a child in common with a victim of domestic violence; who live or live with the victim; or who are \"like the husband.\" Nineteen states also have similar laws on cases of domestic violence. The Klobochar statement is partially accurate. We value it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00247"}
