He said the improvements are due in large part to the policy, in which police officers stop and search people they suspect might be involved in criminal activity.\nWe won\u2019t address the wisdom of the policy, which is the focus of intense debate. Instead, we\u2019ll look at the question of whether \"New York is the safest big city in the nation, and our crime reductions have been steeper than any other big city\u2019s.\"\nThe numbers: Is New York the safest big city?\nWe turned to the most recent full-year data from the FBI, which used 2011 figures. Since a previous NYPD news release had compared New York City to both the 10 biggest cities and the 25 biggest cities, we will use those parameters here as well. In the charts below, violent crimes include murder and nonnegligent manslaughter; forcible rape; robbery; and aggravated assault. Property crimes include burglary, larceny-theft and motor vehicle theft.\nThe following chart lists the 25 largest cities in America, in descending order by population.

Marc LaVorgna, a spokesman for Bloomberg, said that New York does rank first if you go back to 1993, when the city introduced its data-based policing approach, and he cited a 2011 book by University of California-Berkeley law professor Franklin E. Zimring, The City that Became Safe: New York's Lessons for Urban Crime and Its Control.\nWe checked with Zimring, who agreed that Bloomberg is on safe ground with his claim. Zimring said the steepest declines occurred in the early 1990s and would not have been captured entirely in our data. New York City\u2019s drop \"is the steepest ever for a major U.S. city with a credible statistics program,\" Zimring said.\nAre such comparisons valid?\nSo, judging by the numbers, Bloomberg is on target. But is he justified in making a multi-city comparison, or is that just comparing apples to oranges? While everyone does it, experts say it can be a blunt measurement.\nThe FBI -- the source of the statistics Bloomberg used -- is one of the strongest voices warning that city-to-city comparisons are invalid. Here are a few of the factors that the FBI and other experts cite:\n\u2022 No two cities are alike. Bloomberg\u2019s preferred ranking consists of cities (which would not include separately incorporated suburbs) rather than metropolitan areas (which would include suburbs). In addition, New York includes the primarily suburban borough of Staten Island.\n\u2022 Crime reporting rates can vary by city. Whether due to police habits or citizens' actions, different cities may not have the same level of diligence in reporting crimes, especially for the most numerous type of violent crime (aggravated assault) and the most numerous type of property crime (larceny-theft).\n\u2022 Using total crime as the measurement mixes both violent and property crime. The method Bloomberg used counts every violent crime and property crime equally, so every murder is statistically equivalent to every car theft. Changing the category being calculated can make a big difference. In 2011, New York City had a better overall crime rate than Los Angeles, but New York had a higher violent crime rate -- 621 violent crimes per 100,000 population, compared to 524 for Los Angeles.\nStill, despite some concerns about Bloomberg\u2019s use of the statistics in this way, the criminologists we checked with agreed that the mayor has something to crow about.\n\"One thing that is quite obvious is that almost every neighborhood in the five boroughs can be said to be on the way up, whereas cities like Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore and St. Louis have quite a few neighborhoods that can be termed dead or dying,\" said Eugene O\u2019Donnell, criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\nJames Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, agreed. \"New York has done a great job,\" he said. \"But urban one-upmanship does no one any good. Whether they\u2019re first, second or third in the nation is splitting hairs.\"\nOur ruling\nBloomberg said, \"New York is the safest big city in the nation, and our crime reductions have been steeper than any other big city\u2019s.\" Both the FBI and criminologists express concern about making this type of multi-city comparison, and other measures, such as violent crime, don\u2019t put New York at the No. 1 slot. Still, the numbers do broadly back up his claim. We rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08956"}
