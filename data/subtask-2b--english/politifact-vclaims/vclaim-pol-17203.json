He\u2019s also charged with attempted intentional homicide for the shooting of a third man.\nRittenhouse is awaiting extradition from Illinois.\nHe was able to leave the scene even though, as caught on video, he walked toward police with his hands up as protesters yelled that he had shot people.\nThe relationship between Rittenhouse and police has drawn particular scrutiny in the wake of video interactions captured earlier in the night.\nOne viral Facebook post on Aug. 26, 2020, said \"video showed police thank him & give him water prior to the killings.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\nDid police really have such an interaction with Rittenhouse before the deadly protest shooting?\nVideo shows police encouraging armed group\nA livestream posted by The Rundown Live, an independent radio program based in Milwaukee, shows Rittenhouse interacting with police while standing in front of a store in Kenosha shortly before the shooting.\nAbout 10 p.m., the man shooting the video approaches an armed Rittenhouse, who introduces himself as Kyle, as he stands outside a business with another armed man.\nLater in the nearly two-hour video, Rittenhouse tells the man shooting the video, \"People are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business, and part of my job is also to help people. If there\u2019s somebody hurt, I\u2019m running into harm\u2019s way. That\u2019s why I have my rifle, because I need to protect myself obviously. But I also have my med kit.\"\nAbout 90 minutes into the livestream at 11:30 p.m. \u2014 15 minutes before the fatal shooting \u2014 the following exchange with police occurs as Rittenhouse and another armed man walk outside a business.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice officer (over a loudspeaker): \"You need water? Seriously. (unintelligible) You need water?\"\nRittenhouse, raising his arm and walking toward the police vehicle: \"We need water.\"\nPolice officer: \"We\u2019ll throw you one.\"\nRittenhouse then walks out into the street amid several police vehicles, holding his hand in the air for a water bottle. An officer surfaces from a hatch at the top of the police vehicle and tosses a water bottle to a person located just out of the camera\u2019s view, where Rittenhouse would likely be standing based on the preceding footage.\nPolice officer: \"We got a couple. We\u2019ve got to save a couple, but we\u2019ll give you a couple. We appreciate you guys, we really do.\"\nA police officer on a loudspeaker then directs orders, apparently to another group.\nPolice officer: \"You\u2019re going to have to get out of there. This is the last warning. You\u2019re going to have to move south or you\u2019re going to have to get out of this block. This is the last warning. You will disperse.\"\nKenosha County Sheriff David Beth said in an Aug. 28, 2020, news conference that the armored vehicle shown in the video is one of 19 being used in the area but wasn\u2019t from his department. He noted people have a Second Amendment right to bear arms to protect \"their property,\" but local authorities had not asked them to come.\nIt is unclear from the video what law enforcement agency the vehicle belonged to.\u00a0\n\"The comments that whoever was in that armored vehicle said, that does not reflect what we here in Kenosha are asking for,\" Beth said.\nBeth had initially responded to the incident, on Aug. 26, by saying police in Kenosha \"would toss a water to anybody.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says of Rittenhouse: \"Video showed police thank him & give him water prior to the killings.\"\nVideo taken 15 minutes before Rittenhouse allegedly shot and killed two people shows exactly that. Police thanked his group for their presence and gave them water.\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17203"}
