A report from one reputable environmental advocacy group supports that, and other groups are worried too.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s another thing to say what state Rep. William \"Billy\" Richardson said about the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers on Aug. 31.\nRichardson, a Fayetteville Democrat, urged his fellow legislators to commit more funding to the state Department of Environmental Quality during a speech on the state House floor.\n\"There are 250,000 rivers in this country,\" Richardson said. \"Two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers are right here in North Carolina.\" He was referring to the Cape Fear and the Neuse.\nAre the Cape Fear and the Neuse among America\u2019s top five most-polluted rivers? And where is this \"most polluted rivers\" list he alludes to?\nWe\u2019ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular.\u00a0\nThis summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina.\nGenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river \u2014 and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges.\nMeanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill\u2019s effects. But they\u2019re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ\u2019s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ\u2019s leader says the department doesn\u2019t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term.\nEnter Richardson and his claim about North Carolina being home to two of the top five \"most polluted\" rivers in the country.\nThe dangers of hog waste\nRichardson wasn't immediately available for comment. His assistant, Leigh Lawrence, said Richardson was referencing the 2017 edition of the American Rivers organization\u2019s annual \"America\u2019s most endangered rivers\" list. The list ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse together as the seventh most endangered rivers in America.\nOn the phone, Lawrence acknowledged that Richardson might\u2019ve misspoke but that he \"cares deeply\" about the environment, referencing a bill he filed earlier this year to try to protect part of the Cape Fear from regulation rollbacks.\u00a0\nRichardson, for his part, later called PolitiFact to say that he once\u00a0saw a list of America's most polluted rivers that supports his argument \u2013 but that he's had trouble finding it. Regardless of any lists or rankings, he said, the rivers have serious issues that need to be addressed.\n\"My intention was not to mislead anyone,\" Richardson said. \"Between the numerous articles that point to the troubles on the Neuse and Cape fear basin ... and then you throw in GenX, it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got a huge issue that we\u2019re not dealing with.\"\nNonetheless, American Rivers told PolitiFact that their \"most endangered\" list shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a \"most polluted\" list. In fact, the first page of the report says: \"This report is not a list of the nation\u2019s 'worst'\u00a0or most polluted rivers, but rather it highlights rivers confronted by critical decisions that will determine their future.\"\n\"The big difference between \u2019most polluted\u2019 and \u2018most endangered\u2019 is that when we list a river as \u2018most endangered\u2019 it is because there is a decision that is coming up that depending on how that decision is made will have a major impact on the river,\" said Peter Raabe, the group\u2019s conservation director for rivers of Southern Appalachia and the Carolinas.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, American Rivers is calling on state lawmakers to restore funding to a program that helps farmers move hog waste lagoons out of the floodplain. Hog waste lagoons are outdoor basins where farmers store hog waste.\nThe group\u2019s \"most endangered\" report doesn\u2019t mention GenX, but is very concerned about hog waste getting into the rivers.\nThe Neuse and Cape Fear River basins \"have endured two 500-year floods from hurricanes in less than 20 years, during which dozens of animal waste lagoons within the 100-year floodplain were flooded or breached, discharging millions of gallons of raw animal waste directly into the rivers,\" the report says.\nHurricane Matthew, specifically \"partially submerged 10 industrial hog facilities with 39 barns, 26 large chicken-raising operations with 102 barns, and 14 open-air pits holding millions of gallons of liquid hog manure, releasing untreated waste directly into the rivers.\"\nThe North Carolina Pork Council, for its part, told The Washington Post in October that reports of spills were exaggerated and that there\u2019d been zero waste pits breached and just 11 flooded.\nEndangered vs. polluted\nRaabe, among other environmental experts PolitiFact spoke with, said it\u2019s difficult to determine which rivers are the \"most polluted\" because there are different types of pollution that are all similarly bad.\n\"There are so many things that \u2018pollute\u2019 our rivers \u2014 GenX, 1,4-Dioxane, untreated sewer water, heavy metals, algal growth, bacteria, wastewater from failing septic, too much water, too little water, spills from oil pipelines, spills from trucks on highways, etc.,\" Raabe said. \"The Neuse and the Cape Fear Rivers have a lot of issues that need to be addressed but so do all the streams that have been impacted by human activity.\"\nShould residents be worried? City and county water treatment plants do a great job of testing for and eradicating many pollutants from the water, he said.\n\"The problem is, that water is only treated for pollutants we know about. Chemicals like GenX and many other contaminants of emerging concern are not tested for,\" Raabe said.\u00a0\nOther pollution rankings?\nSo American Rivers doesn\u2019t have a \"most polluted\" list. PolitiFact wondered if the federal government tracks which rivers are the most polluted.\u00a0\nTurns out, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the federal government body that aims to protect human health and the environment) \"does not rank waterbodies and we don't keep a list of the most polluted rivers,\" spokeswoman Enesta Jones said.\nExperts at other environmental groups that PolitiFact spoke with \u2013 including the\u00a0Upper Neuse Riverkeeper, Environment America and the EPA \u2013\u00a0echoed Raabe in saying it\u2019s difficult to determine which rivers are most polluted.\nEvery two years, state governments are required to tell the EPA which of their local rivers are impaired. Davina\u00a0Marraccini, an EPA public affairs specialist, warned the public against comparing reports.\n\"Note that because of differences in state assessment methods, the information on the website should not be used to compare water quality conditions between states or to determine water quality trends,\" Marraccini wrote in an email.\nThrough Google searches, PolitiFact couldn\u2019t find a comprehensive, definitive list by a reputable organization that describes a North Carolina river as one of the \"top five most polluted.\"\nOur ruling\nRichardson said that N.C. is home to two of the \"top five\" most-polluted rivers in the state. His assistant acknowledged that he might've misquoted the American Rivers \"most endangered\" list \u2013 but PolitiFact looked around to see if other data might support his claim. There\u2019s evidence that the Neuse River and Cape Fear River, in particular, are threatened not only by waste from local farms\u00a0but by a chemical that state regulators want to investigate. However, PolitiFact found no basis for Richardson\u2019s claim that North Carolina rivers rank among the top five most polluted in the United States. We rate this claim false.\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2017-09-20 18:19:33 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  speech on the House floor NC is home to two of the \"top five most polluted rivers\" in the U.S.    Billy Richardson N.C. state Rep.
