Rick Scott is our salesman-in-chief when it comes to recruiting tourists. His office blasted a press release chock full of statistics about tourism in Florida that made us nod off like a lazy tourist on the beach -- until we came across this phrase:\n\"As we move toward our third consecutive year of record tourism growth, it is clear why the Sunshine State remains the top travel destination across the world,\" stated the Nov. 15 press release.\nThe \"top travel destination across the world\"? Is the home state of Mickey Mouse kicking the derriere of tourist hot spots like France? We went on a virtual trip to find out.\nFlorida tourism stats\nWe asked a spokesman for Scott for an explanation as to how he arrived at his claim. John Tupps said Scott was simply expressing a personal opinion that Florida is the best place to visit in the whole world, not making a quantitative statement.\n\"The governor truly believes Florida is the \u2018top travel destination\u2019 in the world,\" Tupps said in an email. \"It\u2019s his personal view.\"\nWe thought Scott\u2019s wording went further than a personal opinion, though, so we decided put his statement on the Truth-O-Meter. We soon found that comparing tourism stats is tricky, because various states and countries use different methodologies to count visitors.\nVisit Florida, a quasi-state agency, counts out-of-state, overnight visitors. By that measurement, Florida had 91.5 million visitors in 2012.\nIn California in 2012, there were 61 million out-of-state overnight trips. New York had about 62 million overnight out-of-state visitors in 2011, the most recent year available.\nSo in state-to-state competition, Florida wins on the metric that Visit Florida uses.\nBut the picture changes when we look around the world.\nAccording to the U.N.\u2019s World Tourism Organization, in 2012, there were 83 million international visitors to France, compared with the United States in second place with 67 million.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReince Priebus\n\n\nstated on August 3, 2011 in comments made to reporters while in Tampa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Republican National Convention \"is a Super Bowl times four.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 August 12, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo on the metric of international visitors, France is clearly leading Florida.\n\"We continue to say our goal is to beat France,\" said Kathy Torian, a spokeswoman for Visit Florida.\nStill, the comparison of Florida with France is tricky, because France is a country and Florida is a state. Florida\u2019s 19 million population is about one-third the size of France\u2019s population of about 66 million.\nAlso, many Europeans travel to France just for a weekend, or visitors book a short stay in France, and then move on to other European destinations. So France may not be as dominant as its visitor counts make it appear.\nComparing the number of visitors is not the only way to compare tourism rankings. We could also examine the amount of money spent by visitors.\nAnd while France is No. 1 in the number of international visitors, it tumbles behind the United States and Spain when you consider spending, the AP reported:\n\"International visitors spent more than double in the U.S. than they did in France in 2012 \u2013 $126.2 billion, compared to $53.7 billion, according to the U.N.\u2019s World Tourism Organization. That despite the fact that France welcomed 20 percent more tourists.\"\nThe U.S. Travel Association reports that travel spending was $71.5 billion in Florida in 2011. That amount lags behind California, at $105 billion in 2011. Both those numbers top France's $53.7 billion in 2012. But to Scott's point, those spending numbers still don't put Florida in the No. 1 position.\nOur ruling\nWhile touting Florida\u2019s tourism numbers, Scott said, \"The Sunshine State remains the top travel destination across the world.\"\nThere isn\u2019t one simple way to declare \"the\" top travel destination in the world. But Scott\u2019s claim would probably elicit a \"mais non!\" from Scott\u2019s counterparts in France, who can boast to being the undisputed global leader of international tourists.\nAnd if you don't consider France a fair comparison, recent data on travel spending shows that California edges out Florida.\nVisit Florida is clamoring to achieve that No. 1 ranking, but we didn\u2019t find proof that we are already there.\nScott is clearly a cheerleader for his own state, but the data to back up his claim is murky and difficult to substantiate. We rate the claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08586"}
