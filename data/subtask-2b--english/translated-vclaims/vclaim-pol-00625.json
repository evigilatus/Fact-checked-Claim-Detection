She said, \"Many of these people are seeking asylum.\" \"What happened to the promise of our country to give me your trouble, your weakness and your poverty; the people who really come here to seek a better life?\" \"As it turns out, about 80 to 90 per cent of these have no valid asylum application, once we have already obtained their documents,\" said Crenshaw in response. This is not the first time Polyte Fruitte has verified an allegation about the percentage of valid asylum applications - we have evaluated a similar statement from former Attorney General Jeff Cates wrong last year. In fact, about 20 to 30 per cent of asylum applications have been granted annually since 2009, but experts said that this did not mean that the remaining 70 to 80 per cent of cases were incorrect. There are many grounds for refusing or closing an asylum case. Before we go into the numbers, let us take a look at the two main asylum processes, as outlined by the United States Department of Homeland Security: positive asylum: a person living in the United States can voluntarily apply for asylum through this process - regardless of their immigration status or how they arrive in the country. Defence asylum: a person can apply for asylum through this process to avoid deportation from the country - this process can only be pursued by persons who are in the process of deportation. Defence asylum applications may include those filed by individuals arrested at the border while attempting to enter the country without permission or by persons here illegally arrested by law enforcement officials within the country (e.g. at a transit station). The Crenshaw Office sent us a report from the Immigration Review Executive Office within the Ministry of Justice, which dealt with asylum cases arising from the \"lost claim of fear,\" which fall within the framework of the defensive asylum process. These allegations stem from individuals arrested by border patrol officers while attempting to enter the country without permission and were included in the accelerated deportation process. If in these circumstances a person claims to have a credible fear of persecution or torture if deported from the country, he or she meets with an asylum officer who decides whether to refer his or her case to the immigration judge for full consideration. When referring the case to the judge, the person must apply for asylum in court. According to data from the Ministry of Justice, in fiscal year 2018, asylum was granted in 16 per cent of cases arising from the claim of credible fear. Some 29 per cent of applications were rejected and approximately 15 per cent of cases were closed for administrative or other reasons. In the remaining 40 per cent of cases, individuals who had been detained on the grounds of credible fear did not end up applying for asylum. While only 16 per cent of these cases led to the granting of asylum, the experts said that there were numerous grounds for closing cases or refusing applications, regardless of the merits of the claim. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverdi on 3 February 2021, and only because an individual does not apply for asylum after a credible fear interview does not mean that he does not have a valid asylum application, according to Sarah Pierce, policy analyst at the Institute of Migration Policy. \"One of the very common reasons for seeing people who pass the credible fear test and ultimately do not apply for asylum is that they do not know that they have to, and that they are confused about the process,\" said Pierce. Pierce states that some asylum-seekers assume that meeting the credible fear they encounter with an asylum officer is their asylum application, where they are allowed to enter the country while awaiting the court &apos; s history. In fact, however, they must submit a paper application to the court for an official asylum application. In view of approximately 15 per cent of the cases closed for unspecified reasons, Pierce said that this group could include individuals who applied for other benefits before the Migration Court at the same time as they sought asylum and were instead granted other benefits. \"When you're before an immigration judge, there's no limit to what you can ask,\" said Pierce. \"When I first started training, my old boss used to say that I should throw a lot of wet pasta on the wall as I could see what sticks.\" The experts with whom we consulted raised similar points in our 2018 verification of a similar claim made by the sessions. Jennifer Gordon, a law professor at Fordham Law School, said that cases could be dismissed for a number of reasons unrelated to the subject matter of an individual's claim. \"Many cases are rejected for procedural reasons that do not relate to the substance of the claim, or because the applicants are unrepresented or poorly represented, and thus do not have the opportunity to present their case in an effective manner,\" Paulette Fuckett said. James Hathaway, Professor of Law and Director of the Refugee and Asylum Law Programme at the University of Michigan School of Law, said that it was also important to calculate the number of cases that had been reflected through the available appeals. The same applies to all asylum cases. Another important warning to be considered is that credible claims of fear do not constitute the majority of asylum cases brought before United States judges. The Ministry of Justice figures show that about 20 per cent of all asylum cases closed in 2017 (the latest year for which full data are available) were accepted and about 34 per cent rejected. The remaining cases were closed or rejected for unspecified reasons. Regardless of the data set that you consult, the experts said that the same was true: the mere rejection of a case did not mean that an individual did not have a valid claim (cases could be dismissed on procedural grounds unrelated to the merits of the claim); asylum cases could be closed or rejected on several grounds, none of which invalidated an individual &apos; s application; and the mere fact that a person did not apply for asylum after claiming a credible fear did not mean that his asylum application was unreliable. Our referee Crenshaw said that about 80 to 90 per cent of the individuals seeking asylum did not have a valid claim. While the data indicate that about 16 per cent of asylum cases that arose in 2018 from a credible complaint of fear were accepted and about 20 per cent of all asylum applications were filed, the experts said that this did not mean that the remaining cases were not based on objective grounds. It was true that Crenshaw said that 16 per cent of persons seeking asylum after making an allegation of credible fear had a qualified asylum application, but the contrary - what Crenshaw said - was inaccurate. We value this allegation wrong. - The statement is not accurate.
