Of course, for congressmen and women it means backing America with their thumbs by tweeting pro-U.S.A. rally cries to their followers and constituents.\nWhile the quadrennial event has generally united Democrats and Republicans, not all the social media cheering was free of politics. After the United States\u2019 thrilling 2-1 victory on June 16, 2014, over Ghana, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made an immigration reform push by invoking the U.S. Men\u2019s National Team.\nShe tweeted: \"Immigrants help drive America's success, even in the World Cup! Look at what #USMNT would be without them. #TimeIsNow.\" By Thursday evening, it had been retweeted and favorited almost 1,000 times.\nThe below picture was included:\n\nAs you can see, the graphic shows 11 U.S. players with minuses next to their pictures and names. Pelosi\u2019s tweet reads that those 11 players are immigrants who would likely not be on the roster if they weren\u2019t allowed in the country.\nMuch has been made about the number of United States players who have dual citizenships, but is the U.S. World Cup team powered by immigrants?\nWe went through the roster and researched the backgrounds of the 11 players highlighted in the graphic.\nSix of the players were actually born in America. So even though they may have parents who are from other countries, they are very much considered citizens, not immigrants.\nJozy Altidore: Born in Livingston, N.J., to two Haitian-born parents.\nAlejandro Bedoya: Born in Englewood, N.J., to two Colombian-born parents\nJulian Green: Born in Tampa, Fla., to an American serviceman father and a German mother; moved to Germany with his mother as a young child.\nTim Howard: Born in New Brunswick, N.J., to an African-American father and his Hungarian mother.\nAron Johannsson: Born in Mobile, Ala., to Icelandic parents.\nOmar Gonzalez: Born in Dallas, Texas, to Mexican parents.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other five were not born in the United States but have at least one parent who is an American. (In four of the cases, their fathers were in the United States military serving abroad.) That entitles them to all to U.S. citizenship, meaning they did not have to go through the immigration process noncitizens do.\nJohn Brooks: Born in Berlin, Germany, to an American serviceman father and a German mother.\nTimmy Chandler: Born in Frankfurt, Germany, to an American serviceman father and a German mother.\nMix Diskerud: Born in Oslo, Norway, to a Norwegian father and an American mother.\nFabian Johnson: Born in Munich, Germany, to an American serviceman father a German-born mother who had an American father.\nJermaine Jones: Born in Frankfurt, Germany, to an American serviceman father and German mother.\nSo not only are none of these 11 individuals considered immigrants by the United States, they're all actually natural born citizens.\nPelosi\u2019s office told us the source of the graphic is a story posted on Business Insider from Global Post.\nThe story noted that a number of far-right nationalist parties with anti-foreigner sentiments seem to be on the rise in Europe. Some countries are also considering anti-immigration legislation that would put stricter quotas on new inhabitants.\nTherefore, the author wanted to imagine what these teams would look like without immigrants. To do this, he singled out players with at least one foreign-born parent. As Vox\u2019s Dara Lind points out, \"That might make sense for other countries, where parentage is more important to citizenship. But it doesn't make any sense for the U.S., where nearly everyone has some sort of immigrant heritage, and where everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth.\" Basically, in some countries, it doesn\u2019t matter if you were born there; citizenship is more closely tied to lineage. That\u2019s not the case in America, one of a small number of countries that grants citizenship at birth.\nWe took all of this to Pelosi\u2019s office. Spokesman Drew Hammill said they weren\u2019t claiming these players were immigrants, rather, \"We\u2019re merely echoing the point made by the creators of the graphic about the contributions of these sons of immigrants.\"\nBut not even all of the foreign-born parents are actually immigrants. Timmy Chandler, for example, stayed in Germany with his German mother after he was born.\nSo by no definition is the United States represented by immigrants at the World Cup in Brazil. That\u2019s not to say immigrants or immigration aren\u2019t important to the makeup and heritage of the team. The United States is a country built on immigrants, and every player on the team can trace back at least half their lineage to another country (there is one half Native American on the team, forward Chris Wondolowski).\nBut that\u2019s not the message Pelosi was trying to give with her tweet. If it was, you could have whited out the entire team.\nOur ruling\nIn a tweet pushing immigration reform, Pelosi posted a picture of the U.S. Men\u2019s National Team missing 11 of its players and tweeted \"Immigrants help drive America's success, even in the World Cup! Look at what #USMNT would be without them.\" In this instance \"them\" means immigrants. But none of those 11 players are immigrants. Some aren\u2019t even the children of immigrants.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07716"}
