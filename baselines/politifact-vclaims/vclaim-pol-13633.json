DeLay? We wanted background.\n\nAn online search of news coverage showed that The Houston Chronicle identified the jury foreman in a Nov. 23 news article saying in part that the \"forewoman\" is a Greenpeace activist named Katie Stotts. The article\u2019s author, R.G. Ratcliffe, told us in an interview that courtroom observers learned Stotts\u2019 name when the judge inadvertently said it aloud. Ratcliffe said the Greenpeace information came from an entry on Stotts\u2019 Facebook page indicating that she\u2019d enthusiastically answered an invitation to a Greenpeace event. In our own Facebook check, we found that someone identified as Katarina von Stottsen said \"HELL YES\" to attending a September 2009 Greenpeace party in Austin.\n\nAfter DeLay\u2019s trial, a letter from Katie Stotts of Austin appeared Nov. 30 on the Austin American-Statesman\u2019s editorial page. In the letter, Stotts says that she was a juror in the trial, adding: \"We did have a good mix of political affiliations on the jury, but what it came down to wasn't political sides. It took us three very difficult and intense days to come to a decision because we were considering all of the evidence to ensure that we came to the right decision.\"\n\nStotts\u2019 letter continues: \"For those out there crying \u2018liberal,\u2019 they don't have a leg to stand on. It is an insult to my fellow jurors and I who put our lives on hold, and poured every last bit of our energy into making certain that a fair outcome was reached based only on the evidence, not any sort of political agenda... We performed our civil service with honesty and integrity, and stereotypes have no place in that.\"\n\nThe letter makes no mention of Greenpeace.\n\nDeLay\u2019s daughter, Dani DeLay Garcia, who sometimes serves as his spokeswoman, told us by e-mail that the foreman \"wrote that she was a Greenpeace activist on her questionnaire,\" referring to written questions answered by prospective jurors before jury selection.\n\nGarcia also said she\u2019s been told the questionnaires are public record.\n\nNot so, advised Michelle Brinkman, chief deputy clerk for the Travis County District Clerk\u2019s office. She noted that the state\u2019s Code of Criminal Procedure says information about a person collected by a court during jury selection is confidential and may not be disclosed unless a party to the trial or bona fide member of the news media applies for it. Then, \"on a showing of good cause, the court shall permit disclosure,\" the law says.\n\nAt our request, Brinkman asked the judge who presided over DeLay\u2019s trial if questionnaire responses were available. The judge, Pat Priest, replied to her by e-mail Jan. 31: \"I don't think we need dance either to Mr. DeLay's tune or to \u00a0the reporter's, and the jurors made it clear they want their privacy protected. Tell him the information is unavailable.\"\n\nThe same day, we reached Dick DeGuerin, DeLay\u2019s lawyer in the case. DeGuerin declined to share a copy of Stotts\u2019 questionnaire responses. But, he said, Stotts partly answered a question about club memberships including political involvements by writing: \"I am a paying member of Greenpeace.\" DeGuerin said she answered the next question, per volunteer activities, with: \"I\u2019ve been to multiple rallies for environmental preservation issues.\"\n\nIn a follow-up interview, DeGuerin said he did not use any allotted pre-emptory challenges to strike Stotts from the jury. \"There were others\" in the jury pool \"much more objectionable,\" DeGuerin said. \"I wish I\u2019d had 20 strikes.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we reached an Austin-area Greenpeace leader, who referred us to the group\u2019s Washington spokesman, Joe Smyth. Smyth had no comment about Stotts but said via e-mail: \"Every citizen enjoys the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, including serving on a jury, so it's bizarre that Tom Delay seems to think he can blame his criminal conviction on someone's politics or membership in an organization.\"\n\nUpshot: While Stotts reportedly self-identified as a Greenpeace backer, we\u2019d need more information to deem her a Greenpeace activist. We rate DeLay\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n\nUPDATE, 10:30 a.m. Feb. 11, 2011: After we published this article, Stotts responded to our Jan. 31 e-mail seeking comment. Stotts replied Feb. 10: \"I contribute monetarily to Greenpeace, but I am not a Greenpeace activist. I went to, at most, a few local environmental rallies because a good friend of mine used to work for their organization. I have probably volunteered more times for the food bank in Austin than I have for official Greenpeace events. I also work for a conservative insurance company, but neither of these things had an effect on my ability to render an honest and fair verdict in the trial.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13633"}
