Charlie Crist in Florida\u2019s 13th congressional district race, shared the graphics on her social media accounts and said:\n\"Whistleblowers who worked for Dominion software have come forward. The 2020 election is compromised due to this software/ the coding or \u2018glitch\u2019 to FLIP votes to Biden. We MUST fix this for future elections!\"\nThe first map highlights the states that used Dominion machines \u2014 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The second map shows that, consequently, these are the same states where President Donald Trump is filing lawsuits that allege election fraud.\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted a more wide-ranging claim related to the system, saying, in part, that it \"deleted\" 2.7 million votes for his re-election nationwide. We rated that Pants on Fire.\n\u201cREPORT: DOMINION DELETED 2.7 MILLION TRUMP VOTES NATIONWIDE. DATA ANALYSIS FINDS 221,000 PENNSYLVANIA VOTES SWITCHED FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP TO BIDEN. 941,000 TRUMP VOTES DELETED. STATES USING DOMINION VOTING SYSTEMS SWITCHED 435,000 VOTES FROM TRUMP TO BIDEN.\u201d @ChanelRion @OANN\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2020 \n\u00a0\nBut the technology is utilized in at least 28 states, not just the six where Trump has brought legal challenges. It was used in a few counties in Michigan and Georgia that experienced problems, but those cases didn\u2019t affect the vote counts. The problems were minor and quickly resolved, and were either the result of human error or temporary malfunctions.\n\nThe posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe issues in Georgia and Michigan\nIt all started in Antrim County, Mich., when a clerk\u2019s error led to an incorrect early tally that made it appear as if Joe Biden was winning it by about 3,000 votes. The error was never an official result and was corrected within two days, putting Trump ahead in the county by about 2,500 votes.\nThe Michigan secretary of state\u2019s office said it came down to human error by the Antrim County clerk, not a failure in Dominion\u2019s system.\n\"Because the clerk did not update software, even though the tabulators counted all the ballots correctly, those accurate results were not combined properly when the clerk reported unofficial results,\" the Nov. 6 statement said.\nThe mistake was limited to that one county. It is one of 65 counties in Michigan that use the company\u2019s equipment.\nIn Georgia, early morning voting halted temporarily in Morgan and Spalding counties when individual Dominion machines malfunctioned.\u00a0\nThe issue there had to do with a breakdown between the digital list of voters provided by one company, and the voting machines provided by Dominion. Technicians resolved the problem, and a judge allowed the affected polls to stay open until 11 p.m. to make up for lost time.\nGeorgia uses the same system statewide, and the glitch took place only in these two counties. There is no report that votes were miscounted. Trump easily carried both places, winning by a 40-point margin in Morgan County and by 20 points in Spalding.\n\"No credible reports or evidence of any software issues exist,\" Dominion says on its website. \"While no election is without isolated issues, Dominion Voting Systems are reliably and accurately counting ballots. State and local election authorities have publicly confirmed the integrity of the process.\"\nRELATED: Trump supporters falsely tie Nancy Pelosi to broader election misfire scheme\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

The network cited an \"unaudited analysis of data obtained by Edison Research.\" We reached out to OANN for a copy of that analysis but haven\u2019t heard back.\u00a0\nEdison Research is a company that contracts with the National Election Pool, a consortium of American news organizations, to provide exit polling data during election cycles. Edison Research also partners with several TV networks to provide vote tabulation data.\nThe company said it has not found data that back up OANN\u2019s report or Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\"Edison Research has produced no such report and we have no evidence of any voter fraud,\" said Larry Rosin, president of Edison Research.\nRELATED: Dominion Voting Systems \"deleted 2.7 million Trump votes nationwide.\"\u00a0\nElection technology experts called the claims baseless, and said the numbers (like Trump\u2019s 2.7 million \"deleted\" votes) are almost impossible to prove without a digital forensic investigation and a nationwide audit.\u00a0\nEdward Perez, election-technology expert at the OSET Institute, a nonprofit that studies voting infrastructure, said these claims show a misunderstanding of how election administration works.\nThe process involves numerous protocols that include rigorous system tests that take place publicly, and before the technology is used in elections, Perez said.\n\"In the U.S., the way that elections are actually run, technology does not exist in a vacuum. It\u2019s only one of multiple critical things that would make it exceedingly difficult for mass fraud to happen at this level undetected,\" he said.\nNearly all election jurisdictions engage in testing of their systems and ballots before every election. In order for an election jurisdiction to flip votes fraudulently, bad actors would need to figure out how to simulate the appearance of that public testing.\n\"Statutes sometimes require this kind of \u2018logic and accuracy testing,\u2019 and even when they do not, it is a common process conducted by local election officials,\" the National Conference of State Legislatures says on its website. \"Logic and accuracy testing is generally conducted in public and serves dual purposes. First, it demonstrates that the voting system is able to accurately and completely tabulate the ballot and report results. Second, the public nature of it increases voter confidence.\"\nAnd in many places, the test doesn\u2019t only occur on the front end. A similar process is done, again, before officials start tabulating ballots.\nWithout any credible evidence that the voting system is resulting in mass tabulation errors, Perez said, the posts and stories appear to border on outright disinformation.\n\"The claims have reached a scale that is so wild and outlandish that it is perfectly reasonable for people to wonder if the intent of such messages is to specifically inflame passions and to confuse people and undermine public confidence in the legitimacy of the election.\"\nOur ruling\nViral social media posts claim that the 2020 presidential election is compromised because Dominion Voting Systems flipped votes to favor Joe Biden.\nThis is wrong. There is no credible evidence that the system affected any vote counts. Minor problems, including human error and temporary machine malfunctions, took place in a few jurisdictions and did not impact vote tabulations.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18519"}
