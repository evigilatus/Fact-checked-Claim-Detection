The \u00a0newspaper stated that Nicholson opposes McConnell, with the campaign spokesman reiterating: \"Kevin has made it clear he\u2019s prepared to support new leadership because of the Senate\u2019s failure to pass a conservative agenda.\"\nAlso that month, there were two key endorsements of Nicholson, both of which cited McConnell.\nThe pro-Donald Trump Great America PAC, with ties to former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, endorsed Nicholson. People close to Bannon said Nicholson, when meeting with Bannon, made it clear he would oppose McConnell as Senate majority leader, the Journal Sentinel reported.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFreedomWorks for America, a super PAC affiliated with a group that helped start the tea party movement, also endorsed Nicholson, saying Nicholson \"has indicated that he would oppose Mitch McConnell\u2019s failed leadership.\"\nNicholson\u2019s shift was noted in November 2017 in a \u00a0Politico article that carried the headline, \"Republicans flee from McConnell in 2018 primaries.\" The article pointed out that Nicholson \"originally said he would support McConnell, but has since won Bannon's endorsement and now supports \u2018new leadership\u2019 for Senate Republicans.\"\nBut Nicholson would shift again.\nSome eight months later, on July 16, 2018, Nicholson moved to somewhere between support and opposition.\nThis was the exchange when Nicholson was interviewed by major Trump supporter and former Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, who was filling in for conservative Milwaukee radio talk show host Mark Belling:\nClarke: Will you vote -- when the new leadership is chosen in the next Congress \u00a0\u2014 will you support Mitch McConnell as Senate Majority Leader?\nNicholson: I mean, that's a hypothetical; it's hard to predict, right? Like, at the end of the day, I know that who's ever in leadership -- and I'm saying this, like, transparently and honestly as I can -- if they're putting forth good ideas, I'm going to be right there with them, kicking down doors to make it happen. At the end of the day, though, if what they\u2019re doing is foisting upon us all 2,000-plus-page omnibus bills that land on the desks of U.S. senators 48 hours before they have to be passed, with no ability to be amended, I\u2019m going to be the first guy pushing back.\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAsked about the varying statements, Nicholson campaign spokeswoman Ronica Cleary sent us an email that didn\u2019t address Nicholson\u2019s position on McConnell, saying in part:\n\"Kevin has been consistent in saying that institutions should always be open to changing leaders when they aren\u2019t functioning properly, and he believes that the entire Senate should be subject to term limits -- including leadership. This is why he\u2019s limited himself to two terms. Ultimately, as he said on the radio this week, he is not going to answer hypotheticals.\"\nOur rating\nNicholson has gone from supporting McConnell as majority leader, to saying he wanted new leadership to now somewhere in between, saying the question is a hypothetical.\nHad we rated Nicholson\u2019s first shift, he might have earned a Full Flop.\nBut at this point, for being somewhere between support and opposition on McConnell, that\u2019s a partial change in position.
