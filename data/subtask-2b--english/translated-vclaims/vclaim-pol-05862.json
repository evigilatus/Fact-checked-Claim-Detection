Bernie Sanders then turned into some of the statistics he had previously used on the trunk, which led to the denunciation of high unemployment rates among young African Americans. \"African-American Youth Unemployment 51%,\" Sanders said on October 13, 2015, the Las Vegas debate. \"The Spanish Youth Unemployment 36%\" This is like - but not the same - an allegation that we verified in July. At that time, he said that for African-Americans between the ages of 17 and 20, the \"real unemployment rate... is 51 per cent.\" We've mostly evaluated that right. But since the prosecution is drafted somewhat differently, we'll take a fresh look at it here. In the discussion, Sanders did not specify the age range in question, but the more available \"youth\" data from the Employment Statistics Office cover the ages of 16 to 19. For individuals between 16 and 19 years of age in September 2015, the official unemployment rate for whites was 13.9 per cent, for Americans of Spanish origin 18.6 per cent and for Americans of African descent 31.5 per cent. For individuals of that age group of all races and ethnicities, the unemployment rate was 16.3 per cent. While the rates for both minority groups are lower than those for eggs, they are still well below the figures presented by Sanders in the discussion. So what's going on? When we verified this claim in July, we noted that Sanders, using the term \"real unemployment rate,\" wrote a telegram that he was not using the most used statistics for the unemployment rate. In fact, when we asked Saunders camp for supporting evidence, they referred to the research carried out by the Institute for Economic Policy, a left-wing think tank. These data were different from the most common measurements for several reasons. First, the Institute not only viewed the employment situation of persons between the ages of 17 and 20; rather, it limited the scope of its work to high school graduates who did not attend other studies. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 and 2, the Expanded Programme of Immunization is no longer only unemployed workers, but also those who were part-time due to the weakness of the economy and those who were \"frequently associated with the labour force.\" The latter category includes persons who did not meet the strict definition of presence in the labour market, but were also not entirely outside the market. The statistics used, known as the U-6 shortcut, are officially called the measure of \"deficit employment\" instead of \"employment.\" The Institute itself used the term \"deficit labour\" in its research. It's a real statistics, but in July Sanders didn't really describe it in the right way. The term \"unemployment rate\" was used twice and the term \"real unemployment rate,\" which is ambiguous and does not contain any formal definition in BLS and is not mentioned in EPI's research. Its wording during the discussion was more problematic. He simply said, \"The unemployment rate,\" without indicating that he was using a non-standard measure. The EPI data also passed only until March 2015. However, since March, the overall unemployment rate for all African Americans has fallen by almost one percentage point, although the rate for the 16 to 19-year sub-group has since increased. * (This youth sub-group is based on a small sample and has a higher margin of error.) All of this, Saunders has a point that young African-Americans and Spanish have higher unemployment rates than young whites. \"The weird choice of Sanders is that official unemployment statistics could have been used and he continues to make his point that African and Spanish young Americans have higher unemployment rates than other groups,\" said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and in fact chief economist at the job site. During the debate, Sanders said that \"the unemployment of young people of African-American descent is 51 per cent. Unemployment among young people of Spanish descent is 36 per cent.\" He has the view that young African-American and Hispanic-Americans have much worse prospects in the labour market than whites. But his numbers are too far away. Using the usual method of determining the unemployment rate, the figure is 31.5 per cent for young African-Americans and 18.6 per cent for young people of Spanish descent. While these rates are still disproportionately high, they are not as high as Sanders said. The statement is partially accurate but needs clarification, so we evaluate it half correctly.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05862"}
