(In current dollars, that would be a $296,121 paid in taxes on $910,319 in reported income.)\nIn the final two years he did not pay federal income taxes because, according to tax rules, he lost money each year \u2014 more than $3.8 million then, or about $12.8 million today.\nNew Jersey's Division of Gaming Enforcement verified his income, losses and deductions. The division said Trump's losses came from the operation of his various properties. But the report offers no specifics.\nWe asked both the Clinton and Trump campaigns if they had any additional information since our original check. We didn't hear back.\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"The only years that anybody's ever seen\" of Trump\u2019s tax returns \"showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.\"\nThose records, covering five years of returns, report that in three of the five years Trump did pay federal income taxes. In two years he did not. The tax returns themselves remain secret.\nClinton\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6adfa4d3-c309-41e1-940d-dd06448c5548", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04256"}
