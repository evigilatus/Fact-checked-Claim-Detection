Barack Obama said. \"It doesn\u2019t\u00a0\u2013 under the Medicare plan\u00a0\u2013 it doesn\u2019t help seniors get any better. It\u2019s not improving our health care system. It\u2019s just a giveaway.\"\n\n\nObama used the same example when asked a similar question in the first debate.\n\n\n\"We right now give $15-billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system,\" Obama said. \"Doesn\u2019t work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15-billion. That was a giveaway and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.\"\n\n\nObama is talking about the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, which pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries who sign up. It was conceived as a cost containment measure on the theory that competition between HMOs, PPOs and other private plans would drive down costs. In fact, MA plans have consistently cost the government more per beneficiary than traditional fee-for-service Medicare costs. About 18 percent of beneficiaries now belong to MA plans.\n\n\nThe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent Congressional agency, estimated that in 2008, the MA program cost 13 percent more than traditional Medicare. A Commonwealth Fund report estimates that that translates, on average, to nearly $1,000 more for each person in the MA program, for a national total of more than $8.5-billion last year (and a total $33-billion from 2004 to 2008).\n\n\nInsurance companies argue that people enrolled MA programs get better service.\n\n\n\"One of the important things to keep in mind is that Medicare Advantage provides additional benefits and services not available in traditional fee-for-service programs,\" said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans.\n\n\nZirkelbach argues that the plan offers better hearing, vision and dental coverage and a disease management plan. MA plans have also proven useful in some rural areas that are short on health care providers. Some plans refund all, or part, of their clients' Part B Medicare premium, which can save people hundreds of dollars a year.\n\n\nThe tradeoff is that beneficiaries are often limited to using hospitals and doctors in the plans' network. While beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs are often less under MA plans, that is not always the case. Some services, like nursing home rehabilitation, can be more expensive than under traditional Medicare.\n\n\nBrian Biles, a professor in the Department of Health Policy at George Washington University and a former senior vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, said\u00a0 that while MA participants may get about 13 percent more value from extra benefits in the MA plan, it costs about 13 percent more. So it isn't necessarily any more efficient than traditional Medicare, just more costly, Biles argues.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Why should some people get an extra $1,000 in Medicare coverage and some not?\" Biles said.\n\n\nIn testimony before the House of Representatives on June 28, 2007, CBO director Peter R. Orszag said Medicare is, in effect, subsidizing the added cost of the Medicare Advantage program.\n\n\nBut is it better? Orszag wasn\u2019t convinced. \"Many Medicare Advantage plans offer disease management, care coordination, and preventive care programs, but little information is available on the degree to which the plans generate better health outcomes than the traditional Medicare program,\" he said.\n\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the government refused to pay MA plans more than traditional Medicare costs, that the taxpayers would save $9.5-billion in 2009, $54-billion over the 2009-2012 period, and $150-billion over 10 years. It was that last projection that Obama apparently used to come up with his $15-billion figure.\n\n\nJoseph Antos, a health policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, believes that if the additional money paid for MA plans is eliminated or severely reduced, \"half the plans will drop out in two years.\"\n\n\nThat won\u2019t sit well with people in those plans, he said, and it\u2019s likely to be strongly opposed by congressmen from rural districts\u00a0\u2013 Republicans and Democrats alike\u00a0\u2013 who have a high percentage of constituents in the MA program.\n\n\nAntos also takes issue with Obama\u2019s characterization of the extra money paid for MA as giveaways to insurance companies.\n\n\n\"In general, the extra money that goes to these plans ends up benefiting the beneficiaries to some extent,\" Anton said.\n\n\nThe programs tend to have a lower co-payment for prescription drugs and premiums for medical services.\n\n\n\"Does some of that stick to their (insurance company) fingers, of course,\" Antos said.\n\n\nIt's Obama's interpretation when he calls the added payments for MA programs insurance company \"subsidies\" or \"giveaways.\" But Obama is on solid ground when he estimates that the government spends about $15-billion a year extra on the private MA program than on traditional Medicare, particularly as we move forward in coming years.
