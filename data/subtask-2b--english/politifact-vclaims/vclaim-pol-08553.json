Whether it should stay that way, be reduced or even abolished, is being examined by the Special Joint Legislative Commission to Study the Sales Tax Repeal Act of 2013.\nDuring the commission\u2019s most recent hearing, on Nov.19, it heard testimony from Joseph D. Henchman, vice president of the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation.\nAmong other things, he said part of the reason Rhode Island\u2019s sales tax rate is so high is because it taxes so little. \u00a0\n\"Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island\u2019s sales tax,\" Henchman said. \"Only Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have narrower sales taxes. You are exempting 75 percent of the economy from the sales tax already and imposing a higher rate on the rest that you do tax.\"\nIs Rhode Island\u2019s sales tax really as narrow as Henchman says?\nLike most state sales taxes, Rhode Island\u2019s is limited to the sale of so-called tangible goods, not services, such as lawn-mowing or legal fees. It is further diminished by about 83 categories of exempted items such as food, most clothing, medicines, and, more recently, art works and wine. \u00a0\u00a0\nHenchman told us he got Rhode Island\u2019s 25 percent figure from analysis done by John L. Mikesell, chancellor\u2019s professor of public and environmental affairs at the Indiana University. Mikesell is considered one of the nation\u2019s experts on state taxation policies.\nHenchman said the figure came from a statistic Mikesell calls \"breadth of base,\" which estimates how much of a state\u2019s commerce is subject to its sales tax.\nMikesell starts by taking a state\u2019s total sales tax revenue and determining how much in retail sales was needed to produce that amount, a figure he calls the \"implied retail sales tax base.\"\nHe then expresses that base as a percentage of the state\u2019s total personal income, the amount of money residents in the state have to spend.\nIn 2011, Rhode Island\u2019s 7-percent sales tax raised $824 million, which, by Mikesell\u2019s calculation, required $11 billion in taxable sales.\nIts total personal income that year was about $44 billion, according to the state Department of Labor and Training.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe $11-billion figure is 25 percent of $44 billion, and that\u2019s the 25-percent figure that Henchman cited.\nBut there\u2019s a problem. Mikesell is measuring the percent of a state\u2019s total personal income that is captured by its sales tax.\nHenchman was talking about the percent of a state\u2019s total personal spending that is taxed, a very different amount.\nTo get that figure, you\u2019d have to know the total amount of retail sales in the state. Coming up with that number is next to impossible because the state doesn\u2019t track sales it doesn\u2019t tax, said Paul Dion, chief of revenue analysis for the Rhode Island Department of Revenue.\n\"I can\u2019t even tell you what our retail tax base is,\" Dion said. \"We\u2019d have to extrapolate that.\"\nIn 2012, the Connecticut Office of Legislative Research was looking at that state\u2019s sales tax rate and it used Mikesell\u2019s percentage also, but it made the point that Mikesell\u2019s comparison was to income, not sales.\n\"In other words, 26.19 percent of Connecticut personal income is spent on goods and services subject to the sales tax,\" the report said.\nWhen we got back to Henchman, he said Mikesell\u2019s personal income figure provides a uniform number that allows state-by-state comparisons. Dion agreed, and said when he heard Henchman\u2019s statement, that\u2019s how he understood it.\nOur ruling\nJoseph Henchman of the Tax Foundation said: \"Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island\u2019s sales tax.\"\nBut the figure he cited actually referred to personal income, not what people buy.\nIn fact, no one knows what percentage of everything that Rhode Islanders buy is subject to the sales tax because no one calculates total spending.\nDion might have understood what Henchman meant, but we have to go by what he said. We rule his statement False.\nCorrection: In the initial version of this item, Joseph Henchman was incorrectly identified as John Henchman in the Source List.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08553"}
