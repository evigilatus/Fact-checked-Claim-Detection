Rick Scott due to the state's failure to expand the Medicaid program. :: During the Governor &apos; s debate on 15 October 2014 at Broward College, Christ said about Medicaid &apos; s expansion: \"In addition to the $51 billion he will bring to the state over the next 10 years, some studies suggest that he will create some 120,000 jobs. This is the right thing to do.\" This is almost twice as many new jobs as Christ mentioned this summer. If Florida expands Medicaid, will that lead to another 120,000 jobs? Studies on medical assistance and jobs are a joint state-federal programme aimed at providing health insurance to the very poor. The Affordable Care Act 2010 encourages states to expand eligibility, with the federal government paying 100 per cent of the expansion for the first three years, down to 90 per cent in 2020 and beyond. This expansion would have led to an additional 800,000 to 1 million fluorescents joining the Medicaid programme. (This is mostly due to new Floridaans who are qualified, and also because some of those who are already qualified but have not signed will be enrolled in the program after the publicity.) Scott initially opposed the expansion of Medicaid but changed his position in 2013 when he came out to support it. But Scott did not put pressure on the legislative body led by the General Democratic Party, which ultimately rejected this expansion. He didn't say much about it in the campaign. Studies predicting job growth are based on the idea that new patients will have access to medical services that they did not use in the past as the states expand the Medicaid program. Additional revenues for health-care facilities will allow the employment of new workers. However, the number of posts expected in each study varies according to methodology. We found only one study that reached the level of the 120,000 Krest cited in the debate. That study had already been conducted in favour of expansion. Christ cited the analysis of the Florida Hospitals Association for 2013, which expected about 120,000 jobs. The Association commissioned a study by researchers from the University of Florida. During the discussion, Christ did not specify any time frame. Direct jobs account for about one third of jobs, while the remaining jobs include suppliers or secondary spending, such as when a doctor buys a new house or car. Other studies have indicated much lower figures for job growth. For example, last year Modi, a financial analysis company that does not have a position on health care law, predicted that the expansion of Medicaid would create between 10,000 and 30,000 jobs over 10 years in Florida. The White House Council of Economic Advisers expects 63,800 jobs between 2014 and 2017 in Florida. This study was part of the promotion of the Affordable Care Act by the Obama Administration. On July 2, 2012, Rick Scott was mentioned in his comments on CCNBC's Medicaid expansion, which will cost Florida $1.9 billion a year. The White House study depends in part on the Oregon health insurance experience, with some residents receiving medecaid through the lottery. Research has shown that people at Medicaid received preventive tests such as mammograms, cholesterol tests, and blood cancer scans compared to the control group. The White House is expected to expand Medicaid to allow tens of thousands of Floridans to obtain such preventive tests. Experts weigh in studies, so why the huge differences in work predictions? The figures vary based on different economic models used and other assumptions. :: Polyte Fact Florida interviewed several experts in the studies conducted after the first discussion, held in Telemendo, when Christ made a similar allegation about new jobs from Medicaid &apos; s expansion. Dan Wyatt, the chief economist who wrote the Moody study, said that the study of the Hospital Association seemed to assume that anyone who signed into Medicaid's expansion would generate new tunnels. But at least some of the people who were going to join Medicaid were already getting some medical services - despite their incompetence in emergency rooms. \"They're treating all the money coming to the expansion of Medicaid as a new medical expenditure in Florida, but some of these people are already spending money,\" said Wyatt. \"The essence of our analysis is the transformation of those who pay for it. It may be true that these people support 120,000 jobs, but perhaps 10,000 to 30,000 new jobs.\" Some experts in the expansion of Medicaid Polite Fact Florida told that a federal injection of Medicaid expansion would lead to some growth in employment, but asked for a certain number. \"The payment of federal dollars to the state is likely to be stimulating, but the accurate calculation of jobs (given the many simultaneous changes in politics) is difficult,\" said Harvard Health Economics Professor Catherine Baker of Poletti Fact Florida. Michael Tanner, a health-care expert at the Liberal Cato Institute, said that it was impossible to predict jobs. \"I think there'll be some short-term employment gains, but in the long run it'll be more problematic with the billing due,\" he said. \"But even in the short term, I doubt the size and accuracy of this estimate.\" Although most of the experts we met agreed that there would be some growth in employment opportunities, the economist at the University of Chicago Casey B. \"Medicaid makes low income less painful, so people have less incentive to take action to prevent their incomes from falling,\" previously told Paulette Fuckett. \"Not everyone behaves this way, but enough that expansion of Medicaid would reduce employment at the national level.\" Christ our governor said \"some studies indicate\" the Medicaid expansion would \"create about 120,000 jobs.\" Christ was referring to a single study of the Florida Hospital Association, which is supportive of Medicaid expansion. The study predicted some 120,000 new jobs. Several studies have been carried out predicting the growth of employment in connection with the expansion of the Medicaid programme, one of which indicated that this figure has fallen to 10,000 jobs. Christ chose to study with the highest statistics and omitted to have an association in support of expansion. Most economists and Medicaid experts say that the injection of federal cash is likely to lead to some jobs, but it is difficult to determine the number.
