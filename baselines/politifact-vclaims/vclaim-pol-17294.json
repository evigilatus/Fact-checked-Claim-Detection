Yet\u00a0Greenfield lost\u00a0by almost 7 percentage points.\nThat trend proved true in Iowa\u2019s state and local races as well. Iowa Republicans flipped seven Iowa House seats and maintained control of all their Senate seats, even though the Iowa Democratic Party\u00a0outraised\u00a0the Republican Party of Iowa by almost $3 million.\nIowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann made note of that when he\u00a0tweeted\u00a0on Nov. 27 that \"Sir Frederick Hubbell literally blew 100s of thousands of dollars on #ialegis races where there were plenty of reasons to believe the GOP would win, but he had an ax to grind with the family or candidate.\"\nSir Frederick Hubbell literally blew 100s of thousands of dollars on #ialegis races where there were plenty of reasons to believe the GOP would win, but he had an ax to grind with the family or candidate. Hubbell's rather infantile anger certainly got in the way of common sense.\u2014 Jeff Kaufmann (@kaufmannGOP) November 27, 2020 \nIt was a reference to Fred Hubbell, a wealthy Des Moines businessman who is a significant Democratic Party donor and the party\u2019s 2018 candidate for Iowa governor.\nIn a subsequent\u00a0tweet\u00a0on Nov. 28, Kaufmann wrote:\n\"Millions of Hubbell and Bloomberg dollars wasn\u2019t enough to overcome the Iowa House Republican avalanche of success. Sir Frederick and Little Mike have the political skills of President Millard Fillmore.\"\nMillions of Hubbell and Bloomberg dollars wasn't enough to overcome the Iowa House Republican avalanche of success. Sir Frederick and Little Mike have the political skills of President Millard Fillmore. #ialegis #iapolitics\u2014 Jeff Kaufmann (@kaufmannGOP) November 28, 2020 \nThe\u00a0White House biography\u00a0of Millard Fillmore describes the nation\u2019s 13th president as an \"uninspiring man.\"\nWe looked at whether Hubbell and Bloomberg really spent millions so ineffectually during the general election.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloomberg, the billionaire former Mayor of New York who ran for president unsuccessfully this year, is known as a Democratic fundraising giant and has donated to Iowa campaigns in the past. He donated $250,000 to Hubbell\u2019s 2018 gubernatorial campaign and another $250,000 to the Iowa Democratic Party that same year,\u00a0campaign reports\u00a0show.\nThis year, however, Bloomberg did not donate money to Iowa\u2019s state legislative candidates or the party, according to data from the\u00a0Iowa Elections and Campaign Disclosure Board, so spending by him could not have been thwarted by Republican House success in the election.\u00a0\nHubbell is a different story. The former gubernatorial candidate who lost to Republican Kim Reynolds in 2018, Hubbell continued to be a regular Democratic Party donor in 2020.\nHubbell has donated $156,450 to Iowa Democratic candidates for the Legislature and Democratic organizations since Jan. 1, financial disclosure reports examined at the beginning of December showed. Hubbell\u2019s wife, Charlotte Hubbell, donated $5,350, and combined, the two have donated $164,300.\nWhile individual contributions to campaigns are important, political action committees (PACs) are another aspect of campaign finance. Because PACs are not as tightly regulated as campaign committees, it\u2019s difficult sometimes to know where that money comes from or what is done with it. But, we know that the\u00a0Better Democracy PAC, which Fred and Charlotte Hubbell founded in 2019 with the goal of flipping the Iowa House,\u00a0donated $1,150,864\u00a0to Iowa House candidates, the Democratic Party and party funds such as ActBlue and Path to Victory.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s fair to say that Fred Hubbell spent thousands of dollars in this election cycle. Judging whether or not that money was put to good use is a subjective call.\nNeither Hubbell nor the Better Democracy PAC could be reached for comment when PolitiFact tried to contact them.\nOf the 23 Democratic state legislative candidates whom the Hubbells and the Better Democracy PAC donated to directly, eight won and 15 lost. Of those who won, two won by more than 10 percentage points and two ran unchallenged. Of those who lost, six lost by more than 10 percentage points and two lost by almost 30 percentage points.\nOther races were more tightly contested, though, with some being decided by just a few hundred votes.\nWe tried to reach Kaufmann for comment for this story several times but did not hear back from him.\nOur ruling\nThe claim that Michael Bloomberg spent substantially in this year\u2019s Iowa legislative races is false. He did not donate directly to any legislative candidates in 2020. He donated to political organizations that, in turn, donated to other political organizations that sent money to Iowa candidates, but others also contributed to those organizations to support Democrats in several states. Saying Bloomberg donated to the organizations to pump thousands of his dollars to Iowa would distort how that funding is distributed.\nHubbell, on the other hand, donated to Iowa legislative candidates, both personally and through the Better Democracy PAC. While the motivation behind Hubbell\u2019s spending is unclear, it\u2019s true that several of the candidates Hubbell supported were defeated handily by Republicans, a point Kaufmann can make in his argument about Hubbell. However, other Democratic legislative candidates Hubbell supported financially won or lost by just a few hundred votes, indicating some of those races were competitive.\nWe\u2019re splitting the difference here with the claims about Bloomberg\u2019s spending false and Hubbell\u2019s spending true, for a rating for the tweet of Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17294"}
