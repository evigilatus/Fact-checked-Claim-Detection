So we decided to check whether Will was right.\n\nWe turned to two sources. One is the National Bureau of Economic Research, an independent group of economists that is the de facto arbiter of when recessions begin and end. The other is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that calculates all manner of employment figures.\n\nBelow we list the last five recessions as declared by the NBER, along with the difference in U.S. non-farm employment levels between the official start of the recession and the official end:\n\nJan. 1980 to July 1980: 968,000 jobs lost\nJuly 1981 to Nov. 1982: 2,824,000 jobs lost\nJuly 1990 to March 1991: 1,249,000 jobs lost\nMarch 2001 to Nov. 2001: 1,599,000 jobs lost\nTotal jobs lost in the four prior recessions: 6,640,000\n\n\"Great Recession\" -- Dec. 2007 to June 2009: 7,490,000 jobs lost\n\nSo the numbers show that Will is right -- about 850,000 more jobs were lost during the great recession than in the previous four recessions combined.\n\nWe wondered, though, whether the result would be different if we factored in the size of the labor force, which has grown over the past three decades. It\u2019s impossible to make the same exact comparison Will did -- that is, comparing the sum of the past four recessions with the current one -- because you can\u2019t simply add together percentages drawn from different time periods. But we thought we\u2019d at least see whether the 2007-2009 recession registered more jobs lost on a percentage basis than any of the prior ones.\n\nHere are the numbers for jobs lost as a percentage of the labor force:\n\nJan. 1980 to July 1980: 1.0 percent\nJuly 1981 to Nov. 1982: 3.1 percent\nJuly 1990 to March 1991: 1.1 percent\nMarch 2001 to Nov. 2001: 1.2 percent\n\n\"Great Recession\" -- Dec. 2007 to June 2009: Recession decreased jobs by 5.4 percent\n\nSo job losses in the \"Great Recession\" have, on a percentage basis, exceeded those in each of the past four recessions. We rate it True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
