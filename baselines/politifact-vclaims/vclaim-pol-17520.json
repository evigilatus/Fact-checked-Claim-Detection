Paid Family Leave would allow parents the flexibility necessary 2 ensure they are able 2 put their family first,\" state Rep. David Crowley, D-Milwaukee, said Oct. 22, 2019 in a Twitter post.\nCrowley\u2019s tweet came on the same day Assembly Democrats reintroduced the Wisconsin Family Medical Leave Insurance Act.\nUnder the bill, Wisconsin workers without employer-funded family medical leave would be able to buy into a state-run insurance program. The proposal would expand the state\u2019s current family medical leave law to allow individuals to take leave for more family members, including care of grandparents and siblings.\nAccording to a Legislative Reference Bureau analysis, a covered individual who is on family or medical leave would be eligible, beginning on Jan. 1, 2024, to receive up to 12 weeks of family or medical leave insurance benefits. This is the third time the measure has been introduced; it has not gained support from Republican lawmakers.\nIs Crowley, who has announced his candidacy for Milwaukee County executive, on target about the cost of child care for Wisconsin families?\nLet\u2019s take a look.\n\nThe evidence\n\nWhen asked for backup, Crowley\u2019s staff pointed us to a 2018 United Way report. The report focused on a population group that has been given the acronym ALICE -- Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed. The ALICE Report was part of a collaboration between the United Way in Wisconsin and 16 other states.\nIndeed, the report itself includes a line that is nearly identical to Crowley\u2019s tweet:\n\"In the Household Survival Budget, child care accounts for 24 percent of the Wisconsin family budget, well above the 10 percent affordability threshold established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\"\nBut where did the numbers come from?\nOfficials with the state Department of Children and Families told us they do not collect that data. They pointed us to a series of advocacy groups, as opposed to any government agency or repository.\nAccording to the United Way, the report\u2019s child care budget is based on the average annual cost of care for one infant and one preschooler in registered family child care homes -- the least expensive childcare option.\nThe most recent U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports, dating from 2016 onward, recommend that child care be considered affordable if out-of-pocket costs are equivalent to 7% of total household income.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn earlier years, dating back to at least 2015, the federal benchmark for child care affordability was reported as 10%, the figure referenced in the second part of Crowley\u2019s tweet.\n\nAdditional groups\n\nOther advocacy groups have done their own tallies -- though each measures a slightly different thing:\nEconomic Policy Institute: A July 2019 report from the institute puts the average cost of infant child care in Wisconsin at $12,597 a year. The report states that care for one infant would take up 18.5% of a median family\u2019s income in Wisconsin. Wisconsin is ranked 20th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia for most expensive infant care.\nThe group\u2019s source list includes the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Child Care Aware of America and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nChild Care Aware: According to a 2017 report, the average cost of center-based infant care across all states tops 27% of the median income for single parents, an increase of 3 percentage points from findings in the group\u2019s 2016 report, \"Parents and the High Cost of Care.\"\nThe group says it obtains data through surveys of state child-care referral agencies. For states that did not respond to the survey, child care capacity and price data was pulled from publicly accessible databases and market rate surveys.\nCenter for American Progress: On average, a family making the state median income in the United States would have to spend 18% of its income to cover the cost of child care for an infant, according to a November 2018 report.\nThe 18% number is based on the state median income for a family of four, which comes from 2018 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data.\n\"It\u2019s also important to flag that the 18% number is the cost of child care for an infant in a center-based program. If you are focused on home-based child care as implied by one part of the statement we would note that the number for home-based family care is 11%,\" Steven Jessen-Howard, a Center for American Progress spokesman, said in an email.\n\"The high cost of child care is out of reach for most working families,\" said Simon Workman, co-author of the American Progress report in a statement.\nIn short, each of the studies support Crowley\u2019s central point that child care costs consume a far greater share of an average Wisconsin family\u2019s budget than is recommended -- though the estimates vary, from 11% to 27%.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCrowley said \"child care costs account for 24% of a WI family\u2019s budget.\"\nChild care costs can vary, of course, based on age of the child, number of children receiving care and where the care is provided. But each of the available reports supports Crowley\u2019s main point -- that the costs far exceed the recommended amount -- even if the numbers come up somewhat different in each analysis.\nAt PolitiFact Wisconsin, a statement is Mostly True when \"it is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\" That fits here.\nThis fact-check has been updated to change an emailed quote mistakenly attributed to Julia Cusick of the Center for American Progress\u00a0to Steven Jessen-Howard from the same organization.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17520"}
