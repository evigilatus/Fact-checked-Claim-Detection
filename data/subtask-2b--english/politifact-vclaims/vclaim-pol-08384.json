Clarke Jr.\u2019s reaction was basically no way: \"I won't spend one penny of taxpayer money on Abele's self-importance exercise.\"\nSupervisor Jason Haas said Abele was wealthy enough to pay for his own security. Others noted Scott Walker had no security when he had Abele\u2019s job. Abele said he\u2019d received threats.\nThe County Board ultimately carved 75% from Abele\u2019s plan for $400,000 worth of protection and assigned the duty to -- who else? -- Clarke\u2019s office, then overrode an Abele veto to make it happen.\nAfter tempers cooled, County Supervisor David Cullen portrayed the outcome as a victory for Abele and the taxpayers.\n\"The County Executive also requested $400,000 for his personal security,\" Cullen wrote in his year-end 2013 newsletter to constituents. \"The Board allocated $100,000 from the Sheriff's budget for this purpose. This will provide the County Executive with the same level of security as the Governor and the Mayor of Milwaukee while saving taxpayers $300,000.\"\nWe can\u2019t say what the appropriate level of spending is. But let\u2019s check that last statement by the county supervisor.\nDid the move provide the same level of security, while saving money?\nHow spending compares\nFor the record, Abele believes the County Board-approved plan is inadequate.\nHis spokesman, Brendan Conway, said Milwaukee Police officials privately estimated -- based on what it costs to protect Mayor Tom Barrett -- that it would cost $400,000 to protect Abele.\nMPD spokesman Mark Stanmeyer told us that the $400,000 figure (it\u2019s $500,000 including overtime) includes police presence in the entire municipal complex, not just for protecting and driving Barrett to events. Officers are stationed at the Treasurer\u2019s office, for instance.\nIt\u2019s clear, though, from what police tell us that a significant chunk of the $400,000 covers Barrett, and that multiple officers are part of the team that protects and escorts him.\nBy contrast, the county plan is limited to $100,000 and county supervisors say they were told the funds would cover salary and benefits for the equivalent of one full-time deputy.\nIn addition, Conway said Clarke so far is talking about an on-call system, not a body attached to the exec\u2019s office. In addition, Abele would only be escorted when outside the Courthouse. That would be different than the City Hall setup, where police provide security for Barrett both while working in his office and outside City Hall at various functions.\nAs for Walker, who was elected governor in 2010, it\u2019s clear that his security costs greatly exceed $100,000.\nFactors include a large increase in threats he and his family reported receiving in the wake of his Act 10 collective bargaining law, and the fact that his two sons lived at home in suburban Milwaukee during the height of the protests over the law. The governor has maintained separate residences in Madison and Wauwatosa.\nThe costs of the governor's security detail totaled $611,400 over the 10 months from Walker's election in November 2010 to the end of August 2011, the Journal Sentinel reported at the time. That also covers the lieutenant governor, Rebecca Kleefisch.\nThat was more than twice as much as it cost to protect then-Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle over the comparable 10-month period from November 2009 to August 2010. We could not get updated figures.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2013, a state transportation spokesperson told the Capital Times that the State Patrol unit responsible for providing security for the governor, lieutenant governor and visiting dignitaries has doubled its staffing from five to 10 since Walker took office.\nAs is readily evident to the public, a State Trooper squad is a fixture in the driveway of the Walkers\u2019 home in Wauwatosa.\nIn light of these facts, we asked Cullen about his newsletter claim that Abele would get \"the same level of security\" as Barrett and Walker.\nHe told us he \"may have chosen my words inartfully,\" explaining that he meant only that professional law enforcement would protect Abele just as it does Walker and Barrett.\n\"I wasn\u2019t necessarily arguing it was the same level of man hours the governor or mayor gets,\" Cullen said.\nA day later, Cullen said it was possible the county and city security could be more comparable than at first blush.\nThe comparison is not as straightforward as it seems, he said, because the county figure ($100,000) doesn\u2019t include spending on the security checkpoints at the public entrances to the Courthouse. Those checkpoints, staffed primarily by security-trained county facilities employees and lately with help from sheriff\u2019s deputies, give the Courthouse a security dimension lacking at City Hall.\nTrue, but it\u2019s hard to get past the fact that Barrett gets close personal attention inside and outside City Hall, while Abele would only have escorts outside the Courthouse -- and possibly only on an on-call basis.\nIn sum, we think Cullen\u2019s claim would read to most people as comparable security presence for Abele and the other two officials, and it falls way short of that.\nIs it a savings?\nWhat about the $300,000 savings Cullen claimed from the County Board\u2019s action? He bragged about it in his newsletter under the headline, \"County Board Adopts a no-tax increase Budget While Protecting Core Services.\"\nWhile it\u2019s true the board slashed Abele\u2019s security request by that amount, the money was not used for tax relief. Instead, the money went for new spending: The County Board shifted the $300,000 through a budget amendment to beef up the county\u2019s existing support of emergency homeless shelters.\nFinally, what will happen now that Abele and Clarke -- bitter personal and political rivals -- have to work out a security plan?\nClarke told us he\u2019s still angry that Abele eliminated the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s dignitary protection unit in the 2012 election year, opening Clarke to criticism about not fully participating in security when President Obama visited the area.\n\"Now in his narcissistic way (Abele) feels his security should be funded without question as to cost,\" Clarke told us. Conway\u2019s response: Clarke has made clear he has the authority to provide whatever function he wants.\nClarke, who is certified in dignitary protection work, declined to discuss how the department would arrange protection for Abele, citing the need to keep such details secret for safety reasons. He called it a \"gross breach of security\" for Conway to discuss it with the media.\nLast fall, an Abele aide told county supervisors Abele would want to hand-pick the sheriff\u2019s deputy assigned to him.\nWe\u2019ll have to stay tuned to see if he picks the sheriff for the job.\nOur rating\nCullen said action by the Milwaukee County Board will \"provide the County Executive with the same level of security as the Governor and the Mayor of Milwaukee while saving taxpayers $300,000.\"\nThere are major problems with the claim, which Cullen acknowledges was poorly phrased.\nCullen emphasized how much the County Board\u2019s action would save taxpayers, but there is no real savings. It actually costs taxpayers more money.\nAbele\u2019s personal security would fall far short of the governor\u2019s and also appears to be less intense than that accorded to Mayor Tom Barrett. Cullen now says he meant only that Abele would have law enforcement security as do those two officials. But his newsletter said \"same level.\"\nFor these reasons, we rate his statement Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08384"}
