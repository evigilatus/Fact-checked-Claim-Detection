President Trump\u2019s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America\u2019s existence. And while the United States has been mired in endless wars and bloody occupations over the past 17 years, China has used that same period to aggressively develop economic partnerships across Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa. Perhaps that is one reason China will soon overtake the United States as the world\u2019s largest economy.\"\nIt's a common refrain, regardless of who's in the White House.\u00a0In February 2016, we rated Mostly True a statement by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush that \"Barack Obama will somehow manage to add more than $8 trillion to the national debt, which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together.\"\nSo is it really true that \"President Trump\u2019s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America\u2019s existence\"?\nPretty much.\nA few preliminaries. First, there are two common measures for debt. One, called public debt, tallies up the debt held by the public, while gross federal debt is a larger figure that combines publicly held debt plus debt held by the government itself, such as in the Social Security or Medicare trust funds. Both figures are considered legitimate, and since Scarborough didn\u2019t specify which one she was referring to, we\u2019ll run the numbers for both categories of debt.\nBecause debt is cumulative (minus any intervening surpluses) the debt level at the end of a given time period is the cumulative debt up to that point -- you don\u2019t have to add the yearly figures for debt to get the figure Scarborough is referencing.\nCalculating the debt\nThe first question to answer is, when do you start counting to calculate debt for \"the first 200 years of America\u2019s existence\"? (An NBC spokesman didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry.)\nProbably the most obvious way to do it is to look at the cumulative debt between 1776, the date of the Declaration of Independence, and 1976, the national bicentennial year.\nAt the end of 1976, the public debt was $477.4 billion, and the gross federal debt was just under $629 billion.\nSo how does that compare to Trump\u2019s record?\nThe amount of public debt added in 2017 -- a year when Trump was president for all but 20 days and when the Republicans were in control of Congress -- was $497.8 billion, while the amount of gross federal debt added was $666.3 billion.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhichever variety of debt you use, the amount of debt added under Republican control in 2017 was greater than the accumulated debt by the end of 1976, making Scarborough\u2019s statement correct. (Economists do not typically adjust debt figures for inflation; the figures cited above are nominal dollars.)\nMeanwhile, projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office suggest that the size of the debt under Trump will only grow from what it was in 2017. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, the debt is projected to increase by more than $1 trillion in each year.\nSome might suggest starting the clock in 1788 -- when the Constitution was ratified -- and stopping it in 1988, rather than starting with pre-Revolutionary War independence. In that scenario, the accumulated public debt over 200 years would be $2.1 trillion and the accumulated general debt would be $2.6 trillion. That would make Scarborough\u2019s calculation incorrect.\nHowever, \"I think most people would say America began its existence in 1776,\" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.\nSome caveats\nBeyond the starting date, we see a few caveats.\nFirst, Scarborough lays the blame entirely at the Republicans\u2019 feet. However, decisions made by Democrats or by both parties long before Trump\u2019s tenure have shaped how much was added to the debt in 2017.\nNet interest on the debt accounted for 6.6 percent of federal spending in 2017, and mandatory spending -- outlays that are essentially on autopilot, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- accounted for an additional 63.3 percent of federal spending. So the broad outlines of today\u2019s spending picture were not solely set by today\u2019s Republican congressional majorities and Republican president.\nSecond,\u00a0the inevitable grind of inflation and population growth puts an upward pressure on the scale of the debt. Unless and until the United States reverses course and starts paying down the debt, every new president will preside over ever-larger amounts of debt.\nA better way to look at debt is by measuring debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, Ellis said. That\u2019s because a more economically productive country can more easily carry a big debt load.\nAnd how do those figures look? Here\u2019s a chart.\n\nAs the chart shows, the current level of debt as a percentage of GDP is not unprecedented (it was higher around World War II) and its growth has eased recently since a spike after the Great Recession. The recession both fed higher spending on the national safety net and weakened the denominator, which is gross domestic product.\nThe chart does show that, when looking at a percentage of GDP, Scarborough is correct in his comparison. Debt as a percentage of GDP in 2017 was far\u00a0higher (almost 77 percent)\u00a0 than it was in 1976 (about 27 percent).\nOur ruling\nScarborough said, \"President Trump\u2019s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America\u2019s existence.\"\nIf you use the period 1776 to 1976, Scarborough is correct. However, it\u2019s worth noting that much of today\u2019s debt picture owes something to guidelines for mandatory spending and net interest for past debts, both of which were shaped by both parties.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2018-09-12 19:19:59 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"President Trump\u2019s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America\u2019s existence.\"    Joe Scarborough MSNBC host https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-is-harming-the-dream-of-america-more-than-any-foreign-adversary-ever-could/2018/09/10/662e21a4-b52e-11e8-a2c5-3187f427e253_story.html?utm_term=.7f4070bb109b   a column in the Washington Post Tuesday, September 11, 2018 2018-09-11    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01630"}
