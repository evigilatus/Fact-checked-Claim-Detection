Republican state Sen. Jon Husted, of the Dayton area, is O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s opponent.\n\n\"It's factually correct to say that Ken Blackwell had at least 18 lawsuits that were even carried over that Jennifer Brunner inherited when she came into the office as a result of his mismanagement of the 2004 election,\" O\u2019Shaughnessy said in an Aug. 16 interview with WPKO/WBLL in Bellefontaine, a city in west-central Ohio, after a speech to local Democrats.\n\nBrunner, a Democrat, was elected in November 2006 to succeed Blackwell after he lost a gubernatorial bid that year. O\u2019Shaughnessy told the radio station that, if elected, she would maintain the stability Brunner brought to the office.\n\nO\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s comments put her on a long list of Democrats to criticize Blackwell. We wanted to check out her claim and asked her campaign for information about the lawsuits. A spokeswoman pointed to a letter Brunner wrote The Columbus Dispatch and a separate news story that appeared in The Daily Record, of Wooster.\n\nIn a letter to the Dispatch published Feb. 18, 2007, Brunner said 21 lawsuits were pending when she took office. She did not say how many were related to the 2004 presidential election. The Daily Record story, published April 5, 2007, also said 21 lawsuits were pending when Brunner took office. The story made no mention of the 2004 presidential election.\n\nThe portion of O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s statement that said Brunner inherited \"at least 18 lawsuits\" seemed solid. But there was no proof, within the evidence O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s office provided -- that those lawsuits were related to the 2004 presidential election.\n\nWe checked with Brunner\u2019s office, which provided a comprehensive list of all cases that Brunner inherited from Blackwell. It is not specific to the 2004 presidential election, Brunner spokesman Patrick Gallaway said. The list, last updated in January, shows Brunner inherited 18 cases when she took office, including one settled during Blackwell\u2019s term with unpaid fees.\n\nCourt documents showed 10 of the 18 cases are related to Blackwell\u2019s administration of the 2004 presidential election. The others dealt with a myriad of issues, including campaign finance law and the use of electronic voting machines.\n\nTo their credit, the O\u2019Shaughnessy campaign acknowledged she was incorrect after we shared the records from Brunner\u2019s office with them.\n\n\"She misspoke about the ones that relate to 2004,\" spokeswoman Heidi Hubmann said.\n\nO\u2019Shaughnessy clearly jumped to an inaccurate conclusion about Blackwell\u2019s job performance in the radio interview. Her sources of information, two newspaper articles from 2007, do not support the meat of her claim \u2013 that Blackwell\u2019s mismanagement of the 2004 election led to at least 18 lawsuits that landed in Brunner\u2019s lap. Brunner\u2019s records show that\u2019s not true.\n\nWe rate the statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14455"}
