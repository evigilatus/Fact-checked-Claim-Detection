Scott Walker can be a reverse reaction to students. If government assistance to technology schools is not enhanced at the same time, the candidate for governorship states that a freeze on education may require the cancellation of courses upon request. Burke does not rule out supporting education by freezing herself if she wins the November 4, 2014 elections. But she says it's more important to get financial support for students so that they can afford to go to school -- like increasing government aid to maintain the cost of college. The biggest issue I think is that we now have 41,000 people on the waiting list for financial assistance for tech colleges and universities, most of these people on the waiting list for tech colleges, and Burke said during the 22 September 2014 interview by Wisconsin's eyes. Did he reject so many students? In support of its allegations, the Burke campaign referred to a memorandum on 31 July 2014 prepared by the non-partisan Legislative Finance Bureau of the State of Sin. Jennifer Shelling (D-La Crosse). We also followed up on a subsequent memorandum from the Agency dated 19 August 2014. Both notes studied Wisconsin grants, a state-funded program that provides grants on the basis of need to university students enrolled at least half-time in one of four sectors: UW-System institutions, tech colleges, private and non-profit schools, or tribal colleges. You must be a resident of the State to receive money. However, the State spent about $106 million in 2013-2014 on grants. Although it may not be as well known as federal financial aid programs, the state program helps a lot of people. In UW schools and technology schools alone, some 57,000 students received grants for the period 2013-2014. University schools receive allocations, and tech schools operate with a separate amount of money. The average grant for a UW student was $1,775; the average grant for technology students was $994. In the technology system, priority is given to the provision of grants. In the UW system, priority in service is until the allocation of each campus is spent. In 2013-2014, more than 41,000 financial aid applicants eligible for State assistance did not receive any assistance due to lack of funds, according to the Office &apos; s tax note. The note stated that more than nine out of 10 rejected applicants were in technology schools. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021, Financial Office figures on the target, according to John Reynman, Executive Secretary of the Higher Education AIDS Council in Wisconsin, who manages the grants, and Connor Smith, Director of Strategic Partnerships and External Relations of the Technical College System in Wisconsin. Those who have not received a grant are listed if they remain in school if the grant funds are available. The demand began to exceed the supply of grant funds during the Great Recession period, when more people were returning to school for retraining and low incomes meant that many more were eligible for aid. \"Unmet needs\" reached 80,000 in 2009, showing statistics. Technology schools alone saw 54,000 students rejected in 2012. However, there is a somewhat lower word for numbers than the eye sees for waiting list numbers. There are some possibilities - apparently relatively minor - between the UW system and the numbers of the Wisconsin university system at the Technical College. Technical schools put you on the waiting list if you're eligible for one of their awards, and you listed the technology school as the first option for your application for financial assistance. The Financial Office indicates that it does not know how many of these applicants actually attend a technology school. Maybe they went to a private university instead, and maybe they got a scholarship from one of those institutions. Although some did so because they did not receive the technical school grant, others took a different route for other reasons. This situation means that the technology school list most likely increases the unmet need, and the Financial Bureau analyst Emily Pope wrote. On the contrary, the UW list - which includes only students who have actually attended UW school - is likely to underestimate it because it does not include applicants who may have registered there if they have received a UW grant, so for all these reasons, the waiting list number of 41,000 is our best, but not a solid rock. Our evaluation says Burke: \"Now we have 41,000 people on the waiting list for financial assistance for our tech colleges and universities,\" most of them for technology schools. There is a large waiting list, and Burke cites a reliable source of its size. However, some differences in how lists are defined by different institutions mean that the number should be treated with some caution. We assess her claim mostly correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07217"}
