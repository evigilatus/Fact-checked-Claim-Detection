If they are at war against us, which they have declared, we must commit ourselves to unconditional victory against them,\" Giuliani said.\n\"This includes undoing one of the worst deals America ever made - Obama\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran that will eventually let them become a nuclear power and it\u2019s putting billions of dollars back into a country that\u2019s the world\u2019s largest supporter of terrorism. We are actually giving them the money to fund the terrorists that are killing us and our allies. We are giving them the money. Are we crazy? Donald Trump will make sure any agreement with Iran meets the original goals of the U.N. and our allies - a non-nuclear Iran.\"\nRepublicans in Congress have opposed the nuclear deal. They tried to block it through a vote in the Senate, but the effort failed by two votes. Since then it\u2019s been a talking point on the campaign trail both in national and statewide races.\nIs Giuliani right about the details of the Iran nuclear deal?\n\u2018Billions of dollars\u2019 to Iran\nA similar claim has been made before about the money Iran will receive under the deal.\nIn March, Donald Trump said in Florida that Iran would be given $150 billion \u2018for nothing\u2019 as part of the deal. As PolitiFact has reported previously, the money already belongs to Iran and the final amount is expected to be closer to $50 billion.\nGiuliani did not specify an amount that Iran will receive. PolitiFact previously rated Donald Trump\u2019s claim as False.\nMoney to Iran\nThe countries involved are not collectively writing a check to Iran. According to Richard Nephew from Columbia University, the money is revenue from oil and gas sales that foreign banks are forced to hold.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the sanctions lifted, Iran was expected to end up with about $50 billion after financial obligations and other matters, according to experts we spoke to and testimony from Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.\nIran would not receive the money without U.S. permission. If the U.S. had not cut a deal with Iran, the funds would still be frozen under the sanctions. So while no taxpayer money goes to Iran, the U.S. allowed Iran to receive billions of dollars.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much money has been released to Iran. The sanctions were lifted when the deal was implemented earlier this year, but only the Iranian Central Bank knows exactly how much is available to the country.\nSponsor of terrorism\nMore than 30 years ago the U.S. State Department designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. The country remains on that list.\nEach year the State Department releases reports on international terrorism for Congress and the public. This year\u2019s report was released in June.\nIn a briefing with reporters to discuss the report, the department\u2019s acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism Justin Siberell called Iran the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism. Iran sponsors Hezbollah in Lebanon, terrorist groups in Gaza, and groups in Iraq and the Middle East.\nExperts we spoke to are mixed on whether the deal means Iran has increased terror funding. Matthew Kroenig from Georgetown University suggests that could happen. No experts had evidence that Iran's funding of terror groups had grown.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nAt the Republican National Convention, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said the United States is giving Iran billions of dollars under the Iran nuclear deal and that the money is being used to fund terrorists. He also called Iran the world\u2019s largest supporter of terrorism.\nGiuliani is right that Iran ranks as the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism. The billions of dollars released to Iran was\u00a0already Iran\u2019s money, but could only be released with U.S. consent. On the last part of Giuiani's claim, experts\u00a0have said it\u2019s difficult to know whether Iran has used any of the money to sponsor terrorist groups.\nWe rate this claim as Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d81d1a7d-7aa5-47d8-b7e3-1859f23fc5b8", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04521"}
