Do a full 70 percent of Oregon families in poverty have a parent who works?\nWe first rang Chuck Sheketoff, the executive director of the Silverton-based center, who said that the figure was part of the center\u2019s June 27, 2013, \"Working But Still Poor\" fact sheet. \"Work is not a sure path out of poverty,\" it said.\nA pie chart on the second page says that 69 percent of families in poverty were \"working families,\" composed of 22 percent who had \"at least one parent working full time\" and 47 percent who had \"at least one parent working less than full time.\" About 31 percent of the families had no parent working.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe numbers were from the center\u2019s analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2011 American Community Survey data.\nSheketoff pointed us to Jason Gettel, the center\u2019s policy analyst who crunched those numbers. Gettel explained that he used DataFerrett, a free data analysis program promoted on the Census Bureau\u2019s website. DataFerrett allows users to analyze all of the survey responses to carve out data in different ways.\n\"We wanted to see what proportion of families in poverty had a worker present to show that people do live in poverty despite the fact that they work,\" Gettel said. \"They\u2019re there because some jobs pay too little, or they\u2019ve been laid off for some period of time, but not because they don\u2019t put forth a work effort.\"\nGettel walked us through DataFerrett and showed us how he selected certain variables in order to limit the survey responses to arrive at the \"7 out of 10\" number.\nHe limited the data to only the Oregon families who are in poverty with a related child. He then searched for types of work experience by different family members, such as \"householder worked full-time in the past 12 months and spouse worked full time in the past 12 months\" or \"female householder worked less than full-time in the past 12 months and no spouse present.\"\nFinally, the numbers were weighted to more accurately reflect statewide numbers, since the American Community Survey does not count as many people as the 2010 U.S. Census.\nThe analysis showed that there were 437,991 families with children in Oregon. Of those, 86,255 were in poverty. This is the pool of Oregon families we would use for further calculations.\nNext we did some simple addition and subtraction. We first added up the 3,042 families where neither the householder nor the spouse worked; the 4,429 families where single male householders did not work; and the 19,339 families where single female householders did not work.\nThis showed us that 26,810 of the 86,255 Oregon families with children had a parent who did not work in the previous year, roughly 31 percent. Put another way, 59,445 Oregon families with children in poverty \u2014 69 percent \u2014 had a parent who worked at least part time in the previous year.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that the Census data only breaks down work experience by three different types and only over a 12-month period: full-time work, less than full-time work, or no work.\nThat means somebody who last worked a one-month retail job during the 2012 holiday season would qualify as a less than full-time worker.\nWe\u2019re not sure that most people count that as a parent who works. Indeed, government officials generally categorize people unemployed for six months or longer as \"long-term unemployed.\"\nWe also want to note that \"poverty\" is defined as the federal poverty threshold. For 2011, that threshold was $18,123 for a single parent with two children and $22,811 for a two-parent family with two children. The threshold varies depending on the number of adults and children and whether the adults are under 65 years old.\nNext we wanted to verify that Gettel had used the right variables to arrive at the right numbers. DataFerrett, to put it nicely, is not the most intuitive program for the average user.\nWe called the U.S. Census Bureau, where a survey statistician in the poverty statistics branch also used DataFerrett to check our variables and numbers.\n\"The process that was used was the correct process,\" said Robert Bernstein, a bureau spokesman. \"The end result was this 69 percent figure.\"\nLastly, we wondered if similar studies had been done. Again, we turned to the Census Bureau.\nOne table indicated that nearly 64 percent of Oregon families with income below the poverty level in the previous year had a worker in the family. Those data were from the 2011 American Community Survey.\nAnother 2011 Census table based on national data showed that, of the 33.1 million people in families in poverty, 21.1 million individuals were in families with at least one worker \u2014 about 64 percent.\nNeither of those studies was limited to families with children.\nWe looked at some other studies, too, and saw similar percentages. None of these studies is a perfect apples-to-apples comparison to the Oregon Center for Public Policy\u2019s data, but they show that the Oregon center\u2019s numbers are within range of what similar studies have found.\nThe Oregon Center for Public Policy wrote that \"7 out of 10 Oregon families living in poverty have at least one parent who works.\"\nWe checked Gettel\u2019s analysis and confirmed his results. We also confirmed the analysis and numbers with the U.S. Census Bureau.\nWhile the numbers are accurate, under the survey design, somebody classified by federal employment officials as \"long-term unemployed\" could be counted as working under the Census definition. We think that\u2019s an important clarification.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08895"}
