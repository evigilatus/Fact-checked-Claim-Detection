He\u2019s made the accusation several times so far during the 2016 presidential election.\nBut he also said it when his reality TV show The Apprentice didn\u2019t win an Emmy in 2012, 2013 or 2014.\n\"There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged,\" Clinton said Oct. 19 at the third and final presidential debate.\nWe decided to examine Trump\u2019s Twitter feed to see what he had to say.\nIn the case of the Emmys, Trump clearly does a lot of whining about not winning.\nApril 29, 2013: \"I should have many Emmys for The Apprentice if the process were fair-in any event, it's not my day job.\"\nSept. 24, 2012: \" 'Amazing Race' winning an Emmy again is a total joke. The Emmys have no credibility -- no wonder the ratings are at record lows.\"\nSept. 22, 2013: \"The Emmys are soooooo boring! Terrible show. I'm going to watch football! I already know the winners.

But Trump never directly says the Emmys process is rigged in the way he has characterized\u00a0the U.S. election system.\nIn most cases, Trump is complaining that politics plays a role in deciding who wins, which is not a particularly surprising assertion when it comes to the selections made by award shows, or by voters trying to decide whom to pick for United States president for that matter.\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"There was even a time when (Donald Trump) didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged.\"\nTrump never directly makes that accusation.
