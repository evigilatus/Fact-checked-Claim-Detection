Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for an interview that aired on HBO Monday to gather his thoughts and reactions immediately following the final presidential debate on Oct. 22.\nThe pair touched on a range of issues but paid special attention to the national debt and the Republican Party\u2019s wavering interest in reducing it under President Donald Trump, whose administration has overseen trillions added to the national debt.\nSwan kicked off the conversation by paraphrasing a quote from former White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. During a trip to Britain earlier this year, Mulvaney remarked on Republicans\u2019 shifting attitude on reducing the debt.\n\"My party is very interested in deficits when there is a Democrat in the White House. The worst thing in the whole world is deficits when Barack Obama was the president. Then Donald Trump became president, and we\u2019re a lot less interested as a party,\" Mulvaney said, according to the Washington Post.\nWhen Swan asked Cruz to respond to Mulvaney\u2019s portrayal, Cruz emphasized his own personal concerns about the rising debt.\n\"I\u2019m very worried about the debt. I\u2019m worried about it under Trump,\" Cruz said. \"Now to be fair, Trump didn\u2019t campaign on cutting the debt.\"\nThat\u2019s when Swan pointed to comments Trump made during his 2016 campaign signaling his intent to \"get rid of the $19 trillion in debt \u2026 over a period of eight years\" \u2014 a feat that critics called wildly impossible.\nBut Cruz doubled down on his statement.\n\"Do I wish that it was a higher priority for the president to rein in spending and the debt? Yes. (But) he didn\u2019t run principally on reining in spending and the debt. That\u2019s not what he promised to do,\" Cruz said.\nThe national debt \u2014 now pegged at around $27 trillion \u2014 is an issue that comes up in every presidential campaign. Let\u2019s review Trump\u2019s statements addressing the debt and deficits during his 2016 bid.\n\u2018King of debt\u2019\nTrump has weighed in on the rising national debt before, during and after his 2016 campaign, and on occasion he\u2019s proposed ways to reduce it. In an interview with \"Good Morning America\" in 2010, for instance, he floated the idea of imposing harsher taxes on China to finance debt payments.\nWhen Trump launched his first campaign for president in 2015, he committed to addressing the national debt: \"Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we\u2019re in a bubble.\"\nHis campaign website in 2015 and 2016 listed reforming the U.S.-China trade relationship as a way to reduce the debt and deficit \"so China cannot use financial blackmail against us.\" And his tax plan ensured that it would \"not add to our enormous debt and deficit,\" according to archives of his campaign website collected by the Wayback Machine. (Trump\u2019s major tax code overhaul, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, was projected to increase the national debt by about $1.5 trillion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.)\nDuring his 2016 campaign, Trump described himself on numerous occasions as the \"king of debt\" in an effort to portray himself as someone more than capable of drawing down debt.\n\"I\u2019m great with debt. Nobody knows debt more than me. I\u2019ve made a fortune by using debt, and if things don\u2019t work out I renegotiate the debt. That\u2019s a smart thing, not a stupid thing,\" Trump said on \"CBS This Morning\" in June 2016.\n\"I like debt for my company, but I don\u2019t like debt for the country. \u2026 We\u2019ll have to start chopping that debt down,\" he said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis proposal to erase the national debt was revealed in an interview with the Washington Post\u2019s Bob Woodward during the 2016 presidential primaries.\nTrump: \"We\u2019ve got to get rid of the $19 trillion in debt.\"\nWoodward: \"How long would that take?\"\nTrump: \"I think I could do it fairly quickly, because of the fact the numbers \u2014\"\nWoodward: \"What\u2019s fairly quickly?\"\nTrump: \"Well, I would say over a period of eight years.\"\nCritics noted that reducing the debt in eight years couldn\u2019t be done even if all basic government functions were eliminated and all national assets were sold off. And Trump walked back that commitment in an interview with Fortune a month later, pledging to reduce a portion of the debt rather than all of it. (A PolitiFact analysis of that commitment ruled it a Promise Broken.)\nTrump\u2019s comments on the debt continued during the 2016 general election campaign. During a rally in September, he said \"we have a country that is essentially a debtor nation right now. So we\u2019re going to make our country wealthy again.\"\nAnd during the presidential debates he highlighted proposals for slashing both the deficit \u2014 when the government spends more in a year than it takes in \u2014 and the national debt, or the total amount the government owes.\nFirst on Sept. 26: \"We have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, almost $800 billion a year. That means, who\u2019s negotiating these trade deals? We have people that are political hacks that are negotiating our trade deals.\"\nAnd again on Oct. 9: \"I will bring our energy companies back, they\u2019ll be able to compete, they\u2019ll make money, they\u2019ll pay off our national debt. They\u2019ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.\"\nHis promise to reduce the debt through other measures have continued into his presidency. In June 2017, Trump partly justified the country\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord by tying it to the national debt.\n\"America is $20 trillion in debt. Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure. Millions of our citizens are out of work. And yet, under the Paris accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. So think of that,\" he said during a Rose Garden press conference.\nAnd in an address to the nation the next month, before a Senate vote on the Affordable Care Act, Trump excoriated the Obama-era program and championed his own repeal and replace plan.\n\"The Obamacare repeal and replace plan would significantly reduce the federal deficit. So it would be good for the federal government, it\u2019ll cost you less money by a lot, and it will be a much better plan. You can\u2019t do better than that,\" Trump said.\nOur ruling\nCruz said that Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign didn\u2019t promise to reduce the national debt and that he \"didn\u2019t run principally on reigning in spending and the debt.\"\nThe issue of U.S. national debt may not receive as much airtime or grab as many headlines as Trump\u2019s other campaign promises, like forcing Mexico to pay for a southern border wall, but Trump repeatedly raised concerns over the rising debt and pledged to reduce it during his first presidential campaign. And he has repeated those concerns as president, even as it has ballooned.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18831"}
