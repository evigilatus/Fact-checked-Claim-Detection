Glenn Scarpelli and Patricia Colant jumped from the ninth floor of the building where they worked, leaving behind a 19-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter.\nThe husband and wife also did leave a note, which read, \"We had a wonderful life.\" But the couple was deeply in debt. The New York Post reported a lien showed they had owed more than $23,000 in federal taxes, and as of April 2015 they had more than $232,000 in debt. Scarpelli had faced legal action in 2013 for not paying back a $60,000 student loan.\nThe \"financial spiral\" in which they were trapped was too much for the couple, who elected to jump to their deaths, the Post reported. There was no mention of medical costs, or health insurance premiums, or anything else related to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo where did all these posts mentioning health care costs come from?\nInitial versions of the New York Post\u2019s story apparently cited a law enforcement source that said there was a second note at the scene. That note reportedly read, \"We both have medical issues, we just can't afford the health care.\"\nLater versions of the story corrected that assertion, saying a New York Police Department spokesman refuted that detail, and that there was no mention of health care costs in the couple\u2019s sole suicide note.\nSeveral posts on different websites cited a version of the story from the U.K.\u2019s Daily Mail, which appears to have included the same details and also was updated. Neither story indicates what was changed in the text during the subsequent updates.\nUsing an uncorrected and incomplete version of the story led those posts to highlight the erroneous assertion that medical expenses, whether through high insurance premiums or procedural costs, drove the couple to suicide.\nOur ruling\nBloggers said a New York physician and his wife jumped to their deaths because they \"can\u2019t afford\" Obamacare.\nMultiple blog posts said that the couple committed suicide because of unaffordable medical costs. That was based on initial reports about the note the pair left behind, and turned out not to be the case. News outlets later took out references to health care expenses when they updated their stories, but the flawed information remained in other posts.\nWe rate the statement False.\n Share the Facts 2017-08-03 19:28:28 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says a New York physician and his wife jumped to their deaths because they \"can\u2019t afford\" Obamacare.
