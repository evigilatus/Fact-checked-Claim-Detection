Trump said, \"No one respects women more than I -- no one.\" \"And frankly, those stories have been largely dismantled.\" Really? We decided to consider Trump's claim. What we found was that while some accounts were challenged, none of them proved to be invalid by any objective measure. We will discuss the situation surrounding each accused. Jessica Leeds told the New York Times that Trump harassed her in the 1980s on a flight to New York. According to The New York Times, Leeds told the story to at least four people close to her, who also spoke to The New York Times. The Trump campaign gave a reverse novel from a man who said he was on that flight. Anthony Gilbert Hourb told the New York Post that Leeds was the one who was flirting and that he didn't see anything inappropriate. Gilbert Hourp has a volatile past that includes revealing that he bought boys for high-ranking British politicians, but more importantly, he told Post he didn't have any evidence to back up his story. The spokesman for Trump Katrina Pearson challenged the story of Leeds on the grounds that the Pearson plane said that Leeds flew in without the armrest as Lloyd described. No one knows what kind of aircraft Leeds was in. Most of the time, it's a word against a word. Mindy McGillefray McGilivray told Palm Beach Post that in 2003, Trump grabbed her behind her at a Mar Lago concert. McGillefray was helping cameraman Ken Davidoff. Davidov told the post reporter that he \"remembers very well when Majilifray pulled him aside moments after the alleged incident and said to him: \"Donald just grabbed my ass!\" The corresponding information comes from the website \"Getweibondite,\" which claims that there was no concert on the day Davidov said. But the site confirms it without evidence. Even if the photographer made a mistake in history, and there is no evidence of that, it does not refute the allegation. On January 27, 2021, Marco Rubio wrote in his remarks \"Only in the Third World, do you see this routine use of the trials of former leaders?\" Miriam Valverdi wrote on January 29, 2021, Natasha Stwinov Stwinoff in People magazine that during a period of pause in an interview with Trump and his wife Melania and Trump, she was alone in a room where he accepted her by force. She told a coworker, friends and family shortly after the event but did not include it in her article. The corresponding information comes from former Chief Trump, Anthony Sinnikal, who told the Palm Beach Post that \"this never happened.\" Milania Trump also later disputes with Stoinov on the street, as Stoinov said. Once again, we have confirmation of Stoinov's friends, and at most, it's her word against Sinnikal. Summer Zervos Zervos was a former contestant in the Trump Real Program. She went to the Trump golf course in Palos Verdes, Califf. At a press conference, a social worker said that Xerfus told her about the meeting in 2010, years before Trump announced his presidential tender. Trump posted on Facebook that he did not meet Zervos at a hotel and that she remained in contact with him. Trump wrote that recently in April this year, she invited him to her restaurant in California. Also, Zerfus' cousin said she had only good things to say about Trump. The Trump novel raises questions about Zervos' communication with him, but it does not refute her claim. Five other women say that Trump touched them or accepted them without their consent. They are Cassandra Serles, Rachel Crooks, Christine Anderson, Gil Harth and the Temple of Taggart McDowell. We found no evidence to undermine their claims other than Trump &apos; s own denial. We asked the Trump campaign to send us details that would refute women's stories and did not want us. Our verdict, Trump, said that his stories of touching him or forcing himself into women were largely revealed. His campaign didn't give any proof of that. We found that five of these nine stories were not the subject of independent controversy. Of the four remaining stories, women told friends, families or colleagues at the time, providing some support. On the other hand, there is a novel by the former Trump server and a man who admits that he has no evidence of his version of events. While some women &apos; s stories have been questioned, one has not been definitively dismantled, and most stories have not challenged any other facts other than Trump &apos; s denial. We value this allegation wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fa622a1b-1c53-4b62-b3ec-629c8a468bc5", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04089"}
