The city shelled out $10 million for construction of a two-story office building and practice fields.\nBon Secours agreed to pay the city $3.2 million for the naming rights to the facility, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s officially called The Bon Secours Washington Redskins Training Center. The hospital system also is leasing the first floor of the new building for use as a men\u2019s health center when the Redskins are not in their three-week training camp, a deal that could generate another $3.1 million for Richmond over six years.\nSo Bon Secours will invest as much as $6.3 million in the training facility over the next six years. The city is hoping to generate more money by finding tenants for the vacant second floor of the building. \u00a0\nIn exchange for being the major sponsor of the Redskins camp, Bon Secours was given a 60-year lease to the city-owned Westhampton School site on Patterson Avenue to house its School of Nursing and School of Imaging.\nThe final part of the deal calls for Bon Secours to expand Richmond Community Hospital in the city\u2019s East End, which needs medical facilities.\nJones\u2019 claim that the plan has generated $40 million in private investment \"is based on taxable improvements\" from the development of the three properties, according to Tammy Hawley, the mayor\u2019s press secretary.\nThe figure comes from adding the projected construction prices for the improvements on each site:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$10 million for the training camp;\n\n\n$24 million for development of the Westhampton School; and\n\n\n$8.5 million for the expansion of Richmond Community Hospital.\n\nThat comes to a total of $42.5 million.\nJones spoke in the past tense, as if the investments already have been made. But in fact, very little private money has been spent so far. Construction at the Westhampton School and Richmond Community Hospital has not begun. Both projects are in planning stages with no firm dates set for start or completion, according to Charlotte Perkins, performance management officer for Bon Secours.\nIn addition, the contracts for these two projects can be voided. Bon Secours can pull out of the Richmond Community Hospital expansion if it is unable to acquire needed properties. It would have to pay a $2.5 million penalty to the city over 10 years. Bon Secours can withdraw from the Westhampton School project if it is unable to meet zoning requirements.\nAs for the Redskins camp, the $10 million construction cost was paid by the city, not private investors. Jones, in his speech, said Richmond has largely recouped that money through selling naming rights and leasing office space in the building to Bon Secours.\nBut by the end of March, the city is due to have received only about $1.82 million. According to contracts, Bon Secours will have paid seven months rent totaling $160,400 and made the first two of four annual installments of $831,250 for the naming rights.\nWe\u2019ll mention again that Bon Secours could be obligated to make as much as $6.3 million in total rent and naming rights payments to the city through the summer of 2019. Richmond is hoping to add to its take by leasing the vacant second floor of the building at the training site. The Redskins do not pay rent for use of the building and fields during their summer training.\nIf the Westhampton School project pans out, the city will receive $5,000 in annual lease payments from Bon Secours over 60 years. That comes to a total of $300,000. In addition, the hospital system has agreed to pay the city $1 million over 10 years to help public schools.\nOur ruling\nJones said the three-part development deal that brought the Redskins training camp to Richmond \"generated $40 million in new private investment in the city.\"\nThe mayor offered a solid estimate of the total construction costs. But he spoke in past tense, as if the money already has been spent. For the most part, it hasn\u2019t.\nNo start dates have been established for two of the projects totaling $32.5 million: Bon Secours\u2019 expansion of Richmond Community Hospital and its redevelopment of Westhampton School. Important contractual conditions first must be fulfilled.\nThe Redskins training facility, which opened last summer, was built with $10 million of city money. Richmond, at the end of March, will have recovered $1.82 million of that money through the sale of naming rights and the leasing of office space at the facility to Bon Secours. That number could grow to as much as $6.3 million over the next five years.\nNo doubt, the three projects have the potential to generate $40 million in private investment. But the mayor is counting the checks before they\u2019ve been written. We rate his statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08177"}
