Steve Stockman had some alternative suggestions for the president.\n\nOn Feb. 22, he tweeted about one program he has suggested trimming: \"Obama claims a small cut to federal means losing local police and firefighters, but he's spending $2.2 billion to give away \u2018ObamaPhones.\u2019 \"\n\nAs far back as 2009, PolitiFact has checked claims about President Barack Obama handing out free cell phones. We decided to see how this statement compared.\n\nThe government initiative that helps low-income citizens pay for telephone service is the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s Lifeline program. FCC spokesman Mark Wigfield told us by email that Lifeline began in 1985 because of concerns that local rates would rise after a government lawsuit broke up AT&T\u2019s monopoly of the U.S. phone market.\n\nLifeline was enshrined in law in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, Wigfield said, then in 2005 and 2008 began to allow \"resellers\" of cell service -- companies that did not own their own networks -- to participate. Today, he said, \"about 75 percent of Lifeline support goes for wireless service.\"\n\nThe program does not provide phones or phone service and is not paid for by taxes, Wigfield said. Rather, it pays $9.25 a month to a user\u2019s phone company. Some companies give out free phones and price their plans at $9.25 a month, making the plans essentially \"free,\" he said.\n\nMoney for Lifeline comes out of the Universal Service Fund; phone companies pay into the fund and then pass the cost on to customers via a fee on their phone bills. (Click here to read more detailed explanations in this story\u2019s excerpted emails.)\n\nEligible Lifeline participants must have an income that is at or below 135 percent of the federal poverty level or use Medicaid, food stamps, federal public housing assistance or supplemental security income, among other things. In some cases, states administer their own programs.\n\nIn early 2012, the FCC implemented changes to Lifeline aimed at modernizing the program and eliminating fraud and waste. One goal: ensuring availability of broadband for all low-income Americans.\n\nThe term \"Obama phones\" has been attached to Lifeline since at least late 2009, when PolitiFact rated as Mostly False a chain email claim that Obama was giving away free phones. More famously, a viral video during the 2012 presidential campaign showed an Obama supporter saying \"Everybody in Cleveland -- low (income), minority -- got Obama phones.\" Soon after, PolitiFact gave a Florida state official a Pants on Fire rating for saying the Obama campaign was giving out phones.\n\nBoth of those PolitiFact ratings cited the fact that the program existed years before Obama took office, so implying he created the program was incorrect. Stockman\u2019s tweet similarly linked the program to Obama but added a financial factor: \"He's spending $2.2 billion to give away \u2018ObamaPhones.\u2019 \"\n\nStockman spokesman Donny Ferguson emailed us a Feb. 12, 2013, Wall Street Journal news story that said, \"The U.S. government spent about $2.2 billion last year to provide phones to low-income Americans ... Payouts under the program have shot up from $819 million in 2008, as more wireless carriers have persuaded regulators to let them offer the service.\"\n\nWigfield sent us the FCC\u2019s total spending figures for Lifeline in recent years:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 30, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump assassination foiled, Deep State in panic mode!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 4, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2007: $823 million\n\n2008: $821 million\n\n2009: $1 billion\n\n2010: $1.13 billion\n\n2011: $1.78 billion\n\n2012: $2.1 billion\n\n\n\nThe post-2008 boom, he said, came after the FCC decided to open Lifeline to phone companies offering low-cost cell plans on networks they did not own. Tracfone was the first such provider to become an eligible carrier for Lifeline, he said. The Journal article said Tracfone has since become the country\u2019s fifth-largest wireless carrier and that other companies have expanded as \"Lifeline users have been a source of subscriber growth in the otherwise saturated U.S. market.\"\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nStockman said Obama\u2019s \"spending $2.2 billion to give away \u2018ObamaPhones.\u2019 \" That figure\u2019s about right for 2012 federal spending on the Lifeline program, but as PolitiFact has noted before, attributing it to Obama is incorrect.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, too, that the money comes from phone fees, so it wouldn\u2019t be possible to prevent public safety cuts by halting the phone program. The tradeoff Stockman asserts isn\u2019t valid.\n\nWe rate his statement as Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09588"}
