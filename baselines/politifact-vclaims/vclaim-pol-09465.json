Right now, federal background checks are only required for sales through licensed gun dealers.\n\nHere\u2019s how background checks work.\n\nThe FBI maintains the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\n\nWhen you buy a gun from a federally licensed dealer, you fill out a form with personally identifying information. The dealer uses the NICS to match that information with various records to make sure you\u2019re not, for example, a felon who\u2019s not allowed to own a weapon. It\u2019s a computerized process that\u2019s only supposed to take about 30 seconds, but in the case of an unclear match, can take up to three days.\n\nIf you\u2019re cleared to purchase a gun, the government is required to destroy all identifying information about you before the next business day. Instead, the dealer is required to store the form.\n\nThat\u2019s right: Federal law requires destruction of records and bans creation of a federal gun registry.\n\nDoes S. 649, sponsored by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., change that?\n\nSeveral attorneys we spoke to said no, it didn\u2019t \u2014 it leaves those provisions in place. More people would be subject to background checks, but a federal database of that information would remain as illegal as ever.\n\nBut Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, says the language of the bill leaves a door open for a new kind of record of sales between private sellers \u2014 as opposed to sales by federally licensed gun dealers \u2014 a record that may not be subject to the registry ban.\n\n\"We have a real fear with this particular legislative language that this would result in new records being created,\" he said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe points to a legal phrase in the bill \u2014 \"notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter\" \u2014 as perhaps allowing creation and, later, collection of those records, even though existing law rules out \"a system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions.\"\n\nSo, even if there\u2019s no intent to create such a loophole in the registry ban, the law doesn\u2019t explicitly rule it out, he argues.\n\nCall it the possibility of a partial registry.\n\n\"I don't think it's a crazy idea to say that if the records exist, there would be a push to use them for other things,\" \u00a0Calabrese said.\n\nHe contrasts the bill\u2019s vague language with an amendment proposed by Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that would explicitly bar any such registry and adds the possibility of up to 15 years in prison for violators.\n\nBut even if the federal government created a new type of record for gun sales between private sellers \u2014 and tracked them \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t be \"universal registration of all firearms and their owners,\" as suggested by the Arizona group\u2019s email message.\n\n\"There are at least 300 million guns in private ownership in America today, and I am not aware of any provision of S. 649 that would require the registration of those guns or assist the federal government in determining precisely who owns them,\" said Clark Neily, who was co-counsel to Dick Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller.\n\n(Still, he said, mentioning the ACLU\u2019s worry, the Arizona email \"touches upon a genuine concern.\")\n\nSo what does the Arizona Citizens Defense League say about its claim that the bill \"is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners\"?\n\nEssentially, that the government will violate its own rules against keeping background check records.\n\n\"This is where background knowledge of the issue is so important, and goes WAY beyond what is written in statute,\" said Charles Heller, a radio host and spokesperson for the Arizona Citizens Defense League. (He\u2019s no relation to Dick Heller.)\n\nHe says the FBI\u2019s NICS system could illegally store results of all background checks.\n\n\"This is simply a method to herd all transfers to being \u2018on record,\u2019 for later confiscation,\" he said.\n\nBut the email message didn\u2019t say the law would make it easier for the federal government to create an illegal gun registry. It said:\n\n\"The true subject of S. 649 is the requirement to report all firearms transfers to the federal government via \u2018universal background checks.\u2019 In reality S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners. As history has repeatedly shown us, and is currently being demonstrated in New York, registration is the prelude to confiscation.\"\n\nThat\u2019s simply not what the bill proposes.\n\nRobert Levy, the chairman of the board of directors of the libertarian Cato Institute, was in his own words, \"a vigorous advocate for the right to possess firearms for self-defense\" as co-counsel to Dick Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller.\n\nHe acknowledges the concern that expanding background checks creates a data trail that Americans must trust is being destroyed in a timely way by the federal government.\n\nStill, he says, \"it's incorrect to assert that S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAn email circulated to Arizona residents claims a bill before the Senate \"is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners.\" The bill expands background checks to most gun transfers. But federal rules forbid the government from keeping a record of successful background checks for more than a day. The ACLU argues it\u2019s possible the bill creates a new type of record for some sales that may not be subject to the ban, but that\u2019s not the same thing as \"universal registration of all firearms and their owners.\" We rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09465"}
