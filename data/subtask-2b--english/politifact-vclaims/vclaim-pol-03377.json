So, can he be America's most popular politician?", "text": "Discussing the 2016 presidential race on April 19, 2017, a liberal talk radio show host in Milwaukee argued that Bernie Sanders would have \"won a landslide victory\" over Donald Trump.\nThen Mike Crute, who co-hosts \"The Devil\u2019s Advocates,\" exclaimed that Sanders \"is the most popular politician in America today.\"\nCrute, whose show used to be based in Madison,\u00a0didn\u2019t say how he knew. So, we thought we\u2019d check out his claim.\nTwo recent polls\nSanders finished as runner-up to Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination. So the Vermont senator, an Independent, never faced Trump, the Republican nominee. Trump, of course, defeated Clinton, the former secretary of state, in the general election.\nThe latest national survey on this question was the Harvard-Harris Poll, which is done by Harvard University\u2019s Center for American Political Studies and Harris Insights and Analytics.\nConducted online April 14 to 17, 2017 with registered voters, the poll listed the names of 16 political figures, without the titles of their governmental positions. Respondents were asked whether they had a favorable or unfavorable view of each, or had never heard of them. The 16 included prominent figures, such Sanders, Trump and Clinton, and the Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress, but also lesser-known Trump appointees.\nPollster.com co-founder Charles Franklin, director of polling at the Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, said it is common in non-election years for the president, vice president, congressional leaders and perhaps a prominent senator or two to be included in such polls. But including presidential staff members \"is dubious, as they are not known to a lot of voters,\" he told us.\nSanders had the best showing in the Harvard-Harris survey, with 57 percent saying they had a favorable opinion of him. In fact, he was the only one of the 16 to get a majority favorable rating.\nHere are the ratings for the nine political figures who are not Trump appointees:\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nFavorability rating\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt.\n\n\n57%\n\n\n\n\nVice President Mike Pence\n\n\n44%\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump\n\n\n44%\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\n\n\n42%\n\n\n\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\n\n\n38%\n\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\n\n34%\n\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\n\n31%\n\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\n\n27%\n\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n\n23%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSanders also had the best showing among eight elected officials in a Fox News Poll of registered voters conducted by telephone about a month earlier, from March 12 to 14, 2017.\nSanders got a favorable rating from 61 percent of respondents. Pence was second among the politicians, at 47 percent, and Trump was third, at 44 percent. The others: Warren, 39 percent; Ryan, 37 percent; Pelosi, 33 percent; Schumer, 26 percent; and McConnell, 20 percent.\nFranklin also provided us HuffPost Pollster data on polls done since Jan. 1, 2017. \u00a0Former President Barack Obama is included in those polls. Obama\u2019s average favorability rating was highest, at 61 percent, with Sanders coming in second at 56 percent. But like Clinton, Obama is no longer an elected official.\nNone of the other politicians in polls tracked by HuffPost Pollster had a favorability rating higher than 46 percent.\nOur rating\nCrute said Sanders \"is the most popular politician in America today.\"\nThe polls don\u2019t specifically ask respondents for their favorite politician -- they provide a limited list of political figures and ask respondents whether they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of each one.\nBut based on that measure of popularity, Sanders finished comfortably on top among some major political figures in the latest national poll. And in an averaging of polls on favorability done in 2017, his rating was exceeded only by Obama, who perhaps could still be called a politician, though not an active one. \u00a0\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.
