More recently, Feingold has hit the theme harder.\n\n\"His idea for growing our economy is to give millionaires like himself more tax cuts,\" Feingold told supporters at an Oct. 18, 2010 rally the University of \u00a0Wisconsin-Oshkosh.\n\n\"He likes to say there are too many lawyers in the Senate \u2013 57. He\u2019d be the 70th millionaire. I think they\u2019re a little over-represented.\" \u00a0\u00a0\n\nIs Feingold right on the fat-cat factor?\n\nIt\u2019s not an easy question to answer, because senators are not required to disclose their true net worth. Under the required financial disclosure reports, they are allowed to list broad dollar-value ranges for assets and debts.\n\nAs support for the claim, Feingold\u2019s campaign cites a widely quoted 2009 study by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. The group\u2019s work takes the 2008 asset and liability figures that senators reported and finds a mid-point to approximate net worth.\n\nThe center\u2019s study found that 67 of 100 senators carry a net worth of greater than $1 million. Wisconsin\u2019s Herb Kohl, a Democrat, was the richest on the list at $214 million.\n\nPolitiFact Wisconsin updated the study to include three new senators -- Scott Brown of Massachusetts, \u00a0George LeMieux of Florida and Carte Goodwin of West Virginia -- who were appointed or elected after the group\u2019s study came out.\n\nTwo of the newbies, LeMieux and Brown, have a net worth above the $1 million mark, based on our calculations using the center\u2019s methodology.\n\nThat\u2019s the math the Feingold campaign used to get to Johnson as the 70th: 67 + 2 + Johnson = 70.\n\nOf course that slots Johnson into the current crop of senators. If Johnson wins Nov. 2, he will likely be part of a different mix -- some incumbents are retiring or lost in primaries, others may lose on election day.\n\nHow accurate are the numbers compared to senators\u2019 true net worth?\n\nIf you take Feingold as an example, the wealth estimates appear to be conservative.\n\nFeingold takes the extra step of voluntarily disclosing his exact net worth through tax returns and a complete statement of net worth. The Journal Sentinel asks Wisconsin members of Congress for that information.\n\nIn 2008 Feingold reported a net worth of $452,500 -- far above the $83,000 figure that ranked him one of \"10 poorest\" senators in the Center for Responsive Politics study.\n\nAs for Johnson, based on the center\u2019s methodology and his 2010 disclosure form, Johnson\u2019s net worth would be $17.8 million. \u00a0\n\nThat would put him in the top 15 wealthiest members of the current Senate, though for the others the 2008 figures are being used.\n\nSo let\u2019s review our math.\n\nIn turning the tables on Johnson, Feingold says the problem isn\u2019t lawyers in the Senate, but millionaires. He pegs Johnson as the would-be 70th, though that would be in the current Senate -- not whatever mix is there after the election. By our calculations, and those of the Center for Responsive Politics, Feingold is accurate. If anything, the methodology underestimates a person\u2019s net worth -- and therefore may under-count the actual millionaires in the body.\n\nWe rate his statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14173"}
