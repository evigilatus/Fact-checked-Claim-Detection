Jay Inslee, who\u2019s made climate change the centerpiece of his 2020 Democratic presidential run, said he would use the U.S. military\u2019s vast purchasing power to promote clean energy.\nAsked in an interview what the Inslee administration would do about global warming in the first 100 days, Inslee said he would make the Pentagon\u2019s budget more eco-friendly, and argued that elements of that concept have already been shown to work.\n\"We have flown a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. We have flown F-18s,\" Inslee told Vox. \"So we can use the procurement power of the United States military to drive some of this clean energy.\"\nInslee was right about biofuels having powered a supersonic jet. We also found that aircraft similar to the 737 completed transatlantic flights on blended fuel, though we didn\u2019t find instances where 737s had done so.\nF-18 \u2018Green Hornet\u2019\nInslee is correct that the U.S. military has flown an F-18 on biofuel.\nNavy aviators made history in 2010 by flying an F-18 Super Hornet on a 50-50 blend of conventional jet fuel and biofuel\u2014the first time this was attempted in a supersonic jet, according to the Washington Examiner. The 45-minute test flight took place on Earth Day at a Maryland naval base, the Navy\u2019s media wing reported.\nThe biofuel was derived from a plant called camelina, which is native to North America. Prior to the test flight, the Navy said, the Pentagon awarded a $2.7 million contract to a Montana-based renewable fuel company for 40,000 gallons of camelina-based fuel.\nThe environmentally-friendly moves were part of then-Navy Secretary\u00a0Ray Mabus\u2019s initiative\u2014 known as the Great Green Fleet\u2014a $510 million, three-year program to explore cleaner energy options.\nUnder the program, the Navy certified warships and aircraft to operate on biofuels.\nBut according to Todd Harrison, the director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, naval systems do not routinely use biofuels due to their high cost. Harrison seemed skeptical that the military would embrace a dramatic shift to the alternative energy source.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is possible that if the Navy started making regular, large-scale purchases of biofuels for its systems that it could help jump start this industry and bring down the price for other consumers,\" Harrison added. \"But that would be a significant investment on the part of the Navy for something that only tangentially benefits the military.\"\nMabus, for his part, told us he sees climate change and national security as inextricably linked. He argued that as one of the biggest energy consumers on the planet, the Defense Department\u2019s role in combating climate change should not be overlooked.\nBottom line: Inslee is right that F-18s have flown on biofuels. But what to make of his claim about 737s?\n\u2018Green\u2019 737s?\nInslee didn\u2019t specify who he claims flew a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic\u2014and a Navy spokesman said that service branch had never flown this series aircraft on biofuels.\nWe reached out to Inslee\u2019s campaign, and they pointed us to a Boeing press release that described the company\u2019s development of a fuel that blended petroleum fuel and \"bio-derived oils and waste animal fats.\"\nThe press release also mentions Boeing\u2019s work with Virgin Atlantic on a 2008 bio-fueled test flight. But it doesn\u2019t say anything about flying a 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. (We reached out to Boeing directly but didn\u2019t hear back.)\nThat said, we did find numerous examples of transatlantic flights powered by biofuels.\nBoeing posted a clip on YouTube in 2011 of a 747-8 Freighter completing what the plane maker described as \"the first-ever transatlantic biofuel flight with a commercial jetliner.\"\nA Lufthansa 747 made the first biofuel-powered transatlantic commercial flight to the United States in 2012, and two years later Finnair used a cooking oil-based biofuel to fly an Airbus A330 from Helsinki to New York. In 2018, United Airlines celebrated the \"longest transatlantic biofuel flight to date\" when a 787 Dreamliner flew from San Francisco to Zurich.\nOur ruling\nInslee said, \"We have flown a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. We have flown F-18s.\"\nThe Navy made history in 2010 when it flew an F-18 supersonic jet on biofuels. We found numerous transatlantic flights that have been powered by biofuels, too. We weren\u2019t able to find instances where Boeing 737s had done so, but those are similar to other aircraft we documented. \u00a0\nWe rate this Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00871"}
