That law, which Nelson voted for, was adopted in February 2009 by three-vote margins in both the Assembly and the Senate. It was a budget-adjustment measure that also directed an initial $300 million in federal stimulus funds to the state Department of Transportation. The money was for 47 projects, mostly on highways and freeways.\n\nSo, for Nelson\u2019s \"tens of thousands\" of jobs statement to be correct, that $300 million would have to have created at least 20,000 jobs.\n\nDid it?\n\nFrom the beginning, stimulus job-count figures have been beset with problems, in Wisconsin and around the country.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, for example, found that an October 2009 report by the White House -- claiming stimulus money created or saved more than 10,000 jobs in Wisconsin -- was rife with errors, double counting and inflated numbers. In January 2010, the White House abandoned its method of counting jobs \"created or saved.\" Instead, it began labeling jobs as having been funded by stimulus dollars.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say the stimulus has not had any effect. A July 2010 paper by two economists -- one from the public sector and one rom the private -- said stimulus spending created 2.7 million jobs.\n\nBut Nelson\u2019s claim was not about all stimulus money, just that initial gush of cash given to the DOT.\n\nNelson said he based his jobs statement on \"talking points,\" which he later said were based on two sources:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state website that tracks federal stimulus spending, which says 63,000 jobs have been created or saved.\n\n\n\nA November 2009 news release from state Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison), which cites two statements about new jobs. One statement, from a contractors group and three unions, referred to a study that said the 2009 state budget would create more than 25,000 jobs. \u00a0The other statement, from a transportation builders group, predicted the state budget and \"remaining federal stimulus dollars will support\" more than 28,500 jobs.\n\n\nBut Nelson is mixing apples and oranges.\n\nThe first talking point refers to jobs created or saved, when Nelson\u2019s comment referred only to jobs created. What\u2019s more, the 63,000 figure is based on all stimulus money given to the state as of August 2010, not the initial $300 million Nelson originally cited.\n\nThe second talking point moves everything to a different source. It claims the state budget -- not stimulus money -- would create the jobs cited. Or the budget and remaining stimulus money. Again, Nelson is off point.\n\nThere are hard numbers -- rather than predictions -- that Nelson could have used to gauge the effect of the $300 million given to DOT.\n\nPolitiFact Wisconsin analyzed figures from Recovery.gov, the federal website that tracks stimulus funds. The latest data available show that, through the first half of 2010, the $300 million cited by Nelson funded 1,203 jobs.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to know how many were created and how many were saved. But that\u2019s miles away from Nelson\u2019s original claim.\n\nOK, almost time for the second half kickoff.\n\nWhere does all of this leave us?\n\nNelson stated that an initial $300 million in stimulus money for road projects created tens of thousands of jobs in Wisconsin. As evidence, he turns to much broader measures -- jobs created or saved, all stimulus spending, the state budget and stimulus money. But the actual jobs figure from the initial allotment barely exceeds 1,200 -- and even that is a mix of jobs created and jobs saved.\n\nWe rate Nelson\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14355"}
