We moved to the United States Energy Information Department, part of the United States Department of Energy, to obtain statistics on natural gas production in New York and Pennsylvania. The Department collects, analyses and disseminates \"autonomous and neutral energy information,\" according to its website. In New York, natural gas production totalled 35.8 billion cubic feet in 2010 and 11.4 billion cubic feet in 2017. This represents a decrease of 68 per cent. In Pennsylvania, production in 2010 totalled 572.9 billion cubic feet. By 2017, total production was 5.5 trillion cubic feet, according to management. This is an increase of 854 percent, when unrounded numbers are used. In addition to searching the Federal Energy Data Repository, we searched the natural gas production data in each state, and we found similar results. The Department of Conservation of the State of New York provided similar statistics for 2010 and 2017, and calculated that production had decreased by 66 per cent. In Pennsylvania, the dramatic increase in natural gas production can be attributed to \"non-traditional\" wells, or wells that are dug deep into rock formations through a process known as hydraulic fractures, or fractures. Natural gas drilling began in the Marcellus Shaley area of Pennsylvania in 2004, in accordance with the mandate. Marcellus Shaley, generally located under parts of Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, West Virginia, is currently the \"most abundant natural gas area in the United States,\" according to the United States Energy Information Department. In 2017, Pennsylvania recorded the production of 5.36 trillion cubic feet of natural gas from unconventional wells, which at that time was the largest recorded figure for natural gas production, according to the State Ministry of Environmental Protection. Natural gas production from these non-traditional wells grew by 1,360 per cent between 2010 and 2017, according to Elizabeth Reminter, Press Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection. Reminter also confirmed that the calculation of an increase of 854 per cent of total natural gas production between 2010 and 2017, derived from data collected at the federal level, was accurate. Different trends in natural gas production in each state can be associated with different responses to hydraulic fractures. While Pennsylvania experienced significant growth in this type of production, making it the second largest producer in the country, behind Texas, New York, citing the health risks associated with this practice, it banned natural gas extraction in 2014. While New York has \"one of the most energy-efficient economies in the country,\" it relies on other countries, including Pennsylvania and Canada, for most of their natural gas needs, according to the Energy Information Department of the United States. Trump also referred to a pipeline across the state of New York. It could have referred to a decision taken by regulators in New York in May to reject the establishment of a new natural gas pipeline, citing water quality concerns. The pipeline was to connect the natural gas fields in Pennsylvania with New Jersey and New York. The White House press officials did not respond to our request for information. Our President, Governor Trump, said between 2010 and 2017, natural gas production in New York fell by approximately 70 per cent, while production in Pennsylvania increased by approximately 1,000 per cent. In Pennsylvania, total natural gas production increased by 854 per cent between 2010 and 2017. In New York, total natural gas production decreased by between 66 and 68 per cent. The Trump statement was mostly accurate, but there is a sufficient difference between 854 percent and about 1,000 percent to justify a mostly valid judgement.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00202"}
