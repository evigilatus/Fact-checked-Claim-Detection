Kamala Harris claimed yesterday that during her time as the state\u2019s attorney general, she \"disagreed\" with President Obama\u2019s use of the Secure Communities program that partnered local and federal authorities to deport people who were in the country illegally.\u00a0\nHarris was elected California attorney general in 2010 and re-elected in 2014.\nShe made the claim about disagreeing with Obama during her breakout performance at the Democratic presidential debate in Miami, along with other impassioned assertions on civil rights and the economy that we fact-checked here.\u00a0\nHarris was responding to a moderator\u2019s question of whether a person living in the United States, \"without documents, and that is his only offense, should that person be deported?\"\n\"I will say \u2014 no, absolutely not, they should not be deported. And I actually \u2014\u00a0 this was one of the very few issues with which I disagreed with the administration, with whom I always had a great relationship and a great deal of respect.\n\"But on the secure communities issue, I was attorney general of California. I led the second-largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, in a state of 40 million people.\n\"I disagreed with my president, because the policy was to allow deportation of people who by ICE's own definition were non-criminals. So as attorney general, and the chief law officer of the state of California, I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did not have to comply with detainers, and instead should make decisions based on the best interests of public safety of their community.\"\nPresident Obama halted Secure Communities in 2014 following opposition from states and cities who said it eroded trust between local police and undocumented communities. President Trump restarted it shortly after taking office in 2017.\u00a0\nGiven the controversial history of the Obama-era policy, we wanted to know: Did Harris really disagree with it? And, if so, how much? And what did she do about it?\u00a0\nWe set out on a fact check.\u00a0\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates former vice president Joe Biden, left, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., right, stand on stage for the Democratic primary debate, Wednesday, June 27, 2019, in Miami (AP).\nOur research\nThere\u2019s some evidence Harris disagreed with Secure Communities. In 2014, then-AG Harris advised local police and sheriff\u2019s departments, in the form of a bulletin, that they did not have to comply with ICE detainer requests.\u00a0\n\"Federal immigration detainers are voluntary and this bulletin supports the TRUST Act and law enforcement leaders\u2019 discretion to utilize resources in a manner that best serves their communities,\" Harris said in a news release that announced the bulletin.\u00a0\nFormer Gov. Jerry Brown signed The Trust Act\u00a0 in 2013. It limited local police and sheriff\u2019s cooperation with federal immigration agents, and was a precursor of the state\u2019s sanctuary law, SB 54, signed by Brown in 2017, which further limited that cooperation.\u00a0\nHarris\u2019 news release said that two years earlier, in 2012, she issued another \"information bulletin\" to law enforcement agencies clarifying that federal immigration detainers \"are not mandatory, but are merely requests enforceable at the discretion of the state and local agency.\"\u00a0\nSeveral immigration experts said these memos show Harris resisted the Obama-era policy, at least to some degree. But, they said, that resistance did not take place early on.\n\"The bulletin on detainers was meaningful,\" UC Davis Law School Dean Kevin R. Johnson said in an email. \"It allowed local law enforcement agencies\" discretion \"to not detain low level offenders.\"\u00a0\n\"Attorney General Harris was not as aggressive in opposing President Obama\u2019s immigration policies as Attorney General Xavier Becerra has opposed President Trump\u2019s,\" Johnson added. \"She could be criticized for that but she was a Democrat wanting to work with a Democratic administration.\u00a0 It is clear that Senator Harris now is quite willing to criticize the immigration enforcement policies of this Republican administration.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris silent early on\u00a0\nThe Huffington Post published an in-depth report last week on Harris\u2019 lack of action early in California\u2019s debate over immigrant protections.\u00a0\nIt found Harris remained \"largely silent,\" from 2011 to 2013 as activists and lawmakers worked to pass the Trust Act, a landmark statewide sanctuary law over the objections of then-Gov. Jerry Brown and the Obama administration.\u00a0\n\"The Trust Act was a new way to limit ICE at the state level,\" Angela Chan, policy director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice, told the HuffingtonPost. \"We were at the forefront. She didn\u2019t get why it was important to support it at the time. \u2026 She only signaled support when it was safe to do so.\"\u00a0\nSameer Ashar, a UCLA law professor and former co-director of the UC Irvine Immigrant Rights Clinic, told us the record is mixed on Harris\u2019 position.\u00a0\n\"My general sense is there was a lot of grassroots movement pressure on elected officials in California to direct local law enforcement not to cooperate with the federal government on immigration enforcement,\" Ashar said. \"And she responded to that pressure. She took some positive steps, but it was under great pressure.\"\u00a0\nHe added: \"She never led in California on the fight at the time. If anything, she led from behind \u2026 She has evolved over time.\"\u00a0\nHarris\u2019 campaign cited a 2009 Los Angeles Times article\u00a0that paraphrased then-San Francisco District Attorney Harris as saying, \"It is not the duty of local law enforcement, she said, to enforce federal immigration laws.\"\u00a0\nThe campaign also cited a 2011 San Francisco Chronicle report. It quoted then-AG Harris\u2019 spokeswoman saying her office \"was broadly examining the issue of Secure Communities and taking a serious look at the program.\"\u00a0\nBy late 2012, Harris was more vocal in her opposition, describing the program in news articles as\u00a0\"flawed,\" and \"has not held up to what it aspired to be,\"\u00a0as her\u00a0campaign pointed out.\nOur ruling\nKamala Harris claimed she \"disagreed\" with the Obama administration on a deportation program where local police and sheriffs partnered with federal immigration agents to remove people who were in the country illegally.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs attorney general in 2012 and again in 2014, Harris issued bulletins telling local law enforcement they did not have to comply with the program\u2019s federal immigration detainer requests. She was also quoted in news articles in late 2012 strongly opposing the program.\nBut immigration experts say Harris was largely absent in California\u2019s early efforts to pass laws limiting local cooperation with federal agents. She resisted the program, they said, only after pressure built to pass those state laws and then \"led from behind,\" as one expert described it.\u00a0\nHarris\u2019 statement about disagreeing is partially accurate, but it leaves out some key history and takes things out of context.\nWe rate Harris\u2019 claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2019-06-29 02:16:51 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Says \"I disagreed\" with President Obama\u2019s Secure Communities deportation program    Kamala Harris U.S. Senator     Friday, June 28, 2019 2019-06-28    Read More  info    \nRELATED:\nKamala Harris calls her LIFT plan \u2018the most significant middle-class tax cut in generations.\u2019 Is it?\nKamala Harris gets it mostly right on America\u2019s rapid growth of student loan debt\nAre paychecks failing to keep up with inflation?\nDoes teacher pay fall short of the living wage in 30 states, as Kamala Harris said?", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00478"}
