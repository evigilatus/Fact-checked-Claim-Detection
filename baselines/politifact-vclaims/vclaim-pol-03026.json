At least not the Christian God. Not the God of the Bible.\n\"He dreams of a world government and a global communist system of repression,\" Putin added. \"As we have seen before in communist states, this system is not compatible with Christianity.\"\nFacebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to fight fake news.\nThere are no dates given for Putin\u2019s supposed comments, nor is there any indication to whom he was speaking. The post includes a YouTube video apparently generated by a computer that repeats the information.\nComments found in the USAConservativeReport.com post appeared on other outlets, none of which provided an original source for the comments.

Putin also spoke to about 5,000 sailors. But he did not discuss the pope.\nThe speech was available on YouTube, with a translation that jibed with Western reports:\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church have a strained relationship, with Russian believers accusing the Vatican of deliberately working to convert worshippers. The Catholic Church has denied doing so.\nPutin and Pope Francis have met on two occasions, when the Russian president visited Vatican City in 2013 and 2015. While the pair discussed Christian persecution on both visits, topics also included Russian involvement in Syria and Ukraine.\nPutin isn\u2019t Catholic, but there\u2019s no record we can find of him berating the pontiff in such a way.\nWe rate this claim Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-08-08 16:42:10 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says Russian President Vladimir Putin said Pope Francis \"is not a man of God.\"    Internet rumors bloggers   in Internet posts Saturday, August 5, 2017 2017-08-05    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03026"}
