But those without a college degree are hurting even more, according to President Barack Obama, who was in Austin last week to raise money for fellow Democrats.\n\n\"Now, I know some folks argue that as we emerge from the worst recession since the Great Depression, my administration should focus solely on economic issues,\" he said during a side speech at the University of Texas at Austin on Aug. 9. \"But as I said the other week to the National Urban League, education is an economic issue. It may be the economic issue of our time. It\u2019s an economic issue when the unemployment rate for folks who\u2019ve never gone to college is almost double what it is for those who have.\"\n\nAlmost double?\n\nMatt Lehrich, a White House spokesman, pointed us to employment data kept by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Looking at labor force statistics from the Current Population Survey, the unemployment rate for those with at least a bachelor's degree was 4.5 percent in July 2010, while 10.1 percent of high school graduates who didn't attend college were without jobs. Add those who never graduated from high school, and the unemployment rate creeps up to 11 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's more than double the unemployment rate for Americans with a bachelor's, master's, doctorate or professional degree. Include those who attend attended \"some college\" or earned an associates degree, and the jobless rate for the college crowd is 6 percent. So, as of July, the unemployment rate for those who never went to college is almost double what it is for those who have.\n\nHow did the two unemployment rates shake out historically? The data during the last two years show similar ratios.\n\nIn 2009, on average, about 10.9 percent of those who never attended college were unemployed, while 6.1 percent of those with at least some college were unemployed. In 2008, the unemployment rate was 6.4 percent for those without college, and about 3.1 for those who had.\n\nWe rate Obama's statement as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14583"}
