She wasn't...", "text": "Claire Macaskel repeatedly stated that she had not decided to vote \"no\" on the then Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh because of allegations of sexual abuse. However, she was aware of the allegations when she announced her decision, a fact she denied on 25 October 2018, a debate against the Republican competitor and prosecutor of Mizuri Josh Hawley. \"I made my decision in Cavanaugh before the allegations arose, and everything was about Cavanaugh's alliance, loyalty to dark money and unlimited political contributions,\" Macaskel said during the debate. This is the timetable: The Washington Post published her story summarizing Professor Christine Blassie Ford &apos; s allegations of sexual misconduct committed by Cavanaugh on 16 September 2018. As of that date, Makaskel has not yet announced how she will vote on the candidate. The following day, 17 September 2018, she said that she was \"deeply concerned about these allegations\" and that they should be investigated by the Senate Judicial Committee. In so doing, she did not reveal how she planned to vote. On October 3, 2012, in a presidential debate, Met Romney stated, \"In the medical care programme for current retirees, he cuts $716 billion from the programme.\" \u2022 On October 3, 2012, Makaskel's statement of her vote came a few days later, on September 19, 2018. In that statement, she acknowledged the allegations against Cavanaugh but said that they were not based in her decision on those allegations. \" (W) Although the recent allegations against him are disturbing and merit a thorough and fair examination by the Senate Judicial Committee, my decision is based not on those allegations but on its positions on several key issues, the most important of which is the collapse of anonymous dark funds that are crushing our democracy,\" reading the statement. Macaskel repeated a copy of the allegation in his 30 October interview with CNN, saying that \"it took its decision before the allegations actually appeared, much before the ugly confirmation process.\" Mkastkel's decision to vote \"no\" was preceded by other allegations of sexual misconduct. The story of a second woman, Deborah Ramirez, was published in New Yorker on 23 September 2018. On September 26, she accused Julie Sweetnik for the third time. She witnessed Ford and Cavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee on 27 September 2018, just over a week after Makaskel made her official statement. Our judgment, Macaskel, said she made her decision to vote against Cavanaugh before allegations of sexual misconduct were made. In her statement at the time, Macaskel said that her voice \"no\" was based on Cavanaugh's attitude in several cases, including dark money. But Macaskel knew about the alleged sexual assault from Ford. The other allegations received from Ramirez and Sweetnik have not yet been made public. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.
