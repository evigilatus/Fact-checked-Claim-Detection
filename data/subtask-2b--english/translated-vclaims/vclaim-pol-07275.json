In the 30 seconds that began broadcasting on September 10, 2014, Cianci draws a number of comparisons between the state of Providence when he left office in 2002 (federal prison cell) and the state of the city in the years that followed. We can summarize his message very briefly: things were good when he was responsible and bad under his successor. \"When I left the office, there was a $7 million surplus in Providence,\" says Chayancy as a left-hand side of a segmented screen with 2002 at the bottom showing a formal-looking message. While speaking, the right side of the screen, with 2008 at the bottom, says, \"The deficit is $110 million.\" That was when David Cecilin, now one of the U.S. representatives of Rhode Island, was in his second term as mayor and before Angel Taveras took office. And it's not a secret that Providence's money has been in serious distress for most of the last decade, but has the city really fallen into such a deep hole just six years after Sheanxi took office last year? Chianxi told us that the first part -- the surplus when he stepped down -- was taken from a letter dated 23 August 2002 sent to him by Alex Brignano, then the city's finance manager. In the letter - which appeared during the commercial - Brignano said that the city had a surplus of $7.3 million as at 30 June 2001, the most recent figures reviewed at that time. In addition, Brignano in the letter, \"Fiscal 2002 has just ended and although the audit has not been completed, it is expected that the surplus will again be more than $7.0 million.\" Brignano, it turns out, he was right. The surplus increased in fiscal year 2002, rising to $8.3 million on 30 June of that year, according to the city &apos; s financial reports. (See page 11 of the present report.) With regard to the surplus, Chianxi was somewhat conservative in the commercial sphere. When he left the office, he was actually higher than he claimed. What about the second part of the claim? Did the deficit really reach $110 million in 2008? Chianxi told us that he pulled that number from Brovedance's stories about the city's unstable financial situation after Taveras took over from Ceciline in 2011. These stories, as Chianxi correctly observed, were based on a city funding report commissioned by Tavares when he took office. This report, prepared by a four-person group of financial experts, brought together Brigano and former Auditor General Ernest Almonte, projected a structural deficit in the city in fiscal year 2011-2012, the first full financial year of the Taveras administration, of $110 million. We'll figure out why they use the word \"structure\" to describe the deficit, and the importance of that word, in a moment, but first, let's point out that there is a clear variation in the year of their expectations -- 2011 -- and the year that Cianci uses in his business -- 2008. \"It didn't happen overnight,\" I explained Shenchy. \"This has happened over four or five years.\" According to this logic, the figure of $110 million in the report was correct in 2008 just as it was in 2011. The Taveras report does not go backwards and assesses the structural deficit of 2008 - or whether there was a deficit - but looks at the situation inherited by the new mayor from the Cecilin administration in fiscal year 2010-2011, where a structural deficit of $70 million was estimated at that time. Now let's go back to why we keep using the term \"structural deficit\" and not just \"deficit.\" We have recently addressed this issue in another policy item, Rhode Island, which also focused on the financial affairs of Providence. Facebook published on January 23, 2021 in social media \"Baiden invested the entire family's wealth in Ukrainian gas and oil. Then closes the Keystone pipeline. \u2022 On 28 January 2021, a person or entity suffers from a structural deficit if its projected expenditure for the coming year exceeds its projected income for the same period, which was said by Edward M. Maze, former Dean and current Professor of Business at Rhode Island University, in that piece. In other words, it's a forward-looking number. With knowledge of what could happen without work, the Taveras Department worked with city federations to reduce costs for fiscal year 2012. Outcome: a deficit of $11.4 million that year, well below the projected structural deficit of $110 million. Did Providence have a disability, as the Chianxie Declaration says, in 2008? The simple answer is no. After Cecilin took power in 2003, the city's surplus grew steadily. In fact, it amounted to $22.3 million as at 30 June 2008 - almost three times what it was when Cianci left office in 2002. However, in the years that followed, the management of those reserves was significantly reduced to balance the budget. It also required tens of millions of dollars in loans. Ceciline did not blame the Great Recession and he had no choice but to use the money to compensate for the loss of government aid and to replace federal stimulus dollars once. Others said that he acted irresponsiblely. The final result was that by early 2011, two months after Cecilin left the office, only $220,000 remained in the account - a small amount relative to the size of Providence, but still a surplus. We've made this clear to Chayancy. In response, he referred to concerns raised in 2009 about city budget practices by James J. Lombardi III, followed by the Internal Auditor of Providence and the current City Fund Secretary. At that time, he repeatedly warned that the continued use of reserves by the city to finance the budget was unsustainable. The Sianxi view is that the seeds of Providence's financial problems were planted around 2008. He said, \"This is when the deficit began to accumulate.\" Some, including Cecilin and Tavares, claimed that the problems had already begun during the State of Cianci when the city had failed for years to make adequate contributions to its pension fund. (See page 9 of the present actuarial report.) We asked Lombardi if he had assessed a structural deficit in the city before Tafras took office. He could not give a definitive answer, saying that since that time his records had been kept. But he said his fears might have been more focused. In a television announcement, former Mayor of Providence Chianxi said, \"When I left the office, there was a $7 million surplus in Providence,\" but in 2008, the city had a deficit of $110 million. That certainly sounds dramatic. But it's not quite accurate. While he was right about the surplus -- it was actually a little higher than he claimed -- he was wrong about the deficit. There is an argument that some kind of structural deficit existed in 2008, but linking this figure to $110 million represents a major leap. And the Cianci claim ignores the difference -- big -- between disability and structural deficit. Finally, the announcement indicates that things were pink under Sheanxi and landed down after he left. This ignores the future problems caused by the lack of funding for the pension system, the effects of the major recession and the steps taken by Taveras to restore the city from the brink of bankruptcy. The judges were divided on this one, but ultimately a half-right judgment.
