0001	JAKE TAPPER, CNN	Live from The George Washington University in the nation's capital, this is CNN's debate night on the future of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
0002	JAKE TAPPER, CNN	Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world.
0003	JAKE TAPPER, CNN	I'm Jake Tapper.
0004	DANA BASH, CNN	And I'm Dana Bash.
0005	DANA BASH, CNN	President Trump has made the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act one of his top priorities.
0006	DANA BASH, CNN	To certain members of our audience, that legislation has been a lifesaver.
0007	DANA BASH, CNN	To others, it has harmed livelihoods.
0008	DANA BASH, CNN	These defenders and supporters of Obamacare will get to question two leading members of Congress who will shape what comes next.
0009	TAPPER	So, please welcome the runnersup for the Democratic and Republican nominations for president, in their first debate, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont...
0010	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0011	TAPPER	... and Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas.
0012	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0013	BASH	Senators, welcome.
0014	BASH	Please take your positions behind the podiums.
0015	BASH	Now, before your opening statements, I want to talk about the ground rules that you both agreed to.
0016	BASH	You will get 90 seconds to answer questions posed to you, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals.
0017	BASH	Timing lights will guide you.
0018	BASH	As we mentioned, a handful of members of our audience, which include both critics and defenders of the Affordable Care Act, will question you, in addition to questions from Jake and myself.
0019	BASH	As moderators, we will guide the debate.
0020	BASH	And we will begin with twominute opening statements on what should happen to health care in America.
0021	BASH	Senator Sanders?
0022	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Let me begin by thanking CNN for sponsoring this debate and let me thank all of those who are watching.
0023	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Let me get right to the point.
0024	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Senator Cruz, like most Republicans, has said that he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or socalled Obamacare.
0025	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Let me tell you what that will mean to the American people.
0026	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	It means that if you are one of 20 million Americans who finally has received health insurance, forget about it, you're gone.
0027	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	You're off health insurance.
0028	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	And that means when you get sick, you ain't going to be able to go to the doctor.
0029	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	And when you end up in the hospital, you'll be paying those bills for the rest of your life, or maybe you'll go bankrupt.
0030	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	What the repeal of the ACA means, that if you are one of 10 million senior citizens who today is struggling with the outrageous cost of prescription drugs, your prescription drug costs are going to go up on average about $2,000.
0031	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	What the repeal of the ACA means is that if you are suffering with cancer, with diabetes, with serious mental illness, you will be put into a position where you may be rejected from any insurance at all, because you have a preexisting condition.
0032	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	And by the way, women are considered a preexisting condition by the insurance companies because they might have a baby.
0033	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Is the ACA perfect?
0034	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	No.
0035	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Nobody believes that it is.
0036	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	And nobody believes that we do not need to improve it.
0037	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	But the debate is whether we kill it entirely or we make improvements in it.
0038	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	And I will tell you  Overwhelming majority of the American people say do not simply repeal the ACA.
0039	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Make improvements.
0040	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Last point.
0041	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	The United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right.
0042	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	I believe we should move in that direction.
0043	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	The ACA has been a step forward.
0044	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	We have got to go further and join every other major country on Earth and say that if you are an American, you are guaranteed health care as a right, not a privilege.
0045	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Thank you.
0046	BASH	Thank you, Senator Sanders.
0047	BASH	Senator Cruz, what should happen with health care in America?
0048	SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX	Well, Dana, I think I get an opening statement, as well, so I'll start with that.
0049	BASH	Please.
0050	CRUZ	Which is just simply saying thank you.
0051	CRUZ	Thank you, guys, for hosting this.
0052	CRUZ	Thank you for Bernie for joining this.
0053	CRUZ	And thank you to CNN for hosting this.
0054	CRUZ	You know, often in politics we have debates that are sound bites, that are 60 seconds or 90 seconds on a topic, and I appreciate CNN devoting real time to this issue, because it matters.
0055	CRUZ	Health care is personal in a way that is different from most other political issues.
0056	CRUZ	Health care affects our families.
0057	CRUZ	It's our moms.
0058	CRUZ	Health care is our kids.
0059	CRUZ	It's the future.
0060	CRUZ	It can quite literally be whether we live or die.
0061	CRUZ	And this is an issue where Bernie Sanders and I have fundamentally different approaches.
0062	CRUZ	Bernie and the Democrats want government to control health care.
0063	CRUZ	I trust you.
0064	CRUZ	And I trust your doctors.
0065	CRUZ	I think health care works better when you're in charge of your family's health care decisions, when you can sit down with your doctor and decide the care that's best for your family without government setting rules, without government rationing, without wait periods.
0066	CRUZ	And that's the fundamental divide we're having.
0067	CRUZ	You know, six years ago, when Obamacare was being adopted, it's possible that reasonable minds could have differed on whether this was a good idea.
0068	CRUZ	But six years into it, we've seen the results.
0069	CRUZ	We remember Obamacare, a series of promises were made to us by President Obama.
0070	CRUZ	Number one, most infamously, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.
0071	CRUZ	President Obama said that 37 different times.
0072	CRUZ	As 6 million people across this country discovered, that was not true when they had their plans canceled against their wishes.
0073	CRUZ	If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.
0074	CRUZ	Again, millions discovered that wasn't true.
0075	CRUZ	And President Obama promised the American people the average family's premiums would drop $2,500.
0076	CRUZ	Not only wasn't that true, but the average family's premiums have risen $5,000.
0077	CRUZ	That's why people are unhappy with this disaster of a law, because it's driven up the cost of health care, it's reduced your choice, it's reduced your freedom, and this last election was a referendum on Obamacare, and the American people quite rightly decided this plan isn't working.
0078	TAPPER	Senator Cruz, thank you so much.
0079	TAPPER	We have a lot of questions for both of you from members of the audience, but before we get to them, I want to ask about a pressing matter on Capitol Hill, and I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.
0080	TAPPER	House Speaker Paul Ryan said today that the legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare would be done this year.
0081	TAPPER	On Sunday, President Trump said that a plan may not be rolled out until 2018.
0082	TAPPER	Not that it would, but that it may not be rolled out until 2018.
0083	TAPPER	Is anything less than a full and swift repeal and replacement of Obamacare a broken promise?
0084	CRUZ	Listen, I think everyone agrees there is an urgency to honor the promises we made.
0085	CRUZ	You know, since Obamacare was passed, we've had multiple elections, 2010, 2014, 2016, where the numberone issue in each of those elections was Obamacare.
0086	CRUZ	And, you know, what we're arguing here was argued in front of the American people.
0087	CRUZ	The Democrats said over and over again, if Obamacare is repealed, all these people are going to lose coverage.
0088	CRUZ	Now, that's not true, and we're going to get into that.
0089	CRUZ	But that was the argument that was made to the American people.
0090	CRUZ	And 2010, 2014, 2016 I believe were a mandate from the voters.
0091	CRUZ	They said we're tired of premiums going up.
0092	CRUZ	We're tired of deductibles going up.
0093	CRUZ	We're tired of losing our doctors of less choices.
0094	CRUZ	So, yes, should Congress move swiftly to repeal Obamacare?
0095	CRUZ	Absolutely.
0096	CRUZ	Now, nobody thinks we're done once Obamacare is repealed.
0097	CRUZ	Once Obamacare is repealed, we need commonsense reform that increases competition, that empowers patients, that gives you more choices, that puts you in charge of your health care, rather than empowering government bureaucrats to get in the way.
0098	CRUZ	And these have been commonsense ideas, I would note, that for six years Republicans have been proposing, and for six years Democrats have been fighting, saying no changes at all to Obamacare, even as people were hurting and losing their coverage.
0099	CRUZ	This election is about honoring the promises we made to the people who elected us.
0100	TAPPER	Senator Sanders?
0101	SANDERS	Well, the truth is that the Republicans are now in a panic, because the American people have caught on that the absolute repeal of Obamacare without improvements in it, without a plan to make it better, would be an absolute disaster.
0102	SANDERS	So when Ted talks about giving people choice, here's your choice.
0103	SANDERS	You got cancer, and you go to the doctor, and the insurance company says, "We're not going to cover it.
0104	SANDERS	We can't make money on you because you have cancer.
0105	SANDERS	You have a preexisting condition."
0106	SANDERS	And here's another choice you can have if we get rid of Obamacare.
0107	SANDERS	If you have diabetes, and you're spending a whole lot on health insurance, the insurance companies will say, sorry, we're only going to spend X dollars, because we've got to make money off you.
0108	SANDERS	That's the function of private insurance.
0109	SANDERS	So, do we have to improve the Affordable Care Act?
0110	SANDERS	Of course we do.
0111	SANDERS	But let us remember where we came from.
0112	SANDERS	Before the Affordable Care Act, as Ted probably knows, if you were a family of four during the eight years under George Bush, your premiums doubled.
0113	SANDERS	So it's not like, oh, gee, just in America today, health care costs are going up.
0114	SANDERS	They went up much higher before we had the Affordable Care Act.
0115	TAPPER	Senator Cruz, do you want to respond to that?
0116	CRUZ	You know, it is interesting to hear so much of the Democratic rhetoric that government controlling your health care is always justified by saying the insurance companies are terrible.
0117	CRUZ	Now, this is an example of what John Adams famously said, facts are stubborn things.
0118	CRUZ	Let's talk about some facts.
0119	CRUZ	In 2008, the 10 largest insurance companies in America made just over $8 billion profit.
0120	CRUZ	In 2016  2015, rather  those same 10 largest companies made $15 billion in profit.
0121	CRUZ	Insurance company profits have doubled under Obamacare.
0122	CRUZ	That was the result.
0123	CRUZ	Bernie helped write Obamacare.
0124	CRUZ	I don't think the federal government ought to be passing a law that doubles insurance company profits and, while those profits were doubling, what happened to the average American family?
0125	CRUZ	The average American family, your premiums have gone up $5,462.
0126	CRUZ	At the same time, the average deductible has gone up $5,000.
0127	CRUZ	For families that are struggling, you're getting less coverage, you're paying more for it, and your deductibles are higher, and you know who's making out like gangbusters?
0128	CRUZ	The insurance companies and those in government whose solution is let's have even more government control.
0129	TAPPER	Senator...
0130	CRUZ	This thing isn't working.
0131	TAPPER	Senator Sanders?
0132	SANDERS	You know, I find myself in agreement with Ted.
0133	SANDERS	He's right.
0134	SANDERS	The function of insurance companies is not to provide quality health care to all people.
0135	SANDERS	It's to make as much money as they possibly can.
0136	SANDERS	Ted, let's work together on a Medicare for all, singlepayer program, so we're finally going to get insurance companies, private insurance companies out of our lives.
0137	SANDERS	As you know, as the American people know, we are the only major country on Earth that allows private insurance companies to run the system.
0138	SANDERS	But it's not only the points that Ted made about the insurance companies.
0139	SANDERS	What he forgot to tell you, even adding insult to injury, is many of these CEOs of the insurance companies make outrageous compensation and get all of these severance packages, in some cases over $100 million.
0140	SANDERS	Ted, let's work together.
0141	SANDERS	We're going to get those insurance companies out of health care.
0142	SANDERS	We'll move to a Medicare for all health care program, guaranteeing health care to all people.
0143	BASH	Thank you, Senators.
0144	BASH	Unless you want to agree to a single payer system...
0145	CRUZ	Look, I would love to respond.
0146	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0147	SANDERS	You're not going to support that.
0148	SANDERS	I know that.
0149	CRUZ	Well, actually, what I will say, Bernie, is I would love for us to work together going after big pharma, and in particular taking on the FDA.
0150	CRUZ	Right now, it takes $2 billion to approve a new drug.
0151	CRUZ	Now, I've introduced legislation to reform the FDA process so that new health care  so that we can be curing diseases and we can be helping people.
0152	CRUZ	I would encourage you to join me in that legislation.
0153	SANDERS	I'll tell you what...
0154	CRUZ	Join me in right to try, so that if someone has a terminal disease, the government won't tell them, you can't try this life saving medicine because we forbid it.
0155	TAPPER	Gentlemen, we could do this all night.
0156	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0157	TAPPER	We're going to get to pharma.
0158	SANDERS	I'm willing to look at it, if you are willing to look at taking on pharma, which is the greediest of many greedy corporate interests in Washington.
0159	SANDERS	And I'll tell you what, I'm going to introduce legislation to have Medicare negotiate prices with the pharmaceutical industry.
0160	SANDERS	I'm going to introduce, again, legislation to allow Americans to buy less expensive medicine in Canada, the U.K., and other countries.
0161	SANDERS	Let's take on the greed of pharma, substantially lower prescription drug prices.
0162	CRUZ	And, Dana, let me make a response to this, because this is a good discussion.
0163	CRUZ	The whole point of having an extended discussion is to say, as you know, with drug reimportation, bringing in drugs from Canada and other countries, just a couple of weeks ago, on the Senate floor, I voted with you...
0164	SANDERS	You voted for my amendment, that's correct.
0165	CRUZ	... in support of that, in support of allowing drug re importation.
0166	CRUZ	It was the right thing to do.
0167	CRUZ	But I'll tell you, a much bigger barrier than that is the fact that, you know, in the last 20 years, the FDA has approved only three child cancer drugs?
0168	CRUZ	In 20 years, because the burdens are so great.
0169	CRUZ	I introduced legislation that said if a drug is approved in another major country, if it's approved in Europe or Japan or our major respected partners, that the FDA has got 30 days to approve it here.
0170	CRUZ	We shouldn't be telling people with lifethreatening diseases you can't do everything you can to save your lives.
0171	CRUZ	That would be a great thing.
0172	BASH	Senator...
0173	CRUZ	We'd make news if you and I joined up on that.
0174	SANDERS	We'll need to look at it, but that is not the major problem.
0175	SANDERS	The major problem with the pharmaceutical industry is, you know what, they could double or triple the prices you pay for medicine tomorrow...
0176	BASH	Senator Sanders...
0177	SANDERS	... and there is no legislation to control that.
0178	BASH	Senator Sanders...
0179	SANDERS	Hi, Dana, how are you?
0180	BASH	Oh, hi.
0181	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0182	SANDERS	Good to see you.
0183	BASH	So good to see you.
0184	BASH	We do want to talk more about that later, but I want to get to some of the questions from our audience.
0185	BASH	One of the most popular parts of Obamacare is  as you mentioned earlier, requiring insurance companies to cover people with preexisting conditions.
0186	BASH	If Obamacare is repealed, 52 million Americans could lose that guaranteed coverage because of their medical histories.
0187	BASH	One of them is Neosho Ponder, who is fighting breast cancer and currently undergoing radiation treatment.
0188	BASH	Neosho?
0189	QUESTION	Senator Cruz, if Obamacare is repealed, is there anything you can do to ensure that provisions are in place so that half of my paycheck won't be spent on health care?
0190	QUESTION	I didn't ask for cancer.
0191	QUESTION	I never smoked I never drank a lot.
0192	QUESTION	I lived a pretty healthy lifestyle.
0193	QUESTION	I fear that  I fear that if I don't have Obamacare, if I'm not covered, then my preexisting condition of breast cancer and remaining treatments will make it difficult for me to afford insurance.
0194	QUESTION	Senator Cruz, what can you do to protect people like me who are alive because of Obamacare?
0195	CRUZ	Well, Neo, thank you for asking that question.
0196	CRUZ	And how long  how long have you been diagnosed with breast cancer?
0197	QUESTION	I was diagnosed on April 25, 2016.
0198	CRUZ	Wow, well, you're doing great.
0199	CRUZ	You know, our prayers are with you.
0200	CRUZ	I'll tell you, my mom had breast cancer, and  and my mom was diagnosed in 2000.
0201	CRUZ	I sat by her hospital bed as she went through two surgeries, and it's a horrible disease, but 16 years later, thank God, she is a survivor.
0202	CRUZ	And I will tell you, our medical innovation has been incredible dealing with breast cancer.
0203	CRUZ	So all of us  our prayers and thoughts are with you.
0204	QUESTION	Thank you.
0205	CRUZ	You know, you asked about people who get sick and not wanting your insurance canceled, not wanting your premiums to go up, that's absolutely right.
0206	CRUZ	That is absolutely right.
0207	CRUZ	And if you look at every proposal that's been submitted, every significant proposal that's been submitted to replace Obamacare, to fix the problems in the health care system after Obamacare is gotten rid of, all of them protect people in your situations.
0208	CRUZ	All of them prohibit insurance companies from canceling someone because they got sick.
0209	CRUZ	They prohibit insurance companies from jacking up the insurance rates because they got sick or injured.
0210	CRUZ	Look, the whole point of insurance is none of us know if we're going to wake up tomorrow, like you did earlier last year, and discover we have a terrible disease.
0211	CRUZ	And we buy insurance, we pay our premiums, just so we know that we'll be able to take care of that situation.
0212	CRUZ	So, absolutely, we've got to fix it, and I'm confident that we're going to.
0213	BASH	Senator Sanders, response?
0214	SANDERS	Senator, I cannot believe what you just said.
0215	SANDERS	It's in direct contradiction to everything you ran for president on.
0216	SANDERS	What Ted has said is, he wants to get rid of all federal mandates.
0217	SANDERS	Did you say that a hundred times?
0218	CRUZ	I didn't say it once.
0219	SANDERS	I will  said Ted Cruz, I will get rid of every word of Obamacare.
0220	SANDERS	Excuse me.
0221	SANDERS	The only way that we are going to make sure that you  and we all wish you the best  are able to get the health insurance you need with a preexisting condition is to make sure that no insurance company in this country can say no to you or to anybody else.
0222	SANDERS	Now, Ted thinks that's a terrible government intrusion.
0223	SANDERS	I think it is the moral and right thing to do.
0224	SANDERS	So, when you hear Ted and other Republicans say we're going to get rid of all of  we're going to leave it to the states.
0225	SANDERS	Well, what do you think the states are going to do?
0226	SANDERS	You think they're going to maintain the ability to protect people with preexisting conditions?
0227	SANDERS	They're not.
0228	SANDERS	We're going to go back to the obscenity of where we were before Obamacare was passed.
0229	BASH	Senator Cruz, your response.
0230	BASH	And then could you just clarify, will you support anything that doesn't mandate people with pre existing conditions continue to have coverage?
0231	CRUZ	Look, my response is, I said hundreds of times on the campaign trail, yes, we should repeal every word of Obamacare.
0232	CRUZ	But if you listen to the next sentence, I always said, we're not done yet with health care reform, and we do that.
0233	CRUZ	We need health care reform.
0234	CRUZ	And the principles of health care reform, they should expand competition, they should empower patients, and they should keep government from getting between you and your doctor.
0235	CRUZ	And I talked about all sorts of commonsense ideas to do just that.
0236	CRUZ	And as I said, a proposal that is consistent in virtually every one of the pieces of Republican legislation that's been filed is a prohibition on insurance companies canceling people because they got sick.
0237	CRUZ	And, you know, Bernie, it's easy to say to people, gosh, you're going to lose your coverage.
0238	CRUZ	What do the Democrats say to the 6 million people who had their health insurance canceled?
0239	CRUZ	What...
0240	SANDERS	Ted, Ted, you're a good lawyer, and you use words well.
0241	CRUZ	Thank you.
0242	SANDERS	What you just said is "cancel your insurance."
0243	SANDERS	Cancel your insurance, OK?
0244	SANDERS	That's good.
0245	SANDERS	But what happens if tomorrow you wake up and you go to the doctor and you discover that you have cancer?
0246	SANDERS	All right?
0247	SANDERS	You just discovered it.
0248	SANDERS	And the insurance companies say, hey, you're not a good deal for us, we can't make money off of you, you will not get that health insurance.
0249	SANDERS	So I think when people like Ted talk about repealing Obamacare, repealing government mandates  this is a government mandate, and it is a damn good mandate and a humane mandate.
0250	BASH	And, Senator Cruz, if you would answer Neosho's specific question.
0251	CRUZ	Yeah, I did.
0252	CRUZ	Multiple times, Dana.
0253	BASH	OK.
0254	BASH	So you are saying that she will continue to have health care...
0255	CRUZ	Yeah.
0256	BASH	... she and others who have preexisting conditions?
0257	BASH	And
0258	BASH	you're going to make sure that that is a mandate and a requirement in whatever legislation you support?
0259	CRUZ	What I've said is, is virtually all of the Republican legislation that has been filed that the Democrats have opposed maintains a continuity of coverage so that insurance companies can't cancel policies.
0260	CRUZ	And, you know, the question I asked a minute ago that Bernie chose not to answer is, what do the Democrats say to the 6 million people who had their insurance policies canceled, who got a notification in the mail that you don't get to see your doctors anymore?
0261	CRUZ	And not just the people who were canceled.
0262	CRUZ	There are people all over this country who can't afford health insurance because of Obamacare, who the deductibles are so high, the premiums are so high, they say, you know what, my family, we can't make it on this?
0263	CRUZ	And, you know, you talk about the people covered by Obamacare.
0264	CRUZ	Here's something most people don't know.
0265	CRUZ	Most of the people covered by Obamacare are on Medicaid.
0266	CRUZ	They jammed a bunch more people on Medicaid.
0267	CRUZ	And I'll tell you what happens.
0268	CRUZ	People on Medicaid have markedly worse health outcomes than people with private insurance.
0269	BASH	Senator, we're going to get to these issues...
0270	CRUZ	I would like to see a lot more people on private insurance, able to be insured for health care...
0271	BASH	We're going to get to these issues of Medicaid and others....
0272	CRUZ	... rather than  but it's relevant to  he's saying people are going to lose their health care.
0273	CRUZ	If you want health care, we want as many people as possible to be able to afford insurance policies that protect you when you get sick.
0274	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0275	SANDERS	I want to just  very briefly.
0276	BASH	Go ahead.
0277	SANDERS	If you listen carefully to what he's saying, if you go to the doctor tomorrow, and you are diagnosed with a terrible illness, the insurance companies do not have to provide you insurance.
0278	SANDERS	That is what Ted said.
0279	SANDERS	What he also said, if you have an illness, it has to be kept.
0280	SANDERS	But really, we are moving into an era where millions of people who develop terrible illnesses will not be able to get insurance.
0281	SANDERS	And God only knows how many of them will die.
0282	TAPPER	So, Senator Sanders, you just heard Senator Cruz bring up an issue that a lot of Americans have out there, especially a lot of middleclass Americans, who say that the Affordable Care Act has made it so that their insurance is unaffordable.
0283	TAPPER	One of them is in our audience right now.
0284	TAPPER	Her name is Melissa Borkowski.
0285	TAPPER	She's a nurse practitioner from Florida.
0286	TAPPER	She is a mother of four.
0287	TAPPER	She and her husband are paying more than $1,000 a month to insure their family for a plan with a $13,000 deductible.
0288	TAPPER	Melissa?
0289	QUESTION	Good evening, Senators.
0290	QUESTION	Thank you for your time.
0291	QUESTION	As you said, I'm a nurse practitioner.
0292	QUESTION	I've worked in health care for over 25 years now.
0293	QUESTION	But under Obamacare, I'm not able to get the health services I need for myself or my family.
0294	QUESTION	Last year, I had a very abnormal pap smear and needed additional tests.
0295	QUESTION	But our plan has a $13,000 deductible before it will cover anything, so I wasn't able to afford to get those tests done.
0296	QUESTION	So now I sit here wondering if I have an undiagnosed cancer that will eventually take me away from my four children.
0297	QUESTION	My plan premiums plus deductible cost over $25,000 for the year and it covers little more than basic preventative services.
0298	QUESTION	Senator Sanders, my question is, why should we, my family, be forced to pay so much money for an insurance plan that is essentially useless and doesn't do anything for me?
0299	SANDERS	Pam...
0300	TAPPER	Melissa.
0301	SANDERS	Melissa, I'm sorry.
0302	SANDERS	Melissa, you ask a great question, and the answer is, it is totally absurd.
0303	SANDERS	It is totally absurd.
0304	SANDERS	But the real question we should be asking  Melissa is talking about an outrageous deductible, right?
0305	QUESTION	Yes.
0306	SANDERS	So it prevents you from going to the doctor when you should be going.
0307	SANDERS	The real question, which is never talked about or very rarely talked about, is why we end up spending as a nation twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.
0308	SANDERS	Now, if you were in Canada, you know what, you would get the health care that you needed.
0309	SANDERS	If you were in the U.K., France, Germany, Scandinavia, you would get the health care you need as a right of being a citizen in this country.
0310	SANDERS	The idea that we have policies like that, like the one you describe, is clearly an outrage and should tell every American that we've got to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people as a right.
0311	SANDERS	And when we do that, by the way, for a vast majority of the American people, their family incomes will go up.
0312	TAPPER	Senator Cruz?
0313	CRUZ	You know, Melissa, I'm sorry for the challenges you're facing.
0314	CRUZ	There are many people in America struggling with exactly what you are, in the wreckage of Obamacare, with skyrocketing premiums, with deductibles that are unaffordable, and with really limited care.
0315	CRUZ	And I will commend Bernie for his candor.
0316	CRUZ	I mean, his view all along was that we need governmentrun and governmentcontrolled health care for everyone.
0317	CRUZ	And indeed, as he's said here tonight, he thinks other countries do it a lot better than America.
0318	CRUZ	He often points to Canada, the United Kingdom, he says why do we pay more?
0319	CRUZ	Well, there's a reason we pay more than those countries.
0320	CRUZ	We get a lot more and a lot better health care.
0321	CRUZ	Let me give you some basic facts.
0322	CRUZ	As I noticed in all the Democratic primary debates, there was no discussion of the facts on the other side.
0323	CRUZ	The United States, population controlled, delivers three times as many mammograms as Europe, twoandahalf times the number of MRI scans, and 31 percent more C sections.
0324	CRUZ	We provide more health care.
0325	CRUZ	Not only that, in the United Kingdom, for example, wait times, in 2013, you waited 72 days for cataract surgery, you waited 89 days for hip replacement, 95 days for knee replacement.
0326	CRUZ	There are 3.7 million people in the United Kingdom right now on a waiting list, waiting for health care.
0327	CRUZ	Whenever you put government in charge of health care, what it means is they ration.
0328	CRUZ	They decide you get care and you don't.
0329	CRUZ	I don't think the government has any business telling you you're not entitled to receive health care.
0330	CRUZ	That's why I think the answer is not more of Obamacare, more government control, more of what got us in this mess.
0331	CRUZ	Rather, the answer is empower you.
0332	CRUZ	Give you choices.
0333	CRUZ	Lower prices.
0334	CRUZ	Lower premiums.
0335	CRUZ	Lower deductibles.
0336	CRUZ	Empower you and put you back in charge of your health care.
0337	TAPPER	Senator Cruz, thank you.
0338	TAPPER	Senator Sanders, let me ask you, just as part of Melissa's question, Florida, the state she's from, now offers fewer insurance options through Obamacare through the insurance exchange.
0339	TAPPER	There was a nearly 25 percent decline in the number of insurers in 2017 nationally compared to 2016.
0340	TAPPER	There are five states that only have one insurer providing insurance on the exchange.
0341	TAPPER	What would you do to ensure that consumers have both choice and manageable cost?
0342	SANDERS	Fair question.
0343	SANDERS	Let me get back to Melissa, and I'll get to you.
0344	TAPPER	It's part of the question, because the competition is down.
0345	SANDERS	I know it is.
0346	SANDERS	I know it is.
0347	SANDERS	Well, Ted talks about the problems that exist in other countries in terms of waiting lists.
0348	SANDERS	He talks about rationing.
0349	SANDERS	We have enormous rationing in this country.
0350	SANDERS	When you have 28 million people who have no health insurance, that's rationing.
0351	SANDERS	When you have people who can't afford to go to the doctor or can't afford to buy prescription drugs, one out of five Americans can't afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe, that's called rationing.
0352	SANDERS	Except there's no rule on that there's no law on that.
0353	SANDERS	It's just people don't have the money to buy what they need in terms of health care.
0354	SANDERS	To answer your question, Jake, what I have long supported within the context of Obamacare, as we move toward a Medicare for all single payer program, is a public option.
0355	SANDERS	There should be a Medicaretype public option available in all exchanges, in all states in this country.
0356	SANDERS	And I think that would substantially lower the cost of health care in this country and provide real competition to the private sector.
0357	TAPPER	Senator Cruz?
0358	CRUZ	Well, Jake, I think the question you asked is a very good one.
0359	CRUZ	And you're right, that choices have gone down dramatically.
0360	CRUZ	Indeed, I don't know if the cameras can see this, but in 70 percent of the counties in America, on Obamacare exchanges, you have a choice of one or two health insurance plans, that's it, 70 percent of the counties in America.
0361	CRUZ	It's interesting.
0362	CRUZ	You look at this map, this also very much looks like the electoral map that elected Donald Trump.
0363	CRUZ	It's really quite striking that the communities that have been hammered by this disaster of a law said enough already.
0364	CRUZ	Now, Bernie likes talking about a public option.
0365	CRUZ	That's another way of saying government control of your health care.
0366	CRUZ	It's socialized medicine.
0367	CRUZ	And what does it mean?
0368	CRUZ	Every country where it's been applied, you've seen rationing, you've seen government deciding, especially seniors.
0369	CRUZ	Seniors, you don't get the health care you need.
0370	CRUZ	Now, Bernie mentions Canada quite a bit.
0371	CRUZ	I know quite a bit about Canadian health care.
0372	CRUZ	I was born there.
0373	CRUZ	You know, Bernie, that may be the best argument against your position, you know, look what it produced.
0374	SANDERS	Look what it...
0375	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0376	SANDERS	Yeah, that's right.
0377	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0378	CRUZ	But, you know, people vote with their feet.
0379	CRUZ	In 2014, over 52,000 Canadians left Canada to get health care in the United States and other countries.
0380	CRUZ	I'm reminded of a comment Ronald Reagan used to say about East Berlin, about the Berlin Wall.
0381	CRUZ	He said the funny thing the leftists never seem to notice, the machine guns all point one direction.
0382	CRUZ	Everyone was fleeing communism and coming to freedom.
0383	CRUZ	If you look at socialized medicine, people leave there, tens and hundreds of thousands every year, leave socialized medicine countries because they want to get a hip replacement, a knee replacement.
0384	CRUZ	You know, the governor of one of the Canadian provinces came to America to get heart surgery, and he was a governor in Canada.
0385	CRUZ	And, by the way, in your home state of Vermont, your hospitals advertise with Canadian flags, "Come to American hospitals, you'll get better health care."
0386	CRUZ	I don't want to mess up our health care.
0387	CRUZ	I want patients, all of us to be in charge of our health care, not government deciding what health care we get.
0388	SANDERS	Government deciding?
0389	SANDERS	No, government doesn't decide in Canada or anyplace else.
0390	SANDERS	And, by the way, as you well know, Canada had for many years a conservative prime minister.
0391	CRUZ	Conservative is relative.
0392	SANDERS	The United Kingdom had for many, many years a conservative prime minister.
0393	SANDERS	I don't see those countries junking their health care systems in which, by the way, poll after poll shows not that though don't have problems.
0394	SANDERS	Of course they have problems.
0395	SANDERS	Every health care system in the world has problems.
0396	SANDERS	But I am not seeing those countries junking their universal health care system, which provide health care to all of their people at one half the cost per capita that we do.
0397	SANDERS	I don't see conservative prime ministers doing that to go to the American health care system.
0398	SANDERS	Our system is wasteful, it is dysfunctional, it is incredibly bureaucratic.
0399	SANDERS	You talk about choice?
0400	SANDERS	You have people who have to argue with insurance companies for days before they can get the care that they need.
0401	CRUZ	See, Bernie, you say wasteful, and I say people exercising free choice.
0402	CRUZ	You're right.
0403	CRUZ	We could cut costs here if we do like Europe and cut the number of MRIs, the number of mammograms.
0404	CRUZ	If we cut  you know, you look at the elderly in much of Europe.
0405	CRUZ	The elderly here, when the elderly face lifethreatening diseases, they're often treated in the intensive care unit.
0406	CRUZ	In Europe, they're often put in palliative care, essentially doped up with some drugs, and said, "Well, now is your time to go."
0407	SANDERS	Oh.
0408	CRUZ	I don't expect the government to be saying that.
0409	CRUZ	And let me give  since you laughed at that, let's actually talk facts, because facts matter.
0410	CRUZ	So let's talk about, for example, a couple of stories from the United Kingdom.
0411	CRUZ	In Glasgow, Scotland, the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital was so overburdened this past January, it turned away three women who were in labor because they couldn't take care of them.
0412	CRUZ	In Worchester, England, a man was left on an ambulance gurney for five hours before his heart attack was diagnosed, and he waited seven hours before he received a stent and angioplasty.
0413	CRUZ	In a hospital in Essex, doctors twice canceled a lifesaving  potential lifesaving surgery for a patient with esophageal cancer, because there were no free beds in the intensive care unit.
0414	CRUZ	One more example.
0415	CRUZ	In Wales, an 82yearold woman who had fallen waited eight hours on the floor before an ambulance arrived.
0416	CRUZ	Her daughter sat beside her in the ordeal, described it as one of the longest nights of our life.
0417	CRUZ	This is what happened when government takes over health care  every example on Earth  the result is rationing and waiting periods, and you, the citizens, being told, no, you can't have the health care you want and deserve.
0418	SANDERS	And in America, we do rationing in a different way, Ted.
0419	SANDERS	The way we do rationing is, if you are very rich, you can get the best health care in the world, I believe, right here in the United States.
0420	SANDERS	We should be proud of that.
0421	SANDERS	But if you are working class, you are going to be having a very difficult time affording the outrageous cost of health care.
0422	SANDERS	That's what Melissa just told us a moment ago.
0423	SANDERS	Now, estimates differ, but let's be clear about this.
0424	SANDERS	Every single year, tens of thousands of our fellow Americans die because they don't go to the doctor when they should.
0425	SANDERS	You gave some examples about the U.K. Let me give you some examples here in the United States.
0426	SANDERS	I talk to doctors in Vermont, all over this country, and what they tell me, patients come into their offices very, very sick.
0427	SANDERS	And they say to the patients, why didn't you come in here a year ago when you felt your tumor, when you felt your problem, when were you sick?
0428	SANDERS	Why didn't you come in here?
0429	SANDERS	And people said, "I didn't have any insurance."
0430	SANDERS	Or, "My deductible was so high, I couldn't go."
0431	SANDERS	We just heard that story a moment ago.
0432	SANDERS	And some of those people die.
0433	SANDERS	And others end up in the hospital at outrageous costs for illnesses that could have been treated initially at far less cost.
0434	SANDERS	So, please, don't tell me about rationing.
0435	SANDERS	This country has more rationing than any other industrialized country on Earth, except the rationing is done by income.
0436	SANDERS	And workingclass people and poor people today are suffering as a result of that rationing.
0437	TAPPER	We're going to take a very quick break.
0438	TAPPER	The debate will continue right after this with Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders.
0439	TAPPER	Stay with us.
0440	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0441	BASH	Welcome back to the CNN debate on the future of health care in America, with Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders.
0442	BASH	Let's now turn to the effects of Obamacare on small businesses, and with us to discuss is LaRonda Hunter, who owns five hair salons in Texas.
0443	BASH	LaRonda?
0444	QUESTION	Hello.
0445	QUESTION	Under the controls of Obamacare, my business has been restricted from expansion.
0446	QUESTION	I'm from Fort Worth, Texas.
0447	QUESTION	I own five Fantastic Sams hair salons.
0448	QUESTION	We employ between 45 and 48 employees.
0449	QUESTION	My original plan was to open more salons and employ more people.
0450	QUESTION	However, under Obamacare, I am restricted, because I  it requires me to furnish health insurance if I employ more than 50 people.
0451	QUESTION	Unfortunately, the profit margin in my industry is very thin.
0452	QUESTION	And I'm not a wealthy person, so it's impossible for me to grow my business.
0453	QUESTION	My question to you, Senator Sanders, is how do I grow my business?
0454	QUESTION	How do I employ more Americans without either raising the prices to my customers or lowering wages to my employees?
0455	SANDERS	Ronda?
0456	QUESTION	LaRonda.
0457	SANDERS	LaRonda, OK.  You own five salons?
0458	QUESTION	That's correct.
0459	SANDERS	And you employ close to 50 people?
0460	QUESTION	Just under.
0461	SANDERS	And what kind of health insurance do you provide for them?
0462	QUESTION	I don't  none.
0463	SANDERS	You provide no health insurance to them?
0464	QUESTION	Correct.
0465	SANDERS	Let me be  let me give you an answer you will not be happy with, and that is I think that for businesses that employ 50 people or more, given the nature of our dysfunctional health care system right now, where most people do get their health insurance through the places that they work, I'm sorry, I think that in America today, everybody should have health care.
0466	SANDERS	And if you have more than 50 people, you know what, I think  I'm afraid to tell you  I think you will have to provide health insurance.
0467	QUESTION	So my question is, how do I do that without raising my prices to my customers or lowering wages to my employees?
0468	SANDERS	You see, the difficulty is also is  and I'm not much of an expert on hairdressing in general, and certainly in Fort Worth...
0469	QUESTION	I'm just one of small businesses.
0470	SANDERS	I know.
0471	SANDERS	But my guess is, one of the problems that we have is there may be somebody else in Fort Worth who is providing decent health insurance to their employees, and they are in an unfair competitive situation regarding you.
0472	SANDERS	You can compete and maybe charge lower prices, get business, while they on the other hand may be providing decent health insurance.
0473	SANDERS	I don't think that's that...
0474	QUESTION	I think you'll find in profit margin in my entire industry...
0475	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0476	SANDERS	I certainly don't know, you know, about hair salons in Fort Worth.
0477	SANDERS	But I do believe, to be honest with you, that if you have more than 50 people, yes, you should be providing health insurance.
0478	BASH	Senator Cruz?
0479	CRUZ	LaRonda, thank you for sharing your story, and it's good to see
0480	CRUZ	a fellow Texan here.
0481	CRUZ	And, you know, I've got to say, I've got a very different view than Bernie.
0482	CRUZ	I think actually what Bernie told you is the same thing President Obama said, it's the same thing Democrats have said, which is that you, the small business, you're apparently a bad actor, because you're not allowed to manufacture money.
0483	CRUZ	You know, let me introduce you all to two terms that have become really common, 29ers and 49ers.
0484	CRUZ	29ers are the millions of people across this country that have been forced into parttime work that used to have fulltime employment and are now working 29 hours a week because Obamacare kicks in at 30 hours a week.
0485	CRUZ	And a lot of them are people that are single moms, they're teenagers, they're immigrants, they're people who are struggling.
0486	CRUZ	And then 49ers, there are millions of small businesses in the exact situation you're in.
0487	CRUZ	You know, a couple of months ago, I was out in west Texas, was visiting a dairy farmer, driving around the dairy farm.
0488	CRUZ	I got to say, interesting smells on the dairy farm.
0489	CRUZ	Kind of reminds me of Washington.
0490	CRUZ	But the farmer brought up, he said, you know how many employees I have?
0491	CRUZ	I said, no.
0492	CRUZ	He said I've got 49.
0493	CRUZ	He said, do you know why I have 49?
0494	CRUZ	And I said, yes, I do, because Obamacare kicks in at 50.
0495	CRUZ	And he said, I could hire 20 or 30 more employees right now, but Obamacare would bankrupt my business, and that's millions of small businesses.
0496	CRUZ	So we're here at GW.
0497	CRUZ	Let me speak for a minute to all the young people.
0498	CRUZ	When you come out of college with way too many student loans, my guess is you'd like to get a job.
0499	CRUZ	And millions of small businesses being told by the Democrats, tough luck, we don't care if it drives you out of business, that's taking away opportunity and it's hurting in particular the most vulnerable.
0500	CRUZ	It's one of the most damaging things about Obamacare.
0501	BASH	Senator Sanders?
0502	SANDERS	LaRonda, let me ask you a question.
0503	SANDERS	What happens if one of your employees becomes ill?
0504	SANDERS	What happens?
0505	SANDERS	What happens if one of your employees, as happens in every part of the country, gets diabetes, gets cancer?
0506	SANDERS	What do they do if they don't have any health insurance?
0507	QUESTION	I can't really answer that question, but I can tell you that because the premiums have gone up so much this year and because I don't qualify for any kind of government subsidies, I don't have, for the first time in my life, insurance.
0508	QUESTION	It's just not affordable.
0509	QUESTION	Unfortunately, the prices of my services just don't warrant it.
0510	SANDERS	Let me just say this, two things.
0511	SANDERS	Number one, as I mentioned earlier, it is absolutely true that the cost of premiums are going up.
0512	SANDERS	No argument.
0513	SANDERS	They went up even higher during the period of George W.  Bush.
0514	SANDERS	So it's not like, oh, gee, for the first time in American history, premiums are going up.
0515	SANDERS	Number two, Ted mentioned parttime work, the 29ers.
0516	SANDERS	Well, there are fewer parttime employees today than there were before Obamacare, OK?
0517	SANDERS	So here is the point.
0518	SANDERS	The bottom line is with  the situation you've described is honestly absurd.
0519	SANDERS	You should not be going around without health insurance.
0520	SANDERS	Your employees should not be going around without health insurance.
0521	SANDERS	We should not be spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other nation.
0522	SANDERS	Please join me and fight for a Medicare for all program.
0523	SANDERS	Are you looking forward  by the way, I'm not going to ask you your age  won't do that  but are you looking forward maybe when you get to 65 to get Medicare?
0524	SANDERS	Would that be of help to your family?
0525	QUESTION	I expect that that will probably happen.
0526	SANDERS	Good.
0527	SANDERS	Well, I certainly hope it does, and I hope Medicare is still there, despite the efforts of Senator Cruz and others, so that when you reach at least 65, you will be able to get a decent health insurance program.
0528	CRUZ	Well, Bernie, since apparently I've now tried to kill the elderly...
0529	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0530	CRUZ	... let me ask you a question.
0531	CRUZ	When you heard that her premiums had skyrocketed, that she can't afford health insurance, you kind of said, well, premiums always go up.
0532	CRUZ	I mean, let me ask you.
0533	CRUZ	Why did President Obama look in the eyes of the American people and promise LaRonda that her health insurance premiums would go down $2,500 a year?
0534	CRUZ	Was he telling the truth when he said that?
0535	CRUZ	And were you and the other Democrats telling the truth when you echoed his promise to the American people?
0536	SANDERS	Well, Ted, first thought, as everybody knows, health care is pretty complicated.
0537	SANDERS	I think President Obama is an honest person, and I think, based on his assessment, that's what he believed.
0538	CRUZ	Was it true?
0539	SANDERS	But let me  turns out not to be true, but it turns out to be that under Bush premiums went up higher.
0540	SANDERS	Not a new thing.
0541	SANDERS	Then the real question we should be talking about is why we do spend so much money on health care.
0542	SANDERS	And that means that we have to appreciate that we are spending hundreds of billions of dollars every single year not on health care, but on administration and bureaucracy.
0543	SANDERS	Do you know how much money it costs to bill you?
0544	SANDERS	You've got people  hundreds of people in large hospitals, they're sitting around not providing health care, they're working on paperwork, driving you crazy when you bring forth a claim.
0545	SANDERS	So we have to figure out how we have a simple system that guarantees health care to all people.
0546	SANDERS	When we do that, you and your employees will all have health insurance.
0547	CRUZ	Well, there is an area actually where we agree, which is there is way too much paperwork with health care.
0548	CRUZ	There's way too much complexity.
0549	CRUZ	I'll tell you, when you talk to doctors, when you talk to nurses, they say, I don't get to practice health care anymore.
0550	CRUZ	I spend all my time filling out paperwork.
0551	CRUZ	All my time  now, where the paperwork comes from is the government.
0552	CRUZ	It comes from Obamacare.
0553	CRUZ	In fact, there's some amazing stats I'm going to go back and get, because  because they're really quite powerful.
0554	CRUZ	If you look at the paperwork impact, Obamacare's rules alone  and by the way, the Obamacare rules are 20,000 pages.
0555	CRUZ	They're taller than seven feet tall.
0556	CRUZ	They generate $51 billion in costs and more than 172 million hours of paperwork compliance.
0557	CRUZ	And let me put that in perspective.
0558	CRUZ	What does that mean?
0559	CRUZ	That would take 86,200 employees, working fulltime, 2,000 hours a year, to complete one year of new paperwork under Obamacare.
0560	CRUZ	That's roughly the entire population of Miami Beach, Florida, doing nothing but filling out Obamacare forms.
0561	CRUZ	If you want your doctor to get back to caring for you, if you want to drive down costs, get government out of the business of dictating and controlling health care.
0562	SANDERS	Well, Ted is right.
0563	SANDERS	There is far too much paperwork.
0564	SANDERS	Some of it is government.
0565	SANDERS	But you know what some of it is also?
0566	SANDERS	It is insurance companies.
0567	SANDERS	Every American who has filed a claim has the experience of fighting with the health insurance companies to make sure that they get what they are entitled to.
0568	SANDERS	Doctors have to spend half of their lives arguing with the insurance companies as to whether or not they can prescribe the medicine their patients need or provide the therapy that their patients need.
0569	SANDERS	Huge amount of waste.
0570	SANDERS	That is why we need a simple system.
0571	SANDERS	And, as Americans, we're going to have to make a very fundamental decision.
0572	SANDERS	Very simple.
0573	SANDERS	Is health care a right of all people?
0574	SANDERS	Is it or not?
0575	SANDERS	Ted doesn't think it is I do think it is.
0576	SANDERS	And then if we agree, and I think most Americans do, that it is a right, how do you provide health care to all people with high quality in a costeffective way?
0577	SANDERS	I happen to believe that Medicare is a popular program.
0578	SANDERS	It works well.
0579	SANDERS	Right now, you get it at 65.
0580	SANDERS	I think every American should get Medicare.
0581	BASH	Senator Sanders, I want to pick the discussion up right there if I may.
0582	BASH	Senator Cruz...
0583	CRUZ	Yeah, let me make a real quick point, just because I think...
0584	BASH	Real quick.
0585	BASH	Real quick.
0586	CRUZ	It's nice having the back and forth and the...
0587	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0588	BASH	It's lovely, absolutely.
0589	CRUZ	One thing Bernie said that I think suggests maybe an area we could work together, you were talking about paperwork from insurance companies.
0590	CRUZ	I agree, there's way too much paperwork for insurance companies.
0591	CRUZ	I'd like insurance companies to have less power and patients to have more power.
0592	CRUZ	So maybe you and I could agree on a commonsense reform of allowing LaRonda to purchase health insurance of any of the 50 states.
0593	CRUZ	Right now, she's a Texan, it's illegal for her to purchase health insurance anywhere else.
0594	CRUZ	That would give her choice.
0595	CRUZ	If she doesn't like what the Texas companies are offering, she can go to Oklahoma, she can go to Florida, she can go to any other state.
0596	CRUZ	That creates a 50state national marketplace.
0597	CRUZ	It drives down cost.
0598	CRUZ	It increases choices.
0599	CRUZ	Why don't we stand together against the insurance companies and agree on that reform?
0600	SANDERS	Well, I think standing together for a Medicare for all singlepayer system is a lot better idea.
0601	BASH	OK.
0602	SANDERS	Because  OK, because when you have the idea that Ted was talking about, this is a race to the bottom.
0603	SANDERS	And what you are going to end up with, some insurance company in Mississippi or someplace, they're going to provide you insurance.
0604	SANDERS	But you think your deductibles are high now?
0605	SANDERS	It will be a lot higher.
0606	SANDERS	Look, Ted, and you're right.
0607	SANDERS	This is a good discussion, all right?
0608	SANDERS	And here is the issue.
0609	SANDERS	Ted, let me ask you a question.
0610	CRUZ	Sure.
0611	SANDERS	Is every American entitled  and I underline that word  to health care as a right of being an American?
0612	SANDERS	Yes or no?
0613	CRUZ	You know, I'm glad you asked that.
0614	CRUZ	You know, right is a word you use a lot.
0615	CRUZ	Let's talk about what rights are.
0616	CRUZ	Rights mean you have a right for government not to mess with you, for government not to do things with you.
0617	CRUZ	If you look at the Bill of Rights, the Bill of Rights, free speech means the government can't silence you when you're speaking.
0618	CRUZ	Religious liberty means the government can't control who you worship, what your faith is.
0619	CRUZ	The Second Amendment means the government can't take away your guns.
0620	CRUZ	Those are rights.
0621	CRUZ	You know, what the Declaration of Independence said, we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
0622	CRUZ	So what is a right is access to health care.
0623	CRUZ	What is a right is choosing your own doctor.
0624	CRUZ	And if you believe health care is a right, why on Earth did you help write Obamacare that caused six million people to have their health insurance canceled, that had them lose their doctors, and have people like LaRonda, who can't get health insurance, can't afford premiums...
0625	SANDERS	For a start...
0626	CRUZ	You're denying her what you say is her right.
0627	SANDERS	Well, two things.
0628	SANDERS	You didn't answer the question, although I interpret your question to be that LaRonda does not have a right.
0629	CRUZ	No, that's not what I said.
0630	SANDERS	Woah, woah, woah, I heard the Bill of Rights.
0631	CRUZ	What I said is access to health care.
0632	CRUZ	Access to health care is a right.
0633	SANDERS	She has access.
0634	SANDERS	But she doesn't have enough money.
0635	CRUZ	And choosing your doctor is a right.
0636	SANDERS	Look, LaRonda, you have access right now.
0637	SANDERS	Go out and get a really great health insurance program.
0638	SANDERS	Oh, you can't do it?
0639	SANDERS	Because you can't afford it.
0640	SANDERS	All right?
0641	SANDERS	That's what he's saying.
0642	SANDERS	Access to what?
0643	SANDERS	You want to buy one of Donald Trump's mansions?
0644	SANDERS	You have access to do that, as well.
0645	SANDERS	Oh, you can't afford $5 million for a house?
0646	SANDERS	Sorry.
0647	SANDERS	Access doesn't mean a damn thing.
0648	SANDERS	What it means is whether people can afford it, can get the health care that they need.
0649	CRUZ	And they can't under Obamacare.
0650	SANDERS	Second of all, let's  some people have problems, no question about it.
0651	SANDERS	I'm not arguing with you on that, Ted.
0652	SANDERS	But don't argue with me when I tell you that 20 million more people did get health insurance, all right?
0653	SANDERS	We used to have 48 million people in this country who had zero insurance before Obamacare.
0654	SANDERS	Now that number, much too high, is 28 million.
0655	SANDERS	Last point.
0656	SANDERS	Ted talked to the young people, and he said, I want you to go out with enthusiasm, go out and go to  get a job.
0657	SANDERS	He's right.
0658	SANDERS	But under Ted's ideas, if Obamacare is repealed, right now, if you're under 26, you can stay in your parents' insurance program.
0659	SANDERS	That's one of the things we did in Obamacare.
0660	SANDERS	Good idea.
0661	SANDERS	Ted would repeal that.
0662	SANDERS	So as you go out into the real world, be very careful about not having an accident.
0663	BASH	Senators...
0664	SANDERS	Because you don't have any health insurance.
0665	BASH	I want to tell our audience, we're going to take a quick break.
0666	BASH	We have a lot more to discuss.
0667	BASH	More of CNN's debate night and the future of ae Obamacare right after this.
0668	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0669	TAPPER	Welcome back to the CNN health care debate with Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders.
0670	TAPPER	Senators, thanks so much for participating here.
0671	TAPPER	I want to ask you, since Obamacare was enacted, governors of 31 states, plus the District of Columbia, have opted to expand Medicaid through federal funding, providing insurance to 11 million low income people.
0672	TAPPER	One of the Americans who benefitted from the Obamacare Medicaid expansion is Carol Hardaway of Salisbury, Maryland.
0673	TAPPER	Carol?
0674	QUESTION	Thank you.
0675	QUESTION	I have multiple sclerosis, but could not afford insurance.
0676	QUESTION	Without the treatment or medications I need, I had problems with walking, with my speech, and my vision.
0677	QUESTION	When the Affordable Care Act was passed, I moved from our home state of Texas  because they refused to expand Medicaid  to Maryland, and within two weeks, I started receiving treatments through Medicaid and am now well enough to work as a substitute teach.
0678	QUESTION	Senator Cruz, can you promise me that you and the Republican leaders in Congress will have  actually have a replacement plan in place for people like me who depend on their Medicaid?
0679	QUESTION	In other words, I like my coverage.
0680	QUESTION	Can I keep it?
0681	CRUZ	Well, Carol, thank you for sharing your story.
0682	CRUZ	And congratulations on dealing with MS.
0683	CRUZ	It's a terrible disease.
0684	CRUZ	And congratulations on your struggles dealing with it.
0685	CRUZ	You know, if you look at Medicaid, more than half of the people who have been covered under Obamacare have been under Medicaid.
0686	CRUZ	And the problem is  Medicaid is a profoundly troubled program.
0687	CRUZ	And so it may be working well with you, but I'll tell you nationally, the health outcomes under Medicaid are really poor.
0688	CRUZ	Nationally, 54 percent of doctors won't take new Medicaid patients.
0689	CRUZ	Nationally, dental care appointments for moms are denied at a 63 percent rate on Medicaid.
0690	CRUZ	The denial rate for private insurance is 4 percent.
0691	CRUZ	And Medicaid patients are almost twice as likely to die from medical treatment as those with private health insurance.
0692	CRUZ	The solution for people who are hurting, I believe, we should have a system that allows as many people as possible to be on the private health insurance of your choice rather than Medicaid, because the Medicaid outcomes are not working and people are suffering.
0693	CRUZ	And what's happened also  it's really quite striking  because Obamacare dramatically expanded Medicaid, many of the people who had been on Medicaid, many of the people who are really suffering and needy, have found their wait times increasing.
0694	CRUZ	In fact in Illinois, on Medicaid, over 700 people have died on the waiting list for care for Medicaid.
0695	CRUZ	So, I'm glad that you're receiving healthcare.
0696	CRUZ	I can tell you a great many of the people on Medicaid aren't.
0697	CRUZ	And I'd much rather see a system where we can have millions of those on Medicaid getting health insurance.
0698	CRUZ	The only way we can is if we have competition so that rates are lower so you can afford to have health insurance.
0699	JAKE TAPPER, CNN DEBATE MODERATOR	Senator Sanders?
0700	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	We heard from a woman who runs a hair salon in Ft. Worth who can't afford to provide health insurance for her workers and herself.
0701	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	We hear a story now about a woman who has to leave her own state and go to another state because that state is providing Medicaid.
0702	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	My friends, you are living  I know you don't know this  by these stories.
0703	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	You're living in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, where the rich are becoming phenomenally richer while we have 43 million people living in poverty and the middle class is in decline.
0704	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	These stories are obscene.
0705	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	They should not be taking place in the United States.
0706	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	Now, are there problems with Medicaid?
0707	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	Of course, there are.
0708	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	But I will tell you something, to those Republicans governors around the country who told poor people that they would not be able to, for the first time in their lives in many instances, get access to healthcare, to be able to go to a doctor when the federal government paid for the first three years at 100 percent.
0709	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	I hope that those governors sleep well at night, because I don't know how many people lost their lives as a result of their decision.
0710	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	So, once again, what we are looking at is a dysfunctional system.
0711	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	We spend more, we get less.
0712	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	People who work hard have no health insurance.
0713	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	People have to move from one state or the other.
0714	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	This country finally is going to have to do, in my view, what every other major country does.
0715	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	And yes, I believe, Ted, healthcare is a human right.
0716	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	And I believe that this country has got to join every other major country and say, you can stay home and get quality care because you're an American.
0717	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	You can run your small business well and get care because you are an American.
0718	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	That is where we have got to go.
0719	CRUZ	Well, you know, when Bernie says, well, Medicaid has problems.
0720	CRUZ	You want to talk about people who lost their rights, 742 people in Illinois were put on a waiting list for Medicaid after Illinois expanded its Medicaid, Barack Obama's home state, and they died awaiting care under Medicaid.
0721	CRUZ	Why?
0722	CRUZ	Because Medicaid is rationed care.
0723	CRUZ	Those wait lists  you know, Bernie likes to talk about medical care for all.
0724	CRUZ	But let me be clear what his program is.
0725	CRUZ	It's Medicaid for all.
0726	CRUZ	It is rationed care nationally.
0727	CRUZ	You want to know what that looks like.
0728	CRUZ	He keeps pointing to other countries.
0729	CRUZ	Let's look at, for example, the United Kingdom.
0730	CRUZ	The United Kingdom, a 2001 report noted that 39 percent over 80 in the United Kingdom received surgery for breast cancer, compared to 90 percent of the women under 50.
0731	CRUZ	And that women under  men and women under the age of 55 were 2 12 times more likely than those over 75 to receive cancer treatments.
0732	CRUZ	More than 80 percent of older patients in the United Kingdom believe they're discriminated against by their governmentrun healthcare.
0733	CRUZ	You want to know what rationing looks like.
0734	CRUZ	It looks like Medicaid.
0735	CRUZ	It looks like the people who are suffering.
0736	CRUZ	And if you look at this country, across this country, we have 291 million people roughly that are covered by insurance.
0737	CRUZ	I don't think we should be screwing up the insurance of millions of Americans and putting them under rationing.
0738	CRUZ	That's what Obamacare has moved us down the road to doing and it's not working
0739	SANDERS	OK, Ted correctly indicates Medicaid has problems and Vermont has problems.
0740	SANDERS	All over the country, it has problems.
0741	SANDERS	You know what Ted's solution is?
0742	SANDERS	Massive cuts in federal funding for Medicaid.
0743	SANDERS	So, you've got a problem and what Ted wants to do is make it worse.
0744	SANDERS	You mentioned dental care.
0745	SANDERS	Maybe you want to go on my bill, which will provide dental care to tens of millions of American who can't afford it right now.
0746	SANDERS	What we need to do, by the way, is to tell dentists out there that they may have to do more than just make you have a nice smile.
0747	SANDERS	But they may have to provide real dental care to children and others who absolutely need it.
0748	SANDERS	Furthermore, what we have to do is we need tens of thousands more doctors in this country.
0749	SANDERS	We have a major crisis in primary care.
0750	SANDERS	There are areas in urban America and in rural America where people literally can't find a doctor to serve their needs.
0751	SANDERS	And one of the reasons, a number of reasons for that, one of them is you go to medical school, you can come out hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.
0752	SANDERS	And then you're going to become a plastic surgeon not doing primary care in an urban area or rural America, which tells me we've got to expand the program called the National Health Service Corps so that our young people can get their debts repaid if they commit to serving in underserved areas.
0753	SANDERS	Let's get doctors out into the areas where we need them.
0754	TAPPER	Let me just jump in if I can.
0755	TAPPER	Carol, you just shake your head.
0756	TAPPER	Did Senator Cruz, your former senator, did he answer your question?
0757	TAPPER	No, he did not.
0758	TAPPER	The question was, Senator Cruz, can you promise me that you and the Republican leaders in Congress will actually have a replacement plan in place for people like me who depend on their Medicaid?
0759	TAPPER	She got Medicaid through the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid.
0760	TAPPER	We've all heard you criticize Medicaid.
0761	TAPPER	What happens to Carol?
0762	CRUZ	Well, what I said, Jake, is that Medicaid isn't working for millions of people and Obamacare made Medicaid worse by expanding the wait lists by jamming more people on it.
0763	CRUZ	You want to talk about replacement, there's widespread agreement on replacement plans.
0764	CRUZ	Number one, allowing people to purchase across state lines, giving you more choice.
0765	CRUZ	Now, Bernie said he opposes that.
0766	CRUZ	He doesn't want to let you buy insurance in other states.
0767	CRUZ	Number two, expanding health savings accounts so you can save in a tax advantaged way to meet your own healthcare needs.
0768	CRUZ	Number three, making health insurance portable so that it goes with you from job to job.
0769	CRUZ	I imagine, ma'am, at some point, you had insurance with a job?
0770	CRUZ	If insurance was portable right now, federal tax law incentivizes  most of us get our insurance from the government and if you lose your  or not from the government, from our employer rather.
0771	CRUZ	And if you lose your job, you lose that insurance.
0772	CRUZ	One of the best solutions to the problem of preexisting conditions is making health insurance portable that goes with you.
0773	CRUZ	You know, when you lose your job, you don't lose your car insurance, your life insurance, your house insurance.
0774	CRUZ	There's no reason to lose your health insurance.
0775	CRUZ	And if your insurance is portable, it goes with you.
0776	CRUZ	It's affordable.
0777	CRUZ	You have choices.
0778	CRUZ	Now, notice Bernie's solution, we want more doctors.
0779	CRUZ	We all agree on more doctors.
0780	CRUZ	He says, well, the government needs to hire more.
0781	CRUZ	You know, I can point to something that works on that.
0782	CRUZ	In Texas, we passed tort reform.
0783	CRUZ	We fundamentally limited lawsuits and lawsuit abuse.
0784	CRUZ	And you know what we've seen  we've seen the number of doctors increasing dramatically.
0785	CRUZ	We've seen medical malpractice premiums dropping.
0786	CRUZ	Those are the kind of solutions supported at the state level that will result in more doctors.
0787	CRUZ	But Obamacare is discouraging people from going to medical school and training to be doctors.
0788	SANDERS	Well, Ted, I didn't want to raise it, but you brought it forth.
0789	SANDERS	You know what state in the country  and I don't blame you for this  but what state in the country has the highest rate of uninsured in America by far?
0790	SANDERS	It is the state of Texas.
0791	SANDERS	And, by the way, may I say proudly that Vermont is number two in terms of the percentage of people who are insured.
0792	SANDERS	We have relatively few uninsured.
0793	SANDERS	And, by the way, amazingly enough, you know what state in the country has the highest rate of people insured?
0794	SANDERS	It is Massachusetts with RomneyCare, which was the prototype for the Affordable Care Act.
0795	CRUZ	Well, you know, the nice thing, Bernie, again, people vote with their feet.
0796	CRUZ	And for north of a decade now, roughly a thousand people a day have been moving to Texas because we have an environment that allows people to get jobs.
0797	CRUZ	And so, people vote with their feet.
0798	CRUZ	And you're right, there are states, Vermont is a lovely state.
0799	CRUZ	It doesn't have a ton of diversity.
0800	CRUZ	It doesn't have nearly the populations Texas has that are populations that are just starting  when my dad went to Texas in 1957 when he was 18, he couldn't speak English.
0801	CRUZ	He was from Cuba.
0802	CRUZ	He had $100 in his underwear.
0803	CRUZ	He watched dishes making 50 cents an hour.
0804	CRUZ	You know what?
0805	CRUZ	He didn't have healthcare.
0806	CRUZ	But he came to go to the University of Texas, he came to get
0807	CRUZ	opportunity.
0808	CRUZ	That job enabled him to get another job where he could get healthcare.
0809	CRUZ	That's a much better solution.
0810	CRUZ	Create an environment where you don't tax the living daylights out of people.
0811	CRUZ	It's why people choose 
0812	DANA BASH, CNN DEBATE MODERATOR	Senators 
0813	CRUZ	 to be where they get 
0814	BASH	Senators 
0815	SANDERS	Aren't we all happy that under Obama, we created 15 million new jobs in the private sector?
0816	BASH	Senators, I want to get to more audience questions.
0817	BASH	This one is about the fact that the Affordable Care Act requires that all insurance plans cover what the law calls essential health benefits.
0818	BASH	This includes maternity and delivery costs.
0819	BASH	We have a question on what will happen to that coverage for Maria Shahid Rowe, who is pregnant with her second child.
0820	BASH	Maria?
0821	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	Thank you.
0822	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	I'm a nursing student at the Medical University of South Carolina.
0823	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	And I'm concerned about the implications that repealing the Affordable Care Act will have on women's health and specifically for pregnant women.
0824	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	So, I'm five months pregnant and I'm actually qualified for Medicaid due to being a fulltime student.
0825	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	My husband works for a church.
0826	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	We live in a very modest income at the moment.
0827	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	Senator Cruz, what policies do you have in place to protect pregnant women from losing their health coverage either due to being considered having a preexisting condition or from being charged higher insurance premiums than men?
0828	CRUZ	Well, congratulations on your new baby.
0829	CRUZ	Is it a boy or girl?
0830	ROWE	It's a surprise.
0831	CRUZ	Oh, wonderful.
0832	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0833	CRUZ	And you said you have an older child?
0834	CRUZ	What's your older child?
0835	ROWE	We have a 2yearold son.
0836	CRUZ	What's his name?
0837	ROWE	Samson.
0838	CRUZ	Well, maybe you have Delilah and that would be 
0839	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0840	CRUZ	Well, how wonderful and congratulations.
0841	ROWE	Thank you.
0842	CRUZ	Heidi and I have two little girls at home and it is a wonderful, wonderful thing.
0843	CRUZ	Listen, cover  maternity coverage is incredibly important.
0844	CRUZ	But here's how Obamacare worked  you had a lot of politicians in Washington who said we're going to mandate every coverage on Earth.
0845	CRUZ	And it sounds really good.
0846	CRUZ	You know, I had a conversation a couple of years ago with a gentleman in Amarillo, Texas, who told me the story about his 101yearold aunt who had just had her insurance cancelled.
0847	CRUZ	And she said the reason it was cancelled was that it didn't cover maternity care.
0848	CRUZ	Now, this fellow laughed and said, my aunt is 101 years old.
0849	CRUZ	She doesn't really need maternity coverage right now.
0850	CRUZ	We should have a system, I believe, where you can choose to get the policies that meet your needs.
0851	CRUZ	And the impact, especially for young people, of all the mandated coverage  you know, it's interesting the Democrats view  they're big on talking about insurance coverage.
0852	CRUZ	But it's a little bit like giving everyone a bus ticket when there are no buses.
0853	CRUZ	What we should care about is access to healthcare, not just insurance per se.
0854	CRUZ	And what's happened under Obamacare is that millions of people can't afford it.
0855	CRUZ	We should be concerned about people being able to afford health insurance.
0856	CRUZ	And that means giving them the choice in 50 states to choose a policy.
0857	CRUZ	In your instance, you would choose a politician that had maternity coverage.
0858	CRUZ	But someone else who right now kind of can't afford might choose a different policy.
0859	BASH	Senator 
0860	CRUZ	And when government mandates it, those choices go away.
0861	BASH	Senator Sanders, your response?
0862	SANDERS	What Ted is really telling you is that they will not guarantee coverage for you.
0863	SANDERS	And not every pregnancy is planned and if a woman under  a pregnant woman before Obamacare, you know what you were considered to be?
0864	SANDERS	A preexisting condition.
0865	SANDERS	And why would an insurance company want to provide care to you when having a baby is a fairly expensive proposition?
0866	SANDERS	You don't make money doing that.
0867	SANDERS	And Ted keeps talking about these mandates.
0868	SANDERS	So, let's be clear again what Senator Cruz and his Republican friends want to do.
0869	SANDERS	They do not want to guarantee that women who become pregnant will be able to get the healthcare and the prenatal care that they need  which is a terrible thing, by the way, because we have one of the highest infant mortality rates in the industrialized world.
0870	SANDERS	He says to young people who today are on their parents' program  you're out, you're on your own after you leave college.
0871	SANDERS	He says that if you come down with a terrible illness and you're ending up spending hundreds of thousands of dollars, your insurance company can now tell you that there is a limit to what they will pay.
0872	SANDERS	And he is telling 20 million people who gained health insurance under Obamacare  sorry, you're out on the streets.
0873	SANDERS	Bottom line is once again, the discussion, if you really think about the kind of discussion that we're having, it is an absurd discussion for the wealthiest nation in the history of the world.
0874	BASH	Senator Sanders, let me follow up on that.
0875	CRUZ	I want to respond to that briefly.
0876	BASH	Please?
0877	BASH	Go ahead.
0878	CRUZ	You know, it's interesting sometimes the rhetoric that our friends on the left like to say that anyone who doesn't support government control of our healthcare somehow doesn't like and fit in whatever population you're talking about.
0879	CRUZ	But let's again go back to facts and let's talk about young people.
0880	CRUZ	You know, there's no group in America that's been hurt more by Obamacare than young people.
0881	CRUZ	Young people were left on the chopping block.
0882	CRUZ	Let's talk about some basic stats.
0883	CRUZ	A recent study found that the Obamacare mandates, what Bernie just sang an ode to, have increased  the three costliest mandates have increased premiums for younger people by 44 percent.
0884	CRUZ	Without those mandates, the typical 21yearold would pay $1,100 a year less.
0885	CRUZ	If you're 21, think about whether it would be easier to afford healthcare if it cost $1,100 a year less.
0886	CRUZ	And let's talk about some specifics.
0887	CRUZ	Before Obamacare, the most affordable plan that was available for a 30yearold Texan, for a 30 yearold Texan woman was $470 a year.
0888	CRUZ	Today, under Obamacare, the cheapest plan that's available for a healthy 30yearold woman in Ft. Worth is $3,236.
0889	CRUZ	It's gone from $470 to $3,000, over $3,200.
0890	CRUZ	That's why young people are hurting.
0891	CRUZ	And what Obamacare did is it jacked up the rates on all the young people.
0892	CRUZ	Why do you think there's an individual mandate?
0893	CRUZ	It's to force young people to pay really high rates to subsidize the rest of the system.
0894	CRUZ	And if you don't pay it, the IRS fines you.
0895	CRUZ	And, you know, over 6 million people are fined each year by the IRS under Obamacare.
0896	CRUZ	That's who  (CROSSTALK)
0897	BASH	Senator, we're going to get to the question of fines and so forth in a minute.
0898	BASH	But I want to circle back to women's health and ask you, Senator Sanders, why should a 60yearold male or women beyond childbearing years be required to have health insurance plans that have maternity care?
0899	SANDERS	I don't think they should.
0900	BASH	That's what Obama 
0901	SANDERS	That's one of the things we might want to look at.
0902	BASH	OK.
0903	SANDERS	But I do believe that in the United States of America, where we talk a lot about our love for children, that pregnancy is not and should not be considered a preexisting condition.
0904	SANDERS	That every woman in this country who gets pregnant should be 100 percent assured that she is going to get the highest quality care she needs to deliver a healthy baby.
0905	BASH	Senator Cruz, I want to stay on the issue of women's health.
0906	BASH	Under Obamacare, women pay nothing outofpocket for birth control.
0907	BASH	So, will that continue under any Republican replacement?
0908	CRUZ	It's going to be a choice for each patient to make.
0909	CRUZ	Listen, Obamacare is all about these mandates.
0910	CRUZ	And you know, Margaret Thatcher famously said, the problem with socialism, eventually you run out of other people's money.
0911	CRUZ	The same is true with the mandates.
0912	CRUZ	Every mandate, people will say, gosh, I like the  imagine if the federal government mandated that everyone in America must drive a Lamborghini.
0913	CRUZ	I've never driven a Lamborghini.
0914	CRUZ	I mean, they look kind of fun.
0915	CRUZ	But you know what?
0916	CRUZ	I'm willing to bet most of us, if that was the mandate  and it would be cool, you sit in a leather seat, you could go 200 miles an hour, what it would mean for most people is you couldn't afford a car?
0917	CRUZ	If they said, but, you know, gosh, the VW Bug is not fancy enough.
0918	CRUZ	You need everything.
0919	CRUZ	For most people who can't afford it, it doesn't work.
0920	CRUZ	That's what Obamacare is doing.
0921	CRUZ	I would love for everyone to have maximum coverage on everything, but there's no magic fairy with pixie dust that gives it away for free.
0922	CRUZ	These mandates are hurting people because it's putting people in a situation like Rolanda (ph) where they get nothing, they don't get healthcare of any kind.
0923	CRUZ	Her employees don't get healthcare because Obamacare has driven the cost up.
0924	CRUZ	That's why people are hurting so much under it.
0925	SANDERS	Two points.
0926	SANDERS	Our employees are not getting healthcare because in Texas, you did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
0927	CRUZ	No.
0928	CRUZ	She has 49 employees.
0929	CRUZ	She is not covered under it.
0930	CRUZ	She's
0931	CRUZ	not hiring more because 
0932	SANDERS	Lower income people would be eligible for Medicaid.
0933	SANDERS	Second of all, I think that it is very clear that the discussion that we're having when Ted talks about mandates, I look at it differently.
0934	SANDERS	And also, what we should be clear about is Ted says, well, just not enough money, we can't all drive fancy cars.
0935	SANDERS	I think it's a bit disingenuous to talk about driving a fancy car with getting access to healthcare when you're sick.
0936	SANDERS	Last point on this issues, if we repeal the Affordable Care Act, we are going to provide $346 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent.
0937	SANDERS	Ted in other ways goes even further.
0938	SANDERS	He wants to repeal the estate tax which applies to the top 210 of 1 percent, the very wealthiest people in this country, and give them collectively hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks.
0939	SANDERS	Ted, we are the wealthiest country in the world.
0940	SANDERS	And it's not a question of everybody driving a fancy car, but it is a question to making sure that every man, woman and child in this country has healthcare as a right.
0941	TAPPER	I want to bring back to a subject 
0942	CRUZ	Jake, let me respond to that real quickly.
0943	CRUZ	I know this gentleman has a question, but I want to respond 
0944	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0945	TAPPER	 going to talk about the estate tax.
0946	CRUZ	What Bernie said, real quickly, I want to respond to just briefly.
0947	TAPPER	OK.
0948	CRUZ	Which, you know, it was interesting  in the course of the campaign last year, encounter young people all over the country.
0949	CRUZ	There were a lot of young people supported our campaign.
0950	CRUZ	A lot of young people supported Bernie, and I would talk with different people supporting Bernie.
0951	CRUZ	And I'd say to them, typically young people, I'd say, "You know what?
0952	CRUZ	I agree with Bernie."
0953	CRUZ	And they sort of look at me, they'd be startled.
0954	CRUZ	They said, "What are you talking about?"
0955	CRUZ	I said, listen, Bernie talks about how Washington is corrupt, how both parties, how both parties are in bed with big business and big money and it is a corrupt system benefitting special interests.
0956	CRUZ	I agree absolutely and entirely.
0957	CRUZ	And what I tell folks is where I disagree is in his solution.
0958	CRUZ	If the problem is government is corrupt, why on earth would you want more power in Washington?
0959	CRUZ	I want to take power out of Washington and empower the people.
0960	CRUZ	When it comes to taxes, what I want a simple flat tax of 10 percent for everyone and abolish the IRS.
0961	CRUZ	That ends the power of lobbyists.
0962	CRUZ	It ends the power of Washington.
0963	CRUZ	That's a solution empowers the people.
0964	TAPPER	We're going to 
0965	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0966	SANDERS	One second.
0967	SANDERS	In the midst of massive unprecedented income and wealth inequality, Ted's plan according to "Wall Street Journal" would give incredible tax breaks to top 1 percent.
0968	TAPPER	OK, we'll do another  we'll do another town hall debate on tax reform.
0969	CRUZ	Good.
0970	TAPPER	OK?
0971	TAPPER	We're going to take a very quick break.
0972	TAPPER	And when we come back, a subject where there might be some agreement.
0973	TAPPER	The debate continues with Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders in a moment.
0974	TAPPER	Stay with us.
0975	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0976	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0977	TAPPER	Welcome back to the CNN debate on the future of Obamacare.
0978	TAPPER	Let's turn now to the rise in prescription drug costs.
0979	TAPPER	For that, I want to bring in Cole Gelrod.
0980	TAPPER	He comes from Denver, Colorado.
0981	TAPPER	He's a father of two whose daughter Juniper requires medication that would cost $900 a month without Medicaid.
0982	TAPPER	Cole?
0983	COLE GELROD, DAUGHTER HAD HEART TRANSPLANT	Thank you.
0984	COLE GELROD, DAUGHTER HAD HEART TRANSPLANT	My 3yearold daughter born with undiagnosed severe heart defect and required a heart transplant when she was only at 7 months old.
0985	COLE GELROD, DAUGHTER HAD HEART TRANSPLANT	Unfortunately for us and families like ours, our employerprovided insurance does not cover the most vital of my daughter's lifesaving prescriptions.
0986	COLE GELROD, DAUGHTER HAD HEART TRANSPLANT	This luckily hasn't been unbearable financial burden for my family because of Obamacare, and particularly the Medicaid expansion.
0987	COLE GELROD, DAUGHTER HAD HEART TRANSPLANT	Senator Cruz, regardless of what happens with health care reform, how do you plan to address the rising cost of prescription drugs?
0988	COLE GELROD, DAUGHTER HAD HEART TRANSPLANT	Additionally, how would you like to address a healthcare insurance where companies can choose to not cover drugs that people like my daughter need to live?
0989	CRUZ	Well, thank you for the question and thank you for the care you give to your 3yearold daughter.
0990	CRUZ	I know that is not easy.
0991	CRUZ	And the question you ask is one of the great challenges facing this
0992	CRUZ	country as we've seen the cost of drugs increasing dramatically.
0993	CRUZ	One area Bernie and I talked about, we agree on, is allowing importation of drugs into this country from other countries where they are cheaper.
0994	CRUZ	There's no reason why we should be subsidizing other countries across the globe.
0995	CRUZ	But another fundamental area is FDA reform, where the costs of getting a new drug approved are prohibitively expensive.
0996	CRUZ	I don't know if you've ever seen, or folks have ever seen the movie "Dallas Buyers' Club".
0997	CRUZ	It's a wonderful movie with Matthew McConaughey about a gentleman in Texas who had AIDS, and wanted to get drugs to care for and the FDA wouldn't allow it here and he would travel to Mexico, he traveled to Japan, he traveled all over the world trying to get life saving drugs.
0998	CRUZ	There are story after story after story of exactly that happening.
0999	CRUZ	Lifesaving drugs that are available, that are approved.
1000	CRUZ	They're used in Europe.
1001	CRUZ	They're used in Canada, and the FDA won't allow it.
1002	CRUZ	That's why I think FDA reform is so valuable that if we lift the barriers, to let people try, give you a right to try.
1003	CRUZ	If it's your life, you have a right to choose.
1004	CRUZ	You have a right to try.
1005	CRUZ	The key to it is competition.
1006	CRUZ	Listen, the big boys, the big players like government regulation.
1007	CRUZ	DoddFrank benefitted the big banks.
1008	CRUZ	Tough FDA barriers to entry benefit the big pharmaceutical companies.
1009	CRUZ	Massive complexity in tax laws benefits big corporations.
1010	CRUZ	By reducing those barriers, we have competition and there's opportunity.
1011	CRUZ	I believe we can have innovative cures.
1012	CRUZ	To give you a sense, the four most devastating diseases in terms of human life and dollars, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes and cancer.
1013	CRUZ	We ought to be investing everything we can to cure those diseases.
1014	CRUZ	Just curing cancer, an incredible achievement, would save $50 trillion and countless lives across the globe.
1015	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator 
1016	CRUZ	And the FDA is a barrier to doing that.
1017	CRUZ	We need to change them.
1018	TAPPER	Senator Sanders?
1019	SANDERS	Here is the simple issue  we pay  just as the case with health care  we pay by far once again the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
1020	SANDERS	Fifteen years ago, you know what I need?
1021	SANDERS	I took a bus load of women, workingclass women from Vermont dealing with breast cancer across the Canadian border and they were able to purchase Tamoxifen, it's a widely used breast cancer drug, at that point.
1022	SANDERS	It's changed  for 110th the price they're paying in the United States of America.
1023	SANDERS	Tears were coming of these working class women's eyes fighting for their lives.
1024	SANDERS	What's going on?
1025	SANDERS	What's going on is the pharmaceutical industry owns
1026	SANDERS	the United States Congress.
1027	SANDERS	And in all fairness, I will admit, it's not just Republicans.
1028	SANDERS	They have a huge influence over the Democratic Party as well.
1029	SANDERS	So, right now, the reality is uniquely in the whole world, you can walk in tomorrow to the  your pharmacy, the cost that you pay for medicine could be double or triple, and there's nothing anybody can do about it.
1030	SANDERS	So, what do we have to do?
1031	SANDERS	We have to tell the pharmaceutical industry which in 2015 made $50 billion in profit for the five major companies where the top ten executives made over $300 million in compensation, we're going to have to be very loud and clear, and say, stop ripping off the American people.
1032	SANDERS	Two things that we can do immediately  Ted is right.
1033	SANDERS	I introduced and will introduce and look forward to your cosponsorship of legislation to say that pharmacists and distributors and the American people should be able to buy FDAapproved medicine anyplace in the world.
1034	SANDERS	That will drive down prices in this country, because then you'll have international competition.
1035	SANDERS	Second thing we need to do, and I believe, believe it or not, I think even Donald Trump may be on board this, hard to believe, but we should be negotiating drug prices through Medicare.
1036	SANDERS	Medicare spends zillions of dollars for medicines.
1037	SANDERS	Right now Republicans put language in some years ago which prevents them from negotiating prices.
1038	SANDERS	I would hope Ted will join me in saying that Medicare should be able to do what the V.A.
1039	SANDERS	does.
1040	SANDERS	We can lower prices as well.
1041	SANDERS	But the bottom line here is, you've got 1,400 wellpaid lobbyists right now and they are working, if I may say this, they're working against you.
1042	SANDERS	They're working against your daughter.
1043	SANDERS	The only thing they want is more and more profit.
1044	SANDERS	And they could care less about the needs of the American people.
1045	CRUZ	Well, but, Bernie, the barriers are also coming from government.
1046	CRUZ	And I will give an example.
1047	CRUZ	A Texas constituent Kaci Lay (ph) has a 7yearold daughter who was put on a feeding tube when she was 7 months old.
1048	CRUZ	And there's a drug called Domperidone that is used all across the world to treat the condition she has called gastroparesis.
1049	CRUZ	She was put on Domperidone, this 7monthold girl.
1050	CRUZ	She was off the feeding tube.
1051	CRUZ	She was living well.
1052	CRUZ	Domperidone is available in more than 100 countries, including Canada and throughout the European Union.
1053	CRUZ	But the FDA has been aggressively enforcing an import ban here.
1054	CRUZ	And I'll tell you what Kaci's mother said, "I fear she will need to get a feeding tube again.
1055	CRUZ	How do I tell her that?
1056	CRUZ	She's a little girl who has worked extremely hard to overcome her fears of eating and now her joy of just being a normal little girl will be taken away."
1057	CRUZ	We shouldn't have the government putting barriers to people getting the drugs they need.
1058	SANDERS	I think that's a fair point.
1059	SANDERS	I think if you have a product that has been deemed safe by countries that have high standards in this area, I think you make a good point.
1060	SANDERS	But I think the more important point is that the government of the United States representing the American people has got to control the incredible greed of the pharmaceutical industry.
1061	SANDERS	Will you join me?
1062	SANDERS	I do appreciate you coming on board the reimportation.
1063	SANDERS	I really do.
1064	SANDERS	And we can win it if we got Republican support.
1065	SANDERS	Will you stand with me in saying that Medicare which spends a huge amount of money for prescription drugs should be able to negotiate prices?
1066	CRUZ	Oh, listen, of course, Medicare should negotiate.
1067	CRUZ	But you and I have a different view on how you control greed.
1068	SANDERS	Will you be on board that legislation?
1069	CRUZ	Hold on.
1070	CRUZ	Let me finish what I'm saying.
1071	CRUZ	Your view  you said before that, gosh, these executives make too much money.
1072	CRUZ	I don't think the government should be in the business of deciding what you get paid and you get paid and you get paid.
1073	CRUZ	And there are socialist countries on earth.
1074	CRUZ	There are socialist countries that you encourage us to be like.
1075	CRUZ	But those countries are not doing nearly as well as America.
1076	CRUZ	You know, the per capita income in America is over five times the average per capita income in this world.
1077	CRUZ	It's 50 percent more than the per capita income in Europe.
1078	CRUZ	This is a land of opportunity because there is social mobility.
1079	CRUZ	In socialist countries, if you are born poor, you usually stay poor.
1080	CRUZ	The advantage of this country, someone can start out a dishwasher like my dad did and the free enterprise system in this country lets people rise.
1081	CRUZ	So, I don't think the answer is government putting wage and price controls in and deciding 
1082	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1083	BASH	Senator Sanders 
1084	SANDERS	The point was that millions of Americans can't afford the medicine while the drug companies are making incredible profits and paying their CEOs obscene compensation packages.
1085	SANDERS	Yes, that does concern me.
1086	SANDERS	In terms of socialist countries, you think Denmark and Sweden and Finland are terrible places to live.
1087	SANDERS	I think they do pretty well 
1088	CRUZ	I choose to live in America.
1089	BASH	Senator Sanders, let's get back to America and to the Affordable Care Act.
1090	BASH	Throughout your campaign, you said that taxes should go up on the
1091	BASH	rich, not the middle class.
1092	BASH	And yet, millions of Americans who chose not to get health care are forced to pay a tax penalty.
1093	BASH	So, families of four are paying up to $2,000 per year for failing to purchase coverage.
1094	BASH	Many say that they can't afford the premiums, so it's just cheaper for them to pay the penalty than get health care.
1095	BASH	So, is it fair to put this tax burden on families?
1096	SANDERS	No.
1097	SANDERS	It's not.
1098	SANDERS	But on the other hand, is it fair to not raise the revenue that we need to provide the kinds of benefits that we are providing?
1099	SANDERS	That is a way to do it.
1100	SANDERS	I don't think it's a particularly good way.
1101	SANDERS	I disagree with Ted, who wants to give, according to the "Wall Street Journal" and many other publications, incredible tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.
1102	SANDERS	I think in the wealthiest country in the world, we should raise funds in a progressive way, where the very rich are now doing phenomenally well  yes, I do believe they should be asked to pay more in taxes and I think we should use that money and other mechanisms to provide health care to all people.
1103	BASH	Senator, on that very topic, the top 1 percent are paying a lot more in taxes under Obamacare.
1104	BASH	But if you repeal it, will the top 1 percent, the wealthiest Americans effectively get a tax cut?
1105	CRUZ	Well, Dana, let me point out that Bernie acknowledged that 6.5 million Americans are paying Obamacare tax fines because they can't afford insurance.
1106	CRUZ	So, they can't afford health insurance and then the IRS comes in and fines them.
1107	CRUZ	He says, gosh, I don't agree with that.
1108	CRUZ	And yet, throughout the Democratic debate, Bernie says he helped write Obamacare that imposes these fines on people.
1109	CRUZ	I think it's wrong to be fining people.
1110	CRUZ	But let me make a broader point on taxes.
1111	CRUZ	Many times in this debate, Bernie has talked about providing health care for free from the government.
1112	CRUZ	You know what?
1113	CRUZ	The simplest principle in economics is TANSTAAFL, there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.
1114	CRUZ	The liberalleaning Urban Institute scored Bernie's health plan, concluded it would cost $2.5 trillion in the first year and $32 trillion over ten years.
1115	CRUZ	Now, how much that is?
1116	CRUZ	Trillions, it's a big number.
1117	CRUZ	It's not clear what that is.
1118	CRUZ	Let me put it in perspective.
1119	CRUZ	All of the federal income taxes we pay today are about $1.5 trillion a year.
1120	CRUZ	$2.5 trillion means every one of us paying income taxes would have to about triple what you pay in income taxes to get an additional $2.5 trillion.
1121	CRUZ	Now, Bernie no doubt is going to come back and say, no, no, no, none of you are going to pay.
1122	CRUZ	Just the rich.
1123	CRUZ	Well, how about if we took every person that makes over $1 million a
1124	CRUZ	year and confiscated 100 percent of their income, took every penny that they make.
1125	CRUZ	That would raise only enough money to fund Bernie's plan for five months.
1126	CRUZ	Here's another idea.
1127	CRUZ	How about if the government confiscated the assets of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and ExxonMobil, if it came in, illegally seized those companies and sold them, that would pay for one year of Bernie's plan.
1128	CRUZ	If you don't want to see your taxes triple in addition to the wait lists, in addition to the rationing, in addition to fewer MRIs and mammograms to worse care, then you don't want to see Bernie's Medicaid for all.
1129	CRUZ	You want to see cheap, affordable health care that you can choose that puts you in control.
1130	SANDERS	Quote, "Wall Street Journal", October 29th, 2015.
1131	SANDERS	Ted Cruz's  Wall Street Journal," not my paper, your paper, maybe.
1132	CRUZ	Oh, no.
1133	SANDERS	Ted Cruz's new tax plan delivers its biggest benefits to the top 1 percent of U.S. households, adding about onethird to their aftertax income.
1134	SANDERS	Here is the economic reality facing America.
1135	SANDERS	In the last 35 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class and the working class to the top onetenth of 1 percent.
1136	SANDERS	We are talking about trillions of dollars.
1137	SANDERS	Ted's response to that is he's going to support the repeal of the estate tax, correct?
1138	SANDERS	You're on record in doing that.
1139	CRUZ	Among many things.
1140	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1141	SANDERS	Among many other breaks to billionaires.
1142	CRUZ	I don't want to bankrupt small business owners.
1143	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1144	SANDERS	The only people who pay the estate tax are the top two tenths of 1 percent.
1145	SANDERS	It would cost us over $200 billion.
1146	SANDERS	And as Ted said, it goes on and on and on.
1147	SANDERS	So, this right wing hyperbole of we can confiscate everybody  it's not going to do anything.
1148	SANDERS	Here's the basic point if we pass the Sanders plan, 95 percent of people in this country would have more aftertax income than they have right now.
1149	BASH	Senators, I'm sorry.
1150	BASH	It's clear we have a lot more to debate and we can do that at a later time but we have to take a break.
1151	BASH	And when we come back, closing statements about health carry.
1152	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1153	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1154	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1155	TAPPER	Now it's time for closing statements.
1156	TAPPER	Each senator will get two minutes.
1157	TAPPER	We're going to begin with Senator Bernie Sanders.
1158	TAPPER	Senator?
1159	SANDERS	Well, let me thank Ted for being here.
1160	SANDERS	Let me thank CNN for sponsoring this debate which I thought has been a very interesting discussion.
1161	SANDERS	As I see it, the great political problem that we face right now is that we have a Congress that is more interested in representing their campaign contributors and the very wealthy than the needs of ordinary Americans.
1162	SANDERS	Ted ran a very vigorous campaign for president.
1163	SANDERS	I congratulate him.
1164	SANDERS	But Ted also received $36 million in their campaign from three billionaires, three billionaires.
1165	SANDERS	And as a result of Citizens United, we are now looking at the Koch brothers, the second wealthiest family in America, and other billionaires literally buying elections.
1166	SANDERS	And that translates into health care policy because the end result is that Congress worries more about the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry and the medical equipment suppliers than they do about the needs of the American people.
1167	SANDERS	If you listen closely to the very fine questions that people here asked tonight, and you take a step backward, you say whoa, what kind of craziness is this?
1168	SANDERS	We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world and yet we have tens and tens and tens of millions of people struggling with prescription drugs, struggling with basic health care.
1169	SANDERS	Yes, we can do better than that.
1170	SANDERS	And then on top of all of that, we end up spending almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.
1171	SANDERS	Now, what Ted is proposing is to make a difficult situation even worse.
1172	SANDERS	To my mind, Obamacare is a step forward.
1173	SANDERS	We have got to go further.
1174	SANDERS	But what Ted wants to do is do away with many of the patient protection bills, provisions, that were passed, preexisting conditions, a cap on what you have to pay, making sure that women are not discriminated against, making sure that young people can stay on their parents' insurance programs.
1175	SANDERS	Under Ted's idea, all of that is gone.
1176	SANDERS	You are on your own.
1177	SANDERS	I think that is a very bad idea.
1178	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
1179	TAPPER	Senator Cruz?
1180	CRUZ	I want to thank Bernie for being here and for being a vigorous and honest debater.
1181	CRUZ	He believes what he believes and he represents it well.
1182	CRUZ	And I want to thank each much you for spending so much time addressing this critically important issue.
1183	CRUZ	You know, I'd like to take a minute and ask the people if the cameras could turn for a moment to the folks in the audience, I want to ask you how many of you here in the last six years have seen your health insurance premiums or your deductibles go up?
1184	CRUZ	Let me ask another question.
1185	CRUZ	How many of you here know somebody including yourself who has had your insurance policy canceled in the last six years?
1186	CRUZ	If you look at these hands across the room, this is why people are so unhappy with Obamacare, because it isn't working, because it was built on an edifice of lies.
1187	CRUZ	When politicians promise the American people, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, and 6 million people get their plans canceled against their wishes, those are broken promises.
1188	CRUZ	When the president of the United States promises your premiums will drop $2,500 and instead, the average premium rises $5,000 and deductibles go up $5,000, people are hurting because of Obamacare.
1189	CRUZ	And Bernie's solution  you know, I'm reminded of an old "Saturday Night Live" skit with Christopher Walken where they are playing in a band and he keeps ringing the cow bell.
1190	CRUZ	And every team they recorded his solution is more cow bell, more cow bell.
1191	CRUZ	It was government control that messed this all up.
1192	CRUZ	And Bernie and the Democrats' solution is more cow bell, more cow bell.
1193	CRUZ	Yes, it didn't work when we said you wouldn't get your plan canceled.
1194	CRUZ	Yes, it didn't work when we said your premiums would be cut.
1195	CRUZ	But give government even more power.
1196	CRUZ	We can do better.
1197	CRUZ	I believe we are going to honor the promises we made to the American people and we are going to repeal what Bill Clinton called Obamacare the craziest law in the world.
1198	CRUZ	Instead, we're going to give you choice, let you buy insurance across state lines, expand health savings accounts, make insurance portable, block grant Medicaid to the states so you can have experimentation, health savings accounts so we can meet your need, put you in charge of your health care with your doctor, not government.
1199	CRUZ	That's what this election was about, and now, it is incumbent on all of us, Republicans and Democrats, to deliver on the promises made to the American people.
1200	TAPPER	Our thanks to Senator Cruz and Senator Sanders for joining us here tonight.
1201	BASH	And we also want to thank our audience here, our hosts at my alma mater, the George Washington University.
