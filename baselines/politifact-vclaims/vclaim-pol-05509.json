We decided to take a new look through the lens of the latest available data.\nWar casualties\nThe most comprehensive list we found on U.S. war dead was compiled in January 2015 by the Congressional Research Service. It included casualties from the Revolutionary War through Operation Inherent Resolve, which is targeting the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria.\nThe number of U.S. dead in all those conflicts comes to nearly 1.2 million, according to the research service.\nWe should add a qualifier here: The research service says that during the Civil War, the nation\u2019s deadliest conflict, Union and Confederate losses combined were 525,000 to 530,000. But a 2012 study by a Binghamton University historian estimated the combined toll was much higher -- about 750,000.\nIf we use that higher Civil War figure, it would bring the total U.S. deaths in military conflicts to about 1.4 million.\nGun deaths\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a series of hard figures and estimates of yearly gunfire deaths in the U.S. from 1968 to 2014. They add up to about 1.5 million fatalities.\nThe Virginia Center for Public Safety\u2019s claim on gun deaths goes back a little bit further, to 1963. \u00a0We couldn\u2019t find figures going back to that year, since the oldest year for which data were available was 1968. A CDC chart shows 24,000 gun deaths occurred that year.\nWith that in mind, the figure of 1.5 million deaths since November 1963 surely is an underestimate of the level of gun violence since then, because it excludes four years. The actual number probably is close to 1.6 million.\nA key thing to know about these figures: They include not just murders but all gun deaths. In 2013, according to CDC data, 63 percent of gun deaths were suicides; 33 percent were homicides; and the rest were from accidents, legal interventions and undetermined causes.\nOur ruling\nThe Virginia Center for Public Safety says that since 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire than have been killed in all U.S. wars.\nFigures going back to 1968 show about 1.5 million firearms deaths have occurred since then. That doesn\u2019t include data from gun deaths from 1963 to 1967, years for which figures aren\u2019t available, so this is a conservative estimate on firearms deaths since Kennedy was assassinated.\nIn contrast, a high-side figure for U.S. war deaths shows that about 1.4 million service members have been killed in conflicts.\nSo we rate the claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05509"}
