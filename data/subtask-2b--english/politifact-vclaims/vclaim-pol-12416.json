We began by turning to the bill itself.\n\nThe provision in question follows news reports that some companies have rejected unemployed job applicants out of hand as a way of filtering the large numbers of job resumes they\u2019re receiving. In some cases, companies even made it clear in advertisements that they would not consider applicants who were unemployed.\n\nSince unemployment levels have remained stuck for months at near post-Great Depression highs, such practices posed a challenge for an administration that desperately wants to boost employment. So the bill states the overarching position that \"denial of employment opportunities to individuals because of their status as unemployed is discriminatory.\"\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits employers from publishing help-wanted ads that disqualify people who are unemployed, and bars employers from failing to consider or hire an individual \"because of the individual's status as unemployed.\" The bill places similar restrictions on employment agencies.\n\nAs for enforcement of the new provision, the bill says that \"a court of the United States shall have the same jurisdiction and powers as the court has to enforce ... Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" -- the landmark provision that bans employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.\n\nAn individual who seeks redress through the courts, the bill says, \"may be awarded, as appropriate\" an order to employers to stop the prohibited practices, \"reimbursement of costs expended as a result of the unlawful employment practice,\" damages up to $1,000 for each day of the violation, and \"reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\"\n\nLynne Bernabei, a Washington employment lawyer best known for representing whistleblowers, agreed that Hannity described the law accurately, though she said that individuals suing under the new provisions -- if they are ultimately enacted as written -- will still face a steep climb in the courts before they secure any compensation.\n\n\"Any individual suing under this law has to prove that he was discriminated against because he was unemployed,\" Bernabei said. \"Discrimination is always difficult to prove, and it wouldn't be any easier to prove in this context.\"\n\nBut Hannity didn\u2019t suggest that plaintiffs would somehow be assured of winning in court; he simply said that they would have the opportunity to sue. We rate Hannity\u2019s statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12416"}
