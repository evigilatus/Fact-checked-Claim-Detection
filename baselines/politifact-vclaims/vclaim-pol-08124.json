Nathan Deal has two Republicans, one Democrat and one Libertarian running against him. His initial re-election strategy: tell voters that he\u2019s the \"real Deal\" in the race and the candidate who has produced \"real results.\"\nIn a recent campaign flier, Deal cites one of those \"real results.\" Georgia, the flier points out, is ranked as the state with the \"lowest taxes per capita\" \u00a0by the nonpartisan, Washington-based Tax Foundation\nThe campaign accurately quotes the Tax Foundation\u2019s latest published report. It has Georgia at 50th out of 50, with state tax collections averaging $1,639 per person, well below the national average of $2,441 and far below No. 1, Alaska at $7,708 per person.\nBut is that something that Deal can take credit for? PolitiFact Georgia decided to look further.\nThe foundation\u2019s report was published in 2013. But it was based on state tax collections for the fiscal year that runs from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2011.\nDeal only became governor Jan. 10, 2011. He was in office less than six months during the period that was the basis for the foundation\u2019s rankings.\nWe asked Jen Talaber, the communications director at Deal for Governor, to provide evidence that Deal, in fewer than six months, had influenced the state\u2019s ranking and could claim that as \u00a0one of the \"real results\" of his term.\nShe made three points. First, one of his early executive orders put a freeze on the gas tax. Second, he could have adjusted the tax rate or allowed agencies to implement something like a tobacco tax, but did not. Lastly, the governor controlled his revenue estimate in the amended budget for Fiscal Year 2011 to limit state spending and rebuild the state\u2019s reserves, or savings.\n\"We don\u2019t\u2019 take credit for anything we haven\u2019t done,\" Talaber said in an email. \"This is about now and the future. We think it\u2019s a good thing that we have the lowest tax burden, and we\u2019ll fight to keep it that way.\"\nOur research confirmed that Deal signed an executive order freezing the state gas tax.That stopped a scheduled 1.6 cent-per-gallon tax increase that was forecast to collectively cost motorists $40 million. But the freeze took effect July 1, 2011, and had no impact on state tax collections in the fiscal year ending one day earlier, on June 30, 2011.\nTo the second point, that\u2019s a tougher one. It\u2019s hard to say how something the governor didn\u2019t do affected state tax collections. Some type of tax increases are regularly floated during the annual sessions of the General Assembly. But such proposals can go nowhere and likely wouldn\u2019t have in a year when the state and Georgians were still struggling to dig out from the crippling economic downturn. Even if a tax increase or tax cut had been pushed by Deal, it\u2019s very unlikely that it would have affected Fiscal Year 2011 tax collections, longtime Capitol observers say.\nTo address the third point, we turned to Teresa MacCartney, director of the Governor\u2019s Office of Planning and Budget. She said the governor lowered the general fund revenue estimate for the amended 2011 budget by $27.7 million. \u00a0\n\"The reduction in estimated general fund revenues supported the governor\u2019s position of not introducing nor supporting any proposed tax increases during the 2011 legislative session,\" MacCartney said.\nThe governor\u2019s conservative revenue estimates allowed the state to build up its revenue shortfall reserve by $212 million, a 183 percent increase over the previous year\u2019s balance, she said.\nBut rebuilding reserves wouldn\u2019t have changed the per-person state tax collections in Fiscal 2011.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorton Francis, a senior research associate with the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, and Alan Essig, executive director of the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said Georgia\u2019s ranking as 50th in state tax collections is the result of the tough economy more than anything.\n\"It had nothing to do with anything the governor did or the General Assembly did,\" Essig said. \"It had to do with the nature of the economy and the nature of the impact of the recession, which hit Georgia harder than other states, comparatively, because of housing, our economy and all of that.\"\nFrancis, who specializes in state and local finance issues, including tax policy and revenue estimating, said it\u2019s simple logic.\n\"If your population continues to grow and your income goes down, your taxes per capita are going down,\" he said.\nBoth point to the Tax Foundation\u2019s rankings as evidence that Georgia has traditionally been a low tax state.\nGeorgia was 42nd in the Tax Foundation\u2019s rankings for per-capita state tax collections in Fiscal 2007. As the recession hit, it sank to 45th in Fiscal 2008, 48th in Fiscal 2009 and to 49th in Fiscal 2010.The state\u2019s ranking fell to 50th in FY 2011, the first year of Deal\u2019s term, even though tax collections actually increased to $1,639 per person from $1,529 in FY 2010, according to the Tax Foundation\u2019s website.\n\"If the governor is bragging (about Georgia being ranked 50th), then he has to take responsibility for the outcome -- and that\u2019s the shortfall in funding for education, one of the highest numbers of uninsured and the critical condition of child welfare services,\" Essig said. \"You can\u2019t have it both ways.\"\nDeal\u2019s only Democratic opponent, Sen. Jason Carter of Atlanta, brought up the same data last year. He was saying that Georgia is fostering a smaller state government but at the same time relying heavily on federal funds. PolitiFact ruled his calculations were slightly off but his claim was mostly true.\nThere\u2019s one more piece of data. We contacted officials at the Tax Foundation to confirm that the FY 2011 rankings on their website were the latest available. They said their report for 2014, which is based on new data from FY 2012, the first full year of Deal\u2019s administration, is due out in a week or two. It shows Georgia rising one spot to 49th in per capita tax collections. Additionally, it shows state tax collections up $41 per person, to $1,680.\nSo where are we in truth-testing the campaign claim that Deal deserves credit for Georgia having \"the lowest taxes per capita of any state?\"\nWe don\u2019t know how to answer the argument that he could have adjusted the tax rate or allowed agencies to implement something like a tobacco tax. As the campaign points out, he did neither.\nBut we find no other evidence that in Deal\u2019s first six months in office, he had any impact on the state\u2019s ranking on sales tax collections per capita.\nThe campaign\u2019s overarching point seems to be that Georgia has low per capita taxes under Deal. That is true. But it also had low taxes under his predecessor. Under the latest ranking, Georgia is still near the bottom, but it will move up a notch to 49th-lowest.\nDeal\u2019s campaign has a point. But a lot of context is needed to fully understand the claim.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\n\u00a0\n-", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08124"}
