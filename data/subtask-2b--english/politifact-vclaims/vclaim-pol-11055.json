Each broken promise shatters the glass with a stomach-churning crunch.\n\n\"President Obama\u2019s agenda promised so much,\" the ad says, then launches into a litany of broken promises.\n\nOne promise is about health insurance: The ad shows Obama saying, \"If you like your health care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health care plan.\"\n\n\"Broken,\" the ad\u2019s narrator says. \"Millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll fact-check the ad\u2019s other claims in separate reports. Here, we\u2019ll look at people losing their health care.\n\nHere at PolitiFact, we consider ourselves experts on the president\u2019s campaign promises. Our Obameter tracks more than 500 campaign promises Obama made during the 2008 campaign, including many promises about health care.\n\nObama\u2019s promise\n\nObama often said during his 2008 campaign for president that if people liked their health insurance, they wouldn\u2019t have to change it under his proposal, and he continued to say it as president.\n\n\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,\" he said at a 2009 town hall meeting.\n\nWhat Obama was talking about was the way his plan left in place the current health care system in the United States. Instead of completely revamping the system, Obama\u2019s plan put more regulations on insurance companies, and it offered subsidies to coverage for the uninsured so they could either buy insurance on their own or sign up for the existing program of Medicaid. Most significantly, his plan left in place both Medicare for seniors and employer-provided insurance for workers.\n\nThe problem with the promise, though, was that some of Obama\u2019s regulations will change how health insurance companies offer plans. It\u2019s also likely it will change the decisions employers make about health coverage, at least to some extent.\n\nSome workers might see improved coverage, while others see more expensive coverage. Some might see major changes, while others might see trivial changes. In many cases, Obama\u2019s law beefs up requirements on insurance companies.\n\nOn the whole, we rated Obama\u2019s statement Half True.\n\nHaving said that, the health care law that Obama signed looks a lot like what he promised on the campaign trail. It leaves in place employer-provided insurance and Medicare. It puts new regulations on health insurance companies. It offers assistance to the poor and people of modest means to obtain coverage.

The Hill is a newspaper that covers Washington and Congress.\n\nWhen we dug into this claim, we found The Hill\u2019s coverage referred to a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office, a respected independent agency that conducts economic analysis of pending and existing law.\n\nHere\u2019s how The Hill described the CBO report:\n\nAs many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-provided coverage because of President Obama's healthcare reform law, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a new report Thursday.\n\nThe figure represents the worst-case scenario, CBO says, and the law could just as well increase the number of people with employer-based coverage by 3 million in 2019.\n\nThe best estimate, subject to a \"tremendous amount of uncertainty,\" is that about 3 million to 5 million fewer people will obtain coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked into the CBO report ourselves for other fact-checks.\n\nCBO and other independent groups project that the number of uninsured will actually decrease because of the health care law. Estimates vary, but the CBO has projected that between 29 million to 31 million uninsured Americans will gain access to coverage.\n\nThe law will cause some shifting around of how people get their insurance, though. That\u2019s what the CBO report documents. Many of those people that leave employer-provided insurance would get coverage some other way, such as buying it on their own with help from a government subsidy. (Read a more detailed analysis of the CBO report here.) Actually, some of those people will prefer to buy insurance on their own in order to get health insurance that better suits their particular preferences.\n\nSignificantly, the Crossroads ad doesn\u2019t mention any of those specifics. Its point seems to be simply that a lot of people will lose coverage. This is deeply misleading, because the law will increase the number of people who have coverage.\n\nThen there\u2019s the part of the claim that says millions would be \"forced into a government pool.\" We couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of this sentiment, but Crossroads responded to our questions by saying that people who buy insurance on their own are being \"forced into a government pool.\"\n\nThe exchanges are new virtual marketplaces where people who buy insurance on their own will be able to comparison shop for plans. And technically speaking, this is a pool, because people who buy on the exchange will be able to buy plans regardless of any pre-existing health conditions.\n\nUnder the terms of the plan, some of the people will be buying insurance with a government subsidy, but some will be buying with their own money. But they\u2019ll be buying plans from private insurance companies, to be treated by non-government doctors and hospitals.\n\nGiven the contours of the health care debate over the past two years, the ad seems like it\u2019s trying to confuse people into thinking they\u2019ll be signed up for a government-run health plan like Medicare. That\u2019s actually not the case.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Crossroads ad says Obama \"promised\" people could keep their health plans, but \"millions could lose their health care coverage and be forced into a government pool.\"\n\nActually, Obama\u2019s plan leaves the existing health system largely in place. And \"millions\" of uninsured will actually gain coverage, according to independent analysis.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s no option for a government-run health care option under the new health insurance exchanges. The term \"government pool\" seems aimed at confusing this issue.\n\nIn fact, the health care plan Obama promised on the campaign trail looks an awful lot like what was put into law: Leave the existing health care system in place, beef up regulations on insurance companies, and offer assistance to the uninsured to help them sign up for health coverage.\n\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11055"}
