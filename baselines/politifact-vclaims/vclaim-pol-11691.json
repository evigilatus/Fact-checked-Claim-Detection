Stegmaier wants folks to know he oversees a lean government.\n\n\"Chesterfield has eliminated more positions from its general government operations than the Commonwealth has from the entire state government since (fiscal) 2009,\" Stegmaier said in an outline of a Dec. 14, 2011 speech he made to the Chesterfield Chamber of Commerce.\n\nWe were struck by this statement. The state government has 33 full-time equivalent workers for every one in Chesterfield\u2019s central government. Is it true that the county, in raw numbers, eliminated more jobs than the much larger state?\n\nWe ran a check.\n\nChesterfield\u2019s general government operations include workers in all services except education. Stegmaier said that if education was included, the numbers would only grow in Chesterfield\u2019s favor since the county has trimmed employment in that department as well.\n\nStegmaier, to support his claim that Chesterfield\u2019s central government has shed more jobs than the state, pointed us to two sets of statistics.\n\nHe cited county budgets that detail Chesterfield\u2019s authorized full-time employment levels in general government. In fiscal 2009, there were 3,697 authorized jobs. In fiscal 2012, which ends June 30, there were 3,516 such positions. That\u2019s a decrease of 181 approved jobs.\n\nFor state figures, Stegmaier relied on data from Virginia\u2019s Department of Planning and Budget that detail authorized employment levels for all agencies. The state lists the number of employees as \"full time equivalents\" -- a figure that lumps together full-time and part-time employees. That\u2019s why the overall number ends in a decimal.\n\nIn fiscal 2009, the state had a maximum employment level 114,724.44 jobs. This fiscal year, the maximum is set at 114,566.73.\n\nSo the state\u2019s drop of about 157 authorized employees falls 24 short of Chesterfield\u2019s reduction.\n\nBut we had some issues with Stegmaier\u2019s proof. He had not made an apples-to-apples comparison because Chesterfield only tallied full-time employees while the state counted full-timers and part-timers.\n\nAlso, the state and county numbers Stegmaier compared are maximum employment levels in budgets. Not all of those jobs were filled.\n\nWe think the acid test for Stegmaier\u2019s statement is measuring the change in the number of people who actually worked for Chesterfield County and the state. \u00a0\n\nWe turned to the Virginia Department of Human Resource Management\u2019s website, which lists the number of state employees for any given month over the past 21 years.\n\nOn June 30, 2009 -- the end of fiscal 2009 -- , the state had 119,850.81 full-time equivalent employees. By Oct. 31, 2011, the latest date for which statistics were available, the number \u00a0rose to 120,465.97. The state had gained 615.16 full-time equivalent workers.\n\nThen we turned to Chesterfield. Matt Harris, the county\u2019s senior budget analyst, told us Chesterfield had 3,816 full-time equivalent employees on July 1, 2009. The number dropped to 3,664 on Nov. 1, 2011. The county lost 152 full-time equivalent workers.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nNo matter which set of numbers you use, Chesterfield has eliminated more jobs from its general government operations than Virginia has from its entire state government since fiscal 2009.\n\nWe rate Stegmaier\u2019s claim True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11691"}
