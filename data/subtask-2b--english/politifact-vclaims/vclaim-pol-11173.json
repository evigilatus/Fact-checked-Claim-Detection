Our students will not be as successful if we don\u2019t have the best and brightest in those classrooms.\"\n\nWe wondered whether URI\u2019s salaries are really that low relative to other public higher education institutions. If they are, Dooley\u2019s contention that the salaries make URI less attractive to prospective faculty members makes sense.\n\nWhile waiting for the university\u2019s media relations department to get back to us on the source of Dooley\u2019s claim, we searched for information and data.\n\n\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education, a news source about colleges and universities, maintains a salary database on its website based on annual surveys by the American Association of University Professors, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe AAUP\u2019s most recent survey, for the 2011-12 fiscal year, collected salary information for 1,251 higher education institutions around the country. The survey broke down the average salaries by position: full professor, associate professor, assistant professor, and, where applicable, instructor.\n\nAccording to the survey, the national average for full professors is $113,176; for associate professors, it\u2019s $78,565; for assistant professors, $66,564; and instructors, $47,847.\n\nAt the University of Rhode Island, the average for full professors is $105,200; for associate professors, it\u2019s $78,900; for assistant professors, the number is $65,800; and for instructors, it\u2019s $58,600.\n\nTo be clear, in his statement, Dooley was comparing URI with the other flagship state universities in New England. This is a small group that excludes private institutions and smaller public colleges, such as Rhode Island College and the Community College of Rhode Island.\n\nBesides URI, the list includes the University of Connecticut, the University of Massachusetts system, the University of New Hampshire, the University of Vermont and the University of Maine.\n\nAccording to the Chronicle database, UConn, the four UMass campuses and the University of Vermont all had higher average salaries for each teaching level than URI. The University of Maine\u2019s average salaries were all lower.\n\nData for the University of New Hampshire was missing from the 2011-12 survey. A spokeswoman for the AAUP told us UNH did not respond to a request for salary information. \n\nWhen we called UNH, a spokeswoman said the faculty union may not have provided the information because it\u2019s in the midst of a contract dispute with the university and is working under the terms of an expired contract. Erika Mantz, director of media relations, gave us the current average salaries for UNH faculty.\n\nIn summary, these are the average salaries for full professors at each institution in order from highest to lowest: UConn ($139,100), UMass Amherst ($122,600), UMass Lowell ($120,100), UNH ($115,800), UMass Boston ($115,700), UMass Dartmouth ($111,200), the University of Vermont ($113,800), URI ($105,200) and the University of Maine ($95,000). \n\nSo URI does indeed rank second from the bottom in the region. And for each of the other categories, it occupies the same place.\n\nWhen David Lavallee, a spokesman for URI, got back to us, he provided data that the provost\u2019s office took from the 2010-11 AAUP salary survey. We confirmed that in that year, URI also had the second-lowest average salaries in New England.\n\nOur ruling\n\nDooley said that faculty salaries at URI are the lowest among public universities in New England except for the University of Maine. According to a national survey, he\u2019s correct.\n\nMoreover, although salaries for lower-level faculty at URI are comparable to national averages or better, salaries for full professors are 7 percent lower than the national average.\n\nWe rate Dooley\u2019s statement True.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.
