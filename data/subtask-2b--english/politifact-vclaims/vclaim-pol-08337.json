Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled. The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by - let alone get ahead.

(We also looked at the changes between 2009 and 2012, since either date range seems a plausible \"four-year\" period to us, and the numbers were similar..)\nHowever, this raw wage data doesn\u2019t take into account inflation -- something economists like to consider when determining whether a wage \"barely budged.\"\nWhen you use an inflation calculator, the average wage from 2008 was equivalent to $45,075 in 2012 dollars, meaning that the inflation-adjusted wage rose during that period, but only narrowly -- about 1.6 percent.\nBy this data, Obama is correct.\n\u2022 The Social Security Administration's National Average Wage Index\nThese are the numbers used to calculate Social Security recipients\u2019 benefit levels. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nNational average wage\n\n\nIn 2012 dollars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n$41,335\n\n\n$44,079\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n$40,712\n\n\n$43,569\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n$41,674\n\n\n$43,879\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n$42,980\n\n\n$43,869\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n$44,322\n\n\n$44,322\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAccording to this data set, the average annual wage increased by 7.2 percent between 2008 and 2012.\nAfter you adjust for inflation, the average wage from 2008 was $44,079 in 2012 dollars. So from 2008-12, the inflation-adjusted wage rose by less than 1 percent.\nWhichever data you use, the increases are pretty modest, particularly given that they were spread out over a four-year period.\nOur ruling\nObama said that during the past four years, \"average wages have barely budged.\"\nTwo federal data sets broadly agree: Over the most recent four-year period, the average wage has risen no more than 1.7 percent above inflation. That\u2019s a rising wage -- but by a small amount, about a half a percentage point above inflation per year. We think that\u2019s a reasonable definition for \"barely budged.\" So we rate Obama\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08337"}
