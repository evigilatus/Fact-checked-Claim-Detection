Walker's claim that state DOT is ahead of the game", "text": "Given the perpetual orange barrels and accompanying traffic delays on Milwaukee area highways, drivers could be forgiven if they pounded the steering wheel after a recent tweet from Gov. Scott Walker.\n\"Road projects across the state are staying on track or getting done sooner thanks to the good work of the team at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation,\" the governor tweeted Dec. 18, 2017.\nResponses from the Twitterverse showed not everyone was in the same lane:\n\"Apparently the 94/45 interchange isn\u2019t part of the state.\"\n\"#WI: worst roads between the Rockies and Atlantic Ocean\"\n\"When is that zoo interchange supposed to be done again? 2018? 2019? 2020? . . . and counting.\"\nLet\u2019s give this one a spin.\nWalker\u2019s evidence\nWalker communications director Tom Evenson noted the governor\u2019s tweet directly followed the announcement that the State Highway 441 project in the Fox Valley will be finishing in 2019, a year ahead of the previous expected date.\n\"By combining projects on the WIS 441 project into a larger package for construction to bid, WisDOT anticipates more competitive bids, greater contractor efficiencies during construction and estimated saving of $9 million in project costs,\" Evenson said in an email.\nIn addition, Evenson said, in April 2017, the governor announced that the Transportation Department freed up more than $100 million for additional projects to be advanced.\nThis was a result, he said, of $65 million in savings over the course of the state fiscal year \u2013 due to lower gas prices and more competitive bids -- and an additional $38 million in available revenues to add to the Transportation Fund\u2019s FY18 opening balance.\nRebecca Kikkert, director of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation Office of Public Affairs, \u00a0pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to an April 13, 2017, state DOT announcement of the $38 million savings.\n\"With let savings, WisDOT is able to do additional projects and move scheduled projects ahead advancing them, which enables the completion date for these projects to move ahead and get completed sooner,\" Kikkert said in an email.\nPutting on the brakes\nCraig Thompson, executive director of the Transportation Development Association of Wisconsin, a Madison-based group with a primary mission of outreach to the public, media, and decision-makers about the importance of an integrated transportation network, didn\u2019t disagree with the evidence the Walker administration provided.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Thompson cited a list of delayed projects, with several major ones among them:\n\n\nI-94 North-South between Kenosha and the Mitchell Interchange. Original scheduled completion: 2016. The completion date if the state receives an applied-for $246 million federal grant: 2021. The completion date without the federal grant: 2032. The state is still waiting to hear whether it will receive all, some or none of its request.\n\n\nI-94 East-West. The safety and congestion problems that prompted state transportation officials to plan the reconstruction and widening of I-94 between 16th and 70th streets in Milwaukee will not be dealt with now that the project has been abandoned.\n\n\nI-43 North-South (Silver Spring Drive. to Wis. 60), Glendale to Grafton - Milwaukee and Ozaukee counties. \"This project has been put on hold until further notice,\" according to an October 2015 announcement on the Wisconsin Department of Transportation website.\n\n\nI-94 between U.S. Highway 12 and State Highway 65 (St. Croix County). Work on the federally-designated truck route between the Twin Cities and St. Croix County was included in the 2017-'19 budget by lawmakers, but vetoed by Walker.\n\n\nTo be sure, Walker\u2019s team highlighted cases where -- once contracts have been issued -- work was completed earlier than expected, while Thompson noted delayed by broader funding issues.\nThat said, Walker\u2019s tweet did not make such a distinction clear. It was a broad claim. And -- as many of the Twitter responses indicated -- \u00a0that\u2019s how many people understood it.\nEx-DOT secretary waved caution flag\nThen-DOT Secretary Mark Gottlieb told state lawmakers at a December 2016 hearing that the conditions of Wisconsin\u2019s highways would worsen if funding trends continue.\nUnder Walker\u2019s budget at the time, 21 percent of Wisconsin\u2019s highway system was projected to be in poor condition by 2018, he said. By 2027, that number would grow to 42 percent.\nGottlieb had at times called for increasing taxes and fees to pay for highways. Walker has said he won\u2019t raise gas taxes or vehicle fees unless an equivalent cut is made in other taxes.\nGottlieb stepped down less than a month after he told lawmakers Wisconsin\u2019s roads would worsen under Walker's plans.\nIn September 2017, Walker signed the two-year, $76 billion budget. It borrows $402 million for transportation infrastructure, far less than included in recent budgets. The plan delays work on Highway 15 in Outagamie County and the north leg of the Zoo Interchange in Milwaukee County and puts off the reconstruction of I-94 between the Zoo and Marquette interchanges.\nThe reduction in funding for interstates in southeast Wisconsin did a U-turn with the announcement of Foxconn locating in southeast Wisconsin.\nThe state is pinning its hopes for the expanded freeway and related work on a $246.2 million federal grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation that would pay for about half the remaining cost.\nOur rating\nIn a tweet, Walker said \"Road projects across the state are staying on track or getting done sooner thanks to the good work of the team at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.\"\nA spokesman said Walker was referring to the early completion of the State Highway 441 project. But that was not specified in the tweet, and a wide range of other projects -- including major ones -- have been delayed.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate the claim Mostly False.
