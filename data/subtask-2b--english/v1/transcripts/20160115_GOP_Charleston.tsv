0001	CAVUTO	It is 900 p.m. here at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center in South Carolina.
0002	CAVUTO	Welcome to the sixth Republican presidential of the 2016 campaign, here on the Fox Business Network.
0003	CAVUTO	I'm Neil Cavuto, alongside my friend and comoderator Maria Bartiromo.
0004	BARTIROMO	Tonight we are working with Facebook to ask the candidates the questions voters want answered.
0005	BARTIROMO	And according to Facebook, the U.S. election has dominated the global conversation, with 131 million people talking about the 2016 race.
0006	BARTIROMO	That makes it the number one issue talked about on Facebook last year worldwide.
0007	CAVUTO	Now, the seven candidates on the stage tonight were selected based on their standing in six national polls, as well as polls in the earlyvoting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, those standings determining the position on the stage of the candidates tonight.
0008	CAVUTO	And here they are.
0009	CAVUTO	Businessman Donald Trump.
0010	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0011	CAVUTO	Texas senator Ted Cruz.
0012	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0013	CAVUTO	Florida senator Marco Rubio.
0014	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0015	CAVUTO	Neurosurgeon Ben Carson.
0016	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0017	CAVUTO	New Jersey governor Chris Christie.
0018	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0019	CAVUTO	Former Florida governor Jeb Bush.
0020	CAVUTO	And Ohio governor John Kasich.
0021	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0022	BARTIROMO	Tonight's rules are simple up to 90 seconds for each answer, one minute for each followup response.
0023	BARTIROMO	And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you'll hear this.
0024	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
0025	BARTIROMO	So let's get started.
0026	BARTIROMO	Candidates, jobs and growth  two of the biggest issues facing the country right now.
0027	BARTIROMO	In his State of the Union address earlier this week, the president said, quote, "we have the strongest, most durable economy in the world."
0028	BARTIROMO	And according to our Facebook research, jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country, including here in South Carolina.
0029	BARTIROMO	The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half.
0030	BARTIROMO	The president said that anyone who claims America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction.
0031	BARTIROMO	Senator Cruz, what do you see that he doesn't?
0032	CRUZ	Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.
0033	CRUZ	Let me start  I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.
0034	CRUZ	Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.
0035	CRUZ	In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.
0036	CRUZ	President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.
0037	CRUZ	And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.
0038	CRUZ	But the good news is the next commanderinchief is standing on this stage.
0039	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0040	CRUZ	And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.
0041	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0042	CRUZ	Now, on to your substantive question.
0043	CRUZ	The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.
0044	CRUZ	And you know, he's right.
0045	CRUZ	If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.
0046	CRUZ	The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.
0047	CRUZ	But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.
0048	CRUZ	Median wages have stagnated.
0049	CRUZ	And the ObamaClinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.
0050	CRUZ	The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.
0051	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.
0052	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0053	CAVUTO	Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but
0054	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0055	CAVUTO	investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value.
0056	CAVUTO	That makes it the worst start to a new year ever.
0057	CAVUTO	Many worry that things will get even worse, and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable.
0058	CAVUTO	Now, if this escalates, like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency, what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as, in this example, you are taking over the presidency?
0059	KASICH	Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.
0060	KASICH	And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget had four years of balanced budgets paid down a halftrillion of debt.
0061	KASICH	And our economy was growing like crazy.
0062	KASICH	It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.
0063	KASICH	It's a simple formula common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.
0064	KASICH	It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.
0065	KASICH	And if you tax cuts  if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the  in the world.
0066	KASICH	But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.
0067	KASICH	We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.
0068	KASICH	And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations when you reduce taxes and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.
0069	KASICH	Right now, you don't have the  you have taxes that are too high.
0070	KASICH	You have regulations  I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.
0071	KASICH	They are  they're in a position where they're smothering people.
0072	KASICH	And I mean, are you kidding me?
0073	KASICH	We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.
0074	KASICH	Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.
0075	KASICH	You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.
0076	KASICH	And how do I know it?
0077	KASICH	Because I've done it.
0078	KASICH	I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.
0079	KASICH	And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.
0080	KASICH	Our wages are growing faster than the national average.
0081	KASICH	We're running surpluses.
0082	KASICH	And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.
0083	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0084	BARTIROMO	We know that recent global events have many people worried  Iran detaining American sailors, forcing them to apologize North Korea and its nuclear ambitions an aggressive China and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate, not to mention ISIS is getting stronger.
0085	BARTIROMO	Governor Christie, sometimes it seems the world is on fire.
0086	BARTIROMO	Where and when should a president use military action to restore order?
0087	CHRISTIE	Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.
0088	CHRISTIE	Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.
0089	CHRISTIE	And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?
0090	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0091	CHRISTIE	The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.
0092	CHRISTIE	The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.
0093	CHRISTIE	And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.
0094	CHRISTIE	Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.
0095	CHRISTIE	And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.
0096	CHRISTIE	Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.
0097	CHRISTIE	And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.
0098	CHRISTIE	It's a  it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing it showed how the relationship was getting better.
0099	CHRISTIE	The president doesn't understand  and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton  and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.
0100	CHRISTIE	If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.
0101	CHRISTIE	I will not do that.
0102	CHRISTIE	If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.
0103	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0104	BARTIROMO	Just to be clear Governor, where and when would you use military action?
0105	CHRISTIE	MIlitary action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.
0106	CHRISTIE	We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.
0107	CHRISTIE	And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.
0108	CHRISTIE	We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.
0109	CHRISTIE	It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.
0110	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0111	CAVUTO	Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker, well, it's just rhetoric and hot air.
0112	CAVUTO	Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies.
0113	CAVUTO	I guess they would include you.
0114	CAVUTO	What do you say?
0115	BUSH	Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.
0116	BUSH	The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.
0117	BUSH	Think about it.
0118	BUSH	With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battletested terrorists.
0119	BUSH	He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.
0120	BUSH	In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the cochairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.
0121	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0122	BUSH	I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.
0123	BUSH	In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.
0124	BUSH	Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult  we're in a much different position than we should be.
0125	BUSH	And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.
0126	BUSH	Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.
0127	BUSH	As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.
0128	BUSH	We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.
0129	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0130	CAVUTO	So I take it from that you do not agree with the president.
0131	BUSH	No.
0132	BUSH	And worse  worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.
0133	BUSH	Think about it.
0134	BUSH	She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, DoddFrank, all the things that have  that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.
0135	BUSH	And that is wrong.
0136	BUSH	And you know what?
0137	BUSH	Here's the problem.
0138	BUSH	If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.
0139	BUSH	If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.
0140	BUSH	We need to stop that.
0141	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
0142	CAVUTO	Senator Rubio, the president says that ISIS doesn't threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II, that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages.
0143	CAVUTO	But House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1,000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states.
0144	CAVUTO	So how do you define the threat?
0145	CAVUTO	Germany then or dangerous nut cases now?
0146	RUBIO	Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.
0147	RUBIO	She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.
0148	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0149	RUBIO	Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.
0150	RUBIO	Ever.
0151	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0152	RUBIO	On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.
0153	RUBIO	Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.
0154	RUBIO	And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.
0155	RUBIO	He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.
0156	RUBIO	He consistently underestimates it but I do not.
0157	RUBIO	There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.
0158	RUBIO	When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.
0159	RUBIO	The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.
0160	RUBIO	And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a oneway ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.
0161	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0162	CAVUTO	Thank you, Senator.
0163	BARTIROMO	Dr. Carson, the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army, but ISIS is neither a country nor a government.
0164	BARTIROMO	How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders?
0165	CARSON	Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.
0166	CARSON	I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.
0167	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0168	CARSON	You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.
0169	CARSON	The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.
0170	CARSON	Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.
0171	CARSON	And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.
0172	CARSON	And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.
0173	CARSON	I mean, just think about a scenario like that.
0174	CARSON	They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.
0175	CARSON	They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.
0176	CARSON	Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?
0177	CARSON	He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.
0178	CARSON	But here's the real key.
0179	CARSON	We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.
0180	CARSON	And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.
0181	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0182	CAVUTO	Mr. Trump, at the State of the Union, the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack.
0183	CAVUTO	Now he fled that country seeking asylum here, ultimately ended up in Detroit where he's now trying to start a new life.
0184	CAVUTO	The president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum.
0185	CAVUTO	How do you answer that?
0186	TRUMP	It's not fear and terror, it's reality.
0187	TRUMP	You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.
0188	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0189	TRUMP	You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a  the strictest nogun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens 130 people dead with many to follow.
0190	TRUMP	They're very, very badly wounded.
0191	TRUMP	They will  some will follow.
0192	TRUMP	And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor  very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.
0193	TRUMP	That could be the great Trojan Horse.
0194	TRUMP	It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.
0195	TRUMP	When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?
0196	TRUMP	It looked like very few women.
0197	TRUMP	Very few children.
0198	TRUMP	Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?
0199	TRUMP	You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized  they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15  going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look  a good strong look and that's what we have.
0200	TRUMP	We are nineteen trillion dollars  our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.
0201	TRUMP	We can't do it.
0202	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0203	BARTIROMO	Senator Cruz, the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank.
0204	BARTIROMO	During your senate race, your campaign said, "it was inadvertent."
0205	BARTIROMO	A million dollars is inadvertent?
0206	CRUZ	Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.
0207	CRUZ	You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.
0208	CRUZ	The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, "Anybody But Cruz."
0209	CRUZ	Had that actually  that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, "It Follows" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people.
0210	CRUZ	So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.
0211	CRUZ	Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate  unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.
0212	CRUZ	When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.
0213	CRUZ	He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.
0214	CRUZ	We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.
0215	CRUZ	And the entire New York times attack  is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.
0216	CRUZ	But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.
0217	CRUZ	But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.
0218	BARTIROMO	Thank you.
0219	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0220	CAVUTO	All right.
0221	CAVUTO	Welcome back to the Republican presidential , right here in North Charleston, South Carolina.
0222	CAVUTO	Let's get right back to the questions.
0223	CAVUTO	And I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.
0224	CAVUTO	Now you are, of course, a strict constitutionalist  no one would doubt that.
0225	CAVUTO	And as you know, the U.S. Constitution says only naturalborn citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States.
0226	CAVUTO	Stop me if you've heard this before.
0227	CAVUTO	Now, you were born...
0228	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0229	CAVUTO	... you were born in Canada to an American mother.
0230	CAVUTO	So you were and are considered an American citizen.
0231	CAVUTO	But that fellow next to you, Donald Trump  and others  have said that being born in Canada means you are not naturalborn, and that has raised questions about your eligibility.
0232	CAVUTO	Do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight?
0233	CRUZ	Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.
0234	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
0235	CRUZ	You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.
0236	CRUZ	There was nothing to this birther issue.
0237	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0238	CRUZ	Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.
0239	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0240	CRUZ	But the poll numbers have.
0241	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0242	CRUZ	And I recognize  I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.
0243	CRUZ	But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.
0244	CRUZ	Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a naturalborn citizen.
0245	CRUZ	If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a naturalborn citizen.
0246	CRUZ	That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.
0247	CRUZ	If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a naturalborn citizen.
0248	CRUZ	That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.
0249	CRUZ	At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on  some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.
0250	CRUZ	Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.
0251	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0252	UNKNOWN	Not me.
0253	CRUZ	Because  because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.
0254	CRUZ	She was naturalized.
0255	CRUZ	Now, Donald...
0256	TRUMP	But I was born here.
0257	CRUZ	... on the issue  on the issue of citizenship, Donald...
0258	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0259	TRUMP	.
0260	TRUMP	Big difference.
0261	CRUZ	... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.
0262	TRUMP	OK, good.
0263	TRUMP	Because it wouldn't work.
0264	CRUZ	You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander inchief, because that's the most important question facing the country.
0265	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0266	CAVUTO	Mr. Trump...
0267	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0268	CAVUTO	...that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers.
0269	TRUMP	... first of all, let me just tell you something  and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself  NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll  headline Trump way up, Cruz going down.
0270	TRUMP	I mean, so don't  so you can't  you can't...
0271	SYSTEM	[ booing ]
0272	TRUMP	...they don't like the Wall Street Journal.
0273	TRUMP	They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.
0274	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0275	TRUMP	And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.
0276	TRUMP	So  you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.
0277	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0278	TRUMP	You don't have to say that.
0279	TRUMP	In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.
0280	TRUMP	Number two, this isn't me saying it.
0281	TRUMP	I don't care.
0282	TRUMP	I think I'm going to win fair and square

0289	TRUMP	OK?
0290	TRUMP	There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.
0291	TRUMP	Here's the problem.
0292	TRUMP	We're running.
0293	TRUMP	We're running.
0294	TRUMP	He does great.
0295	TRUMP	I win.
0296	TRUMP	I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.
0297	TRUMP	I don't like that.

0308	TRUMP	But  if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.
0309	TRUMP	You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.
0310	TRUMP	And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?
0311	TRUMP	So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.

0357	TRUMP	He's wrong.
0358	CRUZ	... on Larry Tribe.
0359	CRUZ	Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.
0360	CRUZ	He's a leftwing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.
0361	CRUZ	He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.
0362	CRUZ	And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...
0363	TRUMP	He is not the only one.
0364	CRUZ	... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.
0365	TRUMP	There are many lawyers.

0387	RUBIO	.
0388	RUBIO	I was invoked in that question, so let me just say  in that answer  let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.
0389	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0390	RUBIO	But the real  but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.
0391	RUBIO	OK?
0392	RUBIO	Listen, we  this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.
0393	RUBIO	But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.
0394	RUBIO	He wants to change America.
0395	RUBIO	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.
0396	RUBIO	He undermines it.
0397	RUBIO	We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.
0398	RUBIO	We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.
0399	RUBIO	This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.
0400	RUBIO	That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.
0401	RUBIO	When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.
0402	RUBIO	And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.
0403	RUBIO	When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.
0404	BARTIROMO	Thank you, senator.
0405	BARTIROMO	Mr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address...
0406	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0407	BARTIROMO	...appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist, quote, "the siren call of the angriest voices".
0408	BARTIROMO	She confirmed, she was referring to you among others.
0409	BARTIROMO	Was she out of line?
0410	BARTIROMO	And, how would a President Trump unite the party?
0411	TRUMP	Okay.
0412	TRUMP	First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.
0413	TRUMP	Actually a close friend.
0414	TRUMP	And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.
0415	TRUMP	We're friends.
0416	TRUMP	That's good.
0417	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0418	TRUMP	But she did say there was anger.
0419	TRUMP	And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.
0420	TRUMP	I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.
0421	TRUMP	Our military is a disaster.
0422	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0423	TRUMP	Our healthcare is a horror show.
0424	TRUMP	Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.
0425	TRUMP	We have no borders.
0426	TRUMP	Our vets are being treated horribly.
0427	TRUMP	Illegal immigration is beyond belief.
0428	TRUMP	Our country is being run by incompetent people.
0429	TRUMP	And yes, I am angry.
0430	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0431	TRUMP	And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.
0432	TRUMP	And I say that to Nikki.
0433	TRUMP	So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.
0434	TRUMP	She said the truth.
0435	TRUMP	One of your colleagues interviewed me.
0436	TRUMP	And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.
0437	TRUMP	I'm not fighting that.
0438	TRUMP	I didn't find it offensive at all.
0439	TRUMP	I'm angry because our country is a mess.
0440	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0441	BARTIROMO	But what are you going to do about it?
0442	CAVUTO	Marco Rubio.
0443	CAVUTO	I'm sorry, it's the time constraints.
0444	CAVUTO	You and Governor Christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late, and I will allow the governor to respond as well.
0445	CAVUTO	The governor went so far to say, you won't be able to slime your way to the White House.
0446	CAVUTO	He's referring to a series of ads done by a PAC, speaking on your behalf, that say quote,"One high tax, Common Core, liberal, energyloving, Obamacare, Medicaidexpanding president is enough.
0447	CAVUTO	You think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor?
0448	RUBIO	You know, as I said already twice in this , we have a very serious problem in this country.
0449	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0450	RUBIO	We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...
0451	CAVUTO	That is not my question.
0452	RUBIO	Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.
0453	RUBIO	He is  this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.
0454	RUBIO	This president is undermining our military.
0455	RUBIO	He is undermining our standing in the world.
0456	RUBIO	I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.
0457	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0458	RUBIO	We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.
0459	RUBIO	This president, this president is more interested in funding  less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned  he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.
0460	RUBIO	Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0461	RUBIO	All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.
0462	RUBIO	It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.
0463	RUBIO	Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.
0464	RUBIO	Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.
0465	RUBIO	We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.
0466	RUBIO	So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.
0467	RUBIO	No one is a socialist.
0468	RUBIO	No one here is under FBI investigation.
0469	RUBIO	So we have a good group of people.
0470	CAVUTO	Is he a liberal?
0471	RUBIO	Our next president...
0472	CAVUTO	Is he a liberal?
0473	RUBIO	Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.
0474	RUBIO	Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.
0475	CAVUTO	Governor?
0476	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0477	CHRISTIE	I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.
0478	CHRISTIE	It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.
0479	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0480	CHRISTIE	So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.
0481	CHRISTIE	So let's set the facts straight.
0482	CHRISTIE	First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.
0483	CHRISTIE	Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.
0484	CHRISTIE	Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50caliber rifle ban.
0485	CHRISTIE	I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.
0486	CHRISTIE	I vetoed a statewide I.D.
0487	CHRISTIE	system for gun owners and I pardoned, six outofstate folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.
0488	CHRISTIE	And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.
0489	CHRISTIE	So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.
0490	CHRISTIE	See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.
0491	CHRISTIE	And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.
0492	CHRISTIE	When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.
0493	CHRISTIE	And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.
0494	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0495	CHRISTIE	And the last piece is this.
0496	CHRISTIE	I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.
0497	CHRISTIE	That was before he was running against me.
0498	CHRISTIE	Now that he is, he's changed his tune.
0499	CHRISTIE	I'm never going to change my tune.
0500	CHRISTIE	I like Marco Rubio.
0501	CHRISTIE	He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.
0502	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0503	BUSH	Neil, my name was mentioned here.
0504	BUSH	Neil, my name was mentioned as well.
0505	BUSH	Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.
0506	BUSH	He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.
0507	BUSH	Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.
0508	BUSH	And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be  this is not being bad.
0509	BUSH	These attack ads are going to be part of life.
0510	BUSH	Everybody just needs to get used to it.
0511	BUSH	Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.
0512	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0513	BUSH	Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.
0514	BUSH	And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the  the backandforth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.
0515	CARSON	Neil, I was mentioned too.
0516	CAVUTO	You were?
0517	CARSON	Yeah, he said everybody.
0518	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0519	CARSON	And  and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we  and when I say we, Republicans  tore themselves apart.
0520	CARSON	You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.
0521	CARSON	And we got to look at the big picture here.
0522	BARTIROMO	Governor Kasich...
0523	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0524	BARTIROMO	...
0525	BARTIROMO	Governor Kasich, Hillary Clinton is getting some serious competition from Senator Bernie Sanders.
0526	BARTIROMO	He's now at 41 percent in the latest CBSNew York Times poll.
0527	BARTIROMO	Vice President Biden sang his praises, saying Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real, and he has credibility on it.
0528	BARTIROMO	So what does it say about our country that a candidate who is a selfavowed socialist and who doesn't think a 90 percent tax rate is too high could be the Democratic nominee?
0529	KASICH	Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.
0530	KASICH	That's not even an issue.
0531	KASICH	But look...
0532	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0533	KASICH	...and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.
0534	KASICH	So here's this  the situation, I think, Maria.
0535	KASICH	And this is what we have to  I  I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise  and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years  it's very, very difficult for them.
0536	KASICH	Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.
0537	KASICH	Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in  in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.
0538	KASICH	People are upset about it.
0539	KASICH	I'll tell you what else they're upset about you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.
0540	KASICH	Do we have answer for that?
0541	KASICH	We do.
0542	KASICH	There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51yearolds, because they've got great value.
0543	KASICH	I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.
0544	KASICH	Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.
0545	KASICH	We got to do a lot about the high cost of high  higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.
0546	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0547	KASICH	Let me tell you that, in this country  in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.
0548	KASICH	They're very concerned about it.
0549	KASICH	And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to  keeping them from getting it.
0550	KASICH	That's not the America that I've ever known.
0551	KASICH	My father used to say, "Johnny, we never  we don't hate the rich.
0552	KASICH	We just want to be the rich."
0553	KASICH	And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in Kthrough12 and in vocational education, in higher education.
0554	KASICH	And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America  and I mean everybody in America  having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.
0555	KASICH	I'm president  look, I've done it once.
0556	KASICH	I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.
0557	KASICH	The economy was really booming.
0558	KASICH	And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the  than the national average.
0559	KASICH	A growth of 385,000 jobs.
0560	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
0561	KASICH	It's not that hard.
0562	KASICH	Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.
0563	KASICH	Get it done, because our  our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.
0564	KASICH	And, folks, we will.
0565	KASICH	You count on it.
0566	BARTIROMO	Dr. Carson, one of the other candidates on this stage has brought Bill Clinton's past indiscretions.
0567	BARTIROMO	Is that a legitimate topic in this election?
0568	BARTIROMO	And what do you think of the notion that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct?
0569	CARSON	Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.
0570	CARSON	But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?
0571	CARSON	Do we still have standards?
0572	CARSON	Do we still have values and principles?
0573	CARSON	You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.
0574	CARSON	You know, we have a war on virtual everything  race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.
0575	CARSON	Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.
0576	CARSON	You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section  you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.
0577	CARSON	Where did that spirit come from in America?
0578	CARSON	It did not come from our JudeoChristian roots, I can tell you that.
0579	CARSON	And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.
0580	CARSON	And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.
0581	CARSON	The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.
0582	CARSON	They've been beaten into submission.
0583	CARSON	It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.

0592	CAVUTO	We're back in a moment in Charleston, South Carolina.
0593	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0594	BARTIROMO	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debates, right here in North Charleston.
0595	BARTIROMO	Let's get right back to the questions.
0596	BARTIROMO	Governor Bush, gun rights, one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month.
0597	BARTIROMO	Right here in Charleston, Dylann Roof, who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church, reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun.
0598	BARTIROMO	What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns, but those who sell them?
0599	BUSH	First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the 
0600	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0601	BUSH	 the Emanuel AME church killings.
0602	BUSH	And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.
0603	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0604	BUSH	I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.
0605	BUSH	Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.
0606	BUSH	The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.
0607	BUSH	We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.
0608	BUSH	Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not  would not have passed a background check.
0609	BUSH	The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law abiding citizens.
0610	BUSH	That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.
0611	BUSH	It isn't lawabiding gun owners.
0612	BUSH	Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.
0613	BUSH	You're going away for a long, long while.
0614	BUSH	And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.
0615	BUSH	Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.
0616	BUSH	The other issue is mental health.
0617	BUSH	That's a serious issue that we could work on.
0618	BUSH	Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.
0619	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0620	BUSH	The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.
0621	BUSH	Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.
0622	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0623	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.
0624	BARTIROMO	Mr. Trump, are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America?
0625	TRUMP	No.
0626	TRUMP	I am a 2nd amendment person.
0627	TRUMP	If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.
0628	TRUMP	If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.
0629	TRUMP	So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.
0630	TRUMP	We have a huge mental health problem in this country.
0631	TRUMP	We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.
0632	TRUMP	We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.
0633	TRUMP	The guns don't pull the trigger.
0634	TRUMP	It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.
0635	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0636	TRUMP	We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.
0637	TRUMP	He doesn't want to get people together, the oldfashioned way, where you get Congress.
0638	TRUMP	You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.
0639	TRUMP	He just writes out an executive order.
0640	TRUMP	Not supposed to happen that way.
0641	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0642	BARTIROMO	Thank you sir.
0643	TRUMP	You get the Congress.
0644	TRUMP	You get the Senate.
0645	TRUMP	You get together.
0646	TRUMP	You do legislation.
0647	TRUMP	He just writes out an order, executive order.
0648	TRUMP	It's not supposed to happen that way.
0649	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0650	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.
0651	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0652	CAVUTO	Senator Rubio, you said that President Obama wants to take people's guns away.
0653	CAVUTO	Yet under his presidency, gun sales have more than doubled.
0654	CAVUTO	That doesn't sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners.
0655	RUBIO	That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.
0656	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0657	RUBIO	Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.
0658	RUBIO	It is not a suggestion.
0659	RUBIO	It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.
0660	RUBIO	I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.
0661	RUBIO	I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.
0662	RUBIO	I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0663	RUBIO	I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.
0664	RUBIO	Here's my second problem.
0665	RUBIO	None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.
0666	RUBIO	You know why?
0667	RUBIO	Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.
0668	RUBIO	They don't buy their guns from a collector.
0669	RUBIO	And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.
0670	RUBIO	They get  they steal them.
0671	RUBIO	They get them on the black market.
0672	RUBIO	And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.
0673	RUBIO	These...
0674	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
0675	RUBIO	... his answer  you name it.
0676	RUBIO	If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.
0677	RUBIO	Here's a fact.
0678	RUBIO	We are in a war against ISIS.
0679	RUBIO	They are trying to attack us here in America.
0680	RUBIO	They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.
0681	RUBIO	They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
0682	RUBIO	And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.
0683	RUBIO	When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.
0684	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0685	CAVUTO	But what fact can you point to, Senator  what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone's gun?
0686	CAVUTO	You don't think that's
0687	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0688	CAVUTO	?
0689	RUBIO	About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.
0690	RUBIO	He has never defended...
0691	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0692	RUBIO	...I'll give you a fact.
0693	RUBIO	Well, let me tell you this.
0694	RUBIO	Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, "These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."
0695	RUBIO	That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.
0696	RUBIO	This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.
0697	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0698	RUBIO	He doesn't meet  here's the difference.
0699	RUBIO	When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not "how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."
0700	RUBIO	It's "give me options on how I can make it harder for lawabiding people to buy guns."
0701	RUBIO	That will never happen when I am president of the United States.
0702	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0703	CAVUTO	Governor Christie, you, too, have criticized the president's recent executive action on gun control, saying it's unconstitutional, another step to bypass Congress.
0704	CAVUTO	But hasn't your own position on guns evolved, sir?
0705	CAVUTO	The New Jersey StarLedger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms, and that you argued back in August 2013, and I quote, "These common sense measures will strengthen New Jersey's already tough gun laws."
0706	CAVUTO	So isn't that kind of what the president wants to do now?
0707	CHRISTIE	No, absolutely not.
0708	CHRISTIE	The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.
0709	CHRISTIE	And the fact is that that's not a democracy.
0710	CHRISTIE	That's a dictatorship.
0711	CHRISTIE	And we need to very, very concerned about that.
0712	CHRISTIE	See, here's the thing.
0713	CHRISTIE	I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.
0714	CHRISTIE	I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.
0715	CHRISTIE	I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.
0716	CHRISTIE	The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.
0717	CHRISTIE	We have made it easier to do that, not harder.
0718	CHRISTIE	And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not by signing unconstitutional executive orders.
0719	CHRISTIE	This guy is a petulant child.
0720	CHRISTIE	That's what he is.
0721	CHRISTIE	I mean, you know...
0722	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0723	CHRISTIE	... the fact is, Neil, let's think about  let's think about  and I want to maybe  I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.
0724	CHRISTIE	Mr. President, we're not against you.
0725	CHRISTIE	We're against your policies.
0726	CHRISTIE	When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibusterproof Democratic Senate.
0727	CHRISTIE	You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.
0728	CHRISTIE	And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House a Republican majority in the Senate and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.
0729	CHRISTIE	The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.
0730	CHRISTIE	That's not right.
0731	CHRISTIE	It's not constitutional.
0732	CHRISTIE	And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.
0733	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0734	BARTIROMO	So what is the answer, Senator Cruz, to stop mass shootings and violent crime, up in 30 cities across the country?
0735	CRUZ	The answer is simple.
0736	CRUZ	Your prosecute criminals.
0737	CRUZ	You target the bad guys.
0738	CRUZ	You know, a minute ago, Neil asked What has President Obama do  done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?
0739	CRUZ	Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.
0740	CRUZ	Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.
0741	CRUZ	He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
0742	CRUZ	He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.
0743	CRUZ	And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters  the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.
0744	CRUZ	There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.
0745	CRUZ	And I'll note that California senator  Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, "give me your guns, I'm rounding them up," she would.
0746	CRUZ	And let me make a final point on this.
0747	CRUZ	Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.
0748	CRUZ	Unless you are clinically insane...
0749	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0750	CRUZ	...that's what you say in a primary.
0751	CRUZ	But the voters are savvier than that.
0752	CRUZ	They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.
0753	CRUZ	I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.
0754	CRUZ	There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.
0755	CRUZ	There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...
0756	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
0757	CRUZ	...and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans  we defeated that gun control legislation.
0758	CRUZ	And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.
0759	BARTIROMO	Senator...
0760	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0761	BARTIROMO	... let me follow up and switch gears.
0762	BARTIROMO	Senator Cruz, you suggested Mr. Trump, quote, "embodies New York values."
0763	BARTIROMO	Could you explain what you mean by that?
0764	CRUZ	You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.
0765	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0766	BARTIROMO	I am from New York.
0767	BARTIROMO	I don't.
0768	CRUZ	What  what  you're from New York?
0769	CRUZ	So you might not.
0770	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0771	CRUZ	But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.
0772	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0773	CRUZ	And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.
0774	CRUZ	But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or proabortion or pro gaymarriage, focus around money and the media.
0775	CRUZ	And  and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked  my friend Donald has taken to it as advance playing Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", and I was asked what I thought of that.
0776	CRUZ	And I said, "well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"
0777	CRUZ	And  and  you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.
0778	CRUZ	Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.
0779	CRUZ	And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.
0780	CRUZ	And his explanation  he said, "look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York.
0781	CRUZ	Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."
0782	CRUZ	And so that was his explanation.
0783	CRUZ	And  and I guess I can  can frame it another way.
0784	CRUZ	Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.
0785	CRUZ	I'm just saying.
0786	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0787	BARTIROMO	Are you sure about that?
0788	CAVUTO	Maria...
0789	TRUMP	So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.
0790	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0791	TRUMP	And just so  if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.
0792	TRUMP	I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made  New York is a great place.
0793	TRUMP	It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.
0794	TRUMP	When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.
0795	TRUMP	You had two one hundred...
0796	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0797	TRUMP	...you had two 110story buildings come crashing down.
0798	TRUMP	I saw them come down.
0799	TRUMP	Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.
0800	TRUMP	I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.
0801	TRUMP	And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death  nobody understood it.
0802	TRUMP	And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.
0803	TRUMP	And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.
0804	TRUMP	And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.
0805	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0806	CAVUTO	Governor bush, for the third time in as many months, the Iranians have provoked us, detaining us, as we've been discussing, with these 10 Navy sailors Tehran had said strayed into their waters.
0807	CAVUTO	The sailors were released, but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident.
0808	CAVUTO	This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1,500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles.
0809	CAVUTO	Now you've claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama.
0810	CAVUTO	I wonder, sir, what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush?
0811	BUSH	Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.
0812	BUSH	Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.
0813	BUSH	It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.
0814	BUSH	The deployments are too high for the military personnel.
0815	BUSH	We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.
0816	BUSH	The B52 is still operational as the long range bomber it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.
0817	BUSH	The planes are older than the pilots.
0818	BUSH	We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.
0819	BUSH	We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.
0820	BUSH	Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.
0821	BUSH	We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing mediumrange missiles.
0822	BUSH	Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel...
0823	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0824	BUSH	...and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.
0825	BUSH	We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.
0826	BUSH	The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.
0827	BUSH	This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.
0828	BUSH	We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.
0829	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0830	CAVUTO	Thank you, Governor.
0831	CAVUTO	Governor Kasich, while everyone has been focusing on Iran's provocations, I'm wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region, including its execution of a wellknown Shi'ite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production, some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business.
0832	CAVUTO	Sure enough, oil prices have tumbled.
0833	CAVUTO	One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt, and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the driver's seat.
0834	CAVUTO	U.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these, who needs enemies?
0835	CAVUTO	Do you agree?
0836	KASICH	Well, let me  let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.
0837	KASICH	I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.
0838	KASICH	Let em also tell you...
0839	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0840	KASICH	...that after the 911 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.
0841	KASICH	And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.
0842	KASICH	So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 911 to be involved.
0843	KASICH	With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.
0844	KASICH	We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.
0845	KASICH	And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.
0846	KASICH	In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.
0847	KASICH	That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.
0848	KASICH	And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.
0849	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0850	KASICH	So look, in foreign policy  in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.
0851	KASICH	You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.
0852	KASICH	And I'm going to tell you, that it  I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.
0853	KASICH	I've seen so much of it  a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 911 and Gulf War.
0854	KASICH	You see what the Saudi's  deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.
0855	KASICH	And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.
0856	KASICH	Thank you.
0857	CAVUTO	Thank you John.
0858	BARTIROMO	There's much more ahead including the fight against ISIS.
0859	BARTIROMO	More from Charleston, South Carolina when we come right back.
0860	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0861	BARTIROMO	We welcome back to the Republican Presidential , right back to the questions.
0862	BARTIROMO	Candidates, the man who made fighting ISIS the cornerstone of his campaign, South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham is out the race but he joins us tonight in the audience.
0863	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0864	BARTIROMO	He says, "the airstrike now in their 16th month have been ineffective."
0865	BARTIROMO	Dr. Carson ...
0866	CARSON	Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?
0867	BARTIROMO	The airstrikes.
0868	CARSON	OK.
0869	BARTIROMO	Now in their 16th month are ineffective.
0870	BARTIROMO	Dr. Carson, do you think Senator Graham is right in wanting to send 20,000 troops  ground troops to Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS?
0871	CARSON	Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.
0872	CARSON	I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.
0873	CARSON	Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.
0874	CARSON	The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, "what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"
0875	CARSON	Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.
0876	CARSON	I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.
0877	CARSON	In addition to that...
0878	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0879	CARSON	...in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.
0880	CARSON	You know, some of these  these engagement rules that the administration has  "we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it"  give me a break.
0881	CARSON	Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.
0882	CARSON	So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.
0883	CARSON	You know, that's so simple.
0884	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0885	CARSON	And then we need to shut down  we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their commandandcontrol centers.
0886	CARSON	Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?
0887	CARSON	We know to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 200 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.
0888	CARSON	They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.
0889	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0890	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.
0891	BARTIROMO	Senator Graham has also said that the U.S. will find Arab support for its coalition if it removes Syrian President Bashar alAssad.
0892	BARTIROMO	And I quote, "The now king of Saudi Arabia told us, 'you can have our army, you just got to deal with Assad.'
0893	BARTIROMO	The emir of Qatar said, 'I'll pay for the operation, but they are not going to fight ISIS and let Damascus fall into the hands of the Iranians.
0894	BARTIROMO	Assad has to go.'
0895	BARTIROMO	Governor Christie, how important is it to remove Assad from power and how would you do it?
0896	CHRISTIE	Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.
0897	CHRISTIE	You think about it  this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state  drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.
0898	CHRISTIE	He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.
0899	CHRISTIE	In fact, he's done worse than nothing.
0900	CHRISTIE	This president  and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer  she called Assad a reformer.
0901	CHRISTIE	Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?
0902	CHRISTIE	We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.
0903	CHRISTIE	The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace  we are not going to have peace in Syria.
0904	CHRISTIE	We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a nofly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.
0905	CHRISTIE	The Syrians should stay in Syria.
0906	CHRISTIE	They shouldn't be going to Europe.
0907	CHRISTIE	And here's the last piece...
0908	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0909	CHRISTIE	...you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.
0910	CHRISTIE	You're simply not.
0911	CHRISTIE	And so Senator Graham is right about this.
0912	CHRISTIE	And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.
0913	CHRISTIE	And believe me, Assad is not worth it.
0914	CHRISTIE	And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.
0915	CHRISTIE	Hillary Clinton cannot be president.
0916	CHRISTIE	It will lead to even greater war in this world.
0917	CHRISTIE	And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.
0918	CHRISTIE	That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.
0919	CHRISTIE	In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.
0920	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.
0921	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0922	BARTIROMO	Mr. Trump  Mr. Trump, your comments about banning Muslims from entering the country created a firestorm.
0923	BARTIROMO	According to Facebook, it was the mosttalkedabout moment online of your entire campaign, with more than 10 million people talking about the issue.
0924	BARTIROMO	Is there anything you've heard that makes you want to rethink this position?
0925	TRUMP	No.
0926	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0927	TRUMP	No.
0928	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0929	TRUMP	Look, we have to stop with political correctness.
0930	TRUMP	We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the  with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.
0931	TRUMP	I just left Indonesia  bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.
0932	TRUMP	We have to find out what's going on.
0933	TRUMP	I said temporarily.
0934	TRUMP	I didn't say permanently.
0935	TRUMP	I said temporarily.
0936	TRUMP	And I have many great Muslim friends.
0937	TRUMP	And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, "Donald, thank you very much you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."
0938	TRUMP	And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.
0939	TRUMP	And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.
0940	TRUMP	My Muslim friends, some, said, "thank you very much we'll get to the bottom of it."
0941	TRUMP	But we have a serious problem.
0942	TRUMP	And we can't be the stupid country any more.
0943	TRUMP	We're laughed at all over the world.
0944	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0945	BUSH	Donald, Donald  can I  I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.
0946	BUSH	The Kurds are our strongest allies.
0947	BUSH	They're Muslim.
0948	BUSH	You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?
0949	BUSH	The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.
0950	BUSH	We cannot be the world's policeman.
0951	BUSH	We can't do this unilaterally.
0952	BUSH	We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.
0953	BUSH	And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.
0954	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0955	BUSH	So I hope you'll reconsider.
0956	BUSH	I hope you'll reconsider.
0957	BUSH	The better way of dealing with this  the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the  Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.
0958	BUSH	What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder  make the screening take place.
0959	BUSH	We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?
0960	BUSH	What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?
0961	CAVUTO	But you said  you said that he made those comments and they represented him being unhinged after he made them.
0962	BUSH	Yeah, they are unhinged.
0963	CAVUTO	Well  well, after he made them...
0964	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0965	CAVUTO	...his poll numbers went up eight points in South Carolina.
0966	CAVUTO	Now  now, wait...
0967	TRUMP	Eleven points, to be exact.
0968	CAVUTO	Are you  are you saying  are you saying that all those people who agree with Mr. Trump are unhinged?
0969	BUSH	No, not at all, absolutely not.
0970	BUSH	I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.
0971	BUSH	I totally get that.
0972	BUSH	But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.
0973	BUSH	This isn't  this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.
0974	BUSH	You have to lead.
0975	BUSH	You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.
0976	BUSH	Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.
0977	BUSH	And so it was
0978	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0979	BUSH	his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.
0980	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0981	TRUMP	I want security for this country.
0982	TRUMP	OK?
0983	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0984	TRUMP	I want security.
0985	TRUMP	I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over people come in they live they shoot.
0986	TRUMP	I want security for this country.
0987	TRUMP	We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.
0988	TRUMP	We have a tremendous problem.
0989	TRUMP	It's not only a problem here.
0990	TRUMP	It's a problem all over the world.
0991	TRUMP	I want to find out why those two young people  those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them  people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.
0992	TRUMP	I want to find out  many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.
0993	TRUMP	Why weren't they vigilant?
0994	TRUMP	Why didn't they call?
0995	TRUMP	Why didn't they call the police?
0996	TRUMP	And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.
0997	TRUMP	I will tell you that.
0998	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0999	TRUMP	The most mistreated people.
1000	TRUMP	In fact, we need to  wait a minute  we need vigilance.
1001	TRUMP	We have to find out  many people knew about what was going on.
1002	TRUMP	Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?
1003	TRUMP	There's something going on and it's bad.
1004	TRUMP	And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.
1005	TRUMP	That's all I'm saying.
1006	TRUMP	We need security.
1007	BARTIROMO	We  we want to hear from all of you on this.
1008	BARTIROMO	According to Pew Research, the U.S. admits more than 100,000 Muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis.
1009	BARTIROMO	I want to ask the rest of you to comment on this.
1010	BARTIROMO	Do you agree that we should pause Muslim immigration until we get a better handle on our homeland security situation, as Mr. Trump has said?
1011	BARTIROMO	Beginning with you, Governor Kasich.
1012	KASICH	I  I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.
1013	KASICH	And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.
1014	KASICH	But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.
1015	KASICH	And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.
1016	KASICH	If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.
1017	KASICH	We need Jordan.
1018	KASICH	We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.
1019	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
1020	KASICH	It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.
1021	KASICH	And if we try to put everybody in the same  call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.
1022	KASICH	And that's just not acceptable.
1023	KASICH	But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.
1024	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir, we want to hear from the rest of you,
1025	BARTIROMO	Governor Christie, your take.
1026	CHRISTIE	Now Maria, listen.
1027	CHRISTIE	I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.
1028	CHRISTIE	And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.
1029	CHRISTIE	That's the end of the conversation.
1030	CHRISTIE	I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 911, dealing with this issue.
1031	CHRISTIE	Here's the way you need to deal with it.
1032	CHRISTIE	You can't just ban all Muslims.
1033	CHRISTIE	You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.
1034	CHRISTIE	You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.
1035	CHRISTIE	The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.
1036	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
1037	CHRISTIE	And this summer, we didn't do that.
1038	CHRISTIE	We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.
1039	CHRISTIE	Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.
1040	BARTIROMO	Senator Rubio, where do you stand?
1041	RUBIO	Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.
1042	RUBIO	Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.
1043	RUBIO	If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.
1044	RUBIO	They are much more than that.
1045	RUBIO	This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.
1046	RUBIO	This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.
1047	RUBIO	This is not some small scale group.
1048	RUBIO	They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.
1049	RUBIO	So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.
1050	RUBIO	If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.
1051	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1052	BARTIROMO	Senator Cruz, where do you stand?
1053	BARTIROMO	Senator Cruz?
1054	CRUZ	You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.
1055	CRUZ	I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.
1056	CRUZ	What should we do?
1057	CRUZ	First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.
1058	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1059	CRUZ	And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...
1060	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
1061	CRUZ	...that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.
1062	CRUZ	Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.
1063	CRUZ	If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.
1064	CRUZ	When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS
1065	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1066	CRUZ	.
1067	BARTIROMO	Dr. Carson, where do you stand?
1068	BARTIROMO	Do you agree with Mr. Trump?
1069	CARSON	Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.
1070	CARSON	But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.
1071	CARSON	And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.
1072	CARSON	That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.
1073	CARSON	And as far as the Syrians are concerned, AlHasakah province, perfect place.
1074	CARSON	They have infrastructure.
1075	CARSON	All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.
1076	CARSON	And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.
1077	CARSON	Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.
1078	BARTIROMO	So, to be clear, the both of you do not agree with Mr. Trump?
1079	BUSH	So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies  that we need to build better relationships with?
1080	BUSH	Of course not.
1081	BUSH	What we need to do is destroy ISIS.
1082	BUSH	I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a "No Fly Zone" and "Safe Zones" to make sure refugees are there.
1083	BUSH	We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.
1084	BUSH	We need to embed with  with the Iraqi military.
1085	BUSH	We need to arm the Kurds the directly.
1086	BUSH	We need to reestablish the relationships with the Sunnis.
1087	BUSH	We need the lawyers off the back of the war fighters.
1088	BUSH	That's how you solve the problem.
1089	BUSH	You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.
1090	BARTIROMO	Thank you governor.
1091	CAVUTO	Mr. Trump, sometimes maybe in the heat of the campaign, you say things and you have to dial them back.
1092	CAVUTO	Last week, the New York Times editorial board quoted as saying that you would oppose, "up to 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods."
1093	TRUMP	That's wrong.
1094	TRUMP	They were wrong.
1095	TRUMP	It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.
1096	CAVUTO	Well...
1097	TRUMP	They were wrong.
1098	CAVUTO	You never said because they provided that...
1099	TRUMP	No, I said, " I would use  " they were asking me what to do about North Korea.
1100	TRUMP	China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control  just about, of North Korea.
1101	TRUMP	They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.
1102	TRUMP	They say, " well, we don't really have control."
1103	TRUMP	Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.
1104	TRUMP	China is ripping us on trade.
1105	TRUMP	They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.
1106	TRUMP	Thousands of thousands  you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost  50,000 because of China.
1107	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1108	CAVUTO	So they've never said to put a tariff on their...
1109	TRUMP	We've lost anywhere between four and seven million jobs because of China.
1110	TRUMP	What I said then was, "we have very unfair trade with China.
1111	TRUMP	We're going to have a trade deficit of 505 billion dollars this year with China."
1112	TRUMP	A lot of that is because they devalue their currency.
1113	TRUMP	What I said to the New York Times, is that, "we have great power, economic power over China and if we wanted to use that and the amount  where the 45 percent comes in, that would be the amount they saw their devaluations that we should get."
1114	TRUMP	That we should get.
1115	TRUMP	What I'm saying is this, I'm saying that we do it but if they don't start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so that our companies can compete and we don't lose all of these millions of jobs that we're losing, I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China.
1116	TRUMP	Who the hell has to lose 505 billion dollars a year?
1117	CAVUTO	I'm sorry, you lost me.
1118	TRUMP	It's not that complicated actually.
1119	CAVUTO	Then I apologize.
1120	CAVUTO	Then I want to understand, if you don't want a 45 percent tariff, say that wasn't the figure, would you be open  are you open to slapping a higher tariff on Chinese goods of any sort to go back at them?
1121	TRUMP	OK, just so you understand  I know so much about trading about with China.
1122	TRUMP	Carl Icahn today as you know endorsed.
1123	TRUMP	Many businessmen want to endorse me.
1124	CAVUTO	I know...
1125	TRUMP	Carl said, "no, no  " but he's somebody  these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.
1126	TRUMP	If these are the kinds of people  we should use our best and our finest.
1127	TRUMP	Now, on that tariff  here's what I'm saying, China  they send their goods and we don't tax it  they do whatever they want to do.
1128	TRUMP	They do whatever what they do, OK.
1129	TRUMP	When we do business with China, they tax us.
1130	TRUMP	You don't know it, they tax us.
1131	TRUMP	I have many friends that deal with China.
1132	TRUMP	They can't  when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.
1133	TRUMP	If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal  so we don't have an equal playing field.
1134	TRUMP	I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.
1135	TRUMP	I'm a free trader.
1136	TRUMP	I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.
1137	TRUMP	I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.
1138	TRUMP	I sell tens' of millions of
1139	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1140	TRUMP	.
1141	TRUMP	I love China.
1142	TRUMP	I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.
1143	CAVUTO	So you're open to a tariff?
1144	TRUMP	I'm totally open to a tariff.
1145	TRUMP	If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.
1146	TRUMP	You can't deal in China without tariffs.
1147	TRUMP	They do it to us, we don't it.
1148	TRUMP	It's not fair trade.
1149	KASICH	Neil, Neil  can I say one thing about this.
1150	KASICH	I'm a free trader.
1151	KASICH	I support NAFTA.
1152	KASICH	I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.
1153	KASICH	And we do need China  Donald's right about North Korea.
1154	KASICH	I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.
1155	KASICH	But what he's touching  talking about, I think has got merit.
1156	KASICH	And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...
1157	TRUMP	I'm happy to have him tonight...
1158	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1159	KASICH	For too long  no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.
1160	KASICH	And guess what?
1161	KASICH	The worker's out of a job.
1162	KASICH	So when they  be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?
1163	KASICH	Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.
1164	KASICH	I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.
1165	KASICH	And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need  we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.
1166	KASICH	And I want to just suggest to you.
1167	KASICH	How do I know this?
1168	KASICH	Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.
1169	KASICH	And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.
1170	KASICH	So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.
1171	KASICH	That's what I think we need to do.
1172	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1173	CAVUTO	All right.
1174	RUBIO	But on this point, if I may add something on this point.
1175	RUBIO	We are all frustrated with what China is doing.
1176	RUBIO	I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.
1177	RUBIO	China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.
1178	RUBIO	If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.
1179	RUBIO	So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.
1180	RUBIO	It begins with tax reform.
1181	RUBIO	Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.
1182	RUBIO	Let's allow companies to immediately expense.
1183	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1184	RUBIO	It continues with regulatory reform.
1185	RUBIO	Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.
1186	RUBIO	How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?
1187	RUBIO	It needs to be repealed and replaced.
1188	RUBIO	And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.
1189	RUBIO	That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.
1190	TRUMP	Neil, the problem...
1191	BARTIROMO	We're getting...
1192	TRUMP	... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.
1193	TRUMP	It would just  you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.
1194	TRUMP	We just can't do it any longer.
1195	CAVUTO	He is right.
1196	CAVUTO	If you put a tariff on a good, it's Americans who pay.
1197	BUSH	Absolutely.
1198	TRUMP	You looking at me?
1199	BUSH	Yeah.
1200	BARTIROMO	Prices go higher for...
1201	TRUMP	Can I tell you what?
1202	TRUMP	It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.
1203	TRUMP	They're never going to let it happen.
1204	TRUMP	Japan, the same thing.
1205	TRUMP	They are devaluing  it's so impossible for  you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu.
1206	TRUMP	Kamatsu is a tractor company in Japan.
1207	TRUMP	Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu tractors now because they've devalued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.
1208	TRUMP	And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.
1209	TRUMP	And that's why we have to use Carl and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.

1211	BUSH	Here's  apart from the  apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.
1212	BARTIROMO	Yeah.
1213	BUSH	So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes  the equivalent of it goes to China.
1214	BUSH	Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?
1215	BUSH	Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?
1216	BUSH	Of course, they would.
1217	BUSH	This would be devastating for the economy.
1218	BUSH	We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.
1219	BARTIROMO	Real quick, Senator  go ahead, Senator Cruz.
1220	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1221	BARTIROMO	And then we have to get to tax reform.
1222	TRUMP	And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?
1223	TRUMP	Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb  I tell you what, we don't need that.
1224	AUDIENCE	Boo.
1225	TRUMP	We don't need that.
1226	TRUMP	That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.
1227	TRUMP	And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.
1228	TRUMP	And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.
1229	TRUMP	They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.
1230	TRUMP	They don't want them made here.
1231	TRUMP	They want those planes made in China.
1232	BUSH	They're a mile away from here.
1233	TRUMP	That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.
1234	BARTIROMO	Thank you, Governor Bush.
1235	BARTIROMO	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
1236	BARTIROMO	Very briefly.
1237	BUSH	My name was mentioned.
1238	BUSH	My name was mentioned here.
1239	BUSH	The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.
1240	BUSH	You can  if you  you flew in with your 767, didn't you?
1241	BUSH	Right there, right next to the plant.
1242	TRUMP	No, the new planes.
1243	TRUMP	I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.
1244	BARTIROMO	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
1245	BUSH	When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...
1246	BARTIROMO	Thank you, Mr. Trmup.

1251	BARTIROMO	Senator briefly.
1252	CRUZ	Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.
1253	CRUZ	Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.
1254	CRUZ	Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.
1255	CRUZ	You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.
1256	CRUZ	They discussed how  how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.
1257	CRUZ	They're protectionist.
1258	CRUZ	But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.
1259	CRUZ	So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...
1260	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1261	CRUZ	...and here's the critical point, Maria  the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're borderadjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.
1262	CRUZ	It's taxfree  a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers  and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.
1263	CRUZ	It's like a tariff, but here's the difference if we impose a tariff, China responds.
1264	CRUZ	The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...
1265	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
1266	CRUZ	...tariffs that come against us.
1267	CRUZ	It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...
1268	UNKNOWN	Maria...
1269	CRUZ	... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.
1270	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1271	BARTIROMO	We've got to get to tax reform, gentlemen.
1272	BARTIROMO	We've got to get to tax reform, and we've got to get to the...
1273	UNKNOWN	Yeah, but I want to talk about taxes.
1274	BARTIROMO	... we've got to get to the national debt as well.
1275	BARTIROMO	Coming up next, the growing national debt, the war on crime, tax reform.
1276	BARTIROMO	More from North Charleston, South Carolina, when we come right back.
1277	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
1278	BARTIROMO	Welcome back to the Republican presidential here in North Charleston.
1279	BARTIROMO	Right back to the questions.
1280	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1281	BARTIROMO	Governor Christie, we have spoken much about cutting spending, given the $19 trillion debt.
1282	BARTIROMO	But according to one report, America needs $3.6 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020.
1283	BARTIROMO	Here in South Carolina, 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient, costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs.
1284	BARTIROMO	What is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank?
1285	CHRISTIE	Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.
1286	CHRISTIE	Here's  here's our plan.
1287	CHRISTIE	We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.
1288	CHRISTIE	If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world  and we double tax, as you know.
1289	CHRISTIE	And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.
1290	CHRISTIE	And who can blame them?
1291	CHRISTIE	They pay tax once overseas.
1292	CHRISTIE	They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.
1293	CHRISTIE	So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those specialinterest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given  bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a onetime repatriation of that money.
1294	CHRISTIE	Bring the money  the $2 trillion  back to the United States.
1295	CHRISTIE	We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.
1296	CHRISTIE	And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.
1297	CHRISTIE	It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.
1298	CHRISTIE	It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.
1299	CHRISTIE	And  and  and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.
1300	CHRISTIE	You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.
1301	CHRISTIE	He's penalized  and doesn't understand.
1302	CHRISTIE	In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.
1303	CHRISTIE	You've seen middleclass wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.
1304	CHRISTIE	That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.
1305	CHRISTIE	We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.
1306	CHRISTIE	And remember this  I'm credible on this for this reason Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.
1307	CHRISTIE	We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.
1308	CHRISTIE	We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.
1309	CHRISTIE	All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.
1310	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.
1311	BARTIROMO	Dr. Carson...
1312	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1313	BARTIROMO	...it is true U.S. companies have $2 trillion in cash sitting overseas right now.
1314	BARTIROMO	That could be used for investment and jobs in America.
1315	BARTIROMO	Also, several companies right now are pursuing mergers to move their corporate headquarters abroad, and take advantage of much lower taxes.
1316	BARTIROMO	What will you do to stop the flow of companies building cash away from America, and those leaving America altogether?
1317	CARSON	Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.
1318	CARSON	A flat tax for everybody  no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.
1319	CARSON	You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.
1320	CARSON	You know, I  my  my mother taught me this.
1321	CARSON	You know, she only had a thirdgrade education, but  you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.
1322	CARSON	I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.
1323	CARSON	In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.
1324	CARSON	But...
1325	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1326	CARSON	... you know, the  the  the fact of the matter is  you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations  because every regulation is a tax, it's a  on goods and services.
1327	CARSON	And it's the most regressive tax there is.
1328	CARSON	You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up  you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.
1329	CARSON	A rich person does not.
1330	CARSON	Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.
1331	CARSON	And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our  our  our people like this.
1332	CARSON	And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.
1333	CARSON	It's not the evil rich people.
1334	CARSON	It's the evil government that is  that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.

1336	BARTIROMO	Thank you, sir.
1337	BARTIROMO	Senator Rubio...
1338	TRUMP	Maria  Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.
1339	TRUMP	It's one of the biggest problems our country has.
1340	TRUMP	Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs  leave them behind.
1341	TRUMP	They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.
1342	TRUMP	But they can't get along.
1343	TRUMP	They can't even make a deal.
1344	TRUMP	Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.
1345	TRUMP	We have to do something.
1346	TRUMP	Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.
1347	TRUMP	So many companies are going to leave our country.
1348	BARTIROMO	Which is why we raised it.
1349	BARTIROMO	Senator Rubio?
1350	BARTIROMO	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
1351	TRUMP	Thank you.
1352	BARTIROMO	One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare.
1353	BARTIROMO	What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure?
1354	RUBIO	Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.
1355	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1356	RUBIO	Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.
1357	RUBIO	I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.
1358	RUBIO	It's called the value added tax.
1359	RUBIO	And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.
1360	RUBIO	Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.
1361	RUBIO	And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.
1362	RUBIO	Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.
1363	RUBIO	Now, you can support one now that's very low.
1364	RUBIO	But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.
1365	RUBIO	Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.
1366	RUBIO	And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.
1367	RUBIO	When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.
1368	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1369	BARTIROMO	Thank you senator.
1370	CRUZ	Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.
1371	BARTIROMO	Senator Cruz, yes.
1372	BARTIROMO	You were meant to.
1373	BARTIROMO	Yes, of course.
1374	CRUZ	Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.
1375	CRUZ	A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.
1376	CRUZ	This is a business flat tax.
1377	CRUZ	It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.
1378	CRUZ	It goes away.
1379	CRUZ	It enables us to eliminate the death tax.
1380	CRUZ	If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.
1381	CRUZ	We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.
1382	CRUZ	And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.
1383	CRUZ	Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.
1384	CRUZ	Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.
1385	CRUZ	My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.
1386	CRUZ	Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.
1387	CRUZ	We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...
1388	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
1389	CRUZ	...the mandates and have a simple flat tax.
1390	CRUZ	The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.
1391	CRUZ	I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.
1392	BARTIROMO	Thank you senator.
1393	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1394	RUBIO	But that's not an accurate description of the plan.
1395	RUBIO	Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.
1396	RUBIO	Someone's going to be collecting this tax.
1397	RUBIO	In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?
1398	RUBIO	That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.
1399	RUBIO	The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.
1400	RUBIO	Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.
1401	RUBIO	They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.
1402	RUBIO	So there are people watching tonight in business.
1403	RUBIO	If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?
1404	RUBIO	You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.
1405	RUBIO	And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.
1406	RUBIO	You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.
1407	RUBIO	Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.
1408	RUBIO	But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...
1409	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
1410	RUBIO	...and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.
1411	RUBIO	Now, you've got Europe.
1412	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1413	BARTIROMO	Thank you senator.
1414	BARTIROMO	I have to get to a question for Mr. Trump.
1415	CRUZ	Maria...
1416	BARTIROMO	Yes.
1417	CRUZ	Maria, I'd just like to say...
1418	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1419	CHRISTIE	Maria, I'd like to interrupt this on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.
1420	CHRISTIE	Do you remember that, everybody?
1421	CHRISTIE	This was a question on entitlements.
1422	CHRISTIE	And the reason  and the reason...
1423	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1424	CHRISTIE	...no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.
1425	CHRISTIE	Here's the thing.
1426	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1427	CHRISTIE	The fact is, the reason why...
1428	RUBIO	If you'll answer the
1429	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1430	RUBIO	core question.
1431	CHRISTIE	... the fact is  the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.
1432	CHRISTIE	It's a hard problem.
1433	CHRISTIE	And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this  avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.
1434	CHRISTIE	Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.
1435	CHRISTIE	Bernie Sanders has already said it.
1436	CHRISTIE	And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.
1437	CHRISTIE	We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress  this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.
1438	CHRISTIE	A Republican Congress did that.
1439	CHRISTIE	And the fact is it was wrong.
1440	CHRISTIE	And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.
1441	CHRISTIE	We need to reform Social Security.
1442	CHRISTIE	Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.

1459	BARTIROMO	Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president?
1460	BARTIROMO	With such vast wealth, how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize America's interest first?
1461	TRUMP	Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.
1462	TRUMP	As you too know, I know I built a very great company.
1463	TRUMP	But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.
1464	TRUMP	It's peanuts.
1465	TRUMP	I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.
1466	TRUMP	I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.
1467	TRUMP	Run the company kids, have a good time.
1468	TRUMP	I'm going to do it for America.
1469	TRUMP	So I would  I would be willing to do that.
1470	BARTIROMO	So you'll put your assets in a blind trust?
1471	TRUMP	I would put it in a blind trust.
1472	TRUMP	Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.
1473	TRUMP	If that's a blind trust, I don't know.
1474	TRUMP	But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.
1475	BARTIROMO	Thank you sir.
1476	TRUMP	Thank you.
1477	CAVUTO	Governor Christie, going back to your U.S. Attorney days, you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy.
1478	CAVUTO	So I wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country.
1479	CAVUTO	Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said, "most local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by Washington."
1480	CAVUTO	Former NYC Police Chief Ray Kelly, says that, "police are being less proactive because they're being overly scrutinized and second guessed and they're afraid of being sued or thrown in jail."
1481	CAVUTO	What would you do as president to address this?
1482	CHRISTIE	Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
1483	CHRISTIE	He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.
1484	CHRISTIE	He said, "there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."
1485	CHRISTIE	Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.
1486	CHRISTIE	That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.
1487	CHRISTIE	Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to  remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.
1488	CHRISTIE	This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.
1489	CHRISTIE	Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.
1490	CHRISTIE	I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.
1491	CHRISTIE	That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.
1492	CHRISTIE	And this president turns his back  this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.
1493	CHRISTIE	And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.
1494	CHRISTIE	This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.
1495	CHRISTIE	Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.
1496	CHRISTIE	I'd say, "General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively.
1497	CHRISTIE	Make our streets safe again.
1498	CHRISTIE	Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."
1499	CHRISTIE	We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.
1500	CHRISTIE	I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.
1501	CAVUTO	Thank you governor.
1502	CAVUTO	Governor Kasich, as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state, what do you make of Chicago's move recently to sort of retrain police?
1503	CAVUTO	Maybe make them not so quick to use their guns?
1504	KASICH	Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the cochair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.
1505	KASICH	She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.
1506	KASICH	And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.
1507	KASICH	And they came back with 23 recommendations.
1508	KASICH	One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.
1509	KASICH	And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.
1510	KASICH	Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for  for training.
1511	KASICH	But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.
1512	KASICH	Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not  not to lose their life.
1513	KASICH	Their family is waiting for them.
1514	KASICH	At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.
1515	KASICH	See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.
1516	KASICH	But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.
1517	KASICH	And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.
1518	KASICH	And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.
1519	KASICH	It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.
1520	KASICH	And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.
1521	KASICH	Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.
1522	KASICH	I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget that paid down a halfatrillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.
1523	KASICH	You've got to bring people together.
1524	KASICH	You've got to give people hope.
1525	KASICH	And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.
1526	KASICH	And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.
1527	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1528	CAVUTO	Thank you, Governor.
1529	BARTIROMO	Senator Rubio?
1530	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1531	BARTIROMO	Under current law, the U.S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina.
1532	BARTIROMO	The CBO says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years.
1533	BARTIROMO	Why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work?
1534	RUBIO	Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.
1535	RUBIO	And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.
1536	RUBIO	This issue is not about that anymore.
1537	RUBIO	First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.
1538	RUBIO	And here's why.
1539	RUBIO	There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.
1540	RUBIO	And not just green cards.
1541	RUBIO	They're looking  they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.
1542	RUBIO	They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.
1543	RUBIO	They're looking  they're looking to manipulate our  the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.
1544	RUBIO	So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.
1545	RUBIO	So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.
1546	BARTIROMO	So your thinking has changed?
1547	RUBIO	The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.
1548	RUBIO	Twentyfour months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.
1549	RUBIO	They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.
1550	RUBIO	The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.
1551	RUBIO	Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.
1552	RUBIO	We know this for a fact.
1553	RUBIO	They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.
1554	RUBIO	And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.
1555	RUBIO	This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.
1556	BARTIROMO	Thank you, Senator.
1557	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1558	CRUZ	But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.
1559	CRUZ	We had Boko Haram.
1560	CRUZ	We had Hamas.
1561	CRUZ	We had Hezbollah.
1562	CRUZ	We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.
1563	CRUZ	It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.
1564	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1565	BARTIROMO	Thank you, Senator.
1566	CRUZ	It is also the case that that RubioSchumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.
1567	CRUZ	It enabled him  the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.
1568	CRUZ	I think that's a mistake.
1569	CRUZ	That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.
1570	CRUZ	And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.
1571	CRUZ	I voted yes to suspend that.
1572	CRUZ	Marco voted on the other side.
1573	CRUZ	So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.
1574	RUBIO	Maria, let me clear something up here.
1575	RUBIO	This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.
1576	RUBIO	Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.
1577	RUBIO	You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.
1578	RUBIO	You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.
1579	RUBIO	You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.
1580	RUBIO	And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.
1581	RUBIO	I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.
1582	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1583	RUBIO	That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.
1584	RUBIO	When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.
1585	RUBIO	Edward Snowden is a traitor.
1586	RUBIO	And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.
1587	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1588	RUBIO	And one more point, one more point.
1589	RUBIO	Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.
1590	RUBIO	Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
1591	RUBIO	In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.
1592	RUBIO	Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.
1593	RUBIO	If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.
1594	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1595	BUSH	There's  look, there's 
1596	CAVUTO	Gentlemen, gentlemen 
1597	CRUZ	I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.
1598	CRUZ	There's no way he launches 11 attack 
1599	CAVUTO	Very quick, very quick.
1600	CRUZ	I'm going to  he had no fewer than 11 attacks there.
1601	CRUZ	I appreciate your dumping your
1602	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1603	CRUZ	research folder on the stage.
1604	RUBIO	No, it's your record.
1605	CRUZ	But I will say 
1606	CAVUTO	Do you think they like each other?
1607	CRUZ	 at least half of the things Marco said are flatout false.
1608	CRUZ	They're absolutely false.
1609	AUDIENCE	Boo.
1610	CRUZ	So let's start  let's start with immigration.
1611	CRUZ	Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.
1612	CRUZ	Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.
1613	CRUZ	I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.
1614	CRUZ	Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.
1615	CRUZ	I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.
1616	CRUZ	And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.
1617	CRUZ	What he said, and he said it in the last, it's simply not true.
1618	CRUZ	And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.
1619	CAVUTO	All right, gentlemen, we've got to stop.
1620	CAVUTO	I know you are very passionate about that.
1621	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1622	CAVUTO	Governor Bush, fears have gripped this country obviously, and you touched on it earlier since the San Bernardino attacks.
1623	CAVUTO	Since our last , the national conversation has changed, according to Facebook data as well.
1624	CAVUTO	Now this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after the issues of Islam, homeland security and ISIS now loom very large.
1625	CAVUTO	The FBI says Islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication.
1626	CAVUTO	Now the CEO of Apple, Governor, Tim Cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private, period.
1627	CAVUTO	Do you agree, or would you try to convince him otherwise?
1628	BUSH	I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators  back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.
1629	BUSH	The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.
1630	BUSH	We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff 
1631	CAVUTO	Would you answer this question?
1632	BUSH	Oh, I'll talk about that, too.
1633	BUSH	But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.
1634	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1635	CAVUTO	Fair enough.
1636	CAVUTO	So Tim Cook  so Tim Cook says he's going to keep it private.
1637	BUSH	I got that.
1638	BUSH	And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.
1639	BUSH	There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.
1640	BUSH	They understand that there's a national security risk.
1641	BUSH	We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.
1642	BUSH	We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.
1643	BUSH	This is the first priority.
1644	BUSH	The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.
1645	BUSH	Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is  that is just shameful.
1646	BUSH	23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?
1647	BUSH	So it's not just the government  the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.
1648	BUSH	We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.
1649	BUSH	That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.
1650	CAVUTO	But if Tim cook is telling you no, Mr. President.
1651	BUSH	You've got to keep asking.
1652	BUSH	You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.
1653	BUSH	If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship 
1654	CAVUTO	Do you ask or do you order?
1655	BUSH	Well, if the law would change, yeah.
1656	BUSH	But I think there has to be recognition that if we  if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other  other technology companies outside the United States.
1657	BUSH	And what we want to do is to control this.
1658	BUSH	We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.
1659	BUSH	So there's a lot of balanced interests.
1660	BUSH	But the president leads in this regard.
1661	BUSH	That's what we need.
1662	BUSH	We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.
1663	CAVUTO	Governor, thank you.
1664	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1665	BARTIROMO	When we come right back, closing statements.
1666	BARTIROMO	Stay with us.
1667	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
1668	BARTIROMO	Welcome back.
1669	BARTIROMO	Candidates, it is time for your closing statements.
1670	BARTIROMO	You get 60 seconds each.
1671	BARTIROMO	Governor John Kasich, we begin with you.
1672	KASICH	You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.
1673	KASICH	You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.
1674	KASICH	But all of my career, you know, having been raised in  by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.
1675	KASICH	You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.
1676	KASICH	Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hardearned taxpayers whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.
1677	KASICH	Look, that's who I stand up for.
1678	KASICH	That's who's in my mind...
1679	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
1680	KASICH	...And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.
1681	KASICH	Thank you.
1682	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1683	CAVUTO	Governor Bush?
1684	BUSH	Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?
1685	BUSH	Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.
1686	BUSH	Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.
1687	BUSH	Credibility counts.
1688	BUSH	There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.
1689	BUSH	I've done it.
1690	BUSH	I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.
1691	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1692	BARTIROMO	Governor Chris Christie?
1693	CHRISTIE	Maria, Neil, thank you for a great tonight.
1694	CHRISTIE	When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week  the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.
1695	CHRISTIE	They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.
1696	CHRISTIE	They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.
1697	CHRISTIE	I love this country.
1698	CHRISTIE	It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.
1699	CHRISTIE	We need someone to fight for the people.
1700	CHRISTIE	We need a fighter for this country again.
1701	CHRISTIE	I've lived my whole life fighting  fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.
1702	CHRISTIE	But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.
1703	CHRISTIE	I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.
1704	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1705	CAVUTO	Dr. Ben Carson?
1706	CARSON	You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.
1707	CARSON	We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.
1708	CARSON	The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.
1709	CARSON	And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.
1710	CARSON	Bencarson.com  we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.
1711	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1712	BARTIROMO	Senator Marco Rubio?
1713	RUBIO	You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.
1714	RUBIO	Our rights come from God.
1715	RUBIO	That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.
1716	RUBIO	That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.
1717	RUBIO	But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.
1718	RUBIO	This country is changing.
1719	RUBIO	It feels different.
1720	RUBIO	We feel like we're being left behind and left out.
1721	RUBIO	And the reason is simple because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.
1722	RUBIO	We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.
1723	RUBIO	And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.
1724	RUBIO	And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.
1725	RUBIO	If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.
1726	RUBIO	But if we elect the right person  if you elect me  we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.

1730	CRUZ	I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.
1731	CRUZ	I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commanderinchief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commanderin chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.
1732	CRUZ	I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.
1733	CRUZ	This will end.
1734	CRUZ	It will end on January 2017.
1735	CRUZ	And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.

1739	TRUMP	They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.
1740	TRUMP	Half of them had tears pouring down their face.
1741	TRUMP	They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.
1742	TRUMP	And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.
1743	TRUMP	It was a terrible sight.
1744	TRUMP	A terrible sight.
1745	TRUMP	And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.
1746	TRUMP	If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.
1747	TRUMP	We will make America great again.
1748	TRUMP	We will win on everything we do.
