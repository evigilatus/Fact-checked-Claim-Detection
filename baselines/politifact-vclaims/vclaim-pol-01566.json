Ted Cruz of Texas, the Republican seeking a second term against Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, portrayed O'Rourke as wildly out\u00a0of step with Texas in part, Cruz said, by standing against police officers who protect communities with their lives.\nCruz offered as backup in the pair's Sept. 21, 2018, debate at Southern Methodist University a flawed charge that O\u2019Rourke, who represents El Paso in the House,\u00a0voted against body armor for sheriffs. That's\u00a0False, we\u2019ve ruled, in that there was no such vote.\nCruz also said O'Rourke had said\u00a0he\u2019d be open to abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement. We've found that claim\u00a0Mostly True though O\u2019Rourke also has said he wouldn\u2019t eliminate the agency without another department absorbing its duties.\nCruz said next: \"And just this week, Congressman O\u2019Rourke described law enforcement, described police officers, as modern-day Jim Crow.\" Cruz called that descriptive--which refers to the post-Reconstruction practice of denying black Americans equal rights on all fronts--offensive. \"That is not Texas,\" Cruz said.\nO\u2019Rourke replied in the debate: \"What Sen. Cruz said is simply untrue. I did not call police officers modern-day Jim Crow.\"\nSo, did he?\nBy email, Catherine Frazier of Cruz\u2019s campaign told us Cruz was referring to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s reply to a question during a Sept. 19, 2018, event at Prairie View A&M University\u00a0as recapped by the conservative Daily Caller.\u00a0Frazier also noted a press release critical of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s characterization issued by the Texas Municipal Police Association.\nFacebook Live video\nTo see all that O'Rourke said, we turned to the O\u2019Rourke campaign\u2019s Facebook Live video of the Prairie View event.\nAbout 58 minutes in, O\u2019Rourke was asked a question we had trouble making out about how he\u2019d address the needs of former slaves.\nIn reply, O\u2019Rourke referred to the discovery this year of dozens of unmarked graves in Texas\u2019s Fort Bend County indicating, he said, that well after the Civil War, law officers would arrest African American residents for idling and petty crimes to fill out work crews for contractors, a notorious convict-leasing system, according to a Houston Chronicle news story.\nO\u2019Rourke said such individuals were \"people who became convicts solely by dint of the color of their skin,\" he said, under a system that was \"radically unjust.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO\u2019Rourke went on:\n\"That injustice, to many more people here that I know firsthand, continues to persist today. That system of suspending somebody, solely based on the color of their skin; searching that person solely based on the color of their skin; stopping that person solely based on the color of their skin; shooting that person solely based on the color of their skin; throwing the book at that person and letting them rot behind bars solely based on the color of their skin, is why some have called this, I think it is an apt description, the new Jim Crow.\"\nHe said next: \"We have written people off and written people out of the economic life of this country, their ability to participate in the future of the United States of America. We have literally drawn people out of their state House, their congressional, their state Senate districts solely based on the color of their skin.\"\nSome outside perspective: A 2010 book, \"The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness,\" includes a chapter in which author Michelle Alexander, of late an oped columnist for the New York Times, says the imprisonment of 1 million black American men can greatly be attributed to how police and the criminal justice system handle the pursuit, detention and prosecution of black men, many times for drug crimes oft ignored when committed by white people. It adds up to discrimination that\u2019s perfectly legal, Alexander writes, because it\u2019s based on a person\u2019s criminal record. \"In the system of mass incarceration,\" Alexander writes, \"a wide variety of laws, institutions, and practices--ranging from racial profiling to biased sentencing policies, political disenfranchisement, and legalized employment discrimination--trap African Americans in a virtual (and literal) cage.\"\nO'Rourke camp disputes Cruz's claim\nChris Evans of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign answered our inquiry with an email disputing Cruz\u2019s conclusion that O\u2019Rourke called law enforcement or police officers the new Jim Crow.\nEvans stressed that O\u2019Rourke was speaking, as he said, to the \"system.\" Evans wrote: \"As Beto has done at many forums in the past, he outlined how institutionalized inequity -- in education, in economics, in health care, in the justice system, in housing, in transportation -- has been referred to as the New Jim Crow.\"\nEvans also pointed us to an August 2018 O\u2019Rourke commentary published in the Chronicle. In it, O\u2019Rourke describes his tour of the Harris County Jail, which he calls \"part of the world\u2019s largest prison population. One that is disproportionately comprised of people of color, though we know that people of all races use illegal drugs at roughly the same rate. Many have called this the New Jim Crow, and for good reason.\" In the commentary, O\u2019Rourke goes on to talk about the share of black children with a parent in the U.S. criminal justice system and he says that such results begin with a \"school-to-prison pipeline\" starting as early as kindergarten, where a black child is far more likely than a white child to be suspended or expelled, he says.\nEvans further emailed us web links to fact-checks by NBC and the Associated Press of Cruz\u2019s debate statement, each one stating the senator oversimplified what O\u2019Rourke had said at the university.\nOur ruling\nCruz said O\u2019Rourke described police as \"modern-day Jim Crow.\"\nThis claim has an element of truth in that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s embrace of the \"new Jim Crow\" description followed his excoriation of police stops, searches and shootings he attributed to the color of a person\u2019s skin. But O\u2019Rourke also said such actions rank among ways the country systematically discriminates against black residents--extending, he said, to sentencing, economic opportuniy and to how lawmakers carve districts.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
