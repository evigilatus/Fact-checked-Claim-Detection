Committee paints an already dim picture of the system.\n\nThe mailer notes reduced hours and compares them to other metro-area counties: \"Right now, our libraries are open 44 hours per week, down from 57 hours just a few years ago. That\u2019s the lowest of any library in the four-county region.\"\n\nPolitiFact Oregon was well aware that the system has cut back in certain areas, but it surprised us that the cuts had gone so far as to put operating hours behind Clackamas, Washington and Clark counties. We thought a quick check was warranted -- and quick it was.\n\nWe checked the website for each of the counties\u2019 libraries and calculated the weekly operating hours for the main branches. Here\u2019s what we found.\n\nIn Multnomah County, the Central Library is open 44 hours each week.\n\nIn Washington County, the Hillsboro Main Library is open 64 hours each weekand the Beaverton City Library is open 63 hours.\n\nIn Clackamas County, the library system is open 52 hours a week.\n\nAnd up in Washington\u2019s Clark County, the main Vancouver Community Library is open 60 hours a week.\n\nWe \u00a0also called the group responsible for the mailer and asked them about the statement. They sent us a slightly different group of numbers -- the average number of hours a library was open in each county. Their findings supported the same conclusion: Multnomah County library hours are the lowest in the four-county region.\n\nWe find this statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10071"}
