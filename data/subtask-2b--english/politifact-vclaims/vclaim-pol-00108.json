Maybe more people should bring this into the news.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The agent was called to discuss notes he took about a drug trafficker previously involved with Guzm\u00e1n, in an attempt to highlight discrepancies between the notes and the testimony the trafficker gave during the trial.\u00a0\nAlex Cifuentes, a former Guzm\u00e1n associate, took the stand and testified that, among other Mexican officials paid off by Guzm\u00e1n, former Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto took a $100 million bribe from the kingpin. But there was no testimony about Comey, Pelosi, or any other American official.\nOur ruling\nA post on Facebook says Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n took the stand and said James Comey helped launder $150 million \"cartel money\" for Nancy Pelosi.\nThis claim is unfounded. EGuzm\u00e1n did not take the stand at his trial, and therefore could not have testified that his cartel gave millions to Comey, Pelosi or any American official.\u00a0\nThis rumor is Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00108"}
