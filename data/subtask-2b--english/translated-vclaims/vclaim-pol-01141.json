On September 11, 2001, 2,996 people died. Since 2001, 63,000 of us have been killed by illegal aliens. This is equivalent to 21 attacks of September 11.\" This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We asked the United States immigration and customs authorities about the allegation, and on 7 January, Vincent Picard, Deputy Assistant Director of the General Affairs Office of the Institute, sent Paulette Fuckett to two reports from the Agency. According to the report on enforcement and deportations at the Institute for the fiscal year 2018, the criminal records of persons arrested by the Commission for their illegal presence in the country include 2,028 homicides (387 counts and 1,641 convictions). According to the financial year 2017, the criminal record of arrested persons includes 1,886 homicides. These crimes did not necessarily occur during that fiscal year - that only means that they were registered in a person &apos; s arrest record when they were arrested that year. However, what about previous years? Picard said he had nothing to do with 2001 but said there might be more information on the Ministry of Internal Security web page on immigration data and statistics. The website contains reports on immigration enforcement procedures dating back to 2004, but does not refer to murder or murder. Alex Nowaraste, Senior Migration Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute, Liberty Think Centre, called the number nonsense, and referred to an article on the allegation on June 22, Washington Post. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer President of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. On January 12, 2021, in June, President Donald Trump said that at least 63,000 Americans had been killed since September 11. But, according to the Post, it dates back to the 2005 blog by Rep. Stif King, who \"seems to have raised the number... and since there are no good data on the number of crimes committed by persons who have migrated illegally, it has been adopted by those who look forward to putting a number on it.\" Jessica Vaughn, Director of Policy Studies at the Centre for Migration Studies, said that no one was following up on murders committed by undocumented migrants. \"I think 63,000 is meant to include deaths, not just murders,\" she said in the e-mail, \"but I don't know where you get these numbers.\" Neither do we, so we asked others studying immigration to weigh. \"I can't think of any evidence that can support a number like 63,000,\" said Randy Caps, director of research for United States programs at the Institute of Migration Policy. Elizabeth Cohen, Professor of Political Science at Syracuse University, said that the statement \"has not only repeatedly appeared to be unfounded, but even impossible to be ridiculous.\" \"It has nothing to do with any actual crime data,\" she said. We value this allegation wrong.
