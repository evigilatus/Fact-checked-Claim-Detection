It also has the highest crime rate in Florida. And this is a guy who has taken a pledge attacking our men and women in law enforcement. He will not standby them.\"\nA few moments later, Hannity said he had read that Gillum was \"not a big fan of police.\"\nDeSantis responded, \"He said police and prisons have no place in justice. It\u2019s outrageous.\"\nGillum is the Democratic candidate for Florida governor and the mayor of Tallahassee. He\u2019s up against DeSantis, a former congressman backed by President Donald Trump. We\u2019ve looked at DeSantis\u2019 and Gillum\u2019s claims about Tallahassee\u2019s crime rate as well as attacks on Gillum about an FBI probe.\nGillum never said that \"police and prisons have no place in justice.\" When we asked the DeSantis campaign what their evidence was, they pointed\u00a0to Gillum\u2019s relationship with the group Dream Defenders. We'll explain the connection, but Gillum never said those words.\u00a0\nThe pledge\nDeSantis often zeroes in on the social justice group Dream Defenders, a group that has raised concerns about racial profiling since the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin, the young unarmed African-American teenager shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla.\nGillum\u2019s support for the Dream Defenders goes back to the group\u2019s formation, although both the Dream Defenders and Gillum have said they do not share the entirety of each other\u2019s platforms.\nA Gillum spokesman told the Miami Herald in late September that the Dream Defenders were leaders for the struggle for social justice in Florida, but that Gillum did not agree with several of the group\u2019s positions.\n\nDream Defenders spokeswoman Nailah Summers agreed, telling the Herald that the Dream Defenders were \"more left-leaning\" than Gillum and that they disagreed on topics including the role of police and prisons, the functionality of borders and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nWhen DeSantis said Gillum signed a pledge attacking law enforcement, he was referring to the Freedom Papers elected officials pledge. This pledge is a two-page document that calls on those who sign it to pledge not to take a penny from the NRA or the Geo Group, a private prison operator.\n\"I will fight for a Florida that divests from prisons, detention centers, guns and police and invests in the basic needs and safety of its people, especially its children,\" the pledge stated. \"I will fight for a reallocation of our state budget from police and prisons to good food, affordable housing, quality health care and public education.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGillum signed the pledge in June 2018, along with the three other Democratic gubernatorial candidates at the time, according to Dream Defenders spokeswoman Nailah Summers. The candidates signed the pledge following a debate co-hosted by the Dream Defenders. Summers said 30 Florida politicians have signed the pledge.\nThe Freedom Papers elected officials pledge is a different document than the Freedom Papers, a longer document that outlines the Dream Defenders\u2019 views in more detail. However, the two-page elected officials pledge contains the line, \"I pledge my support to the Freedom Papers.\"\nThe Freedom Papers is a 20-page document that makes a series of statements about social and economic issues, particularly those that affect poor people, minorities and immigrants. The papers raise concerns about underpaid teachers, income inequality, rent hikes and calls for open elections and an end to violence.\n\nThe Freedom Papers document includes a few paragraphs that are highly critical of police and prisons, stretching back to the days when police helped catch escaped slaves.\n\n\"Police and prisons have no place in 'justice,'\u00a0\"\u00a0this longer document stated. \"Police and prisons aren\u2019t just racist but they work to enforce the separations of rich and poor. True safety can\u2019t be found where it was never meant to.\"\n\nThe papers also state that prisons separate rich from poor.\n\"We deserve real safety over our cities, our states, our homes, our schools, our workplaces, and our community centers,\" the pledge stated.\nGillum\u2019s relationship with police as mayor\nGillum has called for criminal justice reform, but his record shows that he wants to work with law enforcement.\nIn a 2014 Tallahassee Democrat op-ed, Gillum talked about a ride-along he went on with Tallahassee police and implored community members to support them.\n\"For the sake of my children and yours, I hope you will join me in supporting our law-enforcement officers and investing your time and talents for the betterment of our community,\" Gillum wrote at the time.\nDuring Gillum\u2019s tenure as mayor, Tallahassee added more than 50 police officer positions. Tallahassee started several law enforcement-related programs focused on fostering relationships between community members and police and on improving recidivism rates while Gillum was mayor and earlier while he was a city commissioner.\nOur ruling\nGillum did sign the Dream Defenders elected officials pledge, but we could find no evidence of him saying \"police and prisons have no place in justice.\" That\u2019s a line from the Dream Defenders\u2019 longer document, the Freedom Papers.\nThe pledge Gillum signed focuses on divesting from prisons, guns and police and putting money into safety and education. Signees also agree not to take money from the NRA or a private prison group.\nThe longer document, the Freedom Papers, expands on the Dream Defenders\u2019 views with 20-pages of statements about a range of social and economic issues.\nThe two-page elected officials pledge contains the line, \"I pledge my support to the Freedom Papers.\" However, Gillum and the Dream Defenders maintain that they do not see eye-to-eye on several issues and that the Dream Defenders are \"more left-leaning\" than Gillum.\n\nWe rate this Mostly False. \u200b\n Share the Facts 2018-11-06 14:42:49 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Says that Andrew Gillum said, \"Police and prisons have no place in justice.\"    Ron DeSantis candidate for Florida governor    in an interview Tuesday, October 30, 2018 2018-10-30    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01295"}
