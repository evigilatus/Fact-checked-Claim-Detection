Among them was Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., who joined the cause on Twitter.\n\"By 4th grade, 86 percent of African-American boys and 82 percent (of) Hispanic boys are reading below proficiency levels,\" she\u00a0tweeted.\nIt\u2019s an eye-opening statistic, and one that spoke to Obama\u2019s new effort. But is it accurate?\nThe Nation\u2019s Report Card\nWhen we contacted Slaughter\u2019s office, a spokesman pointed us to\u00a0a White House fact sheet\u00a0with an almost identical claim: \"Large disparities remain in reading proficiency, with 86 percent of black boys and 82 percent of Hispanic boys reading below proficiency levels by the fourth grade \u2013 compared to 58 percent of white boys reading below proficiency levels.\"\nIn turn, the White House said the numbers came from\u00a0The Nation\u2019s Report Card, a federal assessment conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Since 1969, the National Assessment of Educational Progress has tracked student achievement in such subjects as reading, mathematics, science, writing, U.S. history, and by a variety of demographics, including race.\nBroadly,\u00a0proficiency is defined\u00a0by the government as students being \"able to integrate and interpret texts and apply their understanding of the text to draw conclusions and make evaluations.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2013 report card, there is a significant disparity between white and minority students in math and reading scores at the fourth-grade level.\nWhile 46 percent of white students were proficient in reading, just 18 percent of black students and 20 percent of Hispanics meet the same benchmark.\nFor each group, those numbers have risen quite a bit since 1990, when 16 percent of white fourth-graders were reading at a proficient level, compared to just 1 percent of blacks and 5 percent of Hispanics.\nGaps in mathematic scores have been similar. Meanwhile, Asian/Pacific Islanders outpace all races and ethnicities in both reading and math in the fourth grade.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that there\u2019s no improvement in proficiency levels by the time students finish the eighth grade. Similar numbers of students start behind and stay behind.\nBut Slaughter\u2019s tweet specified black boys in particular. To get those statistics,\u00a0we had to dive deeper into the report.\nUsing\u00a0the government\u2019s data, we found that 14 percent of black boys and 18 percent of Hispanic boys read at a proficient level in the fourth grade. This means that 86 percent of black boys and 82 percent of Hispanic boys were not proficient. So Slaughter\u2019s numbers are right on.\nBy contrast, about 58 percent of white boys are considered proficient.\nAnd what about girls? They perform slightly better across all races than boys.\nOur ruling\nSlaughter said that \"by 4th grade, 86 percent of African-American boys and 82 percent (of) Hispanic boys are reading below proficiency level.\" Government data backs up that depressing statistic, though it\u2019s worth noting that the U.S. has at least seen improvements across all races since the early 1990s.
