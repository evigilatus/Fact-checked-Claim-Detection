In the absence of widespread testing, most Americans have supported such mitigation efforts.\u00a0\nBut scattered protests have also captured attention and led pundits like Ingraham and fellow Fox News host Tucker Carlson to call for an end to more statewide shutdowns\u00a0as U.S. deaths due to the coronavirus top 70,000.\nMembers of the White House coronavirus task force have encouraged social distancing. President Donald Trump credited nationwide closures with saving \"millions of lives\" as recently as May 3 in a town hall.\nBut while it\u2019s difficult to assess the exact impact of social distancing policies so far, experts told us Ingraham\u2019s claim is wrong. There\u2019s plenty of science behind social distancing.\n\"It\u2019s one of the few tools that we know works in the case of an unknown, novel virus such as this,\" said Thomas Novotny, an epidemiologist at San Diego State University.\nFox News did not respond to requests for comment.\nStudies of the 1918 influenza are informative\nWith the coronavirus still running its course, studies on the impact of mitigation efforts are only just emerging. But past respiratory disease outbreaks have been informative, experts said.\nOn her show, Ingraham cited a recent\u00a0study on the effects of lockdowns in western Europe and a clip of Stanford University biologist Michael Levitt calling European lockdowns a \"mistake.\"\nShe also highlighted a recent CBS News interview in which Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said mitigation \"didn\u2019t work as well as we expected.\"\nGottlieb has himself encouraged social distancing, however. And the study of European countries, which hasn\u2019t yet been peer reviewed, doesn\u2019t say social distancing is futile, but rather that social distancing measures \"have approximately the same effects\" as full lockdowns.\n\"My work does not question the efficiency of social distancing,\" said Thomas Meunier, the researcher behind the study.\u00a0\nCharles Branas, chair of the epidemiology department at Columbia University, said social distancing \"is a fundamental way to interrupt the transmission of disease in populations.\"\n\"To say that there was no scientific basis for believing that is like saying there is no scientific basis for epidemiology,\" he said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of limiting person-to-person contact dates back centuries. But non-pharmaceutical interventions, as the practices we associate with social distancing are known, became official U.S. policy under President George W. Bush in 2007, according to the New York Times.\nThe shift came after researchers looked back at government responses to the 1918 influenza, which killed about 675,000 Americans. Elaine Nsoesie, assistant professor of global health at Boston University, said that pandemic saw many social distancing measures put in place, including bans on gatherings and school closures.\nRELATED: What the 1918 flu pandemic shows us about social distancing\nOne study in the Journal of the American Medical Association examined social distancing in 43 cities for about 24 weeks in 1918 and 1919. It found cities suffered less when they implemented social distancing swiftly, comprehensively and for a sustained period of time.\nA second study, published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focused on 17 U.S. cities. It found those with early, layered interventions had flatter epidemic curves and peak death rates about 50% lower than cities that didn\u2019t take similar steps.\nThose findings became the basis for the policies adopted by the Bush administration and later modified under President Barack Obama.\nStudies of the 1918 pandemic \"indicated that early implementation of multiple social distancing interventions was associated with a lower death rate at the peak of the epidemic,\" Nsoesie said.\nDavid Hamer, professor of global health and medicine at Boston University, told us Ingraham\u2019s claim is incorrect: \"Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been shown to help reduce the overall number of cases and virus-related mortality.\"\u00a0\nThat\u2019s because shrinking gatherings \"should lead to less exposure to potentially infected individuals and thus reduce the potential for transmission,\" Hamer said.\nOther evaluations of social distancing, handwashing, mask-wearing and related interventions have been compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, especially as they relate to influenza pandemics. (See page 23 of this 2017 CDC document, for example.)\nNow more than ever, it\u2019s important to sort fact from fiction.
