Gov. Nathan Deal wants you to Go Build.\n\nPeople are struggling to find work in today\u2019s jobs-poor economy, Deal said Jan. 10 as he outlined his 2012 agenda during the governor\u2019s yearly State of the State address. Yet jobs are abundant in skilled trades, which don\u2019t require four-year degrees. \u00a0\n\nDeal\u2019s solution: Go Build Georgia, a major jobs and education initiative that makes students aware of skilled trades and helps train them.\n\n\"Right here in metro Atlanta, Siemens has been unable to fill approximately 200 skilled trade positions in the fields of manufacturing automation, health care technology, transportation systems and technical service,\" Deal said.\n\nThey\u2019re having trouble filling 200 open positions? Right here in metro Atlanta?\n\nThe state\u2019s unemployment rate is stuck near 10 percent. Please, tell us more, we asked the governor\u2019s office.\n\n\"Skilled trade\" positions are jobs that don\u2019t require a bachelor\u2019s degree but do require specialized knowledge and training. They include commercial construction workers, pipe fitters, draftsmen and electricians. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA governor\u2019s office spokeswoman referred us to Siemens for more details about the positions. The company posts job openings on its website.\n\nSome 130 positions were listed for Siemens\u2019 locations in Alpharetta, Atlanta, Norcross and five other locations in the metro area. This number was short of Deal\u2019s estimate by about 70 positions.\n\nSiemens spokeswoman Camille Johnston said that is because not all open jobs are posted. Some are only advertised within the company. Other listings are taken off the website if they have enough candidates. A few have one listing but multiple openings.\n\nA difference of 70 positions seemed high to us, but her explanations did not seem unreasonable. We opted to take them at face value. \u00a0\n\nThen we pored over the online listings.\n\nFor the most part, they did not advertise positions in the skilled trades. More than 60 percent explicitly required at least a four-year degree, and many of these listings sought candidates with majors in science or technology. One posting was for an attorney.\n\nEven positions that appeared open to candidates without bachelor\u2019s degrees favored employees with four-year degrees or were typically held by people with four-year degrees, according to the listings. One preferred candidates with a Master of Business Administration or other post-graduate degree.\n\nIn fact, we found only 12 posted listings that did not require or favor candidates without bachelor\u2019s degrees. That\u2019s about 10 percent of the online jobs listings. \u00a0\n\nMost of them were squarely in the \"skilled trade\" category. For instance, two were for heating, ventilation and air conditioning workers. One was for a draftsman, and three sought field service workers.\n\nTwo of them were not. One Atlanta position was for a training assistant who would handle tasks such as billing and scheduling. Another was for an administrative assistant in Roswell. \u00a0\n\nWe emailed and called Siemens to ask why most of the listed positions were not for skilled trade workers, but we received no response.\n\nDeal spokeswoman Stephanie Mayfield said that regardless of the actual numbers, the state needs skilled workers, and the governor\u2019s office is glad Siemens offered to work with Georgia to solve this problem. \u00a0\n\nSiemens may be struggling to fill some 200 jobs in metro Atlanta, but the overwhelming majority are not skilled trade positions as Deal claimed. They\u2019re geared to candidates with bachelor\u2019s or post-graduate degrees.\n\nWe rule Deal\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n A $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11688"}
