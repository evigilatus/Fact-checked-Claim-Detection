Scott Walker in the fall. Citing the priest cases, Walker has called on Flynn to drop out of the race.\nFor years, accused Catholic priests were routinely transferred from one parish or school to another, and many of them continued molesting children. Certainly, transfers were actually ordered by the archdiocese, not by lawyers such as Flynn who were retained by the archdiocese.\nBut was Flynn, whose campaign has been dogged by questions about the priest scandal, involved in those transfers?\nFlynn represented the archdiocese from 1989 to 2004 and was heavily involved in priest abuse cases.\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe history\nEarlier on the day of the debate, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigative columnist Daniel Bice posted a column about Flynn\u2019s work. The article detailed cases indicating Flynn, to some extent, was part of the transfers:\nInformed of Adamsky transfer: In an August 1992 letter, the vicar for clergy in the archdiocese contacted Flynn about the transfer of Father Raymond Adamsky in response to allegations of abuse. A bishop \"suggested that I send a copy of the new assignment for Fr. Ray Adamsky for your records,\" the letter said. \"We hope this will be satisfactory to all involved. Thanks for meeting with us. It was good to have an update on everyone.\" Adamsky was transferred 11 times during his work for the church.\nFlynn\u2019s campaign told Bice the meeting was not about Adamsky's transfer, but about legal claims regarding Adamsky and others.\nIn any case, Flynn was at least aware of the transfer.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll our fact checks in the governor\u2019s race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nLawyers involved: Adamsky had his ministry restricted by a bishop in 1991, but was allowed to continue to serve as priest at the church and have access to its school. Church officials removed Adamsky from the parish in 1992 after two more children complained to their principal about the priest's \"rough physical contact\" with the pair.\n\nThe archdiocese's website says: \"Negotiations between lawyers took place about what kind of assignment would be agreeable, and it was determined that chaplain work at a retirement home would be possible.\"\nSo, Flynn was not named, but he was a key attorney for the archdiocese at the time.\nAnother meeting: In a case involving a different priest, Father Mike Krejci, Flynn is listed in court records as being in a November 1994 meeting with Krejci, the archbishop and other archdiocese officials. Krejci had just been accused in a letter from another priest of sexually abusing a child.\nFlynn\u2019s campaign told Bice the records do not indicate that the meeting involving Flynn had to do with a reassignment of Krejci. The decision regarding the priest's future was made at a meeting the next day, without Flynn in attendance, the campaign contended.\nSo, here, too, Flynn is centrally involved in a priest case and attended a meeting about one of the accused priests the day before the priest\u2019s transfer.\nResponse from Flynn\nFor this fact check, Flynn campaign manager Bryan Kennedy told us that despite the documents cited in Bice\u2019s column, there are no letters from Flynn \"directing the archbishop to transfer priests nor are there directives or memos that Matt signed off on that would show his approval or collaboration in making decisions about transfers.\"\nFair enough. But it\u2019s also clear Flynn was heavily involved in cases where accused priests were transferred.\nOur rating\nFlynn says he was \"not part of transferring\" any priests accused of sexual abuse.\nThere is no evidence to show that Flynn advised the archdiocese to transfer priests accused of molesting children to different parishes.\nBut Flynn was a top attorney for the archdiocese during a period of years when a number of such transfers were done, and he had at least some involvement with cases in which accused priests were transferred.\nWe rate Flynn\u2019s statement Half True.
