They're going to have to hold on to it and never let go of it. They have not legitimately won it.\"\nLimbaugh, whom Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2020, did not respond to a request for comment.\nHe argued on his radio show that the heavy security presence and hundreds of thousands of flags lining the National Mall in place of a celebratory crowd were \"replacements for people\" because Biden\u2019s camp was not \"confident a bunch of people would show up.\"\u00a0\nLimbaugh also posited that Biden had too little support to welcome a large Inauguration Day crowd because \"nobody showed up at Joe Biden political rallies.\"\u00a0\nIn reality, the small, socially distanced inauguration crowd was a reflection of the pandemic that has killed more than 400,000 Americans. And the National Guard was summoned in large numbers to prevent a repeat of the Capitol riot that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment a week earlier.\nBiden\u2019s campaign events, too, were often deliberately kept small due to concern about the coronavirus, which spreads easily in big crowds.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, Limbaugh claimed the election was \"arranged rather than legitimately sought and won,\" and he said Biden was \"credibly accused of winning\" thanks to \"massive election fraud.\"\u00a0\nPolitiFact has examined many such claims and rated them Pants on Fire.\nThe presidential election was not unusually close. Biden, the former vice president, won 306 electoral votes, compared with 232 for Trump. He received 81 million votes overall to Trump\u2019s 74 million.\n\"Joe Biden legitimately won the presidency,\" said Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine. \"There is no credible evidence to the contrary, that any state in the Union wrongly reported its election results or had election irregularities that called the results into question. There was no massive voter fraud.\"\nTrump refused for months to concede defeat, even as dozens of judges in courtrooms across the country rejected lawsuits from his campaign and allies to flip the results. The challenges failed in part because they did not present evidence of the widespread fraud that was alleged.\nSome states held recounts, but the results did not change. After states certified their results, the nation\u2019s electors cast their ballots and sealed Biden\u2019s victory in December.\nState and local election officials, including in key swing states like Georgia, maintained that the results they certified were accurate. International observers said they saw no evidence of fraud, and so did Trump\u2019s former attorney general, William Barr. Trump\u2019s most senior cybersecurity official said the election was the \"most secure in American history.\"\nPolitiFact fact-checked a wide array of claims alleging election fraud. We found no evidence to suggest that Biden did not win \"legitimately,\" as Limbaugh claimed.\nWe rate Limbaugh\u2019s statement Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19205"}
