Leggings made a fashion comeback. Democrats took back the Oregon House. And that fall, The Oregonian reported on a bunch of state legislators for accepting lavish trips to Maui courtesy of the Oregon Beer and Wine Distributors Association.\n\nOne of those legislators was state Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Hillsboro, who faces Rep. Chuck Riley, D-Hillsboro, in the Nov. 2 general election. To no one\u2019s surprise, Riley is bringing up Starr\u2019s stay at the palatial Grand Wailea Hotel in May 2002 to attend the distributors\u2019 conference.\n\nRiley\u2019s ad, \"On Our Side,\" starts with a photo of Starr and a pretty Hawaiian view in the background. A female announcer, backed by a breezy ukulele, says: \"What\u2019s not pretty? The ethics commission ruled he broke the law by letting lobbyists foot the bill.\" \u00a0(There also appears to be a pork chop dressed up to resemble a pineapple on the table.) \u00a0\n\nBut it\u2019s not true.\n\nThe state ethics commission did fine Starr in 2007 -- but not for going to Hawaii on the dime of a lobbying group. Rather, Starr was fined for failing to disclose the 2002 conference on annual disclosure forms filed with the state. At the time, it was perfectly legal for lobbyists to treat legislators to such trips and for legislators to accept them. The distributors, led by lobbyist Paul Romain, paid about $18,000 in 2002 and in 2004 to fly, feed, shelter and entertain a total of seven state legislators at two conferences.\n\nStarr attended the four-day conference with his wife. The ethics commission fined him $300 for not disclosing that trip and another education trip to Israel paid by another organization.\n\nStarr said at the time that he didn\u2019t report the trip because the lobbyist, Romain, told him he didn\u2019t have to. He amended his reports, showing that the beer and wine distributors paid $961 for airfare, $1,007 for his hotel room, $300 for food and beverages and $250 for golf.\n\nMolly Woon, a spokeswoman for Senate Democrats, defends the statement. Perhaps PolitiFact Oregon is overthinking the issue? \u00a0\"He broke the law for taking a lobbyist-paid trip; you can say more, but that's the basic fact,\" she said.\n\nWe have to disagree. Starr broke no laws or ethics rules by taking the trip at a lobbyist\u2019s expense, which is what the Democrats\u2019 ad claims. What Starr did wrong was fail to report the trip. The statement is False.\n\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before Joe Biden signed an order \u201cfor all federal vehicles\u201d to be electric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14184"}
