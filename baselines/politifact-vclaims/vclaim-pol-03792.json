He or she might choose to stay there because of its amenities, its convenient location four blocks from the White House, or to build up goodwill with the president who owns the hotel.\nIf his hotel accepts the foreign government\u2019s bill payment for the dignitary\u2019s stay, some critics argue Donald Trump would, as president, be in violation of the Constitution\u2019s provision to block foreign influence. The emoluments clause says that no officer of the United States can accept gifts, titles or emoluments (salary) from a foreign government, without permission from Congress.\nBut lawyers for Trump say that the critics are mistaken, because this clause doesn\u2019t apply to fair-value exchanges, such as paying standard market rates for a hotel room.\n\"These people are wrong,\" said Morgan Lewis & Bockius partner Sheri Dillon at a Jan. 11 press conference. \"This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument.\"\nDespite this position, Dillon said Trump\u2019s company would donate to the U.S. Treasury any profits earned from foreign governments through his business, to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. And his company will also refrain from engaging in any new deals with foreign governments while Trump is president.\nBut given the backlash about Dillon\u2019s interpretation of the emoluments clause from some legal commentators, we decided to fact-check her claim that fair-value exchanges \u2014 like paying a hotel bill \u2014 are not emoluments.\nThe answer we found isn\u2019t very satisfying: Some legal scholars say Dillon has a point, others say she doesn\u2019t.\nThe emoluments clause hasn\u2019t come before the courts in any meaningful way, so there aren\u2019t any past judicial rulings to look at for guidance about the scope of the emoluments clause. Whether the clause even applies to the president remains an unsettled legal question.\n\"Anything anyone tells you about the emoluments clause is a matter of opinion,\" said Seth Barrett Tillman, a professor at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the clause.\nBefore we go any further, here\u2019s the full text of the emoluments clause, found in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution:\n\"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\"\nWhat that means is someone holding a government position cannot take an emolument, meaning payment or salary, from a foreign government. A clear example of an emolument would be if a government employee made a decision favorable to a foreign country and, in exchange, a representative of that country\u2019s government gave the American employee a check.\nDillon\u2019s law firm explained in a Jan. 10 white paper why they believe this clause doesn\u2019t ban, say, a foreign government paying a fair rate to stay in a hotel owned by a government worker.\nThe authors of the Morgan, Lewis & Bockius white paper wrote that the Constitution\u2019s authors understood the term \"emoluments\" to mean \"a payment or other benefit received as a consequence of discharging the duties of an office.\" So paying a hotel to offer standard hotel services is not an emolument because the service provided is not associated with the office of a president.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also wrote that in the early 1800s, the country nearly amended the Constitution to extend the emoluments clause to all citizens, not just federal office holders. They did not see evidence that anyone thought that extending the clause\u2019s reach would inhibit citizens\u2019 ability to engage in fair commerce with foreign governments or their representatives.\nTillman said he largely agrees with the Morgan, Lewis & Bockius white paper \u2014 especially because the money would be flowing into the Trump Organization, not Trump\u2019s pockets directly.\n\"The concern is related to the concept of office,\" he said. \"It\u2019s not about business deals like staying in hotels when the price is fixed.\"\nThat, however, is far from the final word. Several legal scholars wrote in a Brookings memo that they read the emoluments clause as applying to fair-value exchanges.\nThe clause is intended to block any arrangement with a foreign state that could result in a profit or benefit for the officeholder because it carries the risk of \"improper foreign influence,\" as the officeholder\u2019s legitimate business interests would depend, at least in part, on the foreign state, the authors wrote. They are Norman L. Eisen, chief White House ethics lawyer under Barack Obama, Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush, and Laurence Tribe, a law professor at Harvard University.\nThe historical evidence shows, they argue, that the drafters of the Constitution wanted the emoluments clause to be broad in scope, in order to limit even the possibility of corruption. For example, the phrasing in the clause specifically refers to emoluments \"of any kind whatever.\"\n\"Wholly apart from any actual quid pro quo arrangements or demonstrable bribes or payoffs, the emoluments clause will be violated whenever a foreign diplomat stays in a Trump hotel or hosts a reception in one,\" they wrote.\nDespite their position, Eisen, Painter and Tribe note that \"there is not yet a firm consensus on this point.\"\nAll of this discussion assumes that Trump, as president, would be subject to the emoluments clause. But that\u2019s still not a certainty, and there is evidence, both modern and from the time of the Constitution\u2019s ratification, that supports either side.\nWe should note that hotel stays are not the only way representatives of foreign states interact with Trump\u2019s business. He has worked with foreign governments to do business in around 20 countries. The Bank of China is a tenant in Trump Tower in Manhattan.\nDepending on how his plans to separate himself from his business play out, these dealings could present, if not a violation of the emoluments clause, a serious conflict of interest.\nOur ruling\nDillon, a lawyer for Trump, said under the Constitution, \"Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument.\"\nWhether the emoluments clause would include a situation where representatives of a foreign state paid for a room in one of Trump\u2019s hotels is an unanswered legal question. We encountered reasonable arguments on both sides, and there isn\u2019t any judicial precedent to guide us to the right answer.\nMaybe this question will get answered in a meaningful way during the Trump administration. But for now, we rate the statement\u00a0Half True.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    2 6  Politifact Rating:   \"Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office.
