We found the story posted on other websites, as well.\nThe article was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to winnow fake news from users\u2019 news feeds.\nThe post \u2014 which again, is fake \u2014 said O\u2019Reilly was buying bagels in New York when three men and two women began complaining about his treatment of women.\nO\u2019Reilly was forced off Fox News Channel on April 19 and lost his show, The O\u2019Reilly Factor, after multiple reports of sexual harassment. The New York Times had reported the network paid about $13 million to settle claims.\nThe confrontation turned aggressive when the liberals (as identified in the story) attacked O\u2019Reilly, dragging him into the street and kicking him until \"until he was unconscious and bleeding.\"\nThe attackers ran off, the post said, leaving O\u2019Reilly with four broken ribs and a punctured lung. He possibly suffered \"a cardiac event,\" the story said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcept none of the details about an attack are true. There is no apparent way to contact DailyUSAUpdate.com administrators, who have hidden the site\u2019s registration information.\nThere were no reports from legitimate media sources that this event occurred, in any case. Surely such an attack would have been widely covered.\nThe hoax came about a week after other reports that Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident and Sarah Palin had been run off the road and was in a coma.\nThe fake O\u2019Reilly story originally came from TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we\u2019ve previously checked.\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake.\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn\u2019t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that \"all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\nAnd that\u2019s what we call this fake report \u2014 baloney.\nActually, we rate it Pants On Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03338"}
