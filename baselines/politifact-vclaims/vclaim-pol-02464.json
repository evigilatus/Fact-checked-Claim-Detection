During that time, the U.S. government transferred more than 700 detainees from Guantanamo, and 122 of them were \"confirmed of re-engaging\" in some sort of terrorist activity.\nEight of those transfers happened during the Obama administration. The remaining 114 \u2014 or over 92 percent \u2014 happened under George W. Bush.\nSo Trump\u2019s \"hundreds and hundreds\" is really 122 combatants spread out over 15 years.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

However, Baghdadi was not set free; he was handed over to the Iraqis in 2004, who released him some time later.\nIn a previous fact-check, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro falsely tied President Barack Obama to Baghdadi\u2019s release. Baghdadi was not in U.S. custody when Obama was in office.\nThe framework for transfers was set up while Bush was president. The legal contract between the United States and Iraq guaranteed that the United States would give up custody of virtually every detainee. It would have required an extraordinary effort to have held on to Baghdadi, and there is no evidence that he was on anyone\u2019s radar.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"We have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield \u2014 including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi.\"\nTrump is overstating the number of prisoners released from Guantanamo, who were confirmed of re-engaging in some type of terrorist activity. That number is 122, not \"hundreds and hundreds.\"\nHe is also not entirely right that al-Baghdadi was \"released\" by the United States. The ISIS leader was was handed over to the Iraqi justice system, which released him some time later.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-01-31 05:39:01 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield \u2014 including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released.\"    Donald Trump President https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/state-union-speech-excerpts/   in the 2018 State of the Union speech Tuesday, January 30, 2018 2018-01-30    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02464"}
