The candidates raised very few while accusing their opponents of either supporting or opposing some of the main health-care legislation. In a campaign that fought closely for the Ninth Congressional Region of North Carolina, Republic Mark Harris followed the suit after his democratic opponent, Dan McCreedy, accused Harris of wanting to cut off social security and medical care. We recently verified McCready &apos; s claim and found it half real. Harris did not support any plans that would immediately cut off these programmes, but he expressed his desire for \"overhall\" from social security. The Facebook announcement, paid for by Harris, directly addresses this claim. \"My competitor is attacking me, claiming that I want to cut off social security and medical care, when it was liberal Democrats who supported his campaign that cut $716 billion in medical care to fund their health care scheme: Obama Health Care,\" said the ad. The announcement has been in effect since October 22, 2018. We specifically verify whether $716 billion in medical care has been \"cut\" to pay for Obama's health care, also known as the Affordable Care Act, the Health Act approved by President Barack Obama in 2010. It is. This is the prosecution Poletti Fruitte, which has been investigated several times. Politicians use the figure of $716 billion since at least 2012. In 2012, Polyte Fact checked a similar claim from the presidential candidate Met Romney and evaluated it by half of Tru. Paul Ryan, Vice-President Romney in 2012 and now Speaker of the House of Representatives, made a similar allegation in that year, which was often misappreciated. Finally, Arkansas Goff filed a claim in 2015. Mike Hackabe was evaluated in half right. There's a lot more to it. Politicians often use the right figure but the wrong context. :: Asked where Harris &apos; figure of $716 billion came from, where Jason Williams, the campaign manager, shared a link from the Washington Post blog in 2012. According to the article, Met Romney, the former Republican presidential candidate, is right to say that Obamakari has cut the medical care budget by $716 billion. While there was a reduction in expenditure, there was no loss of services or a reduction in the quality of services. But that article is more than six years old, as are the government figures on which it relies. Let's take a fresh look. Reducing benefits? That Harris' claim makes it seem like the anti-corruption law limits the benefits of the elderly. According to Matthew Fedler of the Brookings Institution, a left-wing think tank, there is no evidence of that. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" \u2022 1 February 2021 \"The implication when making this allegation is that these medical-care beneficiaries have been affected. This hint is not accurate. These changes, which reduced the medical care received by doctors and hospitals, were \"Fidler said. The aim of this law was in part to reduce future cost growth in medical care, which offset some of the costs of the law. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, from 2011, states that health care legislation \"will permanently reduce the growth of the payment rates of medical care for most services.\" \"You may suggest that reductions in payments may have reduced the quality of care. I don't think there's much evidence of that, \"Fidler said. \"Many other changes were aimed at giving hospitals and doctors incentives to provide better care.\" Fidler said that people were paying more for medical services than they needed to cover the costs before the medical examination. After ACA, premiums and joint payments declined, providing money for medical care recipients. The figure of $716 billion represents an estimate of the amount of savings to be made. However, this was a projection, and while Obama Carrie had been in effect for years, Polyte Fact could not find a recent estimate of what actually happened. Any bill to repeal or replace passed through Congress has in fact included the same provisions, even Republican plans, according to Trisha Neuman, Senior Vice-President of the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Health Care Policy Organization. \"Post proposals for ACA cancellation retained medical care savings. It was like in both ways to criticize ACA savings, but to keep them in subsequent proposals, \"Newman said about Republicans. Newman also said that the Anti-Narcotics Act had improved drug coverage and preventive services for users of medical care. The number of Harris in our classification would have been closer to the truth if it were in 2012 rather than 2018. However, its use of the figure also gives the wrong impression. In fact, the number represents a projection of the amount of federal funds that Obama care will provide over the years, mainly at the expense of insurance companies, medical providers and hospitals. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.
