Here\u2019s their exchange:\n\nGregory: \"Let me ask you about social policy. You've notably said that you're a big fan of Lady Gaga, and even the song Born This Way. There's a lot of debate about a gay marriage pledge in Iowa. And related to that, I wonder, do you agree with some of those who are behind that, that being gay is a choice?\"\n\nPawlenty: \"Well, I have two teenage daughters who listen to Lady Gaga, so I'm subjected to it. And it has some good qualities to it. But as to, as to gay marriage, I'm in support of traditional marriage as between a man and a woman. I have not supported the issues of allowing gay couples to have the same benefits ... as traditional couples. And so this is an issue in Iowa and across the whole country. But I've stood in favor of traditional marriage and traditional relationships in that regard.\n\nGregory: \"Is being gay a choice?\"\n\nPawlenty: \"Well, the science in that regard is in dispute. I mean, the scientists work on that and try to figure out if it's behavioral...\"\n\nGregory: \"Right.\"\n\nPawlenty: \"...or if it's partly genetic.\"\n\nGregory:\"What do you think?\"\n\nPawlenty: \"Well, I defer to the scientists in that regard.\"\n\nGregory: \"So you, you think it's not a choice.\"\n\nPawlenty: \"Well, there is no....\"\n\nGregory: \"That you are, as Lady Gaga says, you're born that way.\"\n\nPawlenty: \"There's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic. We don't know that. So we don't know to what extent, you know, it's behavioral, and that's something that's been debated by scientists for a long time. But as I understand the science, there's no current conclusion that it's genetic.\"\n\nWe decided to rate two of Pawlenty\u2019s statements separately. In another item, we\u2019ll look at whether scientists are \"in dispute\" about whether being gay is a choice. In this item, we\u2019ll look at Pawlenty\u2019s claim that \"there's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic.\"\n\nPawlenty\u2019s word choice -- \"genetic\" -- is pivotal for rating the accuracy of his claim. The way he phrased it, he\u2019s pretty close to accurate. But if he\u2019d said instead that \"there's no scientific conclusion that (being gay) is biological,\" he would have been incorrect.\n\nSince the significance of this distinction may not be obvious at first glance, we\u2019ll explain it in detail here.\n\nIf a trait is \"genetic,\" it means that it comes from the genes encoded in your DNA. Furthermore, arguing that something is genetic suggests that there\u2019s a single, or at least a well-defined, genetic source -- what has sometimes been called a \"gay gene.\"\n\nBy contrast, if a trait is \"biological\" in origin, it means that it can stem from any number of factors, such as hormone levels or how a fetus develops in the uterus. It would not, however, originate primarily from environmental factors such as childhood experiences -- what one might call the \"nurture\" part of the nature/nurture divide.\n\nThe typical way of figuring out whether something is caused by genes is through twin studies. Since identical twins share 100 percent of their DNA, any observed differences in traits would be presumed to be influenced by environment rather than genetics. So if being gay was truly, and exclusively, a genetic trait, every set of identical twins should either be both straight, or both gay.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s not the case. Even the studies with the strongest linkage show about a 50 percent correlation in sexual orientation between identical twins. Other studies have shown lower rates. Based on these findings, scientists agree that being gay is not caused exclusively by genes.\n\nHowever, being gay does appear to have a genetic component -- just a weaker one. The same study that showed roughly a 50 percent correlation in sexual orientation between identical twins also showed weaker correlations for fraternal twins, who share only 50 percent of their genes on average. That\u2019s pretty much what you\u2019d expect to see if genetics played a role, but not a dominant one.\n\n\"Pawlenty is surely right that a genetic explanation has not been proven, and indeed genetics is likely a modest influence on sexual orientation,\" said Michael Bailey, a Northwestern University psychologist who undertook the twin study that showed a 50 percent correlation, as well as another that showed lower correlations.\n\nBut if being gay is not primarily determined by genes, it doesn\u2019t mean that its origin isn\u2019t biological.\n\nBailey and others find some of the most convincing evidence of the inherent nature of sexual orientation in long-term studies of the rare cases in which hormonally normal boys are reared as girls due to either accidents or certain medical conditions that have left them less obviously male. He said there have been six published cases of hormonally normal males reassigned early as females, and invariably, their sexual orientation was toward females. That\u2019s consistent with their prenatal gender, not with their rearing as girls.\n\nThe point of these studies is that sexual orientation -- one\u2019s attractions and impulses -- runs very deep and is resistant to social and environmental factors.\n\n\"If you can't make a male attracted to other males by cutting off his penis, castrating him, and rearing him as a girl, how likely is any social explanation of male homosexuality?\" Bailey asks.\n\nScientists freely acknowledge that the precise pathways for imparting sexual orientation are not yet understood. \"Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation \u2013 heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality -- is determined by any particular factor or factors,\" the American Psychological Association has put it.\n\nHowever, just because scientists don\u2019t know the specific mechanisms that cause sexual orientation doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t confident that they are biological in nature.\n\n\"We do not really know in any definitive way the mix between biological and other explanations, but the evidence for biological contributions is as good or better than for any other factor,\" said Clinton W. Anderson, the associate executive director of the American Psychological Association and the director of its lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender concerns office. \"Some have suggested that it\u2019s how you were reared or a failure in bonding to the same-sex parent. But the research to support that is abysmal.\"\n\nJack Drescher, a distinguished fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, added that \"you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a reputable scientist who would exclude some aspect of biology\" from the causes of homosexuality. Drescher is a member of the working group on sexual and gender-identity disorders for the forthcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM 5-- the authoritative reference work in the field.\n\nAt this point, we need to note an important caveat: What we\u2019ve been discussing here applies primarily to gay men. There is actually no solid scientific consensus about the causes of female homosexuality, because the research has been much less extensive.\n\nWe struggled with the question of how we should factor in what one might call the lesbian exception. Neither Pawlenty nor Gregory specifically referred to either gay men or gay women in their comments. Ultimately, we concluded that the science of what causes women to be gay was too unformed to draw any solid conclusions, so we set it aside as a factor in our ratings.\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nPawlenty said \"there's no scientific conclusion that (being gay) is genetic.\" On that specific question, we found broad agreement that Pawlenty was correct. Scientists told us that genetics may play a role in determining sexual orientation, but the current evidence suggests that it\u2019s not the dominant factor and may ultimately be shown to play just a modest role.\n\nBut a modest role is still different from no role. And we also think that viewers of the interview might be led to believe that because homosexuality is not primarily caused by genes, there\u2019s no biological cause. In reality, most scientists do believe that sexual orientation is caused by biology, rather than by choice. On balance, we rate Pawlenty\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
