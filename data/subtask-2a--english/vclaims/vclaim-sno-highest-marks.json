  "vclaim": "A student working his way through college is afraid that he will not have enough time outside of work to adequately prepare for an upcoming exam.  He begins taking amphetamines in order to stay awake and study throughout the day while continuing to work at night.  A few weeks later, he sits for his exam and leaves the room confident that he has done extremely well.  The next day, he is summoned to the instructor\u2019s office and asked to explain why he handed in an exam consisting of nothing but sheets of paper covered with his own name."
