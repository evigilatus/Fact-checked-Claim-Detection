A liberal group called \"The Others 98%\" published a photo showing two people in McDonald's costumes who looked absolutely stunned. (The picture is a video footage of Saturday night.) In the type of headlines the words were, \"McDonald workers in Denmark have a union. Made $45,000 a year.\" The text in the mail itself was somewhat more detailed. He said: \"McDonald employees in Denmark have a union, which is paid $21 an hour ($45,000 a year), and they have a five-week paid vacation.\" The article contained a link with an opinion article by Reuters from a Danish McDonald's worker, Louise Marie Ranzo. \"I work for McDonald's and I make $21 an hour.\" Rantzaw wrote. \"An agreement between our trade union and the company guarantees that workers over the age of 18 are paid at least $21 per hour. Employees under 18 years of age earn at least $15.\" We wanted to check whether the Danish McDonald workers belonged to trade unions and actually earned $45,000 a year. We found the union contract, so this part is simple. For $45,000 per year, there are problems, but if the figure does not exist, it is very close. An annual report issued in 2012 by Denmark McDonalds gives some general figures. (We used Google translation to understand the main sections.) Some 4,000 Danish work under the Golden Arches, almost all of them, about 3,500 work every hour, and very few work full-time. In its report, the company collected those part-time hours and converted them into the equivalent of full-time hours. In 2011, DKK 530 million was paid for the equivalent of 2,040 full-time workers. This is different from talking about what a normal worker gets. However, when you calculate, the company paid an average full-time sports worker about $46,700 that year. Denmark &apos; s statistics are the government agency that tracks labour information. With regard to the category of escorts corresponding to food services, the annual remuneration in 2012 was over $41,000. This applies to all companies, not just McDonald's. On an hourly basis, this translates into about $20 an hour. This is in line with a survey conducted by two economists, Orlee Aschenfelter at Princeton University and Stepan Gorajda at the Economic Research Centre in Prague. Since 1998, MacDonald &apos; s wages have been followed around the world. * (Use Mac &apos; s large price as a way of comparing the worker &apos; s wage with the cost of living, as in, how much Mac &apos; s large is not paid for one hour.) Jurajda Bondit told Fakt that their last survey found that the Danish McDonald workers made about $20 an hour. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy: January 20, 2021, hunting here is that those hourly wages only give an annual income of $41,000 or more if a person is working full-time, and we know that most people work part-time. We asked McDonalds, both in Denmark and in America, about the average annual income. A spokesman for the company sent us the statement, \"Our hourly wages depend on the employee's role and age,\" Lars Esberg, a professor at the University of Aarhus, Denmark, who studies low-paid jobs in his country. Esberg said that the average income was not available to the public, but he sent us a copy of the last trade union contract in McDonald's. The lowest hourly rate is DKK 115, or $20.70. Any person who works after 6 p.m. or Sundays is paid a higher wage. \"Because many will work strange hours, the full-time equivalent of $45,000 seems right to me,\" said Esberg. Usually, when the pay scale rises in McDonald's in Europe, the most common challenge is that people there pay higher taxes. That's true, but even though wages are more than twice what they are in the United States, taxes are not. According to the United States Labour Statistics Office, the average American fast food worker earns about $9 an hour. Compare that to $20.70 paid in Denmark. According to OECD, the average tax burden in Denmark is 38.2 per cent, while in America it is 31.3 per cent. So the taxes are about five times higher. Most people, if given the option, will accept a 20% increase in taxes in exchange for double the amount. This still does not make it a comparison between apples and apples because the cost of living is higher in Denmark. Both Yurajda and Esberg said that this also reduces the wage advantage of the Danish McDonald workers over their American counterparts. But at the end of the day, according to Princeton Orleigh Aschenfelter's economies, they still come forward. \"I'm sure that Danes McCorkers are very happy,\" said Achenfelter. As part of the workforce, however, McDonald &apos; s staff in Denmark was much lower than in the United States. He also said that Danishs had used wages for many decades as part of an informed policy to reduce inequality. The other group said 98% that McDonald's Danish workers had a union and won $45,000 a year. Membership in the union is quite accurate. The question of remuneration applies to some workers, but it is certain that the majority work very few hours to obtain this amount. However, the average figures provided by McDonald &apos; s for Denmark, government statistics and data analysed by economists who studied the earnings of the Danish McDonald workers generally support this figure. The article did not specifically mention that all McDonald workers received $45,000 a year, and the broader point was that it was much better to turn the burgers in Copenhagen than Cleveland. We're mostly assessing the claim right. Update: McDonald's company sent a statement after publication of this cheque", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07353"}
