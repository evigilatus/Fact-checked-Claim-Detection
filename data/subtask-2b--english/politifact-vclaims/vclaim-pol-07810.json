But you aren\u2019t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, you\u2019re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.\u2019\n\"WIT is adamant that there\u2019s no immediate danger, however. \u2018Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we\u2019d start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.\u2019\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

The former disclaimer\u00a0said, \"National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.\" (Snopes also debunked the solar panels story on May 25, 2014.)\nWe checked with a solar energy expert to make sure we weren\u2019t missing something, and they agreed that the sun-draining claim is pure hokum.\n\"The sun is really big, really far away, and constantly producing mind-boggling amounts of energy through nuclear fusion. It couldn\u2019t care less about your puny solar panel,\" said Mark Thurber, associate director of Stanford University\u2019s Program on Energy and Sustainable Development.\nThe closer you read the National Report item, the more obvious the satire becomes. It turns out that the Wyoming Institute of Technology only exists as a website, with an obviously fake backstory. \"WIT,\" according to the website, was originally founded in 1943 as the Wyoming Institute of Education and Nuclear Energy Research (WIENER, get it?) and has purportedly invented such technologies as \"smellovision,\" the \"space toilet,\" the world\u2019s first computer virus, \"the world\u2019s first 100% organic artificial nose, which was created for pop-star Michael Jackson in 1999,\" and the \"E-condom.\"\nOur ruling\nAs is often the case, what you see on social media isn\u2019t accurate. It\u2019s not true that \"solar panels drain the sun\u2019s energy.\" This claim originated with a satirical site, and it has no basis in science.
