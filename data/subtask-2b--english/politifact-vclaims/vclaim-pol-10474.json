A majority has said that nearly every time the poll has been conducted -- 10 times since 1992. Only in December 2001 did more respondents (49 percent) say they were confident about their children\u2019s future than were not confident (42 percent).\n\nA similar poll conducted for CBS News and the New York Times in April asked 957 adults, \"Do you think the future of the next generation of Americans will be better, worse, or about the same as life today?\"\n\nThe \"worse\" answer had a plurality: 47 percent. Twenty-four percent answered \"better\" and 23 percent said \"about the same.\" That poll, conducted six times since 2009, also reflected widespread pessimism, with \"worse\" being the most frequent answer every time.\n\nFinally, a USA Today/Gallup poll of 1,012 adults conducted in May surveyed whether Americans are satisfied with \"the opportunity for the next generation of Americans to live better than their parents.\" Nearly six in 10 Americans -- 58 percent -- said they were dissatisfied, while 40 percent said they were satisfied.\n\n Our ruling\n\nRomney said that \"the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future.\"\n\nWe found three polls that support his claim. Americans are indeed pessimistic about their children\u2019s prospects. But that\u2019s nothing new, according to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. For at least the last 20 years, Americans have expected that our kids would be worse off than we are. Romney cast this national outlook as specifically an Obama-era phenomenon. We rate his statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10474"}
