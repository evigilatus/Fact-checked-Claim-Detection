He\u2019s even been accused of being anti-American for not wearing an American flag pin.\n\n\nHere\u2019s the latest chapter: The Barack Obama Revolucion.\n\n\nThis one originates with a local Fox 26 story in Houston. The camera follows two Obama volunteers whooping it up as they enter a new campaign office. The reporter talks about the importance of the Hispanic vote in Houston. Though it went unmentioned, many viewers had a moment of \u201cWait, is that a....?\u201d Yep, a large Cuban flag with the image of Che Guevara on it can be seen prominently hanging behind the desk of one of the volunteers.\n\n\nErnesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara was a Latin American guerrilla leader and Marxist revolutionary, a major figure in the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro in the late 1950s. Although hailed in some leftist circles as a legendary icon of rebellion, the Argentine-born doctor is also reviled by many Cubans for ruthlessly ordering the execution of more than 150 prisoners in Cuba without a fair trial.\n\n\nNot surprisingly, it didn\u2019t take long for the Fox video to make the rounds on the Internet. More than 70,000 people viewed the video on YouTube. Many blogs picked up the story and ran with it under headlines such as \u201cBarack Obama Loves Che Guevara\u201d at\n\nthis site\n\nand \u201cBarack Obama is a Che Fan\u201d at\n\nthis one.\n\nAnd the photos have been widely spread via chain e-mails that suggest Obama supports Che Guevara.\n\n\nOn Feb. 11, Orlando Sanchez, a native of Cuba and treasurer of Houston\u2019s Harris County weighed in: \u201cI was outraged to see an image of Che arrogantly displayed over the Cuban flag hanging in the Houston offices of the Obama for President.\u201d\n\n\nSanchez, a Republican, is the first Cuban-American elected countywide in Harris County, which boasts the largest concentration of Latinos in Texas. He requested, \"on behalf of all Cuban Americans\" that Obama demand the flag's removal.\n\n\nAfter the whole thing blew up on the Internet, Fox 26 in Houston went back and interviewed the woman who had the flag hanging behind her desk.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer name is Maria Isabel and on an Obama Web page she describes herself as a precinct captain for Barack Obama in Houston. When asked about the flag, Isabel said, \u201cIt\u2019s a distraction. I don\u2019t have time to talk about the Cuban flag.\u201d\n\n\nIsabel, who said she was born in Cuba, cut off the interview when the reporter asked if she wanted to apologize for the flag.\n\n\n\u201cApologize for what? I think it is a waste of time and it (the interview) is taking too much of my time.\u201d On Feb. 12, the Obama campaign sought to put the issue to rest.\n\n\n\u201cThis is a volunteer office that is not in any way controlled by the Obama campaign,\u201d a statement from the campaign reads. \u201cWe were disappointed to see this picture because it is both offensive to many Cuban-Americans -- and Americans of all backgrounds -- and because it does not reflect Senator Obama\u2019s views. Barack Obama has been very clear in putting forward a Cuba policy that is based on one principle: freedom for the Cuban people.\u201d\n\n\nA disclaimer now appears below the Web site with the Fox 26 video of the women opening the office. \u201cThe office featured in this video is funded by volunteers of the Barack Obama Campaign and is not an official headquarters for his campaign.\u201d\n\n\nNick Shapiro, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said he has heard that the flag was taken down. \u201cBut honestly, it\u2019s not our office,\u201d he said on Feb. 21, 2008. \u201cIt is not an official campaign office. She is a volunteer precinct captain. Her views do not reflect the views of the campaign.\u201d\n\n\nThe question is whether or not it's accurate to say \u201cObama Loves Che Guevara,\u201d or any of the many variations of that theme now floating around the Internet, based upon this one decoration in this one office put up by this one volunteer. We say no. We say Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16329"}
