An excerpt: \u201cStraus Republican lieutenant Jim Keffer did mail pieces for Democrat Mark Strama to help him defeat his Republican opponent.\u201d\nKeffer hails from Eastland, some 160 miles northwest of Austin, whose legislative delegation includes Strama. Did a rural Republican really back the re-election of an urban colleague from the other party?\nWhen we asked for elaboration, Barton shared copies of what he said were two political leaflets from a Strama re-election campaign.\nOne of the documents includes pro-Strama quotations from former State Comptroller John Sharp, a Democrat; the Democrat-leaning Austin Chronicle; a resident of Strama\u2019s district and Keffer, who\u2019s quoted saying: \u201cMark Strama serves his district, not any one political party.\u201d\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the other document, Sharp and Keffer are also featured. Keffer is quoted saying Strama \u201cworked with Republicans to cut property taxes and keep our public schools open. We don't always agree on every issue, but we agree on the need to put the interests of Texas ahead of partisan politics.\u201d\nResponding to our query, Keffer confirmed he\u2019d given Strama a hand, saying: \u201cWhether you\u2019ve got an R or a D behind your name doesn\u2019t mean you are most qualified.\u201d\nFinally, we contacted Strama, who told us by e-mail that Keffer, who had authored school funding legislaton that Strama co-sponsored, \u201cdidn\u2019t \u2018do\u2019 mail pieces in the sense of paying for them,\u201d but agreed to be quoted in a mailer \u201cfunded by my campaign about my bipartisan approach to the school finance bill.\u201d\nThough Strama paid for the campaign materials, Keffer willingly helped out his Democratic colleague. Barton\u2019s statement checks out as Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14811"}
