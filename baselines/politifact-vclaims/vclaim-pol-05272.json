Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., joined the party in a Feb. 22 statement.\n\"One would have to go back more than a century to find a scenario where a president\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court was confirmed by the opposition party in the Senate when the vacancy occurred during an election year,\" Flake said. \"I'm not about to break new ground in the Senate, particularly when any nominee could so drastically shift the balance of the court.\"\nPolitiFact has researched similar claims of late:\n\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz said in February that \"it\u2019s been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year,\" also saying that not approving a nomination in an election year is a long tradition. It\u2019s been 76 years, but these openings are rare, so it\u2019s not much of a tradition. We rated Cruz\u2019s claim Half True.\n\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio also claimed in February that \"it\u2019s been 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court Justice.\" President Ronald Reagan, in his second term, nominated Justice Anthony Kennedy in November 1987. He confirmed Kennedy while still in office in February 1988. We rated Rubio\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\n\nSo, turning back the history book once again, we decided to look at Flake\u2019s claim.\nChecks out \nFlake spokesman Jason Samuels emphasized that the Arizona senator\u2019s statement included \"confirmed by the opposition party\" and \"vacancy occurred during an election year\" when we reached out.\nSamuels referred us to the Senate\u2019s list of Supreme Court nominations going back to 1789.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on October 8, 2020 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Biden said, \"The day after I\u2019m elected I will let you know what I stand for, bc if I tell you now it will be all over the news.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Monique Curet \u2022 October 22, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts we spoke with generally agreed with Flake\u2019s claim.\nSarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University, said Flake\u2019s statement is \"technically correct.\" She noted that there are no 20th century examples of a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year that the opposition party in the Senate refused to consider.\n\"The only seat left vacant was Sherman Minton's, who resigned in October 1956, one month before the election. \u00a0The (Democratic-controlled) Senate had already adjourned for the elections, so (Republican) President Eisenhower gave William Brennan a recess appointment, and he was later nominated and confirmed in 1957,\" Binder said.\nA recess appointment isn\u2019t the same as submitting a nominee, according to Russell Wheeler, an expert on federal courts at the Brookings Institution.\n\"Eisenhower didn\u2019t submit a nominee; he recess appointed Brennan then nominated him the following January. It helped that Brennan was a Democrat,\" Wheeler said.\nThe Justice Kennedy instance aids Flake\u2019s statement too.\n\"Jeff chose his words very, very carefully. There have been vacancies during election years that were filled -- including Anthony Kennedy -- by an opposition Senate. But the vacancy occurred shortly before the election year,\" said Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"Fundamental to this statement is the reality that we have not had a vacancy occurring in an election year with an opposition Senate.\"\nOur ruling\nFlake said, \"One would have to go back more than a century to find a scenario where a president\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court was confirmed by the opposition party in the Senate when the vacancy occurred during an election year.\"\nHe\u2019s right.\nFlake\u2019s carefully crafted statement rules out potential exceptions, such as Justice Kennedy\u2019s 1988 election year confirmation, but 1987 nomination, or the 1950s case with President Eisenhower and a Democratic Senate in adjournment\u00a0when a Supreme Court vacancy came up a month before the November election. This seems to be because a vacancy just hasn\u2019t happened to occur under these circumstances.\nWe rate Flake\u2019s claim as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05272"}
