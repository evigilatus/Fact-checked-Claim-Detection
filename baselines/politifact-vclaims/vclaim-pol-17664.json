The spray is also known as MMS, or Miracle Mineral Solution, a bleaching agent that\u2019s been touted by anti-vaxxers and QAnon theorists as a \"miracle cure\" that can treat everything from autism to cancer.\nRELATED: QAnon and Donald Trump rallies: What's that about?\nThe same account tweeted about MMS in relation to the coronavirus multiple times, saying that\u00a0 drinking the solution will instantly \"kill the deadly virus.\"\nThe tweets also share a now-deleted YouTube video that told people to buy and drink the mixture.
