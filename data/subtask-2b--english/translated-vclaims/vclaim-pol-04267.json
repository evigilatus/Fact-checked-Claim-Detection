In 2006, he said, \"Oh, my God, I hope it collapses because then I can go buy some and make some money.\" What do the records show? We found many examples from 2006 to 2009 when Donald Trump spoke of a \"great opportunity\" that came with falling real estate prices. One of the first examples since 2006 is Trump's audio book. The guy who interviewed Trump for the audio book says, \"There's a lot of talk, and you've certainly heard of it too, about what's called a real estate bubble. What do you think of that gloom? \"Well first of all, I kind of hope that happens because then people like me go in and buy. You know, if you're in a good cash position -- and I'm in a good cash position today -- then people like me go in and buy like crazy,\" says in part of the sound book that CNN published. \"If there's a bubble that explodes, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money.\" Now that was before the collapse that led to the Great Recession, and it can be said, Trump was merely providing sound trade guidance. Trump faked the same view several times in 2007. However, at that stage, the country still does not see an economic disaster. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, the situation was quite different in early 2009. The Lehman Brothers Investment House had applied for bankruptcy, the largest in the history of the United States. Dao has suffered her worst weekly loss ever. Washington had already paid General Motors and Chrysler's bail. The mortgage was rising weekly. Trump was on CNN February 17, 2009, talking about the economy with the host Wolfe Blitzer and saying that the moment was a \"great opportunity.\" Blitzer asked Trump why. \"If you get something really preliminary, really good, eventually they'll be worth much more than you pay,\" explained Trump. \"I've been telling people for two years, don't buy real estate and I've been preaching it so hard. And now I'm saying, I think this is the right time. Whether you go to the market exactly or not, I can't tell you. But I think this is the right time to buy. If you have money, this is the right time to buy.\" To be clear, Trump was speaking as an investor. It was not necessarily rooted in the housing crisis. But he was in progress as he spoke. We contacted the Trump campaign and did not get any information to add to this picture. Our referee, Clinton, said Trump was one of the people who was rooted in the housing crisis. While Tramp did not welcome the tragedy of the mortgage for millions of Americans, he was optimistic about the opportunities created by the overall situation of an investor like him. Clinton's statement leaves this difference aside, but it largely matches Trump's words. We're mostly assessing this claim right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/22c6df0a-1ffa-421d-b06a-b6c208a27038", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04267"}
