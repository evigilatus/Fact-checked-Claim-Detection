We put the mayor on Philip O'Mitter to see if he changed his position on tax increases. Stone requests the Board to increase the amount of $9 cents in Richmond's real estate tax, which would set $1.29 per $100 of the estimated value. He also wants a 50 per cent tax on cigarettes. Richmond, home of the world cigarette factory Altaria, is the only major city in Virginia without a cigarette tax. The increase in real estate tax will generate $21.1 million for the budget year beginning 1 July, and the cigarette tax will increase by $3 million. In addition to the total tax increase of $24.1 million, Stone expects $22 million to come from higher assessments for real estate. With the approval of the Board, Stony will spend $18 million in new money on public school programmes and $19 million on infrastructure. In 2018, Stone convinced the Council to raise Richmond's meal tax by 6 per cent in restaurants to 7.5 per cent. This generates $9.1 million per year to finance the renovation and replacement of broken school facilities. We asked Tramil to prove her claim that, during his 2016 election campaign, Stone said he wouldn't raise taxes. She didn't remember a particular occasion, but he probably said so when he showed up at her house in the eighth district of Southside Richmond. We were unable to find a record or news story about that event. Diving through press recordings and stories from the campaign shows that Stony's fiscal stance was mostly consistent. His comment on stocks, while the city needed money for schools, increased taxes - other than cigarettes - were a last resort. \"Before we get to that step, have we exhausted every road?\" On July 10, 2016, he said questions with the Richmond Times Dispatch. \"Did we fight for our fair share of the state government?\" Did we unite with the federal government to return the dollars to Richmond, and did we go out and find those charity dollars... to help increase our current financial situation? I guess we didn't do that.\" During an interview on September 20, 2016 on TV, Stony said, \"I have no plans to raise any taxes. Now, we have a swollen city hall, we have over 4,000 employees in the city hall. I think you should look at some wounds there. You have to look at making a tighter ship. But also, I think you've got to find ways to be a little more creative about our dollars.\" On September 25, 2016, with The Times Despatch, Stone said that the city must improve its efficiency in collecting existing taxes \"before we begin to raise taxes, before we have that discussion.\" Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On January 20, 2020, we encountered one case, but when Stone gave up his usual warning and pledged not to raise taxes. It came during the \"round of light\" debate of October 17, 2016, when Stone and his conservative competitors were asked to answer questions with five words or less. \"Do you raise taxes?\" She asked the moderator. Stone responded with one word: \"No.\" After taking office on the last day of 2016, Stone seemed increasingly open to tax increases, but not necessarily to real estate. On March 1, 2017, the Times Despatch reported that its Political Action Committee was voting for Richmond residents on whether they would support tax increases. On December 24, 2017, with the Times Dispatch, he said, \"Everything on the table\" to raise school funds, including a tax increase plan that is \"well studied.\" While Stone proposed raising the meal tax on January 22, 2018, he said: \"Last year, I said that when it comes to meeting the critical needs of school facilities, the only option outside the table is not to do anything.\" But on October 17, 2018, Stony got himself off the phone with Richmond's headmaster, Jason Camras. According to the Times Mission, Jim Nolan-Stoney's spokesman said that Camras did not consult with the mayor before making the call and that Stone \"has no plans at present to propose an increase in real estate tax.\" Our ruling is that Stone didn't raise taxes? Stoney had an almost accurate answer every time he was asked for increases when he ran for mayor and during his first year in office. While stressing that Richmond needed more money for his schools, he said that the lifting of taxes - other than cigarettes - was a last resort, which could only be used if the Government &apos; s efficiency efforts were limited. Most of the time, Stone remained stable. Several steps have been taken to simplify services and improve revenue collection before proposing increases in last year &apos; s meal tax and real estate tax. We found once, however, when Stone lost his text. :: During the \"lighting round\" of the mayor &apos; s debate three weeks before the 2016 election, candidates were asked to state in five words or less whether they would raise taxes. Stoney said, \"No.\" Stone's answer does not amount to a vow \"read my lips\" not to raise the taxes provided by former President George H. W. Bush in 1988 - only to be broken. As far as we know, Stoney never repeated the pledge not to pay new taxes. His promise was in response to a question put in a way that did not allow him to respond conditionally. But Stony said \"no,\" contrary to his many other data where tax increases are kept as a possibility. So, in general, we're evaluating this half of the pulp.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00878"}
