It\u2019s among the ACA\u2019s most popular provisions, and polling indicates that most Americans support keeping these protections in place.\u00a0\u00a0\nBiden, who worked with then-President Barack Obama on the ACA\u2019s enactment, is a strong supporter of the law. Trump, meanwhile, has called repeatedly for the law to be repealed and is backing a lawsuit by a group of Republican state attorneys generals trying to overturn it. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case Nov. 10.\u00a0\nThe ACA guarantees that those with preexisting conditions cannot be denied coverage by health insurers. Despite promises that he will protect people with medical issues, Trump has not offered an\u00a0alternative proposal to\u00a0do so. He issued an executive order on health care Sept. 24 that included a commitment to preserving that safeguard, but legal experts said the executive order holds no enforcement power.\u00a0\nAfter Biden\u2019s comment at the debate, Trump retorted, \"There aren\u2019t a hundred million people with preexisting conditions.\"\u00a0\nWe thought it was important to figure out if this number was right, especially as the ACA\u2019s future hangs in the balance.\nEstimates vary\u00a0\nThe Biden campaign provided us with several pieces of evidence to back up the candidate\u2019s\u00a0 100 million statistic, including a September article in the New York Times, an issue brief from the Department of Health and Human Services during the Obama administration and a 2018 estimate from Avalere, a health care consulting firm.\u00a0\nWe consulted several health policy experts who also pointed us to the HHS brief and the Avalere estimate. They also cited a 2019 analysis from Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a nonpartisan health policy organization. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of KFF.)\u00a0\nThe HHS issue brief, published in January 2017, estimated that between 61 million and 133 million Americans have a preexisting condition.\u00a0\nThe number varies based on how a preexisting condition was defined.\u00a0\nIn the more conservative estimate of 61 million, a preexisting condition was defined as an illness or condition, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis or heart failure, that would qualify a person for a high-risk insurance pool. High-risk pools were in place before the ACA to help people with serious and expensive-to-treat illnesses gain health coverage. They were operated by some states, as well as by the federal government, but generally covered very few people and were a drain on government budgets.\u00a0\nBut that 61 million number doesn\u2019t include everyone who has a preexisting condition, said Linda Blumberg, an institute fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute.\n\"That\u2019s because it\u2019s only capturing the conditions that people had which were in high-risk pools prior to the ACA,\" said Blumberg. \"We know from a lot of studies that we\u2019ve done that insurance companies would write people up or deny them coverage for conditions that wouldn\u2019t necessarily put you in a high-risk pool.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nBefore the ACA, health insurance companies could deny you coverage for a condition as mild as seasonal hay fever.\u00a0\n\"Insurance companies had tools they could use to protect themselves from risky people,\" said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. \"They would dig through your medical history, and if they found something that might impose additional costs for them, they could do a variety of things.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorlette said those tools included the ability to deny coverage outright, charge individuals with preexisting health conditions higher premiums, or decide to offer them health insurance, but not cover the preexisting condition or the body part affected.\u00a0\nWith that larger definition, the number HHS offered is 133 million people.\nMore recent estimates cite similar figures.\u00a0\nA 2018 analysis by Avalere, a health care consulting firm, estimated that 102 million Americans have preexisting conditions. A 2019 analysis by the left-leaning Center for American Progress suggested 135 million people.\u00a0\nAnd a 2019 analysis by KFF found that 54 million people have a preexisting condition that would likely make them completely uninsurable.\u00a0\n\"The 54 million estimate is who wouldn\u2019t have been able to be covered at all,\" explained Cynthia Cox, director for the program on the ACA at KFF and one of the authors of the analysis.\u00a0\n\"But, I think realistically, there are certainly over 100 million people who have a condition that would have caused them some trouble to get insurance on the individual market,\" said Cox. \"The 100 million includes both the 54 million who wouldn\u2019t get coverage at all as well as the millions of others who might have had an exclusion or might have had to pay a higher premium.\"\u00a0\nBased on the HHS estimate, Blumberg said, she would consider Biden\u2019s 100 million figure\u00a0conservative.\u00a0\n\"If anything, he\u2019s somewhat on the low side,\" she said. \"I think he was being cautious with range and that is appropriate.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nWhy it matters\u00a0\nWhile the number of individuals who have a preexisting condition varies based on the analysis, it\u2019s clear that many Americans have a condition that could make it difficult to get comprehensive health insurance \u2014 or any insurance at all \u2014 if the ACA were overturned, said the experts.\u00a0\nAnd that\u2019s the real point.\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s easy to forget what was common practice before the ACA for insurance companies to use various tactics to dictate coverage,\" said Corlette. \"So, the 100 million, 133 million, 54 million numbers are almost immaterial. The fact is, a heck of a lot of people will face these tactics from insurance companies if these protections disappear.\"\u00a0\nJonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, agreed that the different numbers shouldn\u2019t obscure the central idea: \"The ACA provides strong consumer protections and access to health insurance for persons with preexisting conditions, and if the ACA goes away, so, too, will those protections, jeopardizing health coverage for millions of Americans.\"\u00a0\nHowever, not all think that the ACA will be overturned if Trump is successful in getting his nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, confirmed as a new Supreme Court justice.\u00a0\n\"The Supreme Court isn\u2019t going to overturn the ACA,\" said Joseph Antos, a health policy scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. \"The Supreme Court has an unbroken history since the 1700s of not expanding upon the specific case that is brought before them, so the idea that somehow preexisting condition protections will be tossed out by the Supreme Court is fairly absurd.\"\u00a0\nWhoever is elected Nov. 3 will have to deal with the court\u2019s decision. Although the arguments come next month, it\u2019s unlikely a ruling will be issued until 2021.\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nThe experts all agreed that Biden was certainly in the ballpark with his estimate of 100 million people having preexisting conditions. His figure was even a little low based on a range provided in an HHS report, said one expert.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut a wide range of people \u2014 from 54 million to 133 million\u00a0\u2014 could be affected, according to our reporting. Also, it\u00a0is\u00a0unclear how many people with preexisting conditions would be at risk of losing their insurance entirely, or facing higher costs or having their conditions excluded from coverage. Though Biden\u2019s number is certainly within this range, he would need to provide more detail to support such a definitive number.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate Biden\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18590"}
