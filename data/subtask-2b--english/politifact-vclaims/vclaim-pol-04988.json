Blunt misstates opponent Jason Kander's position on Guantanamo Bay", "text": "The race for Missouri\u2019s U.S. senate seat is heating up between incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt and Secretary of State Jason Kander.\n\nBlunt said Kander supports President Obama\u2019s plan to close Guantanamo Bay, a U.S. military prison in Cuba housing suspected terrorists, and transfer prisoners to mainland prisons. Blunt tweeted out a petition against the plan 11 times on his campaign account between April 18 and April 20.\n\n\nThe petition says, \"Jason Kander supports his plan to bring the remaining suspected terrorists to U.S. soil. Tell national Democrats and Jason Kander that bringing suspected terrorists to U.S. soil puts Missouri families at risk.\"\n\n\nThis statement piqued our interest, because Kander made headlines in February for coming out against this plan. So we decided to look into the claim.\n\n\nObama has tried to close Gitmo ever since he took office in 2009.\n\n\nThe Missouri House passed a resolution\u00a0later that year that opposed the closure. It urged Congress to \"reject any act of asylum, containment, transport, imprisonment, or medical care in regard to suspected terrorists from any United States operated foreign prison present within the State of Missouri.\"\n\n\nKander, who was serving as a state representative at the time, voted against this resolution.\n\n\nAt the end of February of this year, the White House again released a plan for closing the detention center. Part of the plan includes transferring detainees who cannot be released in foreign countries to a U.S. prison facility.\n\n\nOne of the proposed facilities is a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, which sits a few miles from the Kansas-Missouri border.\n\n\nKander released a statement opposing this plan after it was announced by the president.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our focus right now needs to be defeating ISIS, and we can\u2019t risk the possibility that the terrorists housed at Guantanamo could rejoin the battlefield,\" said Kander. \"These dangerous prisoners should not be transferred to the United States, and I strongly urge President Obama to reconsider this plan.\"\n\n\nHis spokesman Chris Hayden said Kander has never supported legislation on the federal level to close Gitmo and has opposed executive action.\n\n\n\"He did not think that a non-binding resolution in the Missouri legislature was the best way to keep us safe from terrorists,\" Hayden said.\n\n\nBlunt has accused Kander of flip-flopping on the issue.\n\n\nTate O\u2019Connor, spokesperson for Blunt\u2019s campaign said, \"Jason Kander may wish to un-ring the bell, but he cannot.\"\n\n\nHe said Kander is only trying to appeal to Missouri\u2019s popular vote by opposing Obama\u2019s plan.\n\n\nBut Kander never officially stated his position on closing Gitmo until February. Even the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which seeks to get Republicans elected to the Senate, released a video last November saying the committee couldn\u2019t find his stance on bringing the prisoners to the U.S.\n\n\nBlunt is going against the message from his fellow Republicans when he says Kander supported Obama\u2019s plan in the past.\n\n\nOur Ruling\n\n\nBlunt says Kander supports Obama\u2019s plan to bring the remaining prisoners at Guantanamo Bay to the U.S. Kander voted against a 2009 resolution in the Missouri legislature that called on Congress to keep the facility open. But that doesn\u2019t mean he supported Obama\u2019s plan to close the prison.\n\n\nHe took no official position until February, and even the National Republican Senatorial Committee said they weren\u2019t sure where he stood before then.\n\n\nWe rate this statement as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04988"}
