As they say, liberals have been skilfully criticized for making comprehensive circulars for Muslims. At the same time, conservatives have resorted to the defence of skill. In Fox News, host Bill O'Reily provided one of his comments on talking points on the question of whether Islam was a destructive force in the world. O'Reilly answered very much in the affirmative. Among its causes - Governments of Muslim-majority States \"failed to confront Islamic terrorism f) did not attack violence in the name of God.\" Then O'Reily played a video showing Palestinian youth jumping and smiling with the news of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. \" Thousands of Muslims, ordinary people, celebrated in the streets,\" said O'Reily. \"They were happy that more than 3,000 innocent people, including Muslims, were killed. Once again, these people are a minority but have not been formally summoned by Muslim nations all over the world.\" O'Reily is right that public demonstrations in support of the attacks of 11 September have taken place. These incidents occurred largely in the Palestinian territories, although we also found reports of one case in Egypt. Middle Eastern Specialist Peter Mandaville, Associate Professor of Government and Politics at George Mason University, reminds them of \"a small and local size.\" However, verification of the facts focuses on the question of whether Islamic nations have rejected the celebrations. \"There was a report from the Palestinian Authority's Information Minister at the time, Yasser Abd Rabbo, appealing to the Palestinians not to show happiness in response to the attacks, but no specific condemnation I know,\" Mandeville said. We found a series of Muslim reactions in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. In addition to Mandaville, we have contacted several Middle Eastern scholars. We found no case when the Government of a Muslim-majority nation punished or condemned the people who rejoiced in the overthrow of the towers of world trade and other deadly events on that day. What we found were many official convictions for the attacks themselves. King Abdullah II of Jordan said: \"What these people defend is against all the principles that Arab Muslims believe in.\" He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On 12 January 2021, on the day after the attacks, Abdul Wahid Belkez, Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, issued a statement in which he said that he condemned and condemned those criminal and brutal acts that ran counter to all covenants, human values and divine religions, above all Islam. The Organization of the Islamic Conference (now the Organization of Islamic Cooperation) represents all Islamic States in the Middle East and throughout the world. Subsequently, the group issued a joint statement in which it spoke about \"the need to track down the perpetrators of such acts in the light of the results of the investigations and to bring them to justice for the punishment they are entitled to.\" The League of Arab States said the same to a large extent, as was said by Islamic religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and other countries. From Syria, Yemen, Pakistan and other States, more than 40 clergymen and leaders of Islamic parties - many of whom have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood - signed a statement on 12 September 2011, saying: \"We condemn in the strongest terms incidents that run counter to all human and Islamic customs. This is based on the noble laws of Islam which prohibit all forms of attacks on innocent people.\" Therefore, while it is true that Governments have not expressed their opposition to the cheerful Palestinians, there has been widespread rejection of attacks by officials and senior religious leaders. Nathan Brown, Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at George Washington University, raised the possibility that street celebrations were bigger in America than anywhere else. \"I remember it being reported in the American media since it looked so awful,\" said Brown. \"But I don't know if they have any local interest in countries reported in the United States media that happened. For example, I recall Palestinian media reporting blood donations by Yasser Arafat, but nothing about Palestinian celebrations.\" Arafat had a picture of him as he donated blood to help survivors of the 9/11 attacks, although subsequent reports questioned whether he had actually done so. We have already found several accounts of the Palestinian authorities &apos; attempt to capture a video of demonstrations, which can talk about how events are taking place in the region. The Media Watch in the Middle East, based in Dubai, is a private company that monitors the activities of news organizations throughout the region. We asked them to look for coverage of the celebrations. They reported that \"expanded search\" of their database found nothing. In addition to the official reaction, ordinary Muslims attended candlelight celebrations and other public events to express sympathy for the victims and to reject attacks. We found pictures from Iran and Bangladesh. These demonstrations are in sharp contrast to the video taken from the Palestinian territories. Our reign, O'Reily, said that the Muslim nations did not \"call\" people who celebrated the 9/11 attacks. As far as we know, there was no official condemnation of persons celebrating the 9/11 attacks. However, Islamic Governments and religious leaders condemned the attacks themselves, as did many ordinary Muslims. That O'Reily's statement is rather accurate, but it leaves important information that might lead someone to a different conclusion. This corresponds to our definition of half the truth.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07178"}
