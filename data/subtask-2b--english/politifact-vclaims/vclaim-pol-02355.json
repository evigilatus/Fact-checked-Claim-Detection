Michael Williams received some on-air fact-checking from CNN when he criticized Delta Air Lines for ending a discount partnership with the National Rifle Association while favoring \"liberal-leaning organizations\" such as Planned Parenthood.\nDelta ended a discount agreement with the NRA in order to remain \"neutral\" in the national debate over gun control, which resurfaced after a Feb. 14 mass shooting in Florida.\n\"If they're going to pull the discount for NRA members, why not pull it for Planned Parenthood or some of the left organizations out there?\" Williams, R-Cumming, claimed during a Feb. 27 interview with CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar.\nKeilar asked for his source of information to back up Delta discounts for Planned Parenthood. Williams said he and other state senators \"looked it up on Google.\"\n\"Just to be clear, no, we looked it up as well. And it doesn't appear, after some digging, that we have been able to determine that that is actually factual, because you're indicating something that may not be true there,\" Keilar responded.\nWilliams, who\u2019s running to become Georgia\u2019s governor, said he \"very firmly\" believed that Delta \"is out there giving discounts to left-leaning organizations as well.\"\n\"But if you're making that argument,\" Keilar said, \"shouldn't you have your facts straight?\"\nLike CNN, PolitiFact Georgia found no evidence to support Williams\u2019 claim. Williams\u2019 campaign did not provide evidence to prove it, and Planned Parenthood told us there are no perks, discounts or deals that come with being a Planned Parenthood supporter or member \u2014 whether with Delta or any other company.\n\"There are no corporate perks that come with being a Planned Parenthood supporter or member,\" said Erica Sackin, director of political communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund.\nDelta did not respond to our query.\nWilliams\u2019 evidence is a missed connection\nWilliams and Keilar\u2019s debate continued off-air on Twitter: Keilar asked for backup on the Planned Parenthood claim. Williams tweeted back that his team had responded. Keilar said his statement still did not back up his \"bogus claim.\" Williams ultimately tweeted a statement saying Keilar was pushing a \"false narrative.\"\nWilliams\u2019 statement mentioned \"Delta's history of supporting left-wing organizations that donate to abortion provider Planned Parenthood.\"\nThat\u2019s a few steps removed from what he said in the interview about Planned Parenthood receiving the discount itself.\nWilliams started to backtrack from that in the Keilar interview. Here\u2019s a transcript of the original exchange on CNN:\nWilliams: \"You're telling me that Delta \u2026 is not giving away discounts to left-leaning organizations? Is that what you're telling me?\"\nKeilar: \"No, you told me that it was Planned Parenthood. I'm just talking to you about what you said to me.\"\nWilliams: \"I know, but is that not a left-wing organization? ... It is a very left-leaning organization.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeilar: \"There's no indication they are giving discounts to that organization, is my point.\"\nWilliams: \"Again, let's, I guess, agree to disagree, because, again, we cannot -- bring me back on and I will have the information for you about where they're giving away these discounts to (a) left-leaning organization\u00a0that support(s) Planned Parenthood.\"\n\u00a0\nSo in addition to Williams saying Delta gives discounts to Planned Parenthood, he backs it up to say Delta has ties with left-leaning groups that in turn support Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions. That doesn\u2019t check out either.\nFaulty Komen link\nWilliams\u2019 spin that Delta has ties to the Susan. G. Komen Foundation, which supports Planned Parenthood, is also wrong.\n\"A quick Google search reveals Planned Parenthood receives hundreds of thousands of dollars from Delta partner Susan G. Komen,\" Williams said in his printed statement. \"It's as simple as that. Has Delta cut their ties with the Susan G. Komen Foundation like they did the NRA?\"\nAndrea Rader, spokeswoman for the breast cancer research organization Susan G. Komen, told PolitiFact Georgia, \"Komen does not and has not had a partnership with Delta at either the state or national level.\"\nKomen does have seven grants in local markets to Planned Parenthood, totaling $277,000, for breast exam services, Rader said.\nWilliams may have conflated Susan G. Komen with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, an actual Delta partner. The\u00a0Breast Cancer Research Foundation told PolitiFact Georgia it does not give money to Planned Parenthood.\nGreg Bluestein, a political reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, tweeted to Williams that Komen said his claim about a Delta partnership is incorrect. Williams tweeted back, \"They may want to issue a new statement\" and included a link to a website for Flashpoint Agency, billed as a marketing agency.\nFlashpoint Agency\u2019 page has photos of a white and pink plane with a pink ribbon that appears to be Breast Cancer Research Foundation\u2019s logo. \"As part of Delta\u2019s work with the Susan G Komen Foundation Flashpoint was brought in to help launch the \u2018Pink Plane\u2019 for Breast Cancer Awareness,\" the website said, incorrectly identifying the partnership.\nWe found a Reddit post where a user wrote \"Delta ends NRA discounts. Keeps relationship with Planned Parenthood.\" The user included a screenshot of a Twitter exchange asking Delta, \"Did you end your discount for Planned Parenthood?\"\nThe Delta Twitter account responded, \"Hey Stuart. We don't handle this over Twitter however I will send you the link below where you could find further information. http://bit.ly/2CRW68T \u00a0Have a fabulous day. *TLJ\"\n(Delta sent the user a broken link, which the user noted in a reply.)\nWe asked Delta if it offered discounts to Planned Parenthood but the airline did not respond to that specific question.\nDelta shared a memo from CEO Ed Bastian to Delta employees regarding the company\u2019s NRA decision and subsequent action by Georgia lawmakers to remove a jet fuel tax exemption from a tax bill that could have saved Delta millions of dollars a year.\n\"While Delta\u2019s intent was to remain neutral, some elected officials in Georgia tied our decision to a pending jet fuel tax exemption, threatening to eliminate it unless we reversed course,\" Bastian said. \"Our decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale. We are in the process of a review to end group discounts for any group of a politically divisive nature.\"\nOur ruling\nWilliams said Delta offers a discount to Planned Parenthood.\nWe found no evidence that supports Williams\u2019 claim. Planned Parenthood said its donors and members do not receive any corporate perks from Delta, and Williams failed to show that one exists. Williams\u2019 campaign said that a Planned Parenthood supporter is a Delta partner, but that\u2019s also not true.\nWe rate Williams\u2019 claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-03-02 20:36:06 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says Delta offers a discount to Planned Parenthood.
