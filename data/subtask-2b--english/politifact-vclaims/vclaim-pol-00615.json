The recipe, a lot like this one, called for milk, cream, sugar, egg yolks and vanilla. The vanilla extract was brown. But because the amount of vanilla the recipe called for was a fraction of its total volume, the end product was merely off-white\u2014a lot like the vanilla ice cream at the grocery store.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical photos show ice cream of a similar color.

It was a trend a few years ago when some shops used activated charcoal to create it\u2019s dark hue. Morgenstern\u2019s Finest Ice Cream in New York sold a coconut ash ice cream cone. A 2017 Eater story says:\n\"The idea of charcoal as a detoxifier isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, but consumers are now more interested in charcoal-tinted ice cream and pizza because it makes for excellent Instagram fodder. The black ice cream from shops like Morgenstern\u2019s in New York City and Los Angeles\u2019 Little Damage have been posted to social media thousands of times, along with inspiring countless copycats at ice cream shops across the country. This time, the craze isn\u2019t necessarily attributed to activated charcoal\u2019s purported health benefits. Instead, the appeal is directly attributed to the fact that black-hued dishes are relatively rare and unique \u2014 and also happen to look really, really cool.\"\nThe claim that vanilla ice cream used to be black appeared online around the same time. Snopes, for example, fact-checked it back in 2017.\n\"We contacted a representative for Morgenstern\u2019s in 2017, who told us that the image indeed shows its \u2018coconut ash\u2019 flavor and confirmed that they also sold black cones,\" the story says.\nSince then, New York City has banned activated charcoal from food and drink in the city.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.\n Share the Facts 2019-05-21 18:46:47 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Vanilla ice cream was black until 1912, when \"white people couldn\u2019t tolerate eating something that tasted soooooo delicious being black.\"    Viral image On the internet     Wednesday, May 15, 2019 2019-05-15    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00615"}
