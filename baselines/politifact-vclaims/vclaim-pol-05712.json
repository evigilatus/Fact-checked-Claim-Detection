Scott Walker\u2019s plan to borrow $350 million over the next two years for road projects. Democrats offered key support.\nEven before that, Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse) was arguing more spending was needed. On Oct. 1, 2015 she tweeted this:\n\"71% of WI\u2019s roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 14% of WI\u2019s bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. #JustFixIt\"\nIn Wisconsin\u2019s budget battles over infrastructure, few deny the need for road maintenance.\nBut is Shilling right about how bad the situation is?\nDigging into the numbers\nShilling\u2019s team directed us to a report from the U.S. Department of Transportation that cited the same statistics as the tweet -- that 71 percent of roads in Wisconsin are in poor or mediocre condition and 14 percent of bridges are classified as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\nSo, the report is quoted accurately. But what about the numbers themselves? The two statistics were drawn from different sources of data.\nThe data on road conditions came from the 2013 Report Card for America\u2019s Infrastructure. The report, the most recent available, is put out by the American Society of Civil Engineers, a trade and advocacy organization.\nBy the group\u2019s tally, Wisconsin is one of just six states with at least 70 percent of roads rated in poor or mediocre condition, meaning our roads are in worse shape than the national average.\nBut experts caution that the report card can overstate the amount of need for road repairs.\nFirst, the report uses a small source of data for each state and then extrapolates that data to the entire state roadway system.\nAshwat Anandanarayanan, director of transportation policy for the environmental group 1000 Friends of Wisconsin, said the civil engineers\u2019 reports also conflate new roadway construction and maintenance, resulting in what appears to be greater need.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\"Lots of roads need to be fixed,\" he said. \"Not a lot need to be expanded.\"\n\u00a0\nSo then, what is a better measuring stick?\nThe Wisconsin Department of Transportation collects its own data on road conditions that is used in the Highway Performance Monitoring System by the Federal Highway Administration, which is considered the gold standard of transportation information.\nAccording to these figures, the percentage of Wisconsin roads in poor or mediocre condition is much lower -- 38 percent of the state highway system falls into those categories. \u00a0\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the state will fare better in a national comparison by that measure. In fact, the state lags behind the U.S. average in most indicators of roadway quality.\nAs for bridges, Shilling said 14 percent of Wisconsin\u2019s bridges were in disrepair or functionally obsolete.\nThis statistic, which is accurate, came from WisDOT data submitted to the Federal Highway Administration.\nBut while Shilling cites the number as evidence of the state being behind, Wisconsin does pretty well here in a national comparison. Only three states \u2014 Arizona, Minnesota and Nevada \u2014 reported a smaller percentage of bridges in disrepair.\nOur rating\nShilling said \"71 % of WI\u2019s roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 14% of WI\u2019s bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\"\nThe report she cited from the federal Department of Transportation backed up her figures, but the numbers used for her road statistic aren\u2019t the most accurate available. By another measure, the percentage of roads in poor or mediocre condition is far smaller.\nThere was no dispute on the bridge number, though on that front the state actually fares better than most others.\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05712"}
