It is not surprising, therefore, with the special elections of the United States House, that candidates in primary school talk a lot about the army. \"We also need to provide enough for our military families through increased infrastructure projects,\" said Democrat Alan Thomas in a pre-election candidate questionnaire with Jacksonville Daily News. \"For the time being, 23% of the army's infrastructure is classified as \"poor,\" while 9% are \"crash.\" We wondered if Thomas had straightened out his numbers, so we decided to put his claim on reality or meter. It turns out he's right. Thomas did not respond to the requests for suspension, but he probably obtained his statistics from the budget request that Lucien Niemer, Assistant Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Environment Defense, had been presented to the House Committee on Armed Services on April 18, 2018. Noting that the Ministry of Defence needs a steady flow of investments to keep its bases in good condition, Nimir asked for more money for fiscal year 2019 to compensate for the decline in funding in previous years. \"As a result of limited investments in previous budgets for facility replenishment and recapitalization, 23 per cent of the Department's facility stock is in \"bad\" condition and another 9 per cent is in \"bad\" condition, as Nimir said in the prepared certificate. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021 infrastructure is a broad term. In this context, it appears to refer primarily to buildings in military bases. The Pentagon spokesman (Heather Babe) confirmed that the figures in the budget request were correct. Since it was worth it, the Ministry of Defence budget proposed by President Donald Trump in the end for 2019 was over $686 billion, with some $10.8 billion allocated for the maintenance and repair of facilities. Thomas our governor said, \"At present, 23% of our army infrastructure is classified as \"poor,\" while 9% are \"loser.\" These figures are consistent with what the Ministry of Defence reported to Congress last year. We're assessing this statement right. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact Review Project, a partnership from Maclachi Carolina, Duke University Reporter Laboratory and Fact Politics.
