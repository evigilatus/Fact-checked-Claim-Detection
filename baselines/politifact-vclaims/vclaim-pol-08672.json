In 2012, Archibong was one of four council members who voted against a pay raise that still passed by a 10-4 margin.\nArchibong represents the District 5 seat on the council, which includes several east Atlanta neighborhoods located in Fulton and DeKalb counties. An attorney in private practice, Archibong was first elected in 2001 and is hoping to be re-elected to a fourth four-year term.\nThe District 5 council race has become particularly nasty in its final days, with accusations flying back and forth among the four candidates. On Thursday, Archibong filed a lawsuit in DeKalb County against Rinker and candidate Christian Enterkin, accusing them of slander. Enterkin also claimed in a flier that Archibong was late or absent to council meetings 90 percent of the time in 2011 and 2012. Enterkin\u2019s flier did not mention Rinker\u2019s claim that Archibong voted herself a pay raise.\nDeKalb County Superior Court Judge Gregory Adams denied Archibong\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order of statements about the councilwoman\u2019s attendance record and other claims about her.\nThe city convenes a panel of citizens once every four years to review the salaries of the mayor and the council. In 2004, the panel met and proposed raising the council\u2019s pay from about $32,000 to $39,473. In March 2005, the council voted by a 9-3 margin to approve the pay raise. Archibong supported the salary increase and voted in favor of it. Rinker said via email he was referring to the 2005 vote.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2012 vote raised the salaries of council members from $39,473 to $60,000 and takes effect in 2014.\nArchibong also sent PolitiFact Georgia attendance records that were certified by the city clerk\u2019s office. Those records show Archibong has missed just one council meeting this year and two meetings per year in 2011 and 2012. They show she didn\u2019t miss any council meetings in 2009 and 2010. Council records, though, raised some questions about Archibong\u2019s punctuality.\nOur review of City Council meeting minutes since the beginning of 2010 shows Archibong was either absent or not listed as present when the meeting convened about 75 percent of the time. In most cases, Archibong\u2019s arrival time was listed about one hour after the meeting was convened. The news website East Atlanta Patch published a spreadsheet that concluded Archibong was either absent or late 78.6 percent of the time during the same time frame.\nThe council often hands out proclamations to citizens and visiting dignitaries at the beginning of meetings and then allows time for public comments before voting on legislation that is on its agenda. It is often 30 minutes to one hour before the council actually gets to the agenda. Most council members sit through the proclamations and public comments. Others, instead, hold sidebar conversations with their colleagues or administration officials or conduct other activities.\n\"I don't sit through proclamations,\" Archibong told us. \"I'm at work though, because the Committee on Council precedes the full council meeting.\"\nThe Committee on Council is a semimonthly gathering of select council members who discuss council administrative issues. The committee typically meets less than two hours before council meetings.\nWas Archibong around when the council took its first vote of the day? She was nearly every time, council records show.\nSo, what does this mean about the accuracy of Rinker\u2019s flier? He\u2019s right that Archibong voted to increase her pay, but that was eight years ago. The councilwoman voted against a pay raise in 2012. This makes Rinker\u2019s flier confusing, if not misleading.\nAs for her attendance record, Rinker\u2019s number comes close to our count concerning how often Archibong is either absent or was not present when the council convened. Council records show Archibong is usually present when the council makes its first vote of the day.\nRinker\u2019s claim contains some elements of truth, but there is a lot of context that needs to be considered before fully understanding what he put in the flier.
