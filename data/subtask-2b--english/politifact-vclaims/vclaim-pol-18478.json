We\u2019ve already debunked one such video. Another video has also been mischaracterized, according to the county. This recent one shows poll workers writing on blank ballots.\n\"More poll workers caught filling out ballots in Delaware County Pennsylvania,\" said one Facebook post, misspelling Pennsylvania.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The scanner manufacturer advised poll workers to transcribe the votes onto clean ballots and scan those ballots instead, she said.\n\"As ballots were being transcribed, the original damaged ballots were directly beside the new ballots, and bipartisan observers witnessed the process at close range,\" Marofsky said. \"Damaged ballots have been preserved.\"\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s not clear from the clips circulating on social media platforms is that bipartisan poll watchers were monitoring the process nearby, Marofsky said.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18478"}
