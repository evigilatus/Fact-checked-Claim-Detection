The article claims that \"while the left continues to lose the battle for America's spirit, its greatest heroes go abroad in an attempt to divert the tide in any way possible - even if that means destroying the country.\" The author cites an article in November 2015 in Brittbart, London, as evidence of the purpose of Soros \"to tear apart all national boundaries.\" According to the Bunsch news, Soros said this \"after last week's indictment\" by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The Newsbunch takes the Soros statement from 2015 out of context. In October 2015, Orb\u00e1n Soros was accused of being part of a group of \"activists\" who \"vulnerate nation states.\" \"These activists who inadvertently support migrants become part of this international human smuggling network,\" Bloomberg Business said Urban at the time. In response, Soros sent a statement to Bloomberg Trading Company, defending his position. At that time, Soros wrote about the Urban Plan, \"Protecting the protection of national borders as a target and refugees as a constraint. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as a goal and national boundaries as a constraint.\" On January 12, 2021, the Facebook fact-finding articles mentioned in an article in Facebook by Samantha Buterman, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Belusi. On January 12, 2021, Soros did not say that his goal was \"to wipe all national boundaries,\" such as the allegations of News Ponch. ............................................................................................................................................................................. As a student at the London School of Economics in 1947, Soros studied the work and philosophy of Carl Popper, author of \"Open Society and its Enemies.\" As Soros wrote in a lecture at the University of Central Europe in 2009 and later published as part of a book, he was drawn to the idea that the truth was not the prerogative of any single ideology: \"The ideologies that claim to be in possession of the ultimate truth make a false claim; therefore, they can only be imposed on society through coercion. All these ideologies lead to repression. Popper suggested a more attractive form of social organization: an open society in which people were free to hold divergent views, and the rule of law allowed people with different views and interests to live together in peace. After living during the German and Russian occupation here in Hungary, I found the idea of an open society very attractive.\" This is not the same thing that supports the destruction of national borders. The Newsbunch article is almost identical to Nov 6, 2015, the natural news entitled, \"George Soros's message reveals a global plan to destroy the first world by removing national borders with the global invasion of Blitzcrieg by immigrants.\" In any case, it was included in an article by NewsPunch a footage of a video that became viral after being posted on Twitter by Rip Matt Gates, R-Fla, on 17 October. 2018. The video depicts the money being handed over to people, and the Bunch news included a shot of it with the title \"Man paying members of the migrant convoy in cash.\" Gates claimed that the footage was from Honduras, and in his tweet he mentioned Soros, he wrote, \"It's time to investigate the source.\" As reported by the Poletti Fact, the footage was from Chiquimula, Guatemala, not Honduras, and it was fired outside a store selling car parts. The bloggers falsely claimed that immigration was financed by Democrats. The Open Society Institutions, an international grant-making network established by Soros in 1979, denied Gates &apos; claim that Soros or his charities financed migration. \"Neither Mr. Soros nor the open society finance this effort. We support the historic commitment of the United States to welcoming people fleeing persecution and violence in their home countries, \"the institutions of open society were written in the tweet of October 18. The ruling newspaper Newsbunch claimed that the 2015 Soros Statement to Bloomberg Trading Company in response to Orb\u00e1n's accusations, \"Save the \"border acquisition\" scheme with the invasions of Caravan immigrants.\" The codification article confuses a three-year-old statement made by Soros with the current migration to the United States-Mexico border, in an attempt to establish a link between the two that does not exist. We're assessing this statement with pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01340"}
