Bob McDonnell says the country can\u2019t afford another four years of President Barack Obama.\n\n\"[The president\u2019s] budget would call for about $25 trillion in debt by the end of his term, if he was re-elected,\" McDonnell, a Republican, said at Politico\u2019s Feb. 24 State Solutions Conference.\n\nThe total U.S. debt stands at about $15.5 trillion. About two-thirds of it is owed to investors and the rest is owed to trust funds for government programs such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\nMcDonnell\u2019s statement caught our eye. If Obama is re-elected, would his policies really lead to a \u00a0$9.5 trillion expansion of the national debt by the time the president leaves office in January 2017?\n\nTucker Martin, a spokesman for the governor, stressed to us that McDonnell\u2019s statement was made during an hour-long \"extemporaneous\" exchange over a range of issues. Then he offered a clarification.\n\nMartin said in an email that McDonnell had cited a figure on what the debt would be at the end of a 10-year projection contained in the president\u2019s budget for the current 2012 fiscal year.\n\nMartin pointed to White House summary tables for that budget estimating it would lead to a total national debt of $26.3 trillion in 2021. The tables essentially assume that policies in the budget will be carried out for a decade.\n\nOn Feb. 13, more than a week before McDonnell made his statement, the president introduced his budget for fiscal 2013, which starts Oct. 1. The White House projected the plan would lead to gross national debts of $25 trillion in 2021 and $25.9 trillion in 2022.\n\n\"Under the terms of his introduced budgets, the president, if re-elected, would leave office in January 2017 with the national debt estimated to reach approximately $25 trillion by 2021,\" Martin said.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what the governor said. McDonnell said the debt would hit the $25 trillion mark by the end of a hypothetical second Obama term in January 2017. There\u2019s a considerable difference.\n\nThe president\u2019s current spending proposal projects the debt will grow to $21.3 trillion by the end of fiscal 2017 -- the last year for which a two-term Obama would submit a budget. That\u2019s still a leap from the current debt, but $3.7 trillion below what McDonnell said.\n\nTo put that number in focus, $3.7 trillion is also the entire amount this year\u2019s federal budget. The sum would roughly cover four years of government spending on Social Security or six years of outlays for defense.\n\nJason Peuquet, research director at the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal \u00a0Budget, said that while 10-year projections are important to budget, they are also extremely volatile. \"These things are about 100 percent guaranteed to be not right on the mark,\" he said.\n\nJosh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition -- an organization that advocates balanced budgets -- does not put much stock in measuring debt by simple dollars. Gordon said it\u2019s best to look at it in proportion to the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product -- the total goods and services produced -- because that compares the debt to a nation\u2019s ability to pay.\n\nU.S. total debt is now about 101 percent of GDP. The White House projects it would peak at 107.8 percent of GDP in 2014 under Obama\u2019s budget before dropping to 102.3 percent in 2021.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcDonnell said that if Obama is reelected this year, his budget policies would push total U.S. debt to about $25 trillion by the time the president\u2019s second term expired in 2017.\n\nThe governor\u2019s spokesman qualified the statement. McDonnell, he said, cited a White House projection of the national debt in 2021 if Obama\u2019s policies are continued. Indeed, the administration has estimated a $25 trillion debt that year.\n\nBut in 2017 -- at the end of a second Obama term that McDonnell addressed with dread -- the debt would be $21.3 trillion. That\u2019s still a heavy load, but significantly less then the governor claimed.\n\nMcDonnell\u2019s statement is based on the element of truth that the debt will continue to rise under Obama\u2019s policies, but greatly exaggerates by how much. We rate his claim Mostly False.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11492"}
