Paul Gosar of Prescott and challenger Ray Strauss of Buckeye, whom Palin called a \"malleable politician\" willing to compromise.\n\"In other words, to sell us out, raise taxes, and spend more of your hard-earned money,\" Palin said in an Aug. 11 Facebook post supporting Gosar. \"Dr. Gosar's opponent is actually classified by Americans for Prosperity for being a \u2018Champion of Big Government'\u00a0for his votes to raise taxes while on the local city council.\"\nPalin was referring to Strauss, who served on the Buckeye City Council from June 2010 through May 2016.\nWe wondered whether Palin\u2019s claims against Gosar\u2019s opponent held any weight.\nNot for taxes\nWe did not hear back from Palin or Strauss, but Gosar campaign spokesman Tom Van Flein pointed us to the Americans for Prosperity's 2016 scorecard. This conservative group, which advocates for limited government, annually grades local and state politicians based on their fiscal voting record.\nTheir scale ranges from Hero of the Taxpayer to Hero of Big Government:\n\nAccording to his most recent scorecard for calendar year 2015, AFP did give Strauss a grade of\u00a0\"Champion of Big Government.\"\nBut that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\nIn June 2015, the Buckeye City Council unanimously approved a $258 million budget for fiscal year 2015-16, $73 million more than the previous fiscal year.\n\"The (sic) rating in calendar year 2015 was for voting for a 39 percent increase in the city\u2019s approved budget, from $185 million in fiscal year 2015 to $258 million in fiscal year 2016,\" Americans for Prosperity Arizona state director Tom Jenney said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Strauss -- and the rest of the council -- did not vote to increase taxes. They actually approved a lower property tax rate of $1,800 per $100,000 of accessed property value.\nDespite a lower tax rate, some homeowners may still pay more in taxes if their home is worth more, but it varies.\n\"It\u2019s the assessed value on any given property that dictates whether someone\u2019s overall taxes increase or decrease,\" said Buckeye finance director Larry Price. \"She got her years wrong or just flat out missed it.\"\nMoreover, while Strauss did get a \"Champion of Big Government\" rating for calendar year 2015, from calendar year 2007 through calendar year 2015, he averaged a score of -1, or \"Needs Much Improvement.\"\nAnd in calendar year 2014, AFP actually gave him a \"Friend of the Taxpayer\" rating.\nWe also examined the minutes for all the Buckeye City Council meetings in 2015 and found that Strauss voted against resolutions thought to be pro-government.\nIn August 2015, he voted against two resolutions for city employee raises, including one that would give raises to employees based on the city\u2019s financial scope.\nBy comparison, Gosar received a perfect score from AFP, as his congressional votes coincided with the group\u2019s position.\nOur ruling\nPalin said, \"Dr. Gosar's opponent is actually classified by Americans for Prosperity for being a \u2018Champion of Big Government'\u00a0for his votes to raise taxes while on the local city council.\"\nThat\u2019s misleading and leaves out important context.\nThe opponent in question, Ray Strauss, did not vote to raise taxes that year while on the Buckeye City Council.\nAnd while the group did give him that rating in 2015, it wasn't a lifetime rating.\u00a0Palin cherry-picks one year. On average, he has a much more moderate score from AFP.\nWe rate her claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c31bf412-8e0d-4a78-bf3f-ac7802c2806c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04448"}
