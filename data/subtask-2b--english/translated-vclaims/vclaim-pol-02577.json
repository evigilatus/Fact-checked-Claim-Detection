Donald Trump mischaracterizes the visa lottery.", "text": "President Donald Trump's allegations about bad people coming to the United States have expanded to include not only those who come here illegally. Tramp told graduates at the FBI National Academy that two recent terrorist attacks in New York City were perpetrated by individuals who came to the United States through a \"deactivated immigration system,\" one through family care and the other through a variety of visa lotteries. Trump said: \"They have a lottery. You choose people. Do you think the country gives us the best people? No. What kind of regulation is this? They come in the lottery. They've given us the worst people, put them in a box, but in his hand, when he chooses them, it's really the worst. Congratulations, you're going to the United States. Okay. What a system -- a lottery system.\" Trump made similar comments on December 20, at the Cabinet meeting: \"When we take people into the lottery, they don't put the best people in the lottery. That's the right logic. They don't say, \"Oh, let's take our best people and let's put them in the lottery so we can send them to the United States.\" No. They put the worst people in the lottery. This is what we get in many cases.\" The recent Trump comments coincided with his claim that Pants was on fire as a presidential candidate that the Mexican government was sending \"bad guys\" to the United States. In this case, Trump oversimplified and misunderstood the programme. Countries don't send their people. Lottery students must meet the minimum standards of education or work experience. The lottery is run by the United States, not by foreign countries. The lottery winners are selected through a random computer operation. Individuals must pass background checks by the U.S. government before obtaining a visa. The White House refused to comment on the record for this fact check. Trump's criticism of various visas favours a merit-based immigration system where people come on the basis of work skills, not only because of family ties or for diversity. He said that the visa lottery \"presents significant weaknesses in our national security\" and cited the example of Saivolo Saibov, from Uzbekistan, who entered the United States in 2010 through the lottery programme. Saibov is accused of killing eight people and injuring 12 others in an attack on vehicles in October in New York City. He pleaded not guilty to murder and terrorism. A visa lottery programme was established in 1990 to diversify the immigrant population in the United States. The lottery began in 1995 and applicants are selected from countries with low migration levels over the past five years. Currently, the maximum number of miscellaneous visas is 50,000 in the fiscal year. It's not foreign governments that run the lottery, it's run by the U.S. State Department. This is the current description of the program: the online register of lottery applicants in autumn; the names of lottery winners are randomly selected by a computer; the lottery winners are notified around May that they can apply for a diversity visa; the fact-finding Tom Cotton mentioned on February 1, 2021 in an interview with Fox and friends of \"Many of these immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 3 February 2021: the visa application and interview process will begin on 1 October. \u2022 Applicants who pass the screening process receive a diversity visa, which is normally valid for up to six months from the date of issuance. \"A visa cannot be issued unless all the concerns raised by the examination have been fully resolved. As part of this screening process, information that may indicate that an individual is a potential threat is shared with all appropriate United States government agencies, \"The Department of State said in a statement of PoliticFact. \"National security is our highest priority in deciding visa applications,\" added by the Agency. \"The worst of the worst \"? The Trump comment that the worst comes not only from ignoring the scrutiny of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but also from the requirements to enter the lottery at least in secondary education or its equivalent, or from two years of practical experience over the past five years in a profession that requires at least two years of training or experience to carry out. \"In countries where only a small part of the population completes secondary education, this basic criterion limits the pool of persons eligible for the diversity lottery to a large extent,\" said Beth Elise Whitaker, an assistant professor of political science at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte. Trump said countries don't give us the best of their people. But this is a false statement. \u2219 V. Cohen, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Syracuse University. \"individuals make decisions to apply for any visa, including, but not limited to, a variety of lottery visas. The decision is difficult, as is the visa process, \"Kohen said. \"The process of application and scrutiny is also complex, indicating that only highly qualified and well-equipped individuals will succeed.\" Cohen said that Trump and his administration promoted two conflicting objectives: they attacked family reunification, but also the diversity lottery, \"which is not dependent on family reunification and is more skill-based than the name suggests.\" The diversity visa program is a real lottery. It is impossible for a foreign government to play lottery to unload the worst in citizens. Stephen Yale Loher, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School, wrote in a newspaper article for the New York Daily News. Our governor Trump said about our various visa lottery program, \"Give us the worst people, put them in the trash,\" and \"worst of the worst\" are chosen. Trump's criticism of the lottery program was based on the fact that the suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City came through the program in 2010. However, the simplified Tramp description gives a misleading impression of how the process actually works. First of all, countries do not \"give us\" migrants. The lottery is run by the United States, not foreign governments. Intruders to the lottery must meet educational requirements and work experience, and the winners are chosen randomly by computer. Also, winning the lottery does not necessarily mean that a person will come to the United States. They must be examined thoroughly before being granted an entry visa. We appreciate Trump's statement of fire pants.
