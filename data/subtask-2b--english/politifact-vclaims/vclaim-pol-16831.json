We found no evidence that on Oct. 23 ABC 7 aired or published a story about a high school shooting in Santa Clarita. We reached out to ABC 7 for comment but have not heard back.\nABC 7\u2019s first published news reports about the school shooting were on Nov. 14, the day the incident, archives show. ABC 7\u2019s page listing all news about Santa Clarita does not have any Oct. 23 reports about the shooting, as the Facebook post falsely claimed.\u00a0\nThe story snippet that the Facebook post highlights does appear to have been written by ABC 7 staff \u2014 it features the same first sentence of a story bylined by ABC 7\u2019s staff. But ABC 7 actually published the story on Nov. 14, not three weeks before the shooting happened.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claimed that ABC 7 reported the Santa Clarita high school shooting \"3 weeks in advance.\"\nWe found no evidence of that. All reporting about that shooting began Nov. 14, not earlier. This appears to be another example of a so-called \"false flag\" theory fueled through social media that often follows mass shootings. Such theories seek to promote the notion that these mass horrors never happened and are the invention of a media conspiracy. They have no basis in truth.\nWe rate the post Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16831"}
