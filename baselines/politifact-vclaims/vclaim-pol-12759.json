The bill gave the superintendent the power to hire the school district\u2019s general counsel and chief financial officer. It also imposed ethics guidelines for school administrators and the board. The bill\u2019s chief sponsor: then-Sen. Kasim Reed, who is now Atlanta\u2019s mayor.\n\nLong has been critical of Reed\u2019s role in the ongoing school district crisis. Long has accused the mayor, who by law has no oversight of Atlanta schools, of solely serving the interests of the city\u2019s business community and the influential Metro Atlanta Chamber. Long was one of the few public officials to side with Reed\u2019s opponent, Mary Norwood, in the 2009 Atlanta mayoral runoff election, which Reed won by less than 1 percentage point.\n\nReed defended the bill Monday in an interview with Channel 2 Action News. The mayor said it was an effort to streamline operations at a time some community leaders complained the district couldn\u2019t keep a superintendent because of board micromanagement. Reed also took a verbal jab at Long.\n\n\"He\u2019s looking for 15 minutes of fame out of the awful crisis that\u2019s impacting our children,\" Reed said.\n\nLong defended his point to PolitiFact Georgia, saying the legislation left the board essentially toothless. Stacking the deck, were the words Long used to describe the overwhelming influence that Hall was given over APS.\n\nLong said he\u2019s considering a bill that would revive the board\u2019s authority to hire a general counsel and CFO.\n\n\"The board didn\u2019t have any power,\" said Long.\n\nWe wondered if Long\u2019s comments about the bill added up.\n\nThe state report outlines in exhaustive detail a \"culture of fear\" inside APS for teachers and administrators to produce higher student scores on statewide tests. Hall was named national superintendent of the year by one influential education group for Atlanta\u2019s markedly improved test scores and higher graduation rates. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution questioned irregularities in some scores as far back as 2001, and ramped up its investigative reporting into the matter over the past two years. The state report concluded 178 educators, including three dozen principals, participated in systematic cheating on state curriculum tests. Nearly half of them confessed to wrongdoing.\n\nSenate Bill 204 supporters said the legislation was necessary to insulate the superintendent from micromanaging by the board. Atlanta board member Emmett Johnson, who is still on the nine-member board, made that argument to the AJC in 2003, noting that the city school district had five superintendents in 10 years. The board had overseen the chief financial officer and general counsel positions since the 1970s, as part of the so-called \"Atlanta compromise\" that brought the city its first black superintendent. Critics worried at the time that board ceded too much of its authority.\n\nThe bill still gave the board power to fire the superintendent. It also gave the board and the superintendent the dual authority to adopt districtwide academic standards. Additionally, they had the power to track progress toward \"student learning goals and the academic content and performance standards.\"\n\nDoesn\u2019t this prove the school board had oversight power? No way, said Long.\n\nLong maintained that some board members felt they couldn\u2019t stand up to Hall, who was being supported by Atlanta\u2019s business community, which typically bankrolled winning school board candidates through a political action committee called EduPAC.\n\n\"That\u2019s a lot of intimidation, and people who don\u2019t recognize that are naive,\" said Long, who called on Hall to resign in August.\n\nReed said the bill strengthened Hall\u2019s power, but argued the board\u2019s oversight \"remained exactly what it was.\" He said many districts considered it a \"best practice\" to have the general counsel and CFO report to the superintendent.\n\nWe talked about this with Warren Fortson, who served as the general counsel to APS for 22 years, until he retired in the early 1990s. Fortson said he argued against SB 204 because \"it builds a wall between the board and the administration.\" Still, he said, the APS board had oversight. Fortson said Long\u2019s claim was too broad.\n\n\"They have oversight of the superintendent,\" Fortson said of the APS board. \"A board has the authority to call in the superintendent for almost anything.\"\n\nSB 204 gave more authority to the superintendent. However, it still gave the board the oversight authority over the superintendent. The board also had consent power over hiring and firing a CFO (Sec. 4-101) or general counsel (Sec. 2-111).\n\nLong said state lawmakers \"took away\" the Atlanta school board\u2019s oversight of the school superintendent. It did not. But it did somewhat diminish the board\u2019s power.\n\nLong\u2019s statement contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts that we believe would give people a different impression.\n\nWe rate his claim Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
