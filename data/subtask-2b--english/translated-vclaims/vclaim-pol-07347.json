Senator Jean Shahin, D-N.H., in the November general elections. Brown was the subject of numerous offensive announcements by outside groups, including a recent announcement by the majority party in the Senate, a pro-Democrat group, who claimed to have voted to grant large tax exemptions to oil companies and, in turn, took over $400,000 as contributions to the electoral campaign. The claim in that declaration was classified as half valid. Now, Brown finds himself the target of a similar announcement, this time directly from Shaheen's campaign. \"The big oil companies are the most profitable on the planet,\" says the novelist at the beginning of a 30-second announcement entitled \"Profit.\" \"Scott Brown voted to give them over $20 billion in taxpayers' subsidies. Big oil gave Scott Brown thousands of dollars within days of his votes.\" At the same time, a vision in the Declaration put a figure on \"in thousands of dollars\" received by Brown: \"The Great Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260,\" the Declaration. This looks like something polyte vac should be solved. Since we have already reviewed Brown's sounds of \"big oil,\" we will focus here on the collapse of contributions to his campaign and the specific number mentioned in the Shahin Declaration. The Shaheen campaign referred to us as OpenSecrets.org, a separate website managed by the Centre for Responsive Policy that follows funds in politics. The website tracks donations of at least $200 in Congressional and other elections. While the Shahin Declaration was first released, the OpenSecrets website showed $454,260 in donations to the campaign by donors to the oil and gas industry for Brown over his career. That's exactly the number Shaheen mentioned. So far, this is actually a little bit of the past; the updated figures show that Brown received $488,010 from donors associated with the oil and gas industry. Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. \u2022 29 January 2021, the total makes the oil and gas industry the 14 most popular sector offered to Brown. The largest sectors receiving funds from Brown are retired individuals, securities and investment, lawyers, law firms and real estate, each with a share of at least $1 million. But these numbers don't tell the whole story. The call of donors in Brown for \"big oil\" is not quite accurate, as many of these donors are not large companies or influential CEOs. OpenSecrets defines oil and gas companies as \"multinational and independent oil and gas products and refineries, natural gas pipelines, gas service stations and fuel oil traders.\" While this category includes what can be widely understood as \"big oil,\" it also includes smaller and independent companies, as well as low-level oil company personnel. Indeed, the distribution of contributions to Brown from the oil and gas industry shows that only $52,550 of the total came from \"the major multinational oil and gas producers.\" This is only 11.5 per cent. There is another evasive: advertising makes it seem like the companies themselves are donating, but this is true of only a minority of the dollars donated. In total, $168,000 came from the Political Action Commissions, which collect personnel dollars and make donations on behalf of the employer. The other USD 287,760 came from individuals associated with oil and gas companies. The reasons for individual donation may be related to everything or have nothing to do with the industry's political agenda. The Governor Shahin's announcement said that \"the big oil gave Scott Brown $454,260.\" The data collected separately show that while Brown received almost this much from donors classified as the \"oil and gas industry,\" only about 11.5 per cent of that shipment came from companies and individuals associated with the largest multinationals -- what most viewers consider to be \"large oil.\" The statement is partially accurate, but it omits important details. So we're assessing this claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07347"}
