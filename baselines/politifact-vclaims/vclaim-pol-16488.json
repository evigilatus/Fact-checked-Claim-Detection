He cites the newspaper in Ottumwa, Iowa, as an example of things gone wrong.\n\n\nProblem is, his example is wrong.\n\n\nThe regular newspaper for Ottumwa, Iowa, is the\n\nOttumwa Courier,\n\npublished six days a week in English, says\n\nOttumwa Courier\n\npublisher Tom Hawley. Reported circulation is around 14,000.\n\n\nOnce a week, the\n\nCourier\n\npublishes a couple thousand Spanish editions along with the regular paper, Hawley says. The top story is printed in English and Spanish and the rest of the paper, which is a compilation of stories from the week, as well as Mexican soccer scores, is printed in Spanish. The Spanish papers are free and distributed across the city.\n\n\n\"It's really aimed at just helping (Hispanics) assimilate in the community,\" Hawley says. In Wapello County, where Ottumwa is the county seat, 7.4 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, according to a 2006 report from the State Data Center of Iowa.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

He didn't really say much. ... He continued to say the same thing even after we explained it.\"\n\n\nWe took this information to the Tancredo campaign, and press secretary Alan Moore disagreed with our findings.\n\n\n\"We stand by our statement,\" Moore said.
