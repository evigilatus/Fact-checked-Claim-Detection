Joe Scarborough of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe flubbed describing the situation in the April 27 show.\nHe was discussing a column by the Washington Post\u2019s Ruth Marcus, whose op-ed highlighted an unreported donation to Bill Clinton\u2019s foundation by Algeria in 2010 as an example of sloppiness. The donation, and others like it, raises questions about whether Clinton went \"soft\" on Algeria for contributing to her husband\u2019s cause under the appearance of earthquake relief in Haiti, Marcus wrote.\nScarborough said the situation will \"stink to high heaven\" even if it\u2019s a legal gray area.\n\"I think it was Algeria, maybe, that had given a donation that went unreported at a time when they wanted to be taken off of the terror list in the State Department,\" Scarborough said. \"They write the check, they get taken off the terror list. ... At the same time, and then it goes unreported by the Clinton Foundation.\"\n\"Is there a quid pro quo there? I don't know, that's really hard to tell,\" he said.\nScarborough went on to break down to his panelists how easy it would be to explain to voters what might have occurred.\n\"This is pretty simple stuff. So Algeria is on the terror list, they want off the terror list, the State Department's making a decision to do it, they write a check for what? How much? How many million dollars do they write a check for? I don't know, but Algeria writes a check. You're from Boston, you know how politics works. They write a really big check to the Clinton Foundation,\" Scarborough said. \"The Clinton Foundation takes the check, and then just, out of nowhere the State Department then decides, well, they are going to take Algeria off the list. Now why did Algeria write a big check to the Clinton Foundation at the time they want something from the State Department? That's pretty simple for most voters.\"\nThe problem with all of this isn\u2019t the donation, or questions about a quid pro quo with Algeria. It\u2019s the fact that Algeria wasn\u2019t ever on the terror list. (Media Matters\u00a0first pointed\u00a0out what Scarborough said.)\nAn ally against terror\nThe list Scarborough mentions is a serious designation given to just four countries the State Department considers state sponsors of terrorism: Syria, Iran, Sudan and Cuba. President Barack Obama is poised to remove Cuba from the list as a show of improved diplomatic relations. (Libya, Iraq and North Korea are the only countries that have been removed.)\nAlgeria is actually a key partner of the United States in fighting terrorism in North Africa and \"has a long history of fighting terrorism,\" the State Department says.\nThe country spent about 20 years locked in a civil war between the military and various Islamist groups after an Islamist group won a 1991 election that was scrapped. The country\u2019s president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, lifted a state of emergency in April 2011.\nBut the country continues to struggle with radical violence in neighboring countries. Algeria was attacked by the group that calls itself al-Qaida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb almost 200 times in just 2013 in the form of improvised explosive devices, bombings, kidnappings, and fake roadblocks.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman rights violations hamper relations\nThe Algerian government is not a state sponsor of terror. But its hands are not clean when it comes to human rights, which is most likely what Scarborough was trying to recall on air.\nThe Washington Post story that revealed the Algerian embassy\u2019s donation of $500,000 also mention that the one-time gift coincided with increased lobbying visits to the State Department about human rights violations.\nIn 2010, Algeria spent more than $420,000 lobbying American officials on inter-country relations and on \"human rights issues,\"\u00a0the Post found, citing documents filed as part of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The year also saw an increase in meetings between State Department officials and lobbyists representing Algeria, growing from \"a handful\" of recorded visits in the years before and after to 12 visits in 2010, the Post reported.\nThe Algeria donation came soon after the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake in Haiti, the Clinton Foundation said. It was unsolicited and went to the Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief Fund, \"where the entire amount of Algeria\u2019s contribution was distributed as aid in Haiti.\" Algeria had not donated before and has not donated since, a foundation spokesman said.\nThe foundation acknowledged it did not alert the State Department about the gift for vetting, which was required under a memorandum of understanding between the Obama administration and the Clintons in an effort to prevent foreign governments from trying to curry favor with Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department by donating to Bill Clinton\u2019s philanthropy.\nSo what are the human rights issues Algeria was lobbying on?\nReports by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the State Department outline the activities of a strict authoritarian government that represses its people\u2019s freedom of assembly and association, overuses pretrial detentions, and employs a judicial system that is susceptible to corruption.\nThe State Department\u2019s 2010 report of human rights issues in Algeria highlights more issues including reports of arbitrary killings, the government failing to account for people who disappeared during the civil war in the 1990s, violence and discrimination against women, and continued restrictions for workers\u2019 rights.\nThe government of Algeria has resisted inspections by independent human rights groups.\nMSNBC's Diana Rocco said Scarborough deserves some credit for indicating he \"wasn\u2019t sure it was\" Algeria, and that the exchange that followed \"clearly shows he\u2019s using it as a hypothetical scenario to make his larger point about how the quid pro quo scenario may have unfolded.\"\nNone of that, though, means that\u00a0Algeria was on the terror watch list in the first place.\u00a0\nNeither Algeria nor other governments revealed to have given to the foundation \u2014 Australia, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Oman and Qatar \u2014 are sponsors of terrorism, either.\nOur ruling\nScarborough was trying to recall the details of a news story about Clinton Foundation donations from foreign governments when he brought up Algeria\u2019s donation to the foundation to try getting off the \"terror list.\"\nThere are parts about the donations that may not look good for Clinton. Maybe it becomes a legal problem, maybe it\u2019s just a political one. But to claim the foundation took donations from a country on the terrorist list is inaccurate.\nScarborough\u2019s claim rates False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06472"}
