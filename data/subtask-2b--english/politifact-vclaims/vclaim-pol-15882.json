The ad, which was initially released in August, repeats a claim McCain made in a speech in May.\n\n\nThe ad opens with scary music, a photograph of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the words \"Don't forget to say Death to America\" painted on a wall.\n\n\n\"Iran. Radical Islamic government. Known sponsors of terrorism,\" the announcer says in a somber tone. \"Developing nuclear capabilities to 'generate power' but threatening to eliminate Israel. Obama says Iran is a 'tiny' country, 'doesn't pose a serious threat.' Terrorism, destroying Israel, those aren't 'serious threats'? Obama \u2013 dangerously unprepared to be president.\"\n\n\nBack in May, McCain made the claim in an address to the National Restaurant Association in Chicago.\n\nWe rated that claim False.\n\nWe examined it again in August when the ad first aired and again found the statement to be\n\nFalse\n\n. But the ad will be new to many viewers this week, so we are revisiting it here.\n\n\nMcCain is distorting Obama's original comments. Here\u2019s the full context of Obama\u2019s remarks in Pendelton, Ore., on May 18, 2008:\n\n\n\u201cStrong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Kennedy did with Khrushchev. That\u2019s what Reagan did with Gorbachev. That\u2019s what Nixon did with Mao. I mean, think about it. Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union. They don\u2019t pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us. And yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying we\u2019re going to wipe you off the planet. And ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war, and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the Berlin Wall. Now, that has to be the kind of approach that we take.\n\n\n\u201cYou know, Iran, they spend one-one hundredth of what we spend on the military. If Iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us, they wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. And we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen. That doesn\u2019t mean we agree with them on everything. We might not compromise on any issues, but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest, and we can reduce some of the tensions that have caused us so many problems around the world.\u201d\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcCain twisted Obama's words when he claimed that Obama characterized the threat from Iran as tiny or insignificant. Obama never said that.\n\n\nObama was speaking about whether to negotiate with Iran, which the Bush administration resisted. Obama noted that previous presidents had met with adversaries from the Soviet Union and China that were willing to destroy the United States, but that President Bush refused to meet directly with leaders of smaller global players such as Iran, Cuba and Venezuela.\n\n\nRather than dismiss those countries as insignificant, Obama was urging direct talks to engage them.\n\n\nAnd Obama elaborated on his comments back in May when he issued a retort to McCain: \u201cSo John McCain, he said, \u2018Oh, Obama doesn\u2019t understand the threat of Iran.\u2019 I understand the threat of Iran. But what I know is that the Soviet Union had the ability to destroy the world several times over, had satellites spanning the globe, had huge masses of conventional military power all directed at destroying us, and so I\u2019ve made it clear for years that the threat from Iran is grave, but what I\u2019ve said is that we should not just talk to our friends, we should be willing to engage our enemies as well, that\u2019s what diplomacy is all about.\n\n\n\u201cSo let me be absolutely clear: Iran is a grave threat. It has an illicit nuclear program, it supports terrorism across the region and militias in Iraq, it threatens Israel\u2019s existence, it denies the Holocaust. But this threat has grown, primarily \u2013 and this is the irony \u2013 the reason Iran is so much more powerful now than it was a few years ago is because of the Bush-McCain policy of fighting an endless war in Iraq and refusing to pursue direct diplomacy with Iran.\u201d\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Obama has talked about the grave threat posed by Iran. He has repeatedly characterized it as such during his campaign.\n\n\nObama never said the threat from Iran was \u201ctiny\u201d or \u201cinsignificant,\u201d only that the threat was tiny in comparison to the threat once posed by the Soviet Union. And if the McCain campaign was unclear on that point, it should have been clear after Obama's comment in May that \"Iran is a grave threat.\" To continue to twist Obama's words, especially after that clarification, earns another False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15882"}
