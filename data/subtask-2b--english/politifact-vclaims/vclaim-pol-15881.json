Barack Obama plays defense in a new\n\ntelevision ad\n\n, alleging that in a previous ad Sen. John McCain's campaign \"selectively edits\" the words of Obama's running mate, Sen. Joe Biden.\n\n\nThe only problem is the Obama ad\u00a0\u2013 which the campaign released Oct. 27, 2008, in the Northern Virginia market\u00a0\u2013 at a minimum\u00a0employs, um, selective editing.\n\n\nLet's unravel this tangled web of selectivity to see who's being dishonest, beginning with the\n\nMcCain ad\n\nthat started the volley.\n\n\n\"Listen to Joe Biden talking about what electing Barack Obama will mean,\" the narrator says.\n\n\nThen we hear an audio recording of Biden at a recent fundraiser: \"Mark my words: It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama,\" we hear Biden say, as sinister music plays over images of hooded gunmen, and hostile foreign leaders. \"The world is looking. We're going to have an international crisis to test the mettle of this guy. I guarantee you it's gonna happen.\"\n\n\n\"It doesn't have to happen,\" the narrator continues. \"Vote McCain.\"\n\n\nThose comments by Biden are lifted from\n\na talk\n\nhe gave to campaign contributors at Seattle's Sheraton Hotel on Oct. 19, 2008.\n\n\nAre they a fair representation of Biden's point of view? To find out we have to look at Biden's remarks in more context\u00a0\u2013 a good deal of context, in fact.\n\n\n\"Barack is the right guy at the right moment for this job,\" he said.\n\n\nHe riffed on foreign affairs a bit, then continued:\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Barack gets it...And I'll tell you why I'm telling you this: because we're going to find ourselves in real trouble when we get elected...We're gonna have the largest systemic deficit in modern\u00a0\u2013 not modern\u00a0\u2013 in the history of the world...So there are going to be a lot of tough decisions Barack's gonna have to make, a lot of very tough decisions, including on foreign policy. And here's the point I want to make: mark my words. Mark my words. It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy. The world is looking. We're about to elect a brilliant 47-year-old president of the United States of America. Remember I said it standing here if you don't remember anything else I said. Watch, we're gonna have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy...we're gonna need you to use your influence, your influence in the community, to stand with him. Because it's not gonna be apparent initially, it's not gonna be apparent that we're right. Because all these decisions, all these decisions, once they're made if they work, then they weren't viewed as a crisis. If they don't work, it's viewed as you didn't make the right decision, a little bit like how we hesitated so long dealing with Bosnia and with Kosovo, and as a consequence 200,000 people lost their lives that maybe didn't have to lose lives. It's how we made a mistake in Iraq. We made a mistake in Somalia. So there's gonna be some tough decisions.\"\n\n\nDid McCain's ad distort Biden's point?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIt omitted Biden's implication that Obama is up to whatever challenges he'll face. But by raising the interventions in Bosnia, Iraq and Somalia\u00a0\u2013 decisions by Republican and Democratic presidents that Biden framed as flawed\u00a0\u2013 he also left room for the possibility that Obama will make mistakes in grappling with international challenges.\n\n\nSo the McCain campaign omitted crucial context, but didn't exactly turn Biden's meaning on its head either.\n\n\nNow let's look more closely at Obama's response ad.\n\n\n\"An economic meltdown, two wars,\" it says. \"And John McCain's playing with audio tapes, selectively editing Joe Biden's words.\"\n\n\nSo far, that's more or less accurate, as we've seen. It goes on to say:\n\n\n\"The next president will be tested. But here's what Biden actually said about Barack Obama: 'They're gonna find out this guy's got steel in his spine.'\"\n\n\nWell yes, Biden did say that. But not at the appearance the McCain campaign highlighted in its ad. The \"steel in his spine clip,\" a phrase Biden has used frequently, came from an appearance a day earlier at a\n\nfundraiser in San Francisco\n\n.\n\n\nSo the Obama campaign took Biden's words out of context even as they accused the McCain campaign of that very sin. But was\n\nthat\n\na distortion?\n\n\nNot really. It was more of a misdemeanor. At the Seattle fundraiser Biden did indeed praise Obama emphatically, just perhaps not as concisely as he had in San Francisco. (We should note that several news organizations\n\nerroneously reported\n\nthat Biden made the \"steel in his spine\" comment at the Seattle fundraiser, so the Obama campaign's mistake may have been inadvertant.)\n\n\nDid the McCain campaign \"selectively edit\" Biden? Yes, but editing generally is selective, and this editing didn't really distort Biden's meaning. Did Biden actually say Obama had steel in his spine? Yes, but a day earlier than he made the comments the McCain ad highlighted, not immediately afterward as the Obama ad claimed. The Obama ad suggests there was some outrageous lapse here, but we don't see it. We find\u00a0the Obama ad Barely True.\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
