Barack Obama won, a reporter for a student newspaper asked Sen. Hillary Clinton why her numbers aren't as strong with young voters.\n\n\"Well, I think they're getting better,\" Clinton said at the March 25, 2008, news conference in Greensburg, Pa. \"You know, I was very pleased at the reception that I've gotten here in Pennsylvania. And, you know, I did very well with young people in Ohio, Massachusetts, California.\"\n\n\nClinton uses three big states whose primaries she won to prove her popularity with young people. Exit polls from those states show she competed well with Obama for voters under 30 years old in two of the three states:\n\n\n\u2022 In California, she and Obama tied at 49 percent each.\n\n\n\u2022 In Massachusetts, she won 49 percent. Obama won 48 percent.\n\n\n\u2022 In Ohio, Clinton won 35 percent. Obama won 61 percent.\n\n\nClinton did better among the youngest voters \u2014 those under 25 \u2014 in California and Massachusetts, but fared worse in Ohio:\n\n\n\u2022 In California, Clinton won 50 percent to Obama's 48 percent.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Considering Clinton usually trails Obama by about 20 points among young voters, a tie is pretty good, Lenski said.\n\n\nExit poll patterns show her performing best among older voters, he added.\n\n\nLenski noted that Clinton won even more youth votes in Oklahoma and Arkansas \u2014 60 percent and 56 percent under 30, respectively, he said \u2014 but may have passed over those examples because they're not big, core Democratic states like California and Massachusetts.\n\n\nIt has been a bit of conventional wisdom in this campaign that Obama is winning the youth vote, which is why we evaluated Clinton's claim of doing \"very well\" in that context. As Lenski said, splitting the under-30 vote with Obama in Massachusetts and California is a good record for Clinton, and we find that part of her claim to be true. But by including Ohio in her claim, where Clinton took less than half of the under-30 vote that Obama won, she has gone way too far, leading us to conclude that her overall claim to doing \"very well\" among young voters is Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16278"}
