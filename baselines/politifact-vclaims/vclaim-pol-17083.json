Lilo is hiding behind a pizza box, not a dryer.\nOn Facebook, posts such as this one are casting this film edit in a nefarious light, using hashtags like #savethechildren and #Pizzagate, a baseless conspiracy theory that emerged in 2016 and claims that children were being abused and tortured at a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C.\n\"I\u2019m wondering who could explain why a movie I watched as a kid that was made almost 20 YEARS AGO suddenly made its way into Disney+ and his this specific \u2018modification,\u2019\" the post says. \"I\u2019m.

Lilo hid behind a pizza box in the version that was originally released in the United Kingdom in 2002 so that it could have a lower movie rating.\nTikTok users may just be discovering the edit but it was under discussion as many as six years ago on Reddit.\u00a0\nThen, like now, there was no evidence that Disney was nodding to an unfounded theory about a child sex-trafficking ring by including a pizza box in an edited scene.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17083"}
