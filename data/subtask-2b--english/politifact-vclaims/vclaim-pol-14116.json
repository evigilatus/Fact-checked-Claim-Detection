Take, for instance, a fresh-off-the-keyboard e-mail received from the Basic Rights Equality PAC -- the political finance arm of Basic Rights Oregon -- that ties the views of one pollster to those of the Senate Republicans.\n\nFirst, the e-mail starts by quoting from a Willamette Week article:\n\u00a0\n\n\"It\u2019s hard to believe. But there it was in bold print in \u2018Willamette Week\u2019: an advisor to Oregon Senate Republicans \u2018advocates death for gays.\u2019 \"\n\nThe e-mail continues, making some assertions of its own:\n\n\"It\u2019s shocking that candidates in Oregon would be so blatantly anti-gay -- even advocating violence.\"\n\nIndeed, it is shocking. That\u2019s why PolitiFact Oregon decided to check it out.\n\nAs a basis for their claim, Basic Right Oregon points to the Willamette Week article, which reported on \"an advisor to Oregon Senate Republicans\" and his alleged extreme anti-gay views. A quick Google search, and we had before us the article with the perfectly provocative headline \u00a0\u00a0\"Republican Pollster In Oregon Says Slaves \u2018Well-Treated\u2019; Advocates Death for Gays.\"\n\nAccording to the article, state filings showed that the campaign arm of the Senate Republicans had paid thousands of dollars to Target Market Strategies for polling over the past few years. Senate Democrats pounced when they learned that Dennis Oliver Woods, the \"company principal\" of Target Market Strategies, had published a book that included the following passages:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeff Merkley\n\n\nstated on June 12, 2012 in a press release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays, \"Less than half of all states have legal protections on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, despite the fact that LGBT Americans report employment discrimination and unemployment at much higher rates than the U.S. average.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Janie Har \u2022 June 18, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some crimes are such a violent assault on the image of God in man or on biblical society that God stipulates that nothing less than death will satisfy His offended sense of justice.\"\n\nAnd then this one:\n\n\"In addition to murder (see Lev. 24:17), the death penalty is specified for a number of crimes. This is the ultimate form of restitution. These crimes include promotion of witchcraft\u2026Bestiality (see Lev. 20:15), homosexuality (see Lev. 20:13), incest and adultery ...\"\n\nWe decided to give Woods a call directly to discuss his views. He wouldn\u2019t chat with us but instead sent us an e-mail that didn\u2019t do much to address what he actually thought. \"My point of view is really irrelevant now since the Senate Republican caucus has dismissed me and I am no longer working for them,\" he wrote.\n\nPolitiFact Oregon wrote him back, asking for clarification. He never responded.\n\nTo learn more, we got our hands on a copy of his book, \"Discipling the Nations,\" from which all this was excerpted.\n\nThe book says that \"Part III,\" the section excerpted in Willamette Week, \"offers God\u2019s Blueprint for Civil Government. Chapter 7 holds forth the Word of God as the only adequate rule for civil government.\"\n\nMichael Gay, the spokesman for the Senate Republicans, says they did not know about Woods\u2019 book, which was published more than 10 years ago and is not widely distributed. They have since stopped using his services.\n\n\"He served no advisory function to the caucus whatsoever,\" Gay said. \"He was merely a vendor who made phone calls.\n\n\"We wrote the poll questions, we told him what to ask, he was scripted.\"\n\nMaya Blackmun, a spokeswoman for Basic Rights Oregon, argues, \"(I)t's common knowledge that on political campaigns pollsters are a key player in advising and consulting on a campaign, interpreting results, providing cross tab analysis, targeting profiles, connecting messages with key audiences, etc.\"\n\nEven if Woods does believe in the death penalty for gays and even if he was an adviser to the Senate Republicans, Basic Rights Oregon asserted that Republican candidates are \"blatantly anti-gay -- even advocating violence.\"\n\nPolitiFact Oregon finds no evidence of this claim. Certainly, no member of the Republican Senate caucus has spoken in support of Woods\u2019 views or said anything remotely similar.\n\nBlackmun concedes that the e-mail could have done with a bit of editing. It would have been fairer, she said, had the e-mail read something to the effect of \"it\u2019s shocking that an adviser to candidates in Oregon would be so blatantly anti-gay.\"\n\n\"We made a mistake,\" Blackmun said. \"The additional words would have made it clearer.\"\n\nWe find the claim that Senate Republicans are advocating violence against gays False.\n\n\u00a0\n\nComment on this story.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14116"}
