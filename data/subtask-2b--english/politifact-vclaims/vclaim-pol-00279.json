During an Aug. 8 interview on WRVA Radio in Richmond, he was dismissive of calls for stronger background checks\u00a0in the wake of fatal mass shootings this year in Virginia and other states.\n\"Criminals don\u2019t go through background checks,\" he said. \"I think it\u2019s like 3% go through a background check - 3%. Ninety-seven percent get the guns on the street.\"\nWe fact-checked Van Cleave\u2019s claim.\u00a0\nDemocrats in Virginia\u2019s General Assembly and in Congress are calling for tighter background checks. Virginia and federal laws require all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling firearms - to run computerized checks to see if buyers have disqualifying criminal or mental health records. But gun sales between individuals not in the business - say, neighbors or hobbyists - are exempt.\nPresident Donald Trump has recently said he supports stronger background checks, but has not specified what changes he favors.\u00a0\nVan Cleave told us his 3% statistic comes from a 2016 survey of 24,848 state and federal prisoners by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. The bureau reported its findings in January 2019.\u00a0\nOf the inmates, 21% said they used or possessed a firearm while committing the crime that put them in prison, or about 5,200 of the sample, according to our calculation (the study did not break down its percentages into numbers of inmates). Of the prisoners\u00a0who used or possessed a gun during the crime:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u202243%, or about 2,240, said they got the firearm \"off the street or underground market.\"\n\u202225% - about 1,300 - said they bought or rented the gun from a relative or friend, or got it as a gift.\n\u20226% - about 310 - said they stole the gun.\n\u202210% - about 520 - said they bought the weapon at a retail outlet: a gun store, pawn shop, flea market or gun show. The rest got their guns by other means.\n\nNow, let\u2019s focus on the 10% who bought their guns from a retailer. They\u2019re important because the researchers identify them as the prisoners who were likely to have taken criminal background checks before they got their guns.\nOf that group of about 520 retail buyers, around 360 - or 69% - said they bought the gun using their own name. And about 350 of the retail buyers - or 67% - said they underwent a background check using their real name. (The survey doesn\u2019t cite reasons why they passed the check, but perhaps they didn\u2019t have criminal records at the time).\nHere\u2019s another way of expressing the finding: About 350 of 5,200 inmates who possessed or used a gun during their crime - or 6.7% - said they went through a background check, using their real name.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nVan Cleave said, \"Criminals don\u2019t go through (gun) background checks. I think it\u2019s like 3% go through a background check.\"\nHe was referring to results from a 2016 survey of 24,848 state and federal inmates by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. About 5,200 of the prisoners said they possessed or used a firearm during their crime. Of that armed group, about 350 - or 6.7 percent - said they went through a background check to get the\u00a0gun.\nVan Cleave slightly understates the percentage of gun-toting criminals who went through background checks, but the gist of his claim - that very few of them did - is sound.\nWe rate his statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00279"}
