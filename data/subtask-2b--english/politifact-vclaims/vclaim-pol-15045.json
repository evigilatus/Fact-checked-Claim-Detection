As originally noted, however, oil production in Texas still topped out in 1972. The corrected production figures don't affect our rating of Commissioner Patterson's statement.\nJerry Patterson, the state land commissioner seeking a third term this November, refers to the the state\u2019s oil-soaked history in a recent column extolling renewable energy. In his article, published Tuesday in the Austin American-Statesman, Patterson writes: \u201cWe\u2019re making more than ever off oil and gas right now, but it\u2019s no secret that oil production in Texas peaked in the 1970s.\u201d\nEven though oil production has been declining, state revenue from oil and gas is the tops?\nWhen we sought background, the General Land Office shared a chart showing state oil and gas income reached a historical high of $495 million in 1982 that wasn't exceeded until 2008, when it hit $533 million.\nThe state's oil-and-gas-related proceeds dropped to $381 million in 2009, the land office says. Counting revenue during the first seven months of this fiscal year, we calculate it will reach $279 million by the end of the 2010 fiscal year Aug. 31.\nTotal state take during Patterson's seven-plus years as commissioner: $2.7 billion.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd when did oil production peak?\nAccording to the Texas Railroad Commission, which tracks in-state oil production, the peak year for crude oil production was 1972 when more than 167,000 wells produced nearly 1.3 billion barrels. As of 2007, production had ebbed to about 336 million barrels. In 2008, production increased for the first time since 1991 to more than 346 million barrels, before falling in 2009, according to the commission.\nR.J. DeSilva, spokesperson for the State Comptroller's office, offered this analysis for the surge in state income from oil and gas surged well after oil production peaked: \"Oil and natural gas production are taxed on the value of oil and natural gas that\u2019s produced. Oil and natural gas prices were higher in the early \u201880s than in the \u201870s (and reached all time highs in 2008).\"\nSo how does Patterson\u2019s statement shake out?\nHe gets the peak-production timing right; it was the '70s.\nBut he's off in saying state government is making more than ever from oil and gas \"right now.\" That was true for the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2008, but in 2009 state oil and gas revenue fell 29 percent from the year before and it's on pace to register another decline this fiscal year.\nWe rate Patterson's statement as Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15045"}
