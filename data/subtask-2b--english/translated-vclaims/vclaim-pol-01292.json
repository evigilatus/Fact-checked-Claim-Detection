Later that evening, he seemed to do exactly that. Hanetti and Trump were both in Cape Gerardo, Moo, where current Democratic Senator Claire Macaskel was held in a close race with Attorney General Josh Hawley. Trump was there to push the crowd to Hawley before the vote. Earlier that day, Hanetti said that he would broadcast his night show from the gathering place, but he pledged not to participate in the campaign event. \"Despite reports, I will make a direct offer from Cape Gerardo and meet President Trump before the rally,\" the Fox News host tweeted. To be clear, I won't be on stage with the president. I'm covering the last gathering of my show. Something I've done in every election in the past.\" Despite reports, I will make a direct presentation from Cape Gerardo and interview President Trump before the rally. To be clear, I will not be on stage with the President. I'm covering the last gathering of my show. It was on November 5, 2018, a few minutes after Trump's remarks, that Sean Hannity was praised by the President and invited to the stage. Trump said to the crowd: \"I have a few people, and they're here, and they're very special, they've done an incredible job for us.\" \"They've been with us from the beginning, too. I'll start by saying, Sean Hannetti, come up.\" Hanetti took the stage and hugged Trump. The host of Fox News then approached the podium and ripped his finger off in the media, which included reporters with Fox News. \"By the way, all these people in the back are fake news,\" he said for applause, citing one of Trump's favorite devices. Huntie told the crowd he didn't know Trump was gonna call him on stage. He then presented an inventory of Tramp's achievements, took a masked strike on former President Barack Obama, and then left the theatre. \"The only thing that made and defined your presidency more than anything else,\" Hannity said, \"the pledges made, the promises kept.\" For any reasonable observer, Hannity appears to have been on stage campaigning with the President - in direct contradiction to his statement hours ago. Facebook was published on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook video showing the man upset because he was added to the no-fly list to break into the Capitol. \u2022 On 11 January 2021, Fox News did not respond to the request for comment. Since the 2016 elections, Hannity and Trump have had each other &apos; s ears, when Hannity publicly supported Trump &apos; s presidential offer, gave political advice to the candidate, and even appeared in a pro-Trump campaign before the vote. \"I do not hide the fact that I want Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States.\" Hannity told The New York Times in August 2016, adding, \"I never claimed to be a journalist.\" (In a subsequent interview with The Times, Hannity described himself as a \"publicist\") Fox News distinguishes between his opinion and the news side of the house. However, the relationship between Fox News and the White House in Trump raised ethical questions as to whether the channel disseminated news or promoted the President &apos; s agenda. Hannity, whose evening program attracts more than 3 million viewers, is the most popular view of the network, and its program is usually the most watched cable news talk show. On the day after the gathering, Fox News released the following statement: \"Fox News does not overlook any talent that participates in campaign events. We have an extraordinary team of journalists leading our coverage tonight, and we are very proud of their work. This was a unfortunate distraction and was treated.\" The network also referred to a tweet from Sean Hannetti about the incident, saying that he was surprised to be called on the stage and that his previous tweet was sincere. What I said in my tweet yesterday was 100% honest. When the President invited me on stage to make some remarks last night, I was surprised, but I was honored by the President's request. This was not planned. - Sean Hannity (@sianhannity) November 6, 2018, however, Hannity actually appeared on stage for a campaign with Trump in a rally, directly contradicting himself. We promised Huntie that he wouldn't go onstage for a campaign with Trump in a rally. After hours, he did it exactly. We evaluate this a full flop. Update: This story was updated shortly after its initial publication to include a statement from Fox News and a tweet from Sean Hannetti.
