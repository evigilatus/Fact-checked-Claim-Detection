Claire Macaskel, D-MO. \"The non-partisan experts have consistently put Claire one of the most independent senators -- right in the middle\" her campaign said in a television announcement. Her Republican challenger, Attorney General Josh Hawley, often criticizes her for voting according to party lines. Did Macaskel follow the party's predecessor or did she often walk away from the left side of the corridor when she made her own decisions? According to the quarterly Congressional newspaper Macaskel, its records of analysis are GovTrac Analysis, and the ideology of the National Journal in support of the so-called independent series. This is what they said: quarterly in Congress: Analysis of the publication showed that Macaskel was one of the least likely people to vote according to her party, and he does so 82 per cent of the time in 2017. Only three senators, Angus King (81 per cent), Joe Donnelly (74 per cent) and Joe Manchen (64 per cent), defected from their party during the voting more than Makaskel. \u2022 Guftrak: Guftrak is a small four-member organization that regularly publishes the state of federal legislation and information on representatives and senators of Congress. On the site analysis page of Akaskel, the first scale presented is its ideological chart. It is one of almost 10 senators who is located near the ideological center. The Guvtrac report card for its 2017 legislative year ranked it the sixth most conservative in the Democratic Senate. It has acceded to the draft laws with the 7th parties most often among all the members of the Senate. Jason Kender stated on August 10, 2016 in the Roy Blunt advertising campaign \"Voice to raise his salary 12 times\" while in Congress. \u2022 The National Gazette: Since 2007, Makaskel has been classified for the first year of office according to the National Gazette as 43rd, 52nd, 53rd, 48th, 51st, 57th and 50th of the 100 senators respectively. The National Journal ceased to create its ideological arrangement in 2013, according to the Macaskel Group. We have contacted six experts in political science to shed some light on the factors that may qualify a senator to be independent. All of our experts, except one, noted that the formulation of the claim was odd. As stated by a research colleague at the Kato Institute and editor of Jason Kuzniki, \"development\" and \"independence\" are not synonymous. Only two senators are currently registered as independents: Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) and Angus King (I-Me). The American Professor of Politics at the University of Missouri Marvin Oferby said that the allegation was exaggerated. \"We live in an age where politics is very partisan and independent politicians unusually rare,\" he said, \"We live in an age where politics is very partisan and independent politicians unusually rare.\" \"But relatively, it is fair to say that - in the era of the extremist party - Macaskel shows more independence than most people.\" Our governor Macaskel said, \"The non-partisan experts have consistently put (she) one of the most independent senators -- right in the middle.\" It is difficult, if not impossible, to define independence. Multiple studies show that Macaskel voted against her party more than most other Democrats. However, experts cautioned that the record of moderate or intermediate voting was not necessarily equal to independence. For these reasons, we value this claim half as valid.
