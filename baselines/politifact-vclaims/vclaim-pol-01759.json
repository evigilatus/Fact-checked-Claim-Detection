Tammy Baldwin used a TV ad to attack both Republicans who are seeking to unseat her, but the Wisconsin Democrat trained her heavier fire on former Marine Kevin Nicholson.\nNicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir are vying in the Aug. 14, 2018, Republican primary. The winner will take on Baldwin Nov. 6, 2018.\nIn Baldwin\u2019s ad, released online on July 31, 2018, the narrator asserts:\nNew reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people.\nSo, Baldwin is portraying Nicholson as being paid big money to play a role in shutting down plants and laying off people.\nThere is a connection.\nBut there is less here than meets the eye.\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAssociated Press story\nTo back up the narrator\u2019s statement, this headline from an Associated Press news story is shown on the screen: \"Nicholson consulted for companies that shed jobs.\"\nThe AP said in the story, posted eight days before the launch of the ad, that the story was based on information provided by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge. American Bridge also produced a video that makes an attack on Nicholson similar to the one in the Baldwin ad.\nAccording to the AP article, Nicholson worked as a consultant for companies that laid off nearly 1,900 people since 2015, shutting down plants in Wisconsin and other states as they moved to save money and shift production overseas.\nExamples included a company that bought Brillion Iron Works near Green Bay through a subsidiary in September 2016 and two weeks later announced it was shutting down the plant, resulting in a loss of 345 jobs.\nTo be clear:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article said Nicholson did consulting for companies that did the layoffs and shutdowns.\nBut it did not say that Nicholson provided any consulting on those decisions.\nThe article also said Nicholson has reported being paid $362,417 in salary and $808,180 in fees (which is a total of more than $1.1 million) from 27 clients between January 2016 and November 2017. But the article did not say how much he was paid for the companies that did the layoffs and shutdowns.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAll of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhat we don\u2019t know\nAn executive for ghSMART, the company that employs Nicholson, told us ghSMART helps companies \"interview, evaluate and develop their senior leadership\" and \"has never advised any clients on whether to close a plant or conduct employee layoffs.\"\nAnd Nicholson\u2019s campaign has reiterated those points, while also going so far in condemning the AP article as to call the reporter a \"liberal hack.\"\nBut Nicholson and his company have also described their work as being more broad, involving more than merely advising about executive leadership.\nThe AP pointed out that, according to the ghSMART website, the firm works with companies and investors on \"management assessment and organizational change initiatives.\" Nicholson himself, the AP noted, has said his job involves helping companies design strategies for growth, assisting with mergers and acquisitions, and problem solving. And Nicholson\u2019s campaign has described his work as \"helping companies solve their toughest problems.\"\nIn short: We simply don\u2019t know what Nicholson may have advised the companies that did layoffs and shutdowns.\nOur rating\nBaldwin says: \"New reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people.\"\n\nAn Associated Press report said Nicholson worked as a consultant for companies that laid off nearly 1,900 people since 2015, shutting down plants in Wisconsin and other states.\nAnd it says Nicholson received more than $1 million for his consulting work between January 2016 and November 2017. But it doesn\u2019t say how much he was paid for consulting for the companies that did layoffs and shutdowns.\nIn short, Baldwin cites no evidence to show how much money Nicholson was paid consulting for those companies. And we don\u2019t know whether Nicholson\u2019s work had anything to do with the layoffs and the shutdowns. There\u2019s simply no evidence of what he did for those companies.\nBaldwin\u2019s statement contains only some element of truth \u00a0\u2014 our definition of Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-08-07 16:44:58 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False   \"New reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people.\"     Tammy Baldwin U.S. senator, D-Wis. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhYzRQiybGQ&feature=youtu.be   In a TV ad Tuesday, July 31, 2018 2018-07-31    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01759"}
