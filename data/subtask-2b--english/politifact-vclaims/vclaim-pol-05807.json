Congressman isn't even real", "text": "Oh, our dear PolitiFact Georgia readers. Bless your hearts.\nThat\u2019s not a socially polite insult. We have sincere concerns after hearing from a reader, alarmed at the outlandish statements posted on Twitter by \"Rep. Steve Smith\" of Valdosta.\n\"Please check out hate-filled (timeline) of @RepStevenSmith,\" the reader asked us. \"How is a misogynist bigot of epic proportions allowed to serve? Dangerous.\"\nOur worry is not with Smith\u2019s timeline.\nTrue, it is littered with (cough) liberal use of \"boy\" to demean those who try to engage and plenty of media baiting, along with the promised \"partisan\" thoughts of someone claiming Tea Party membership.\nBut our reader has, sadly, joined journalists Christiane Amanpour and Ezra Klein in becoming the latest victim of the parody Twitter account.\nSimply: \"Rep. Steven Smith\" is not real. The account, and the Congressman, are fakes.\nHow do we know? We expect to hear protests from our bogus politico on Twitter, so let\u2019s break down how you can trust us on this one.\nStep One: Read Twitter\nSmith\u2019s Twitter bio is succinct and looks pretty official. It reads, \"Republican Representative of Georgia's 15th Congressional District. Tea Party Patriot. Constitutionalist. Partisan.\"\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Smith\u2019s followers on the account include a chief of staff, @TJMitchJohnson. That adds to credibility, right?\nStep Two: Read some government stuff\nWe\u2019re paid to do the research for you, true. But it\u2019s not hard to find an official list of Congressional representatives from the Peach State.\nOur friends at the government transparency website GovTrack have set up web pages showing the elected representation for every state.\nGeorgia, it shows, is represented by two Senators (like all the other states) and 14 members of Congress.\nThe Congressmen (Georgia has no female representatives) hail from districts made up of about 710,000 people each.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those keeping score, then, there is no 15th district in Georgia. There are only 14.\nStep Three: Find the real guy\nA Congressman does of course represent Valdosta. His name is Austin Scott, a Republican whose 8th Congressional District stretches from that south Georgia city, through Scott\u2019s hometown of Tifton and into middle Georgia. \nScott was elected in 2010, riding on an anti-Democratic sentiment that swept national elections that year and flipped control of the House from D to R.\nWhile Scott is not a member of the Freedom Caucus that has pulled the GOP to the right in the past year, he is a clear conservative.\nHe has co-sponsored a bill to repeal Obamacare, and he earned a True on the Truth-O-Meter for his claim that 97 percent of Americans aren\u2019t receiving the premium subsidies under that law.\nScott also has signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge from the Americans for Tax Reform, promising to oppose any effort to raise taxes and has been especially vocal in his opposition to any new federal gun laws.\nScott\u2019s main Twitter account (he also has a campaign account) focuses not only on some of those issues but also the more meat-and-potatoes work you\u2019d expect, like Medicaid workshops in the district and a recent trip to a pecan farm.\nStep Four: Never forget Google\nStill not convinced? There is one other way to check your facts.\nAs anyone who has ever watched \"Catfish\" knows, you can look up your Cyrano, or anyone, in Google image.\nWhen you drop the photo of the man claiming to be Steven Smith into the search engine, no name will appear.\nInstead, it takes you to the website of a big-and-tall men\u2019s store in New Hampshire using that photo.\nBut at least the store is called George\u2019s. That\u2019s almost like Georgia.\nIn that same way, Rep. Steven Smith is almost a Congressman.\nThe outrageous statements in question come from a parody account, not a real U.S. representative. How can someone like that serve?\nThe U.S. Constitution says the only rules to serve are to be at least 25, a citizen for seven years and a resident of the state electing you.\nOf course, all those requirements mean you do have to be real.\nWe rate this as Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05807"}
