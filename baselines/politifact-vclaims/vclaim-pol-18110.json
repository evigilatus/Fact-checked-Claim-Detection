Roy Cooper \u201chas seen his approval rating plummet\u201d", "truth_label": "barely-true", "date": "stated on February 25, 2020 in a tweet:", "title": "NC GOP mostly wrong about Cooper's approval rating", "text": "North Carolina\u2019s Roy Cooper enters a re-election year as one of only three Democratic governors in the South.\nCooper also leads the only state where the governor and legislature didn\u2019t agree on a full budget for fiscal year 2020.\nThe state House and Senate passed a budget in late June. But Cooper vetoed it just days later, saying it didn\u2019t do enough for education and health care.\u00a0\nThe state House voted to override Cooper\u2019s veto on Sept. 11, but the Senate hasn\u2019t been able to wrangle the votes.\nNow, the North Carolina Republican Party is saying Cooper\u2019s budget veto significantly affected his approval ratings. Cooper faces Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Forest in the November election.\n\"Radical (Gov. Cooper) has seen his approval rating plummet after refusing to give teachers their raises or increasing ed funding while holding the state hostage over expanding Obamacare,\" the NC GOP tweeted on Feb. 25.\nThe tweet includes misleading information about the governor\u2019s stance on education and why he vetoed the budget. But, since we\u2019ve previously addressed a claim about the reasoning behind Cooper\u2019s veto, we\u2019re going to focus on his approval ratings.\u00a0\nIs it true that they have plummeted?\nPolitiFact and WRAL reviewed multiple polls conducted before and after Cooper vetoed the budget on June 28.\u00a0\nThe word plummet means to \"drop sharply and abruptly,\" or \"drop straight down at a high rate of speed.\" Most polls show a very slight dip, if any at all.\u00a0\nExperts who spoke with PolitiFact said use of the word \"plummet\" in this case exaggerates what poll numbers show about Cooper, who they say is generally in good shape for an incumbent facing re-election.\u00a0\nA 7 point drop\nWhen we reached out to the NC GOP, its digital director Sasha Duncan pointed us to polling from Civitas Institute, a conservative think tank in North Carolina. Duncan pointed out that Cooper\u2019s approval rating dropped from 58 percent in March 2019 to 51 percent between Oct. 15-17, when the poll was conducted.\nThe same survey showed Cooper\u2019s disapproval rating rising by 6 percentage points, from 29 percent in March to 35 percent in October.\nThere are a couple reasons the Civitas poll doesn\u2019t support the GOP\u2019s tweet:\n\n\nCivitas is only one polling group, and experts say multiple polls are needed to properly gauge a change in attitudes.\n\n\nIt showed a 7 percentage point drop in the survey that has a 4 percent margin of error, which most experts would not consider to be a dramatic fall.\n\n\n\"I would say that, generally, movements of less than 10 percent would not be considered \u2018significant,\u2019\" said David McLennan, director of the Meredith College Poll.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Civitas polling results were unveiled and discussed at an event in October, according to the Carolina Journal newspaper. At the event, Institute President Donald Bryson said Cooper\u2019s approval drop was \"nothing for him to complain about.\"\n\"That\u2019s where an incumbent would want to be late in the year before an election year. But it\u2019s still something to watch,\" Bryson said.\nKaye Usry, assistant director of the Elon Poll, said Cooper\u2019s approval rating suffered a \"slight drop\" between the March and October Civitas polls.\n\"There is certainly a downward trend in his overall approval rating, but it is slight,\" Usry said.\nAs for the reason behind the drop?\nUsry and Jason Husser, the Elon Poll\u2019s director, agreed that there\u2019s little hard evidence to tie the ratings drop to the budget stalemate.\u00a0\n\"A decline along these lines could be driven by the budget stalemate, but it seems more likely that it would be driven by the campaign season calendar and that Cooper now has a general election opponent running a campaign against him,\" Husser said.\nOther polls\nWhat do other polls show? Much smaller dips.\nNorth Carolina is home to several reputable polling universities and organizations.\nMeredith College polls show that Cooper\u2019s approval rating fell 3.5 percentage points from 48.6 percent in October to 45.1 percent in February, McLennan said. Their margin of error was 3 points, he added.\nPolls conducted by High Point University found Cooper\u2019s approval rating to be 40 percent in February, 40 percent in November, and 41 percent approval in April.\nRaleigh-based Public Policy Polling has consistently found Cooper\u2019s approval rating in the 45-to-50 percent range, said Tom Jensen, the group\u2019s director. PPP found Cooper\u2019s approval rating to be 40 percent in June and 45 percent in October, he said.\nCooper\u2019s position\n\"I would consider a 7 point drop to be pretty significant if it was showing up in polling across the board, but it\u2019s not,\" Jenson said in an email. \"And even if you did drop from 58% approval to 51% approval, that\u2019s something most politicians these days would take in a second!\"\nJ. Miles Coleman, associate editor of Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball politics blog, agreed with Jensen\u2019s assessment that Cooper is in a good position. He pointed to surveys conducted by MorningConsult at the beginning of 2019 and the end of the year.\u00a0\nThe margin of error in the Morning Consult polls is only 1 percent.\nCooper had an approval rating of 49 percent at the beginning of the year and 47 percent at the end of the year. Cooper\u2019s disapproval ratings, meanwhile, started at 28 percent and ended at 32 percent. By contrast, Coleman said one-term NC Gov. Bev Perdue started 2012 with a disapproval rate of 48 percent and ended the year at 59 percent disapproval. She didn\u2019t seek reelection.\u00a0\n\"That type of double-digit negative movement would qualify as 'plummeting,\u2019\" Coleman said of Perdue\u2019s numbers. The Crystal Ball blog currently considers the race to be \"leaning\" in Cooper\u2019s favor, he added.\nOur ruling\nThe NC GOP tweeted that Cooper\u2019s approval rating has \"plummeted\" and, as evidence, they cited polls from a conservative think tank. But there are several reasons the GOP\u2019s claim is inaccurate.\nThe GOP cited a poll showed a 7-point dip, which experts don\u2019t consider significant. Other polls show Cooper\u2019s approval rating as stable. And experts, including the president of a conservative think tank, believe Cooper is in good position.\nThe tweet exaggerated the reality of Cooper\u2019s polling numbers. So we rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18110"}
