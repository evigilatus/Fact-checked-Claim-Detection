Facebook users flagged the story for possibly being fake, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to combat fake news.\nOut of the gate, we\u2019ll note the story is fake.\nIt said that the United States Treasury paid $411 million for \"Royalty Payments for Obamacare\" to a limited liability corporation owned by someone named Barry Soetero.\nThe money was for the author of Obamacare for \"expenses and royalties associated with naming the bill.\" The story said Obama was the bill\u2019s author and therefore, he is the one collecting this $411 million. The conspiratorial implication is that Obama actually is Soetoro. (Soetoro is the name of Obama's stepfather,\u00a0Lolo Soetoro.)\nFederalistTribune.com said the money was split among accounts in the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Caledonia. That last one is actually the name the Roman Empire gave to the region that is now Scotland.\nAmong other claims in the disjointed post is a citation for an April 4 missive on FreedomsFinalStand.com, which said Obama had denied using the Soetoro alias many times. FreedomsFinalStand.com said that these contrived royalty payments were stopped after Obamacare was renamed the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a patently absurd assertion about the law officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and was later dubbed Obamacare by skeptical Republicans to taunt Obama.\nBut let\u2019s go back even farther: It appears this post first breached the Internet as a March 11 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site we know was designed to troll conservatives with faux news made up to stoke ire on political issues. The parody website has been the source of several fake news stories that we\u2019ve previously checked.\nThe site\u2019s articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, usually without an indication that they are fake.\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn\u2019t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, either. But its About Us link notes that \"all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\nIt\u2019s difficult to say whether the other sites are in on the joke or not. FederalistTribune.com\u2019s Contact Us link doesn\u2019t seem to perform any action, and FreedomsFinalStand.com doesn\u2019t appear to have contact information at all. Both sites are privately registered, with no personal contact information.\nAt any rate, the tale of Obama using an alias to bilk millions from the U.S. Treasury for naming his signature health care law was made up.\nWe rate the statement Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-04-17 14:22:23 UTC   Politifact    6 1 7  Politifact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says President Barack Obama \"tax audit exposes MILLIONS in offshore accounts stolen from taxpayers.\"    Internet rumors Bloggers   in a headline Tuesday, April 4, 2017 2017-04-04    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03430"}
