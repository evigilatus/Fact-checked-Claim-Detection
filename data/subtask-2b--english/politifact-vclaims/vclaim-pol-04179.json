They do not agree on how to fix it.\nChris Jacobs, the Republican candidate who currently serves as Erie County Clerk, is pushing term limits for state lawmakers. The Republican majority already supports term limits for legislative leaders, but not members.\nAmber Small, the Democrat running for the seat,\u00a0wants to see outside income limited for lawmakers and supports a hefty set of reforms to the state\u2019s campaign finance system. Her campaign is also trying to link Jacobs to the latest string of corruption charges from U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.\n\"What shouldn\u2019t be lost in this web of public corruption is that the same candidate plastering Western New York with commercials calling for an end to corruption has been financed by the same men who are now facing charges in one of Western New York\u2019s largest public corruption schemes,\" Small\u2019s campaign manager Matt Tighe said in The Buffalo News.\nTighe is referring to three men involved in a federal corruption probe that were named in a complaint from Bharara\u2019s office in September. Louis P. Ciminelli, a Buffalo-area developer was named, along with two LPCiminelli executives, Michael Laipple and Kevin Schuler.\nCandidates in a handful of competitive state Senate districts are using Albany\u2019s corruption problem as a hook in this year's election.\nIs Small\u2019s campaign manager right about her opponent taking donations from Ciminelli and his colleagues?\nWho\u2019s donated?\nCiminelli and Laipple \u00a0both donated to Jacobs in his campaigns for Erie County Clerk, the first in 2012. Kevin Schuler has not, according to filings with the Board of Elections.\nLaipple donated $200 to Jacobs' campaign once in 2012.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCiminelli has given Jacobs three donations since 2011, totaling $5,500. He gave Jacobs $2,000 in his first race for county clerk in 2011 and $2,500 in 2014 when he was up for re-election.\nJacobs\u2019 campaign confirmed that Jacobs donated the same amount to United Way when the allegations became public in September.\nCiminelli Development Company gave Jacobs $1,050 in the 2014 election for county clerk.\nAltogether, Ciminelli, Laipple, and Ciminelli\u2019s company gave Jacobs $6,750 between 2011 and 2014 according to filings with the Board of Elections.\nThe donations amount to a fraction of the $300,000 Jacobs has raised in his race for state senate according to the latest filing. None of the accused donated to Jacobs since 2014, though his campaign account for county clerk did give Jacobs a $100,000 head start in this year\u2019s election.\nHe also received donations from at least two political action committees that Ciminelli donated to, but neither has exclusively supported Jacobs.\nOur ruling\nAmber Small\u2019s campaign manager said in The Buffalo News that Chris Jacobs \"has been financed by the same men who are now facing charges in one of Western New York\u2019s largest public corruption schemes.\"\nIt\u2019s true that Ciminelli and Laipple have given to Jacobs in the past, but not in the race for state Senate. Their donations account for a small portion of what Jacobs has raised this year and in years past.\nWe rate this claim as Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7e719f0a-8862-4480-85e3-eec49f707a92", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04179"}
