Even though Demi's on our way right now (they don't want the money to go there) we get him done!\" Trump tweeted on May 8th. After hours at the Peech Caucus in Panama City, Tramp called on the Democrats to work with the Republicans to pass disaster assistance to the area affected by Hurricane Michael in 2018. Trump then spoke of Democrats who did not want to build the wall on the United States-Mexico border - a connection that we will explain later. Trump's comments that Democrats \"don't want\" to go to Panhandle were causing an inflammation of a party battle over hurricane relief funds. Both parties &apos; legislators supported disaster aid, including assistance to Florida, but the party battle was about how much could be provided to Puerto Rico. The Trump tweet repeated the statements of Mr. Rick Scott of the United States, R-Fla, who also blamed the Democrats for the lack of agreement. Party fighting for disaster aid seems to point to the failure of Senate efforts to pass disaster aid. The Senate delayed the amount of money to be given to Puerto Rico to recover from Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. The negotiations took place amidst Trump's criticism of Puerto Rican politicians and his false claim that the island had already received $91 billion. In the House of Representatives on January 16, six Republicans joined the Democrats to pass human resources 268, which included $14 billion to recover from forest fires, hurricanes and other recent natural disasters. The legislation includes $600 million for Puerto Rico under nutritional assistance in the event of disasters. On the same day, the Trump Administration wrote a letter calling for Puerto Rico's financing \"excessive and unnecessary.\" This raised questions as to whether Trump would sign a bill containing funds for Puerto Rico. The Republicans in the Senate wrote a few copies of disaster relief in 2019, including a proposal of $13.45 billion in March by the Chairman of the Senate Accreditation Committee, Richard Shelby, R. It also included $600 million in food assistance for Puerto Rico, describing it as \"a major democratic priority in the draft law.\" However, on April 1, the Senate failed to move forward in issuing two versions of disaster aid. The GOP 44-49 version failed with almost all Democrats voting against it. The democratic version of the House of Representatives failed 46-48, and the Republicans voted against it. Donald Trump's second presidential isolation was \"the most isolated of the two parties in American history.\" By Louis Jacobson: 13 January 2021 for Florida, legislation would have given money to farmers who had lost crops and expenses related to flood mitigation, disaster relief, long-term recovery, and infrastructure rehabilitation. Vice-President Patrick Lehe, Vice-Chairman of the Senate Accreditation Committee, said that the democratic version had increased to $2.6 billion for Florida. This account includes funds for farmers, the reconstruction of roads and communities, and military projects. Exactly how much money will go to any country that, in any case, can change depending on eligibility. Increased pressure to reach a new agreement, with weeks to go before the onset of the hurricane season on 1 June. On 10 May, the House of Representatives is expected to vote on Human Resources Project 2157, which will provide $17 billion in aid, but the chances of reaching a decision in the Senate remain uncertain. In early May, news reports reported that members of the Senate were about to conclude a $17 billion deal involving accelerated access to funds for Puerto Rico and funds for the Middle West floods in 2019. However, the Washington Post reported new wrinkles: the Trump administration wanted to add $4.5 billion to the United States-Mexico border. Legislators from both sides have resisted this idea. Disaster aid was the subject of lunch with senators and Vice-President Mike Pines. Shelby told the Washington Post that both sides wanted help with disasters. Steve Ellis, Deputy Chief Taxpayer for Public Sensitivity, said that Democrats clearly wanted to help disaster to go to Florida. \"In view of the fact that the President has consistently and incorrectly complained about the amount of assistance provided to Puerto Rico, I would like to say that most of the blame is on him. I believe that the Republicans in the Senate are tired of this battle, and with both the Florida Senate seats in the hands of the Republicans, they want to do it,\" he said, referring to Marco Rubio and Scott. \"If he gives his blessing, I think the complementary disaster will pass through Congress like the fatty lightning.\" Our Democrats said, \"They don't want money\" to go to Florida Panhandle to help Hurricane Michael. His response appears to indicate that the Democrats in the Senate voted on April 1 against the GOP version of disaster assistance, because the Democrats wanted more money for Puerto Rico. But Trump does not know that the Democrats in the Senate voted for their own version, which included money for Florida and other disaster-stricken areas. Also, the democratic-led house approved a bill a few months ago. Trump also overlooked his role in delays, including his critical comments on Puerto Rico and his recent request for funds to be added to the border wall. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1f9f6e3-1308-4603-8662-622eb4e218d", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00657"}
