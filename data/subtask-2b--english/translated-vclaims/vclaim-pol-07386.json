The latest figures, reported in July 2014, indicate 4,397 heroin deaths nationwide in 2011, an increase of 44 per cent compared with 2010. At the same time, after a rise of more than a decade, the deaths of prescription opioids claimed a significantly larger number - 16,917 lives, an increase of 2 per cent. But, relatively, how serious is the problem of opiates? In an interview on 15 August 2014 on Wisconsin General Television, the Public Prosecutor of Wokisha Brad Shimel, the Republican candidate for the state Attorney General, was asked what he considered most important in facing the winner in the Nov 4, 2014 elections. Schimel -- who faces the Jeffersonian Hap District Attorney, a democracy -- gave this reply: \"Well, for the time being, the biggest public safety issue we face is the problem of heroin and the prescription of opiates. This is the first cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin. I've been over traffic accidents for several years.\" Is it true that the overdoses of heroin or prescription opiates not only exceed the number of traffic deaths, but are the main cause of accidental deaths in Wisconsin? The latest figures from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that nationwide there were 41,340 lethal overdoses of all types of drugs in 2011, making them the main cause of death due to injuries in the country. But what about Wisconsin? When we asked Shemmel about his campaign about his claim, Schmell responded in an e-mail that he misspoked. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: 2 February 2021, he told us that he meant to say that the number of all drug overdose deaths in Wisconsin -- and not just heroin and opioid prescription deaths -- exceeds the number of car deaths and is the main cause of accidental deaths. We reviewed the latest report from the State Department of Health Services, which said there were 2,789 accidental deaths in 2012. The main reason was the fall of 1,091 persons (also the main cause in 2011, according to the Administration). There were 615 car deaths. The same number of deaths -- 615 -- caused by \"incidental poisoning and exposure to harmful substances.\" However, these 615 deaths included deaths caused by a variety of drugs, as well as other substances such as alcohol. Separately, we obtained figures from the Ministry of Health showing that there were 511 opioid deaths in Wisconsin in 2012. This included 187 heroin deaths, up from 27 in 2002. There were 324 deaths due to either prescription opioids or a mixture of prescription opioids and heroin, up from 144 in 2002. Our classification Schimel said heroin and the recipe for opium were \"the first cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin.\" Shimmel admitted to us that he misspoked, and in fact, the deaths of opiates are at the bottom of the list. The latest figures, in 2012, were the main causes of accidental death in Wisconsin. The second is car deaths and drug overdose of all types - including 511 deaths from heroin or opioids prescribed. We're assessing the statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07386"}
