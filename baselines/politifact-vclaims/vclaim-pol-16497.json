In national polls conducted during November and December 2003, Edwards lagged significantly behind Howard Dean, Wesley Clark, Richard Gephardt and Joe Lieberman.\n\n\nBut the poll numbers were a little different in South Carolina. A few polls showed Edwards trailing, but at least two state polls showed Edwards the leading named candidate after \"Don't Know\" or \"Undecided.\" On the other hand, today Edwards seems to be trailing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in South Carolina in every published poll we were able to find.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.
