Rob Wittman took aim at House Democrats during a recent radio interview, claiming they have spent more time pursuing President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment than legislating.\n\"The critical business of the nation is not getting done,\" he said during a Nov. 11 interview with Jeff Katz on NewsRadio WRVA, \"Everything has ground to a halt and everything becomes these hearings on impeachment. The ridiculous thing about this is there\u2019s actually been more subpoenas issued by the majority than bills passed.\"\nWittman\u2019s claim parrots a similar attack that has made the rounds among\u00a0 Republican lawmakers and\u00a0 conservative pundits as the House continues its probe into Trump\u2019s actions on Ukraine.\nThe claim has roots in an Oct. 22 article from the Washington Times, which said that under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Democrats have issued 56 subpoenas while passing just 46 bills that went on to become laws.\u00a0\nWhile some Republicans specified that the Times article counted congressional subpoenas against House bills that were ultimately signed into law, Wittman was less precise, instead comparing subpoenas issued to bills passed.\u00a0\nIn fact, House Democrats have helped pass more than 500 bills and resolutions, although many have not made their way to Trump\u2019s desk. We reached out to Wittman and his director of communications, Kathleen Gayle, told us the congressman misspoke.\n\"Congressman Wittman meant to emphasize that House Democrats have issued more subpoenas than have had bills signed into law, as clearly there have been many partisan bills that have passed the House by an exclusively Democrat majority,\" Gayle wrote in an email the contained the italics.\nEven this revised claim gives a misleading impression, however. Experts said it\u2019s meaningless to compare subpoenas with House bills enacted into law, because while a committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, there are more hurdles to passing legislation.\nCounting House-backed laws can be misleading\nThe Washington Times counted 56 publicly acknowledged subpoenas that House Democrats issued between the start of their majority and the article\u2019s Oct. 22 publication, including 15 related to the impeachment inquiry.\nThe report\u2019s authors did not respond to requests for comment, but their subpoena tally lines up with what other news outlets have reported. By our count, the House has subpoenaed at least 24 people to date as part of the impeachment inquiry.\u00a0\nPelosi spokesperson Ashley Etienne said she believes the House has issued about 47 in total, adding that many were due to \"stonewalling of the current administration and Trump\u2019s posture of refusing to respond to congressional requests, inquiries and subpoenas.\"\nEtienne also pointed out that during President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, Republicans in the majority issued more than 1,000 subpoenas.\nThe Washington Times said the House has introduced and passed 47 bills-turned-laws since Democrats took over in January. According to Congress.gov, that\u2019s accurate: There are 44 bills and 3 joint resolutions that originated in the House, passed the Senate and were signed into law by Trump.\nBut Josh Tauberer, president of GovTrack.us, a nonpartisan website that tracks government and congressional data, said the number of House bills that become law is not a reliable indicator of how hard the House is working to legislate.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s because bills are often introduced in pairs, with the House and Senate each proposing their own versions. \"But which one is enacted is up to chance and doesn't indicate that only legislators in one chamber put in any effort,\" Tauberer said.\nAlso,the text of a bill is often replaced as it goes through the legislative process, meaning \"the chamber that a bill originated in, and a bill's original sponsor, may have no connection to the substance of the bill when it is enacted,\" he said.\nThis year, the House and Senate have combined to pass 68 bills that earned Trump\u2019s signature, according to Congress.gov. But Tauberer said Pelosi\u2019s House has voted on about 1,200 pages of new laws and roughly 200 unique legislative proposals that ended up in those enacted laws.\u00a0\nThe House can\u2019t make laws by itself\nExperts said the biggest problem with the subpoenas-to-bills comparison is the lack of attention it pays to the Senate\u2019s role in sending House-backed bills to the president\u2019s desk.\n\"The House can't pass \u2018bills into law\u2019 by itself,\" said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University.\nAccording to Congress.gov, the House has passed or agreed to 522 bills and resolutions since January. But the Senate hasn\u2019t acted on many of them. In July, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., vowed to block Democrats\u2019 progressive policy proposals, telling an audience to \"think of me as the grim reaper.\"\nThe GOP doesn\u2019t have the same blocking power when it comes to subpoenas, however.\u00a0\n\"We are talking about two completely different processes,\" said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, a Washington think tank. \"A committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, whereas it takes a majority of House members and senators to enact a law. The latter is a much bigger hump to surmount.\"\nOf course, Wittman\u2019s botched version of the comparison is even more wrong, since he originally said there have been more subpoenas than bills passed, which simply isn\u2019t true.\nWe should note that Political National fact-checked and rated False a nearly identical to Wittman\u2019s, made Oct. 31 by CNN commentator Mike Shields.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\nWittman said, \"There\u2019s actually been more subpoenas issued by the majority than bills passed.\"\nThat\u2019s wrong, and Wittman\u2019s spokesperson told us the congressman misspoke. But the claim the claim Wittman\u2019s spokesperson says the congressman was trying to make - that House Democrats are responsible for more subpoenas than bills passed into law - is also misleading, since it compares two very different processes.\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16802"}
