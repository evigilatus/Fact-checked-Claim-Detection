Gingrich was quick to criticize the government agency designed to \"protect human health and the environment.\"\n\n\"If you look at the EPA's record, it is increasingly radical,\" Gingrich said. \"It's increasingly imperious. It doesn't cooperate, it doesn't collaborate, and it doesn't take into account economics. The city of Nashua recently had a dump that was cited by EPA. They went down to find out, what was it being cited for? And they told them, frankly, \u2018We don't know. We can't find the records that lead to this citation, and we're not exactly sure what it referenced. But it must be bad or we wouldn't have sent it out.\u2019\"\n\nWe wondered whether Gingrich\u2019s vague classification of an EPA citation really went down that way.\n\nFirst we contacted Gingrich\u2019s campaign to find out how the speaker came up with this example, but they never got back to us.\n\nWe turned to Nashua Telegraph reporter Albert McKeon, who did a story on the city\u2019s EPA problem last month, to see if Gingrich explained the situation accurately.\n\nAs far as \"a citation\" goes, McKeon said Gingrich framed that explanation incorrectly.\n\nEPA didn't give the dump a citation. Rather it put it on a list, McKeon said. \"The description for the list itself is very vague. It says it doesn\u2019t imply any organization has committed any violation, it just triggered them to be on a list of being watched.\"\n\nMcKeon reported that Four Hills Landfill in Nashua had appeared on three months\u2019 worth of the EPA\u2019s watch lists for supposed violators of the Clean Air, Clean Water and Resource Conservation and Recovery (for hazardous waste) acts.\n\nThe purpose of the watch list, however, seemed a little fuzzy.\n\nAccording to the EPA Web site, the watch list exists \"to facilitate dialogue between EPA, state and local environmental agencies on enforcement matters relating to facilities with alleged violations identified as either significant or high priority.\"\n\nBeing on the watch list does not mean a facility has violated the law, according to the agency, but only that an EPA investigation, or a state or local environmental study, has led an organization to assert an unproven violation has occurred.\n\n\"Being on the watch list does not represent a higher level of concern regarding the alleged violations that were detected, but instead indicates cases requiring additional dialogue between EPA, state and local agencies -- primarily because of the length of time the alleged violation has gone unaddressed or unresolved,\" the EPA site says.\n\nThe reason Nashua\u2019s dump made the list also was vague, McKeon said.\n\nEPA spokesman Dave Deegan, working at the agency\u2019s Boston offices, told McKeon a \"data lag\" on the watch list, which cited a long-ago state Department of Environmental Services action against the Nashua landfill, got Four Hills on the list. But Four Hills had had no violations in recent memory and was in compliance with environmental standards, Deegan said.\n\n\"Nashua had no idea they were on the list, and the EPA, quite frankly, didn\u2019t either,\" McKeon said. \"(Deegan) said it was a violation in the past. He said they were not really sure what it was, but somehow it got transferred to the EPA's database, and it shouldn\u2019t be on there because there were no problems with Nashua.\"\n\nNashua being on the list was more a matter of not keeping records up-to-date. Nashua is not currently under any scrutiny for any violations, according to the city and the EPA.\n\u00a0\nOur ruling:\n\nGingrich said the EPA cited a Nashua landfill without knowing its reason for doing so. The landfill \u00a0made a \"watch list\" for an outdated action, but it was not cited or fined for any violation by the EPA for being on the list. We rate his claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
