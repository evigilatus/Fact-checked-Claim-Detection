For almost three decades, it was customary for the public defender in Virginia to resign when he ran for governor. The tradition was broken in 2013 by Ken Cuchinelli, a Republican who lost that year &apos; s ruling elections to the Democrat Terry McCulevy. Many of the Democrats and the editor-in-chief of Cuchinelli criticized him for remaining a public defender throughout the election campaign. Herring was on the democratic ticket in 2013, investigating the first two successful runners for the Attorney General's office. Gilbert said that Herring made the \"screw up\" and then resigned as the state's chief attorney if he ran for governor. Gilbert refers to the following paragraph in an article published on 30 September 2013 in the Virginia-Pelut newspaper: \"In accordance with his pledge to take the policy out of the office, Herring said that he would resign as a prosecutor if he decided to run for governor. \"Kuchinelli went beyond criticism of his remaining in office while campaigning for the Governor, challenging a pattern set by many of his predecessors.\" Gilbert said, \"If Herring is serious about his announced plan to run for governor, he must immediately fulfil his pledge to resign.\" Michael Kelly, the spokesman for Herring, said the Attorney General \"will not resign anytime soon.\" Is that equivalent to Herring's reversal of his resignation, as Gilbert says? We brought it up to Philip O'Mitter, who measures whether politicians are consistent with the issues. The timing is a pivotal election day for the next governor in November 2, 2021 - about three years ago. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy on January 12, 2021, nine public defenders resigned to run for governor over the past seven decades, all of whom waited for the election year to stand down. These are their names, political party, month and year in which they left office: Lindsay Almond Jr., D., August 1957; Albertis Harrison, D., April 1961; Andrew Miller, D., January 1977; Gerald Bali, D., January 1985; Mary Sue Terry, D., January 1993; Jim Gilmore, R., June 1997; Mark Airley, R., June 2001; Jerry Kelgor, R., February 2001; and Bob McDonnell, R., February 2009. There is no precedent for the prosecutor seeking promotion in the state government to resign three years before the upcoming Governor &apos; s elections - as Gilbert requests - or even after one year. It is difficult to assume that Herring referred to pioneering work when he promised that he would also relinquish his post. Kelly, Herring's spokesman, rejects Gilbert's statement as \"manufacturing anger.\" Kelly noticed the pilot's article about a month before the 2013 general election and, at that time, he remained a prosecutor despite \"the full-time campaign of the Governor for several months.\" Kelly added that \"Hering has told people what he intends to do in a few years, but he is not exactly running a campaign\" at the moment, so the situation is quite different. In 2013, Herring said that he would resign as a prosecutor if he decided to run for governor. Now that he's admitted his intention to run for governor in 2021, Gilbert is asking Herring to honour his pledge and to remove him immediately as Attorney General. Herring won't. We don't find this hypocrisy. The upcoming Governor's elections are almost three years away. All nine public defenders who had resigned from the office of Governor from 1957 to the election year waited to do so. There is no reason to believe that Ring, who did not specify when he would resign, was promising something different. Herring said, \"Tell people what he's going to do in a few years,\" said his spokesman. Herring was consistent. We're assessing this \"La Flap.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01186"}
