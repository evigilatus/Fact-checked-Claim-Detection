The entire story was fabricated and originated from satirical website, \"The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense,\" which is a part of a network of satire and parody sites.\u00a0\nWe were able to track down the article, which was posted in February 2017, using the internet archive tool Wayback Machine.\u00a0\nThe website includes a disclaimer that reads:\n\"All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney. Pictures that represent actual people should be considered altered and not in any way real.\"\nAccording to CBS News White House reporter Mark Knoller, who keeps records of presidential travel, President Obama took 29 vacation trips over his eight years in the White House. The trips spanned all or part of 235 days (not 692). He also made 39 visits to Camp David, totaling around 93 days.\nEven though the original story was published with a disclaimer, versions of the account were copied and pasted in social media posts with no such explanation and circulated as real news.\u00a0\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16827"}
