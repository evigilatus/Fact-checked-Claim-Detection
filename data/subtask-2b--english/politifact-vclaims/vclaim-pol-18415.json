However, a TikTok post goes even further in an attempt to connect Biden to the cages along the border.\u00a0\n\"Who built the cages, Joe?\" reads the caption. \"Turns out, it was James Biden, Joe\u2019s brother and they (the Bidens) made millions from it\u2026.

Instead, it features a screenshot of a press release announcing James Biden\u2019s hiring at HillStone International, a construction management firm.\u00a0\nAt no point does the press release discuss a project to build cages along the U.S.-Mexico border. There is no evidence that HillStone International was ever involved in a project along these lines.\u00a0\nGil Kerlikowske, commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection during the Obama administration, told PolitiFact in an email that he had never heard anything about a relative of Biden\u2019s being involved in a construction project in a border processing facility.\u00a0\nWe searched a database of government contracts for any contracts awarded to HillStone International from 2008-2016 and got no results.
