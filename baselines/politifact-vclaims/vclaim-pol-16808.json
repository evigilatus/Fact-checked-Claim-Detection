Thom Tillis, says he won\u2019t take money from corporate political action committees.\n\"That means this campaign is funded by people like you -- not the special interests,\" he tweeted on July 31.\nIs it true that Cunningham has received no donations from special interests?\nPolitiFact has investigated similar claims by former Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, Congressman Conor Lamb and, in North Carolina more recently, congressional candidate Kathy Manning.\u00a0\nWhile it\u2019s true that Cunningham hasn\u2019t received money from corporate PACs, he has received money from business executives and PACs that receive money from corporations.\nCorporate PACs\nThe Center for Responsive Politics tracks donations of all types, including political action committees (PACs.) PACs are generally put into three categories: business, labor and ideological.\nThe CRP\u2019s campaign tracker backs up Cunningham\u2019s claim that hasn\u2019t accepted money from business PACs.\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a significant sacrifice for Cunningham, according to Brendan Quinn, CRP\u2019s outreach and social media manager.\u00a0\n\"Corporate PACs don\u2019t usually give that much to challengers,\" Quinn said. When those PACs do donate to Democrats, he said they typically give to those in safe districts.\n\"Not much would go to a Democrat trying to swing a Senate seat in a purple state,\" he said.\nCunningham has received $10,000 from labor PACs, $22,590 from ideological PACs, and even more from PACs tied to Democrats in the U.S. Senate.\nAnd that\u2019s where Cunningham\u2019s claim comes into question. He\u2019s received money from PACs that get some of their money from corporations.\nOther PACs\nCunningham has received thousands from PACs tied to individual senators, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, Cunningham received $10,000 from Forward Together PAC, which is affiliated with Democratic US Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. According to CRP, Forward Together has received money from employees of Amazon, Microsoft, and other big corporations.\nCunningham also received $10,000 from Motor City PAC, affiliated with Democratic US Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan. Motor City recently received $5,000 donations from American Express, Charter Communications, Comcast, Delta Air Lines, FedEx, General Motors, Goldman Sachs and other large corporations.\u00a0\nSo, even if Cunningham has shunned corporate PACs, may have received money that originated with a corporation. Some experts consider that degree of separation that some experts consider significant.\nAndrew Mayersohn, a committees researcher for the CRP, told PolitiFact last year that candidates who receive money from a Senate PAC money are more likely to feel indebted to the Senator than the company who donated to the senator\u2019s PAC.\nIn some cases, though, there\u2019s no separation between Cunningham and corporate leaders. Cunningham has received thousands of dollars from corporate executives.\nCEO money\nHe received big individual donations from the CEO of a financial consulting group, the founder of a pharmaceutical company, and the president of Blue Shield California, among others.\nEnd Citizens United, a group that aims to reduce the influence of money in politics, sees a distinction between receiving money from corporate CEOs and from corporate PACs. The PAC exists to benefit a company, while the motivation of an individual CEO is often unclear.\n\"Individuals can give to candidates for any reason,\" said Patrick Burwinkle, spokesman for End Citizens United. \"That candidate could align with (the CEOs) values,\" from reproductive rights to foreign policy and other issues.\n\"And that's why - unlike Senator Tillis - Cal has taken and followed a pledge against taking corporate PAC money while also releasing a comprehensive anti-corruption plan that would reform Washington's broken political system,\" said Rachel Petri, spokeswoman for Cunningham.\nSome, however, don\u2019t see much of a difference in who the money is coming from.\u00a0\nCorporate PACs are funded by the corporations\u2019 employees, not the organization itself. \"Every dime that goes into a pac is an individual dime, it\u2019s just pooled resources,\" Cleta Mitchell, a conservative campaign-finance and election-law attorney told The Atlantic last year.\u00a0\nMichael Williams, founder of the public policy and communications consulting firm The Williams Group, explained his skepticism to Fortune Magazine earlier this year.\n\"What\u2019s the difference? If you won\u2019t take a particular bank\u2019s money, but you\u2019ll take the bank executive\u2019s money?\" Williams told Fortune. \"Are you really materially changing anything?\"\nOur ruling\nCunningham said his campaign hasn\u2019t accepted corporate PAC money and isn\u2019t funded by special interests.\nIt\u2019s true that he hasn\u2019t accepted money from corporate PACs directly. But he has accepted money from PACs that do accept money from big corporations. He\u2019s accepted money from special interest groups, such as labor PACs. And he has accepted direct contributions from corporate executives.\u00a0\nCunningham\u2019s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\nClarification: This report has been updated to clarify why the statement is rated Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16808"}
