Do most Americans, including most Republicans, prefer to raise taxes and cut spending to address the deficit?\n\nPolls supporting the president\n\nWe searched for public opinion polls to see if they supported the president\u2019s declaration.\n\nThe best evidence in Obama\u2019s favor was a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center and USA Today as the sequester loomed. Researchers talked with 1,504 adults across the country from Feb. 13-18, 2013.\n\nThe survey found broad concern over the federal budget deficit \u2014 and support for a combination of spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nTo reduce the budget deficit, 19 percent said the president and Congress should focus only on spending cuts. Just 3 percent preferred only tax increases.\n\nA strong majority \u2014 76 percent \u2014 sought a combination of both.\n\nWhat about \"a majority of Republicans\"?\n\nHere was the breakdown of support for a mixed approach by party:\n\nDemocrats: 90 percent\n\nRepublicans: 56 percent\n\nIndependents: 76 percent\n\nSo, yes, the poll shows that a majority of Republicans support both spending cuts and tax increases to reduce the deficit.\n\nA November 2012 poll from CNN/ORC International of 1,023 adults was in line with the Pew Center\u2019s results. \u00a0It asked, \"If you had to choose, would you rather see Congress and President Obama agree to a budget plan that \u2026\"\n\nOnly included cuts in government spending: 29 percent\n\nOr a budget plan that includes a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on higher-income Americans: 67 percent\n\nThe party breakdown for the \"combination\" response?\n\nDemocrats: 87 percent\n\nRepublicans: 52 percent\n\nIndependents: 60 percent\n\nMeanwhile, a Bloomberg News poll conducted Feb. 15-18 showed majority support for curbing the budget deficit \"through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on companies and high earners, as the White House has proposed, rather than focusing exclusively on spending reductions, as Republicans assert,\" according to Bloomberg\u2019s article. (We didn\u2019t see the actual poll.)\n\nWe also came across this Fox News poll, conducted by Republican and Democratic pollsters of 1,010 registered voters on Feb. 25-27. \u00a0\n\nIt asked, \"In January, the president and Congress reached a budget agreement that raised tax rates on wealthy Americans and postponed making cuts to government spending. This time,\nwould you prefer the budget deal reduces the deficit by focusing \u2026\"\n\nOnly on cutting government spending: 33 percent\n\nMostly on cutting spending, and a small number of tax increases: 19 percent\n\nOn an equal mix of spending cuts and tax increases: 36 percent\n\nOnly on adding further tax increases: 7 percent\n\nDon't know: 5 percent\n\nSo, a majority of respondents, 55 percent, supported a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. The results we saw didn\u2019t break out responses by party.\n\nPolls that don\u2019t address or undermine Obama\u2019s claim\n\nWe asked House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s office if there were other polls we should consider.\n\nPress secretary Brendan Buck pointed us to an NBC/WSJ poll of 1,000 adults conducted Feb. 21-24.\n\nThey were asked whether they supported the sequester\u2019s automatic cuts, more cuts, or fewer cuts. A majority, 53 percent, either favored more cuts or the sequester\u2019s automatic cuts, which Buck interpreted as support for Republicans\u2019 cuts-only approach.\n\nBut the poll didn\u2019t ask respondents whether they wanted to see revenue as part of a deficit reduction plan. It focused on cuts only.\n\nMeanwhile, 50 percent agreed with the statement: \"These spending cuts are too severe and will hurt our economy. The President and Congress need to find a way to reduce our deficit by working together to avoid this from happening.\"\n\nWhile 46 percent agreed with: \"Washington has become too partisan and the President and Congress cannot reach an agreement on reducing our deficit. Allowing these spending cuts to go into place may not be perfect, but it is time for dramatic measures to reduce the deficit.**\n\nThe poll results don\u2019t directly support Obama\u2019s claim. But they don\u2019t undercut it, either.\n\nBuck also mentioned a survey from Rasmussen Reports, a survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 24-25.\n\nIt asked, \"Should the long-term federal budget deficit be reduced by cutting spending, by raising taxes, or combination of tax hikes and spending cuts?\"\n\nRasmussen\u2019s respondents found cutting spending the most attractive approach, with 45 percent support. Just 6 percent, it said, supported raising taxes alone.\n\nSo, a plurality supported the Republican approach of cutting spending only, while a minority supported Obama\u2019s solution.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that some polling experts, such as the New York Times\u2019 Nate Silver, have raised issues with Rasmussen\u2019s methodology. Its \"robopoll\" strategy, which uses a digitally recorded voice to conduct interviews, showed a statistical bias toward Republicans in the 2010 and 2012 elections. Meanwhile, Pew\u2019s work in 2012 was more favorable toward Obama than the pollster consensus (though Silver hasn\u2019t raised issues with Pew, which he says he respects).\n\nBuck also mentioned a survey from Republican polling firm Winston Group, but beyond the poll\u2019s conservative phrasing, it had the same issue as the NBC/WSJ poll \u2014 it didn\u2019t offer respondents the choice of a mixed approach to replacing the sequester. It asked registered voters only whether they preferred Republican spending cuts or Democratic revenue increases or sequester delay. They favored Republican spending cuts over Democratic revenue increases by 52 percent to 40 percent.\n\nOne other way the president doesn\u2019t enjoy majority support: Just a plurality of Americans, rather than a majority, wanted Congress to pass legislation to avoid the sequester, according to Gallup.\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama said of a balanced approach to deficit reduction that \"the majority of the American people agree with me and this approach, including, by the way, a majority of Republicans.\" We found two polls that supported his statement in its entirety, several polls that supported at least the first half, and polls from Rasmussen and Republican pollster Winston Group presented more of a mixed picture. The majority of the polls we found support the president. We rate the president\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09645"}
