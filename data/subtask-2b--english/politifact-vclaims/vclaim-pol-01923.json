We found that while Clinton supported more border security, the plans back then were not the kind of wall Trump has proposed, and Trump himself said that what Clinton supported was inadequate.\nThe Secure Fence Act of 2006\nThomas\u2019 column linked to a video clip of Clinton discussing her voting record on immigration while a senator.\n\"I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in,\" Clinton told an audience at a campaign stop Nov. 9, 2015. \"And I do think you have to control your borders.\"\nClinton voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which President George W. Bush signed after the measure cleared the Republican-held Congress. It authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico.\nThe act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles.\nThen-Sen.\u00a0Clinton voted in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19. (Notably, then-Sen. Barack Obama and New York Sen. Chuck Schumer voted for it, too.)\nOriginally, the act called on the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended later, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement.\nFence versus wall\nSo how does the fence-building measure Clinton supported compare to Trump\u2019s wall?\nFor her part, Clinton sought to distinguish the two after TV news anchor Jorge Ramos put the question to her at a campaign event.\n\"What is the difference between your idea and Donald Trump\u2019s idea on building a wall with Mexico?\" Ramos asked at the Jan. 11, 2016 Iowa Black and Brown Forum.\n\"So we do need to have secure borders and what that will take is a combination of technology and physical barrier,\" Clinton said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You want a wall then,\" Ramos interjected. \u00a0\n\"No, we\u2019ve \u2014\" she said.\n\"You said that,\" he said.\n\"Well, I voted for border security, and some of it was a fence,\" Clinton said. \"I don\u2019t think we ever called it a wall. Maybe in some places it was a wall.\"\nOn one hand, the differences in semantics between a wall and a fence may not seem too significant because both block people.\nHowever, there are significant differences between the fence Clinton voted for, and the wall Trump pitched during the campaign, which he promised would be an impenetrable, physical, tall and \"beautiful\" wall that Mexico would pay for.\nThe plans Trump articulated for\u00a0the wall during the campaign were somewhat\u00a0vague and inconsistent.\nHe said the wall didn't need to run the nearly 2,000 miles of the border, but about 1,000 miles because of natural barriers. He said it could cost between $8 billion and $12 billion, be made of precast concrete, and rise 35 to 40 feet, or 50 feet, or higher.\n\u00a0\nIn any case, Trump himself criticized the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 election.\n\"Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad,\" Trump said. (Actually, the project didn\u2019t face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.)\nOur ruling\nThomas said that Clinton \"supported a border wall until she ran for president in 2016.\"\nClinton did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico.\nBut the fence she voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump proposed. Trump himself called the 2006 fence a \"nothing wall.\"\nThomas\u2019 statement is partially accurate, but ignores important context. We rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01923"}
