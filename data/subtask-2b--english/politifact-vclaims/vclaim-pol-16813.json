It got bloated to like 236 people, up from 100 in the Bush administration, under President Obama. We're streamlining the National Security Council. There are people that are detailed from different departments and agencies. My understanding is that Col. Vindman is detailed from the Department of Defense. So everyone who's detailed at the NSC, people are going to start going back to their own departments and we'll bring in new folks.\"\nWhen pressed on whether Vindman was being taken off the NSC out of retaliation for his testimony, O\u2019Brien denied it.\nO\u2019Brien: \"I never retaliated against anyone.
