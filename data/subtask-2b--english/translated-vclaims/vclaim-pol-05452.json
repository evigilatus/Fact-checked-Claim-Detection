Many media have questioned Trump &apos; s claim that he spoke against Iraq &apos; s war, noting that it appears that no general position was taken on the war until after the invasion in March 2003. Because Trump continues to make this kind of allegation, we decided to put it on the O-Meter polyte truth fruit. We examined press articles and television lectures from 2002 and 2003, during the debate that led to the Iraq war. We found no examples of Trump categorically denouncing war until one year after the war began. We found in Tramp's comments only one case where Trump discussed war before it started. In January 28, 2003, just three months before the invasion, Neil Cafoto of Fox News Trump asked whether President George W. Bush should focus more on Iraq or the economy. Speaking of Iraq, Trump said: \"Well, either he does something or he does nothing, perhaps, because maybe we shouldn't do it yet and maybe we should wait for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a pretty good job. But, of course, if you look at polls, a lot of people get a little tired. I believe that the Iraqi situation is a problem. I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned.\" Trump seemed to doubt the task here in Iraq, and the economy should be a higher priority. But he did not say anything similar to his claim: Bush should not go forward because war would \" destabilize the Middle East.\" The United States invaded Iraq on 19 March 2003. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u25cf January 11, 2012, a week later, Trump gave a different take. At the Academy Awards after the ceremony, Trump said that \"war is a mess,\" according to the Washington Post. Tell Fox News that because of the war, \"the market will rise like a rocket.\" In August 2004 in Esquire, the most cruel criticism in Trump came out of the war: \"Look at the war in Iraq and the chaos we are in. I wouldn't have handled it that way. Does anyone really think that Iraq would be a great democracy where people would run into the voting box and gently put in their vote and the winner would happily advance to lead the country? Come on. Two minutes after we leave, there will be a revolution, the smartest, most violent man who will take over. He will have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam did not have. \"What's the purpose of all this thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people were killed. And what about the people who come back without arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All these Iraqi children that were blown to pieces. It turned out that all the causes of the war were blatantly wrong. It's all for nothing!\" \"I don't think we made the right decision to go to Iraq, but, you know, we hope we're going out.\" It is clear that Trump opposed Iraq's war in its early years. But there is no evidence that he defended the war in the first place. In our ruling on the Iraq war, \"I was the one who said, \"Don't go, don't do it, you'll destabilize the Middle East.\" \"Trump may have felt this way in private, but he didn't make any public comments in the period leading up to the Iraq war that reflected that feeling. We found only one example of Trump's comment on Iraq's war before the invasion, and he seemed scared but did not strongly oppose the process. He started publicly condemning the war only after I started. Trump makes it look like he stood on a railroad trying to stop Iraq's war train in its tracks. In fact, at a time when the war was strongly criticized, that train had already left the station. We're mostly assessing his statement wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0271543b-ce2b-4dc5-bce2-69d842b2d7b3", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05452"}
