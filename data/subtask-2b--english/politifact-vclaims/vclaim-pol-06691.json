Sheila Jackson Lee can be a firecracker of a public speaker.\nBut we were skeptical of a Facebook meme, shared online Feb. 7, 2015 and brought to our attention by a reader. The meme showed Jackson Lee, a Houstonian initially elected to the House in 1994, saying: \"Hey, all you wrinkly, white-aged has-beens: It\u2019s time for you to die and let the next generation have your spot on the planet.\"\nA web search led us to similar though less racially charged language posted by Stand Up for the Truth, a Wisconsin-based weekday religious public affairs program, in a November 2012 web post critical of the United Nations. The post opened: \"Hey all you wrinkly, middle-aged has-beens: Are you ready to move over and let the next generation have your spot on the planet? After all, you\u2019ve lived a good life.

In other words, your return-on-investment isn\u2019t looking so good to the United Nations.\"\nBy email, the program\u2019s co-host, Amy Spreeman, said she recalled \"coming up with the term, \u2018wrinkly has-been\u2019 for that article.

We also asked the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks the activities of hate groups, if it had noticed such words from the Texan. Spokesman Mark Potok said not, otherwise pointing out a center white paper on the United Nations issue raised by Stand Up for Truth.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also queried Michael McQuerry, a spokesman for Jackson Lee, who said by email: \"She has NEVER said this...
