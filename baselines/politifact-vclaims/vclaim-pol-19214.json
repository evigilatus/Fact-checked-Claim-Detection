Someone shouted a command. And Biden\u2019s voice, through his mask, was picked up on the mics.\nIt isn\u2019t clear what Biden said. But that moment \u2014 a comment made in passing as Biden entered the Capitol \u2014 fueled an unsubstantiated online rumor.\u00a0\nThe rumor: That Biden was using an earpiece to get through the day.\nSocial media users sharing a clip of the scene claimed that Biden was told through his headset to salute the Marines on his way inside, as presidents customarily do. They said that he repeated the command out loud instead of actually offering a salute.\n\"Biden fails to salute the Marines, hears the headset remind him to salute them and says it aloud,\" read a caption on one YouTube video, which showed a snippet from C-Span\u2019s live coverage of the Inauguration Day events. The caption was later removed.\n\"Someone in Biden's earpiece told him to salute the marines, and Biden just repeated the words \u2018salute the marines,\u2019 because he is so used to just repeating what comes from his earpiece,\" said a Twitter user who also shared the same clip from C-Span.\nFacebook posts sharing similar clips were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

There\u2019s no indication from the clip that Biden was wearing an earpiece and taking orders through it. It\u2019s not clear what he said, either.\n\nJournalist Keith Olbermann, Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel and other social media users separately tweeted that they heard Biden say, \"Good looking Marines.\"\n\"That\u2019s a more reasonable explanation tha(n) \u2018Biden had a secret earpiece yesterday, only once accidentally repeated his Deep State instructions, and a random guy noticed it,\u2019\" Weigel, who often debunks manipulated media through his Twitter feed, wrote in a second tweet.\nPolitiFact reviewed C-Span\u2019s footage and video of the same moment as shown by other other networks, such as PBS NewsHour. We found that Biden\u2019s remarks were difficult to make out because of the wind and poor audio, and because he was wearing a mask.\nThe burden of proof is on the speaker, however. The videos shared on YouTube and Twitter did not provide conclusive evidence that Biden was following instructions from an earpiece. We saw no credible reports that he was wearing one as he entered the Capitol, either.\nOn the contrary, the social media claims resemble past conspiracy theories that targeted Biden during his campaign. Those claims alleged, without evidence, that Biden wore a wire or used a medical device to get answers from aides during the presidential debates.\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19214"}
