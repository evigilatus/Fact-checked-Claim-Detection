The board employs 10 full-time staff members.\nOn April 7, the board voted 2-1 to approve a resolution that banned its staff from \"engaging in global warming or climate change work while on BCPL time.\" The resolution grew out of concerns that Nelson had spent time advocating for climate change policies as part of her role as co-chair of Gov. Jim Doyle\u2019s now disbanded task force on global warming.\nThe board is to vote Tuesday June 16, 2015, on a measure that would change the ban from \"engaging in global warming or climate change work\" to engaging in \"policy advocacy\" on the board\u2019s time.\nAbout the board \nBut Walker is not on the board.\nIts members, as defined by the state constitution, are three other statewide elected officials -- Attorney General Brad Schimel and state Treasurer Matt Adamczyk, both Republicans, and Secretary of State Doug LaFollette, a Democrat.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the board is not even part of the executive branch. Its 10 employees represent about .0003 percent of the state\u2019s about 30,000 total employees.\nCullen Werwie, communications director for the state Department of Administration, said no cabinet agency under Walker had such a ban.\nAnd we could not find any such evidence either.\nOn the flip side, we did find examples of government engaging in conversation about climate change -- such as on the Department of Natural Resources\u2019 web page, which talks about climate change and the Great Lakes, and the Department of Transportation documents related to its long-term transportation plan.\nA search for the terms \"climate change\" or \"global warming\" on wisconsin.gov sites yielded more than 1,000 results.\nA tenuous connection\nWhen we asked Forecast the Facts for back up to its claim, it sent an audio recording of the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands meeting and vote.\nBut that board, of course, is separate from Walker. And the group\u2019s claim was broader, referring generally to state government employees, not just those in one department.\nBrant Olson, the campaign director for the group, could not name any other part of state government with such as ban in place.\nInstead, the group cited a quote from Laurel Patrick, the governor\u2019s spokeswoman, in a New York Times article about the board\u2019s ban: \"Generally, Governor Walker does not think it is unreasonable to enact policies requiring board staff to focus on board-related activities.\"\nOlson said the quote showed the climate change ban was \"clearly a decision he endorses.\"\nWhile we were reporting this item, though, the group swapped in some new words.\nThe language on the web site was changed to read: \"Governors Rick Scott (FL) and Scott Walker (WI) both support state agencies that reportedly ban employees from talking about climate change.\"\nEven that could be outdated if the public lands board passes the measure to amend its rule.\nOur rating \nForecast the Facts said Walker runs a state government that bans \"employees from talking about climate change.\"\nBut the group could only name one obscure agency, outside of the governor's jurisdiction, that has such a rule in place. The rule was aimed at barring its workers from doing climate-change work while on state time. And that rule is poised to be amended. Meanwhile, we found plenty of examples where state agencies were discussing climate change.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06311"}
