Lindsey Graham in the red state.\u00a0\nBut a Facebook post suggests \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that something nefarious is happening with the ballots.\u00a0\n\"Jaime Harrison is being left off of SC ballots,\" states the Facebook post. \"South Carolinians who are voting \u2018straight Democratic\u2019 have noted that Jaime Harrison isn\u2019t included on their ballots. Voters have had to manually go through and select individual names.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe South Carolina Election\u00a0Commission had received complaints from the state Democratic Party that some voters said Harrison\u2019s name was missing when they cast ballots on touchscreen machines at early voting.\nChris Whitmire, a spokesman for the commission, said the state consulted with local elections officials and checked out the complaints and found no proof of problems. Whitmire forwarded to us the email correspondence between Shaundra Young Scott, a voter protection lawyer for the state Democratic Party, and Whitmire between Oct. 12 and 14.\n\"We have had multiple reports that Jaime Harrison's name is missing from the ballot,\" Scott wrote Oct. 12, citing complaints from voters in Florence and Georgetown counties.\nIn an email the next day, Scott said that the Democrats had reports from two voters who said they were unable to vote for Harrison when they voted straight party and had to try multiple times. Scott wrote in a subsequent email that a similar situation occurred with a straight party voter in Beaufort who had to try three times before Harrison\u2019s name was included. It wasn\u2019t clear from the emails exactly how many voters had made allegations, but Scott told us in an interview it was a handful.\nWe spoke to Whitmire on a video call so he could show us how voting works on touch-screen machines in South Carolina, one of a handful of states that offer what is known as straight party voting. Roughly half of South Carolina voters generally opt for straight party voting, where they can select all of a party\u2019s candidates in partisan races without having to select them individually.\nHere\u2019s how it works: The voter sees a screen that allows the voter to choose their party. (A voter who doesn\u2019t want to vote straight party hits the \"next\" button.) If a voter chooses Democrat, then the party\u2019s candidates automatically appear\u00a0\nIn this case, when the voter is on the Senate screen, Harrison\u2019s name automatically appears with a green check mark. But if the voter touches Harrison\u2019s name, then his name is deselected.\u00a0\nWriter Jennifer Cohn tweeted an image of what deselecting Harrison\u2019s name would look like. The machine warns voters if they haven\u2019t chosen a candidate in a race.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe touch screen has a review screen at the end, and then prints out a card that shows the voter\u2019s choices. If a voter sees that their selection for Senate wasn\u2019t on the card, the voter can tell the poll manager that it\u2019s wrong, and then the voter starts over. (The printed card is scanned for tabulation. Only one card per voter is ultimately put through the scanner.)\nState officials contacted the election directors in Florence and Georgetown counties, and neither one was aware of any voter seeing a ballot without Harrison\u2019s name, Whitmire told Scott in an email.\nWhitmire wrote that one possible explanation is that some straight-ticket Democratic voters are touching Harrison\u2019s name to make sure they\u2019re voting for him and end up unintentionally deselecting his name.\n\"In this situation, when the voter reached the review screen, they would see no selection, and if they printed their ballot they would also not see Harrison\u2019s name,\" Whitmire wrote. \"Of course, this situation could happen with any partisan candidate.\"\nWe asked Scott if it was possible that voters were unintentionally deselecting Harrison\u2019s name.\n\u00a0\"I don\u2019t want to speculate. We are still investigating and trying to figure that out,\" she said.\nThe party has poll watchers inside polling sites. So far, she said, no poll watchers told her that they had seen a situation with Harrison\u2019s name missing from ballots, but she has asked them to be on the lookout.\nWe also contacted the Harrison campaign and asked them to send any evidence they had that Harrison\u2019s name was omitted from the ballots.\u00a0\n\"We are not currently aware of the problem you described,\" said Guy King, a Harrison spokesman. \"South Carolinians who experience any difficulty trying to vote should call 1-855-785-0222 or go to VOTEBLUESC.com.\"\nHarrison is a former lobbyist who became the first African American to run the South Carolina Democratic Party. Some polls have shown the race as close while others have shown Graham with a lead. Harrison raised $57 million in the most recent quarter, shattering the quarterly record for a Senate candidate set by Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas in 2018.\u00a0\nRELATED: Lindsey Graham\u2019s Truth-O-Meter from PolitiFact\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said \"Jaime Harrison is being left off of South Carolina ballots.\"\nWe found no evidence that Harrison\u2019s name has been left off the ballot, and Harrison\u2019s campaign told us they know of no evidence showing that, either. Elections officials investigated and said voters using touch screens may be accidentally deselecting Harrison after voting straight-party, but it\u2019s possible to fix such an error before casting a final vote.\u00a0\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18712"}
