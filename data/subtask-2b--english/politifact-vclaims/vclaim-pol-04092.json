The Clinton campaigned highlighted this part of the speech to back up Clinton\u2019s debate comments.\n\"In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced ... As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.\"\nTrump said his deportation priorities included criminals, security threats and visa overstays. According to some estimates, about 40 percent of the undocumented population came to the United States on visas and overstayed their departure date.\nWhile Trump emphasized removal of undocumented criminal immigrants and of those who arrived illegally, Clinton\u2019s claim that every undocumented immigrant would be subject to deportation has merits.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other parts of the Phoenix speech, Trump said undocumented immigrants would eventually have to return to their home countries and apply for re-entry.\n\"Those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only: To return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined,\" Trump said.\nBut Trump also gave another mixed message within the same speech.\nHe said that after accomplishing enforcement and deportation goals, after building a wall, ending illegal immigration and establishing a new lawful immigration system, \"then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.\" That suggests that while every undocumented person could potentially be deported (\"subject to deportation\"), they won\u2019t all be deported.\nOur ruling\nClinton claimed that Trump said \"as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.\"\nTrump said Aug. 31 that anyone in the country illegally who wants lawful status has to go back home and apply for re-entry, and that those who came illegally are subject to deportation.\nBut Trump also said \"then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.\" That suggests he doesn\u2019t intend to deport literally every undocumented person.\nClinton\u2019s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ac1ea82e-ae5f-46ba-ad05-e4114efd4e0d", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04092"}
