A new CNN/ORC poll shows about 60 percent of Americans think Congress should refuse to authorize the use of force. Even as an offer of Syrian chemical weapons destruction takes shape, the White House is lobbying hard to sway undecided lawmakers, hoping that classified briefings will nudge them into going against the views of their constituents.\nPolitical strategist Karl Rove gave the administration a bit of ammunition as it tries to win support for a resolution. The public\u2019s views are flexible, he said.\n\"Before President Obama acted in Libya in 2011, the American people were opposed to military action by 35 to 60,\" Rove said on Fox News Sunday. \"After he took action, they were in support of it 54 to 43.\"\nRove\u2019s point? \"The American people do have an animus against any kind of action, but if you take action, and you\u2019re successful, they applaud it,\" he said.\nWe went back to the record to check whether at the end of the day, public opinion can change direction so completely and so quickly.\nRove\u2019s office told us that if anything, Rove\u2019s claim understated the swing in public opinion back in 2011. Three days before Tomahawk missiles struck Libyan air defenses, a Fox News poll showed just 25 percent of the people in favor when asked \"Do you favor or oppose the U.S. military getting involved with the situation in Libya?\" Those against stood at 65 percent.\nThat was in mid-March 2011. By the end of August, a CNN/ORC poll showed 54 percent said they favored the U.S. military action in Libya, while 43 percent were against it.\nThe timeline\nIt helps to get a sense of what was going on in Libya when these polls were taken. As this timeline \u00a0shows, the international community quickly rallied to the cause of the protesters who sought to overthrow Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, but the conflict lasted through most of the year.\nFebruary 2011 -- Popular protests begin, prompting a violent government crackdown. By the end of the month, the UN Security Council had issued a statement condemning the Libyan regime, imposed sanctions and referred Gadhafi to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\nMarch 17, 2011 -- The UN Security Council approves a no-fly zone and the use of all necessary measures to protect civilians.\nMarch 19, 2011 -- British, French and American forces move to enforce the no-fly zone, starting with missile attacks to destroy Libyan air defenses.\nMarch 24, 2011 -- NATO takes command of the mission to enforce the no-fly zone.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril - August 2011 -- Air strikes continue. Special forces from Britain, France, Jordan and Qatar aid the rebels on the ground.\nAugust 20, 2011 -- Rebel and Gadhafi loyalists battle in Tripoli.\nOctober 20, 2011 -- Rebels capture and kill Gadhafi.\nOpinions shift, questions matter\nThe earliest poll we found came from the Pew Research Center. Taken around March 13, it showed a clear distaste for the military options. A slight majority favored economic and diplomatic sanctions, but nearly 70 percent opposed arming the rebels, 77 percent opposed bombing Libyan air defenses, and 82 percent opposed sending ground troops.\nThis was very much in line with the Fox News poll.\nAs soon as the missiles were launched, public opinion changed. On March 20, \u00a0pollsters from CBS News posed this question: \"As you may know, the U.S. military and other countries have begun cruise missile and air strikes in Libya in order to protect civilians from attacks by Gadhafi's forces. Do you approve or disapprove of the U.S. and other countries taking this military action in Libya?\"\nNearly 70 percent of respondents said they approved.\nBut slightly different questions revealed a more closely divided public. Polls at the end of March from Pew Research Center and NBC News/Wall Street Journal asked simply if people thought military engagement was the right or wrong decision.\nThe question did not mention protecting civilians, and support dropped. Both polls found that half the people thought it was the right choice. About 40 percent thought it was the wrong decision and about 10 percent didn\u2019t know.\nAt the very end, in early November 2011, after Gadhafi was dead and a transitional government took over, CBS News asked if the United States had done the right thing by getting involved militarily. Only 37 percent thought the country had done the right thing. Nearly half said America never should have gotten involved. This was well before the attacks on the American diplomatic post in Benghazi, which happened nearly a year later, in 2012.\nOur ruling\nRove said there was a major swing in public opinion from before military action in Libya began to after. In varying degrees, we found polling results that support that conclusion. \u00a0In general, once the missiles fly, the public tends to take a more favorable view of military engagement.\nHowever, some polls found only a modest shift, and much depended on how the question was asked. Overall, the public remained closely divided on the American role in Libya.\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08898"}
