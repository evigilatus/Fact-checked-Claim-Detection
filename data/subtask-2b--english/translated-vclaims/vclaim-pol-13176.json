Fifteen days later, it sought a state-wide recount after the official returns of each province showed that it had more than 7,300 votes out of 1.5 million votes cast. In explaining its decision, Klobenberg told journalists that a recount might not get her the highest, but it would highlight \"elections that now seem to many people to be suspicious.\" I also went to the attack and asked questions about the legitimacy of the number of votes around the state. \"There are illegal and widespread anomalies,\" said Klopenberg, a State Department of Justice lawyer, \"and wide-ranging queries about the conduct of these elections, are more evident in Wakesha County, but also in the provinces around the state.\" The problems of the Wakesha district are well known: the late vote disorder has led to an increase in the total number of Prossers in the official number by some 7,600. The provincial writer Kathy Nicholas, a republic in the Democratic Party stronghold, has not reported her error for more than a day after the elections. In view of the anger about the Wakesha incident, Klopenberg appears to be on hard ground indicating that there are \"wide-ranging questions\" about the elections. But are there \"widespread anomalies\" in the state-level count? This is a much different claim that we can verify. In order to justify her claim, we believe that Klopenberg must show that many questionable cases remain \"unregular\" or \"unnatural\" In addition to the Wakesha case, Klobenberg at the press conference cited \"Andervuti\" in Milwaukee and Racin; a lack of polling and long lines in Found de Lac and several other municipalities; and changes in the informal vote totals in the province of Winnebago. Let's take a look: \"Voices\": this is when the elector chooses not to vote in all races listed in the ballot -- creating a \"negative voice\" in one race compared to the other. For example, this year in the city of Milwaukee, the Milwaukee County Director's race won about 2,000 votes more than the Klobenberg-Prosser race at the top of the ticket. The director of the Clobenberg Melissa Mulbin campaign said that Racine and Milwaukee had an unusually low voice rate in the court race at the state level compared to the local races there. \"You wonder why,\" said Melvin. \"Did the voting machines misread the ballot papers?\" However, in the city of Milwaukee, the Court &apos; s 2011 competition was not the largest contest for the Court &apos; s race in the past three years. In 2008, when Michael Gableman now defeated Louis Butler to the Supreme Court, Scott Walker Lina Taylor, the county executive, got another 3,500 votes. The backward review shows that court races are sometimes attracted more and sometimes less than other competitions, depending on the competitiveness of the races involved. In Racine, the Klobenberg-Proser race received fewer votes from the Racine Mayor &apos; s race. It lacked 150 votes, or 1%. This has also happened before: in 2009, Judge Shirley Abrahamson &apos; s breeze for re-election received much fewer votes than that of a special initial election to the post of Mayor of Racine. But in 2008, the Gableman-Butler race was slightly more than a state-wide referendum in Racine. There's not a lot of pattern there. Neil Albrecht, Deputy Director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, said that understatement in voting was not actually an anomaly. He said: \"It is more reflective of people's comfort and knowledge of certain competitions and candidates.\" Policy scientist WW Madison agreed with Barry Borden. \"Dropoff' is the term we use,\" said Borden, who studies election management. \"It doesn't surprise me at all. This is reasonable to expect when you have a local sex that attracts a lot of attention.\" (The local conditions were on the contrary in another democratic hot zone, Dan County. Craig Gilbert of the newspaper Milwaukee Sentinel stated that the number of people who voted in the court race was 10,000 more than the number who voted in a county race that wasn't even close to him.) :: Deficiencies in the number of voters: the unusually high number of voters voting in the Supreme Court race - at least 14 points across the state than expected - has exacerbated the number of voters in the various communities. \"Cloppenberg is quoted as Fond du Lac County.\" In the city of Fondo de Lac, State electoral officials ordered a writer to issue alternative ballot papers due to lack, resulting lines on screens and late voting. Our research found another shortage in Yao Claire, Shiboygan and Winnebago counties. Together, they included more than 2,000 votes on photo ballots that had to be manually counted. How unusual is this? There are divergent views. Birden said that the use of photo cards is fairly common, but rarely noticed unless the race is imminent. It is sufficiently common for the State to have a law defining the procedure for issuing alternative ballots when there is a shortfall, as Red Magne, the spokesman for the State Government Accountability Council, said. One of the female employees, Lisa Friberg of Fondo do Lac County, said that in her district it was \"unusual\" to use copies of the ballot papers. The writer of the city of Lac Soe Strands, who requests the ballot papers, agreed. Strands said she considered her voice constant. If there were \"disturbed,\" it was limited to four cases in which voters had attempted to place the ballot papers they had copied on the voting machines. They're stuck. The Klubenberg campaign says the question is how these cards were counted. The electoral clerks say that there is some concern about a reliable number of ballot papers, as they cannot be managed through voting machines. This required some manual counting on a crowded electoral night. Differences in informal results: It is clear that the major error in the recording of votes in Wakesha County on election night was extraordinary. :: Polyte Fact Wisconsin has already examined Nicholas &apos; s claim that the errors in that part of the operation are \"joint.\" We found that her mistake was extreme but unprecedented, and we evaluated her claim barely right. It is important to note that errors such as the Wakisha District Account and the 1,100 miscommunications in the informal account from the Winnebago District are usually reviewed and corrected in the official votes of the provinces. This process -- in addition to a special investigation in Wakesha County -- has now been completed, and state officials say that the contradictions between Wakesha and Winnebago have been resolved. If the verification process has already been completed, does this leave Klopenberg with many justifications for Wukisha's listing of problems? It points out that the state will conduct a deeper investigation into Nicholas's previous work -- and that the state's preliminary investigation has found a bunch of inconsistencies in the votes written in the province. So, did Clobenberg support its claim? Their \"negative\" claims do not stand; they are not unaltered based on historical patterns. The errors in the informal account were mostly routine, and are likely to have now been corrected through regular post-election surveys. The situation of Wakesha province was rare, but it was only one province, and the great disparity there had already been eliminated, according to state electoral officials. For Klopenberg: There has been a shortage of ballots - albeit not rare and not per se evidence of miscalculation - in several regions and in no way the rule. The situation in Wakesha province, although it has already been thoroughly investigated, still lacks some outstanding endings, and questions remain about the methods of Nicholas. Therefore, the Clubenberg claim was an element of truth but went beyond critical facts that gave a different impression. Some may call him a liar mostly. But actually O-Meter, that's hardly a definition. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession.
