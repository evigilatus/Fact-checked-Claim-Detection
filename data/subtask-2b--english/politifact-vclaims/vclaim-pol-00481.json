It was posted on June 23 on the Occupy Democrats Facebook page, where commenters cheered the actor on.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Thank you Robert!\" one account said. \"I wish I could have said it better.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But De Niro doesn\u2019t make the statement in the Facebook post in that video.\u00a0\nHe also didn\u2019t say it at last year\u2019s Tony Awards in June 2018, when he walked on stage and declared, \"f--- Trump.\"\nSearching the Nexis news database for \"Robert De Niro\" and \"village idiot\" and \"Donald Trump\" we found no results. Searching for the same words online, we found instances of the insult slung at both De Niro and Trump, but not De Niro calling Trump a \"village idiot.\"\u00a0\nIf evidence surfaces proving the actor made this statement, we\u2019ll reconsider our ruling.
