Either way, Giuliani is correct that Democrats are open to letting some of the tax cuts of 2001 expire, which would raise taxes for those affected.\n\n\nMost of the Democratic presidential candidates have said they want to renew some of the those tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire in 2010. But they also have indicated that they would favor allowing tax cuts to expire that, in their view, unfairly benefit wealthy Americans. The tax rate on household incomes above $200,000 would return to higher levels, as would taxes on capital gains, dividends and estates.\n\n\nBut is that a 20 to 30 percent increase?\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

First of all, the Democrats aren't advocating the elimination of\n\nall\n\nof the 2001 tax cuts. And second, the logic of the Giuliani argument is that a rise in revenues is the same as a tax increase.\n\n\nIf that's the standard, than President Bush's own budget for 2008, released in February, includes a 29 percent tax increase over the same period, too.\n\n\nNope, that doesn't cut it.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00338"}
