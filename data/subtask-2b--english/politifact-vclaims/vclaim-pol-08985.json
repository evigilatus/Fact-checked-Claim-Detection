First time in 47 years,\" one person tweeted.\nBut as we\u2019ve learned with the popular social media tool, you can\u2019t always tell the whole story about something in 140 characters. Sebelius offered more context in her speech.\n\"(D)espite some of the rhetoric in Washington, the cost outlook for Medicaid is as strong as it\u2019s been in a long time,\" Sebelius said during her speech to the National Conference of State Legislatures. \"In 2012, Medicaid spending per beneficiary actually fell 1.9 percent, the first time it had fallen in 47 years, except for the year when prescription drug costs shifted to Medicare Part D.\"\nPolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether Sebelius was correct that Medicaid spending per beneficiary declined by nearly 2 percent last year. We also wanted to find out how many times there has been a decline since the program was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965.\nMedicaid has been a big issue in Georgia over the past year. The state\u2019s top political leaders have refused to join the Obama administration\u2019s plans to expand Medicaid coverage, starting in 2014. Sebelius told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an exclusive interview during her recent visit here that the state\u2019s stance would hurt many working-poor families.\nBut Georgia leaders say the state cannot afford to pay for the estimated 650,000 residents who would be eligible for Medicaid under the expansion. The federal government has pledged to pick up nearly the entire tab in the coming years. Georgia leaders are dubious Washington can follow through with such a commitment and fear state taxpayers might have to foot the bill.\nThere have been many news accounts in recent years about the rise in spending on Medicaid, which provides health services to many low-income Americans. An estimated 54 million Americans receive Medicaid, according to congressional testimony. Medicaid spending has consistently grown higher than the nation\u2019s economic input. The costs rose dramatically in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Many fear it is a budget buster unless costs are brought under control.\nSo how could Sebelius be right about a cost decline?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Robinson\n\n\nstated on July 8, 2012 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding the federal health care law without a tax hike will \"require the state to cut nearly a quarter of its annual budget.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Stirgus \u2022 July 16, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe secretary\u2019s office sent us an actuarial report it put together to support her claim. It was a report on the current fiscal health of the Medicaid program, with statistics on past, present and future spending.\n\"Acute care fee-for-service Medicaid expenditures are projected to grow at an average rate of 5.7 percent per year over the next decade. In 2012, these expenditures are estimated to have declined by 1.9 percent. But they are projected to increase in 2013 and later years,\" the report says on Page 27.\nBy 2012, the report means the federal government\u2019s fiscal year 2012, which began Oct. 1, 2011, and ended Sept. 30, 2012. Sebelius said in her speech that Medicaid spending in 2020 will be 14 percent lower than previously projected.\nOne government spreadsheet we looked at showed federal Medicaid spending rose steadily since its creation. The only years we saw a decline were in 2006, the year when Medicare Part D took effect, and in 2011, which would include portions of fiscal year 2012. Medicare Part D was a drug benefit plan that federal officials said would save seniors money. Medicaid recipients eligible for the Part D benefits were automatically enrolled into the new Medicare program, which lowered total Medicaid spending, federal officials say.\n\"As a result of this shift in coverage, Medicaid drug spending (net of rebates) decreased 44 percent from 2005 to 2006,\" according to the Medicaid report that a HHS official sent us.\nThe same HHS report attributed the 2012 decrease in Medicaid spending on a decline in costs on hospital services and prescription drugs. Some news accounts said fewer new recipients added to the Medicaid rolls helped decrease spending. The HHS report says that was a small factor. The report credits the controversial Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as being another small factor in the spending decline.\nOther organizations sent us reports with similar findings: The only other year Medicaid spending decreased was in 2006.\nTo sum up, Sebelius said per capita Medicaid spending declined by about 2 percent in 2012, the first time in the history of the program that happened, aside from 2006. The reports we reviewed confirm her claim.\nShe was making a much larger point: That Medicaid costs might not increase as rapidly as some had predicted, even though they will still go higher.\nThe federal government has warned spending is going to rise again sharply in the next few years.\nHer claim is accurate but could have used a little more context.\nWe rate this claim as Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08985"}
