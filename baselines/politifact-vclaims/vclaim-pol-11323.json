In his very first budget, Mayor Barrett broke his pledge to keep a lid on property taxes and has continued increasing taxes and fees ever since. In fact, property taxes are up more than 20 percent and fees have doubled.\"\n\nThe website is a detailed complement to an RGA TV ad on Barrett -- the ad featuring an elevator going down. (We\u2019re working on several claims from that ad, which also goes after Democrat Kathleen Falk, also running in the all-but-certain recall election against Walker).\n\nBarrett, in addition to running in the Walker recall race, was re-elected as Milwaukee mayor on April 3, 2012 against underfunded candidate Edward McDonald.\n\nNo one disputes that total tax levy collections rose during Barrett\u2019s two terms, and the RGA gets the numbers roughly right.\n\nBut we were interested in whether Barrett broke an old campaign promise on taxes, and has raised taxes and fees every year.\n\nOn the campaign promise, an RGA spokesman pointed us to an Aug. 7, 2003 Journal Sentinel article on a candidate forum from Barrett\u2019s first bid for mayor.\n\n\"As mayor, I will not raise property taxes,\" Barrett said at the forum.\n\nWe found a similarly forceful pledge in the paper\u2019s coverage of another forum on August 23, 2003.\n\n\"I'm not going to raise property taxes,\" Barrett said at that one.\n\nThe tax levy has grown 25 percent under Barrett, from 2005 to 2012, according to official city figures on tax changes under Barrett.\n\nCase closed?\n\nNo. There\u2019s more to this story.\n\nAfter both Barrett quotes, the stories immediately noted Barrett had made clear his pledge was to freeze the tax rate, not the overall tax levy -- the total amount collected from all city taxpayers.\n\nSo what happened to the rate? The rate actually went down 5.5% in Barrett\u2019s first budget -- the \"very first budget\" the RGA website refers to.\n\nTo be sure, its not an especially impressive feat -- rising property assessments meant the rate could go down even if more money was collected in taxes. What\u2019s more, those same rising property values meant many homeowners faced a higher out-of-pocket bill despite the lower rate.\n\nBut that was the pledge Barrett made.\n\nThe RGA website also says Barrett broke his pledge to \"keep a lid on\" property taxes in his first budget.\n\nThat\u2019s another line right out of the 2003-\u201904 campaign. It came later in the race, when Barrett, under pressure to toughen up his tax pledge, said he would impose a virtual freeze in the overall tax levy in his first budget.\n\n\"Pledges to keep lid on amount collected from property tax,\" the Journal Sentinel said of Barrett in a Nov. 12, 2003 issues story. \"Would allow increase in first budget, for 2005, to account for increased tax base from new construction. Would review this pledge on \u2018a year-by-year basis.\u2019 Not considering any fee increases.\"\n\nSo Barrett made the same \"freeze\" proposal that state legislative Republicans championed at the time -- allowing only for tax increases to cover the new growth in a community.\n\nHow did Barrett do on that second pledge, which was only for one year?\n\nHe proposed a 1.99 percent levy increase for 2005, compared with new construction growth of 2.175 percent. He did not renew his tax pledge for his next budget.\n\nFor the record, in subsequent years, Barrett signed budgets that raised the levy by 5.0 percent, 3.3 percent, 3.3 percent, 4.3 percent, 4.1 percent, 0 percent and 0.5 percent.\n\nThe rest of the RGA claim is that Barrett has continued increasing taxes and fees \"ever since\" that first budget in 2005.\n\nWhat does that mean? One way to hear the statement is an allegation that both fees and taxes went up every year.\n\nAnother is that taxes or fees -- one or the other, not both -- went up every year.\n\nEither way, there are problems with that part of the RGA claim.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that both taxes and fees have not both gone up every year.\n\nBarrett\u2019s 2011 budget -- presented as he ran against Walker -- actually cut the tax levy a tiny amount. It was the only time he had done so in his eight years. Indeed, the RGA\u2019s own TV ad says: \"Taxes went up every year but one.\"\n\nCollections from major fees usually went up, year to year under Barrett from 2005 to 2012, but they went down twice compared with the previous year, city records show.\n\nIn 2011 fees didn\u2019t go up, so that year neither taxes nor fees went up. This is based on the collective take from the city\u2019s major property-related fees, including fees for solid waste, snow and ice removal, stormwater and sewer.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that if you define fees much more broadly -- as every service charge city departments collect -- fees in fact have gone up every year on Barrett\u2019s watch, as his budget documents note.\n\nAnd even in 2011, when fees against residential property owners fell overall, one fee, for stormwater, went up. An owner of a one-to-four unit residential property saw an increase per quarter in that fee.\n\nFor the city, fees are a stand-in for property taxes, we noted in a September 2010 item. We reported that revenue from major fees had more than doubled under Barrett. A new fee -- the stormwater management charge -- went into effect under Barrett.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nThe Republican Governors Association said, \"In his very first budget, (Milwaukee) Mayor Barrett broke his pledge to keep a lid on property taxes and has continued increasing taxes and fees ever since.\"\n\nThe group is wrong on Barrett\u2019s first budget, no matter which of Barrett\u2019s promises you consider. But there\u2019s an element of truth in the part of the claim alleging continual fee and tax increases, depending on how you define fees.\n\nWe rate the RGA statement Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11323"}
