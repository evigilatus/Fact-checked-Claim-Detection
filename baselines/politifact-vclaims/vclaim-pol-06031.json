We are losing our industry. We're losing our business to Mexico.\"\nWe were curious about Trump\u2019s claim that more U.S. companies are relocating south than almost any other place in the world. (China, anyone?)\nHis campaign didn\u2019t get back to us, but given the context of Trump\u2019s claims, we\u2019ll assume he\u2019s talking about outsourcing production overseas, rather than companies packing up their headquarters and moving abroad for good (a practice known as corporate inversion, which often takes place in the Bahamas).\nExperts told us there\u2019s no official tally of the number of companies closing plants in the United States and moving production abroad.\n\"Outsourcing is hard to measure,\" explained Gene Grossman, a professor of international economics at Princeton University. \"Only rarely can we see a firm close a plant in one place and open a new one someplace else doing the same thing. So, we use proxies.\"\nWe\u2019ll look at three different proxies: the amount of imports from other countries, the number of U.S. companies operating in different countries, and the amount of money U.S. companies are investing in firms abroad (known as foreign direct investment).\nOur southern neighbor doesn\u2019t top the list by any of these metrics, but Trump has a point when he says Mexico is near the top. It\u2019s No. 3 in import value, No. 7 in number of U.S. firms (out of 189 countries), and No. 15 (out of 171 countries) in foreign direct investment.\nIf Trump really wanted to name a country as the top outsourcing destination, experts agreed that it would be China, not Mexico. It\u2019s No. 1 in import value and No. 6 in number of U.S. companies. (Europe dominates foreign direct investment.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He\u2019s mistaken. More companies are moving to China than Mexico,\" said Robert Scott, who studies trade at the liberal Economic Policy Institute.\n\"China, in particular, has been a favorite location for many U.S. businesses, often due to the lure of the vast and growing Chinese market,\" added James Jackson, an international trade analyst for the Congressional Research Service.\nMuch of outsourcing to China is indirect, according to Scott. He pointed to Apple Inc. as a prime example of a U.S. company letting someone else do the manufacturing (their most notable contractor is the controversial company Foxconn).\nMexico, however, is certainly competitive and will remain an important outsourcing destination -- thanks to its proximity to the United States and particularly when it comes to making cars and car parts, experts said. While there\u2019s no official tracking, there are plenty of anecdotes of automakers moving south, cited by Trump himself.\nYet some experts contend that while his claim has some truth to it, these relocations and outsourcing are not signs of the U.S. \"losing\" businesses or jobs to Mexico. Rather, these developments are typical of a dynamic economy.\n\"Moving jobs to Mexico has not been the major reason for the decline in manufacturing jobs in the U.S.,\" said Martin Baily, a senior economics fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"Manufacturing jobs as a share of total jobs have been declining in the U.S. for over 50 years, same is true in all other advanced economies.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Our companies are moving into Mexico more than almost any other place right now.\"\nThere\u2019s no direct measure of how many companies are moving plants from the United States to Mexico. When we look at outsourcing through official metrics (imports, foreign direct investment, and the number of U.S. business housed in a certain country), Mexico places near the top but not at the top. Experts said China was the top outsourcing destination.\nTrump used the qualifier \"almost,\" which makes his statement partially accurate, but it still needs additional context and information.
