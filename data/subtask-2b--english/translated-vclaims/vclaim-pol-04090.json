He has been charged several times thus far during the 2016 presidential election. However, he also said that when his reality television programme did not win \"The Pupil\" in 2012, 2013 or 2014. \"There was even a time when Amy didn't get his TV show three years in a row and started tweeting that Amy was fake,\" Clinton said on October 19 in the third and final presidential debate. We decided to check Trump's Twitter feed to see what he had to say. In Amy's case, it's clear Trump's been whining a lot about not winning. April 29, 2013: \"I must have many Amy to train if the process is fair in any case, it's not my day job.\" September 24, 2012: \"The Amazing Race\" wins again Amy full joke. Amy has no credibility -- no wonder the ratings are in record decline.\" September 22, 2013: \"Amy is so boring! Terrible show. I'm going to watch football! I already know the winners. Good night.\" March 2, 2014: \"Which is worse and which is more misleading - Oscars or Imes?\" On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" By Daniel Funk \u2022 19 January 2021 September 24, 2012: \"Amy is all political, and that is why, despite the nominations, January 14, 2013: \"According to many, while I was a candidate, I would have won the Amy Award many times except for my policy. @Premetimeemeemys.\" September 22, 2013: \"#CelebAprentice should be part of Amy's nominations! \"Pure politics!\" That's a lot of anxiety. But Trump never said that Eames' operation was fake the way he identified the U.S. election system. In most cases, Trump complains that politics plays a role in determining the winner, which is not a particularly surprising confirmation when it comes to choices made through awards, or by voters who try to decide who chooses the President of the United States on this issue. Our rule said Clinton, \"There was even a time when Donald Trump didn't get Amy for his TV show three years in a row and started tweeting that Ames was a forgery.\" Trump never makes this charge directly. It describes the system as unfair and political, but does not go so far as to claim that the process is being manipulated or manipulated. We're assessing Clinton's claim half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2b1d7f48-b399-4796-980c-d228a6cb2dca", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04090"}
