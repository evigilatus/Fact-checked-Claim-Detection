This time, it's Benjamin Franklin in the light. The site of June 23, which received more than 6,800 shares in just a few days, uses President Trump as a target to quote the alleged Franklin. We share the \"Occupant Democrats\" page on Facebook, the article shows a picture of Franklin with the following quote: \"We are all born ignorant, but one must work hard to remain stupid.\" Underneath that, a picture of President Trump appears along with the words \"the hardest working man in America.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

The mathematician Barry Bobick also studied the quote in 2013 and found no evidence that Franklin said or wrote. Bobk reported that the phrase \"has been cited in printing only since about 1999\" - far from Franklin's life. This \"quote\" is pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00483"}
