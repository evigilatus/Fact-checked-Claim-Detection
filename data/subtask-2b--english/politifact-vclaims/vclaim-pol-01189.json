The study was prepared on behalf of the state tourism office.\nThe study supports the specific figures Justice cited in his tweet. In the nation as a whole, the report said, spending by resident and foreign visitors increased by 3.0 percent over 2016. In West Virginia, by contrast, total travel spending increased by 3.9 percent.\nIf you do the math, 3.9 percent is 30 percent higher than 3.0 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\n stated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, it\u2019s worth noting a few additional bits of context.\nFirst, a chunk of these increases stem from inflation. Nationally, the inflation rate was 2.2 percent in 2017. This wouldn\u2019t affect the comparison of West Virginia to the nation as a whole -- both increases were boosted by inflation -- but it does make the 3.9 percent increase in West Virginia less impressive.\nSecond, Justice chose to highlight the most favorable data in the report. He chose not to highlight the fact that, according to the report, local tax revenue from tourism fell by 2.7 percent over the same period, while state tax revenue fell by 1.2 percent.\nHow about Justice\u2019s assertion that \"this increase reversed a four-year decline in which travel-generated spending fell more than $600 million\"?\nThe report shows that tourism fell by $695 million from 2012 to 2016, a four-year period.\nJustice\u2019s office did not respond to the data critiques we sent them.\nOur ruling\nJustice said, \"WV's tourism industry grew at a rate 30% above the national rate in 2017. This increase reversed a four-year decline in which travel-generated spending fell more than $600 million.\"\nHe\u2019s right about the comparison of West Virginia and the nation as a whole, and he\u2019s also correct about the decline from 2012 to 2016. However, he engaged in a bit of cherry-picking of the data and glossed over the role of inflation in the state\u2019s tourism spending increase.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01189"}
