The tweet included the following images, and was sent out at 4:25 p.m. Eastern on April 19, 2017:\nPatriots' turnout for President Obama in 2015 vs. Patriots' turnout for President Trump today: https://t.co/OxMEOqZonI pic.twitter.com/pLmJWhOw1j\u2014 NYT Sports (@NYTSports) April 19, 2017\n\nThe top image is the team\u2019s trip to the White House on April 23, 2015, to celebrate the Patriots\u2019 victory in Super Bowl XLIX. The bottom image is their April 19 visit for their come-from-behind win in Super Bowl LI. The post was retweeted almost\u00a049,000 times.\nThe photos appear to show that a mere fraction of the team showed up to visit Trump, compared to the sprawling entourage that visited Obama. The comparison recalled the January 2017 dispute over images showing smaller crowds for Trump\u2019s inauguration than for Obama\u2019s 2009 swearing-in.\nBut while several players were absent from the 2017 visit, it\u2019s difficult to fairly compare the two photographs. The 2015 photo showed the team and its administrative staff, while the 2017 photo did not.\nThe Patriots pointed this out at 8:45 p.m. the same day, noting that more than 40 staff members were seated instead of lining the staircases, forcing the New York Times to backpeddle a bit.\nThese photos lack context. Facts: In 2015, over 40 football staff were on the stairs. In 2017, they were seated on the South Lawn. https://t.co/iIYtV0hR6Y\u2014 New England Patriots (@Patriots) April 20, 2017\n\nWhy no photo with the entire staff this year? \"That\u2019s just what the White House chose to do,\" team spokesman Stacey James told the Boston Globe. The Patriots provided the Globe with a photo the team had tweeted of the ceremony\u2019s rehearsal that did include more than 100 players and staffers.\nThanks @realDonaldTrump & @WhiteHouse for the gracious hospitality today honoring the Super Bowl Champion New England #Patriots! pic.twitter.com/7AU8XsA5Xk\u2014 New England Patriots (@Patriots) April 20, 2017\n\nAnother tweet from the team included images that the Patriots said were a fair comparison by showing only the players and not the full staff. That example included a photo of the team visiting President George W. Bush on May 10, 2004.\nThe New York Times updated its tweet by noting that the Patriots said 34 players visited in 2017 and 50 attended in 2015, but the total number of team and staff was \"roughly the same.\"\nThe newspaper\u2019s story noted that several key Patriots players like LeGarrette Blount, Chris Long, Alan Branch, Dont\u2019a Hightower, Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty had stayed away specifically because they did not support Trump.\nPatriots owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick have described themselves as Trump\u2019s friends. So has quarterback Tom Brady, who had announced in a statement before the gathering that he would be absent because of \"personal family matters.\" Brady also skipped the 2015 ceremony.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNESN Patriots reporter Doug Kyed tweeted out a list of players who did not attend the ceremony before the New York Times story published.\nWe attempted to contact both the New York Times and the Patriots via phone and email, but neither responded with any comment beyond prior public statements.\nAnother element to the attendance appears to be that, well, it\u2019s just not all that special for a team that\u2019s won five Super Bowls since 2002 to visit the White House.\nThe New York Times story provided figures from James, who said 45 players went to the White House in 2002, when Bush was president, closer to 2015\u2019s 50 players. But in 2004 and 2005, the players numbered closer to this week\u2019s 34 player attendees. (WBZ-TV sports anchor Dan Roche tweeted 36 players went in 2004, and just 27 in 2005.)\nNew York Times sports editor Jason Stallman took responsibility for the deflating juxtaposition in an emailed statement to the Washington Post:\n\"Bad tweet by me. Terrible tweet. I wish I could say it\u2019s complicated, but no, this one is pretty straightforward: I\u2019m an idiot. It was my idea, it was my execution, it was my blunder. I made a decision in about four minutes that clearly warranted much more time.\n\"Once we learned more, we tried to fix everything as much as possible as swiftly as possible and as transparently as possible. Of course, at that point the damage was done. I just needed to own it.\"\nEven so, Trump took to his Twitter account the next morning to accuse the Times of lying:\nFailing @nytimes, which has been calling me wrong for two years, just got caught in a big lie concerning New England Patriots visit to W.H.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2017\n\nThe White House had no further comment when we contacted a spokesman.\nOur ruling\nThe New York Times\u2019 comparison made it appear the turnout for President Donald Trump's 2017 ceremony with the New England Patriots was smaller than the team\u2019s turnout with President Barack Obama in 2015.\nWhile many Patriots players did skip the April 19 ceremony, some to avoid Trump, the use of the images together made a false equivalency. The 2015 photo shows not just players, but also Patriots staff members, while the 2017 photo does not.\nThe New York Times updated their tweet and story, and the sports editor has apologized.\nWhile fewer players showed up at this year\u2019s White House ceremony, it wasn\u2019t drastically different than similar situations in prior years. If we\u2019re talking just players, the team has said 34 players visited in 2017, compared to 50 in 2015.\nThis claim rates Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-04-20 20:37:30 UTC   Politifact    4 1 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly False  Images show the turnout for President Donald Trump's 2017 ceremony with the New England Patriots was smaller than the team\u2019s turnout with President Barack Obama in 2015.
