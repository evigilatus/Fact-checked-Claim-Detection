It was published on Facebook on 5 March and referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The tweet by Randy Price, which on Twitter is @IronStache. He is a veteran of the United States Army who ran as a democracy for the first congressional region of Wisconsin. It was shared on Twitter more than 22,000 times and over 500 people responded, including some who said it wasn't Sinclair Lewis' quote. We contacted working families, a political group where Bryce is a senior consultant, according to his Twitter biography, to ask for a quote. A spokesman for the organization said in an e-mail \"it turns out that Sinclair Lewis did not write those exact words, although they were usually attributed to him.\" Bryce talked about Twitter saying it wasn't a quote from Sinclair Lewis. When we reviewed Bryce's account on March 12, the tweet was still stuck on his page. However, he also tweeted excerpts from the Sinclair Lewis Society at Illinois State University, which notes on its website that although the quote appears to be something that Louis or his books may have said, society has never been able to find the exact quote. :: Whether Lewis quoted fascism as \"most questions\" in society, according to his website. The Society also gives passages from two books that are similar to the quotes attributed to it. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" Samantha Butterman wrote in his book \"Can't happen here\": \"But he also felt that the conflict in America was influenced by the fact that the worst fascists were the ones who disowned the word \"fascist\" and were preachers of capitalism under the pattern of indigenous American constitutional and traditional freedom.\" In \"Gideon Planish,\" he wrote: \"I just hope people don't quote Lincoln or the Bible, or comment the flag or the cross, to cover something that belongs more to the bank book and the three gold balls.\" \"There was also a Sherman Yellow play called \"The Strangers\" in the late 1970s that had a similar quote, but no one, including one of Louis' autobiography, Richard Lingman, was able to locate the original martyrdom,\" according to society. In 2007, Harvard published a petition from a researcher for the \"final source\" of the quote, who said that \"it was sustained differently to Upton Sinclair, H.L. But the reader said that the online search for the novel didn't reveal the quote, and when we looked in the book for a quote on Google books, we couldn't find it either. We sent an e-mail to Harvard magazine to see if the publication had discovered the origins of the quote in the years following that reader's request, but Senior Editor Jean-Anne Martin said: \"It is unfortunate that we have not yet found a final source.\" Of course, many people attribute the quote to Louis, not just Randy Price or Facebook poster. According to the story of No. 6 talking points... Others were also commented on. On Godrides, the quote is attributed to James Waterman Weiss. But without a reliable and solid source of quote, we will not attribute it to anyone. We're assessing this wrong Facebook post.
