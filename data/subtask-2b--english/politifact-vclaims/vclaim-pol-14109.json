You're an Obama liberal. That's exactly why they're endorsing you.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother reason, of course, is that Scott has turned down requests to meet with newspaper editorial boards, so he didn't seek their endorsements anyway.\n\nWithout buying into Scott's claim that Alex Sink = Obama liberal, we still wanted to fact-check whether most of the newspapers that endorsed Sink endorsed Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign. Florida is usually considered a swing state, so we wondered if the endorsements lined up as Scott claimed.\n\nWe looked up endorsements from 16 newspapers Sink mentioned. We also looked up two others: The Daytona Beach News-Journal no longer endorses candidates for office, saying that the paper instead preferred \"to emphasize the independence of our news operation and its credibility in covering elections.\" The Lakeland Ledger endorsed Sink two days after the Oct. 25 debate, so we're not including it in our analysis. However, it also endorsed Obama in 2008.\n\nOur next task was to determine which of the 16 newspapers that endorsed Sink at the time of the debate also endorsed Obama. We determined that nine of 16 newspapers endorsed both Sink and Obama, including the St. Petersburg Times, the Miami Herald, the Orlando Sentinel and the Palm Beach Post.\n\nWe found that three newspapers endorsed Sink this year and Republican John McCain for president in 2008: The Tampa Tribune, the Bradenton Herald, and the Spanish-language Miami-based Diario Las Americas.\n\nThe remaining four newspapers endorsed Sink, but declined to endorse a candidate for president in 2008. Those papers were the Citrus County Chronicle, the Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville, the Fort Myers News-Press and the Tallahassee Democrat. (The Tallahassee Democrat has a policy of endorsing only local candidates.)\n\nOne newspaper specifically mentioned Scott's charge that Sink is an \"Obama liberal.\" The South Florida Sun Sentinel wrote, \"Scott likes to tar Sink as an Obama liberal. The truth is Sink's economic platform is pro-business, and she hasn't been campaigning with the president. She doesn't have to. She's smart and accomplished enough to run on her own record.\"\n\nHere, we're steering clear of Scott's charge, but fact-checking his claim that \"most\" of the newspapers that endorsed Sink also endorsed Obama. We found that nine of 16 endorsed Obama. That's 56 percent. That's a bit shy of \"most\" -- it's a bare majority.\u00a0Still, we find that enough newspapers endorsed both Sink and Obama that we rate his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14109"}
