Does that not really matter? Stopping Poll Watchers, voting for unsuspecting people, fake ballots and so much more. Such egregious conduct. We will win!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 23, 2020 \nThere is no reading of this claim that makes it accurate.\nTrump might be recycling the inaccurate claim that in pivotal states, there were more votes than registered voters. Charges of that sort circulated quickly right after Election Day, and they were simply wrong.\nTrump didn\u2019t specify which states he had in mind \u2014 and our request for details from the White House and the Trump campaign went unanswered. So we focused on the states where Trump\u2019s lawyers have most aggressively challenged results: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\nIn each of those, there are far more registered voters than votes cast. In Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the difference is more than 2 million people in each state. At 387,612, Wisconsin has the narrowest gap, but that doesn\u2019t include same-day registrations, so the exact number will change.\n\nIn any event, the number of registered voters greatly exceeds the number of votes counted.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet could also be interpreted as him saying large numbers of people voted twice \u2014 once by mail, and once in person. But there is no evidence of that happening \"in big numbers\" either.\nThe National Association of Secretaries of State tracks each state\u2019s approach to ensuring one voter cannot cast two ballots. Basically, it all comes down to software that links votes to voters, no matter how a ballot comes in.\n\"States have databases that record the receipt of a ballot from a voter and mark that voter as having voted,\" said Philip Stark, University of California-Berkeley election security researcher. \"If you vote by mail and your ballot was received, you would not be permitted to cast a vote in person at the polls; you would be marked as having voted already.\"\nThere have been instances when voters show up to vote in person before their mailed ballot arrives. The same voter database process works that direction, too. The voter\u2019s appearance at the polling station is recorded and if a mailed ballot appears, it is saved, but not counted.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that in key swing states, there were more votes than people voting, \"in big numbers.\"\nThere is zero proof. If he meant there were more votes cast than registered voters, election data show the opposite. In the six key states we examined, there were between several hundred thousand and 2 million more registered voters than votes cast.\nIf he meant that there was a lot of double voting, his lawyers have provided no evidence to back that up. States use careful systems to prevent that from taking place.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18566"}
