Checking Bill Clinton's claim", "text": "It is one of the most controversial gun control policies: A ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines that allow shooters to keep firing longer without reloading.\nWhile defining what is and isn\u2019t an assault weapon is hard, singling out the broad class of firearms the term conveys is not. Following the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, former President Bill Clinton invoked the ban that passed on his watch.\n\"How many more people have to die before we reinstate the assault weapons ban and the limit on high-capacity magazines and pass universal background checks?\" Clinton tweeted Aug. 5. \"After they passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again. We must act now.\"\nHow many more people have to die before we reinstate the assault weapons ban & the limit on high-capacity magazines & pass universal background checks? After they passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again. We must act now.\u2014 Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) August 5, 2019 \nClinton touched back on the trend in an op-ed for Time on Aug. 8. So we wanted to check it out.\nWe\u2019ve dug into the general question of the impact of the 1994 law before. This is the first time we examine its specific tie to mass shooting deaths, and whether the death toll rose after the ban ended. (Clinton\u2019s tweet assumes that the presence or absence of the ban changed the number of mass shooting deaths. Proving cause and effect is a heavy lift.)\nThe topic is riddled with tough data challenges. The law banned only certain types of semi-automatic firearms along with magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Should rampages using other kinds of assault-style weapons count? Plus, mass shootings happen much less frequently than other gun crimes, which puts any scientific analysis at a disadvantage.\nThat said, the evidence shows that mass shooting deaths rose in the years after the ban. The drop during the ban is less clear cut. The impact of the law is debated, but some researchers say that data and logic show that limits on large capacity magazines and assault weapons help reduce fatalities.\nA limited law\nThe 1994 law barred the \"manufacture, transfer, and possession\" of about 118 firearm models and all magazines holding over 10 rounds. People who owned such weaponry could keep it. When the ban took effect, there were roughly 1 million assault weapons in private hands. An estimated 25 million weapons were equipped with large capacity magazines.\nThe ban expired in 2004.\nIn a key 2004 study commissioned by the U.S. Justice Department, researcher Christopher Koper wrote, \"The ban\u2019s exemption of millions of pre-ban assault weapons and large capacity magazines ensured that the effects of the law would occur only gradually.\"\n\"Should it be renewed, the ban\u2019s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement,\" Koper wrote.\nClinton\u2019s new data\nClinton\u2019s office cited a 2019 study from New York University\u2019s School of Medicine. A group led by epidemiologist Charles DiMaggio homed in on mass shooting deaths. (Other research has tracked the number of times mass shootings happened, which is not the same thing.)\nResearchers define mass shootings in different ways. Following the FBI\u2019s definition, DiMaggio\u2019s group looked at incidents where at least four people died.\nIn raw numbers, they found that mass shooting deaths fell during the years of the ban, and rose afterwards. DiMaggio shared his data.\u00a0\n\n\"During the ban period, there were fewer bodies,\" DiMaggio said.\nThe death toll from mass shootings went from 4.8 per year during the ban years to 23.8 per year afterwards.\nMany factors drive gun deaths. To help account for those, DiMaggio\u2019s team put mass shooting deaths in terms of the total number of firearm homicides. Viewed that way, they found that between 1994 and 2004, the yearly rate fell by 7-9 people per 10,000 firearm homicides.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s room for debate over what happened to death rates, in contrast to raw numbers, before and during the ban.\u00a0\n\"There is some evidence they actually declined \u2014 or at least didn\u2019t continue to increase during the period of the ban,\" DiMaggio said.\nEpidemiologists speak in terms of risk; that is, the odds of something bad happening. DiMaggio\u2019s study concluded that mass shooting deaths were 70% less likely during the ban.\u00a0\nThe ban\u2019s impact remains unclear\nOn the key policy question of whether the ban drove the decline, DiMaggio urges caution.\n\"It is pretty much impossible to prove cause and effect,\" he said.\nThat\u2019s the consensus among a number of researchers. Philip Cook at Duke University said the death toll is real, but complicated.\n\"Violence rates were quite volatile during that period generally for reasons that had nothing to do with gun regulation,\" Cook said. \"That doesn\u2019t mean that the ban was ineffective \u2014 only that we don\u2019t know and probably cannot determine the answer given that the outcome of interest (mass shootings) is so rare.\"\u00a0\nThe drop of 15 mass shooting deaths from before the ban to during it is a slender difference on which to base firm conclusions.\nEconomist Rosanna Smart at RAND, a consulting nonprofit research group, agreed that mass shootings rose after the ban ended, but noted, \"I don\u2019t think (DiMaggio\u2019s) methods are well-suited for determining the causal impact of the assault weapons ban.\"\nIn a 2018 article, Smart reviewed two studies on the impact of the ban. She said strictly in terms of statistical methods, the results were \"inconclusive.\" Although one report did find that state-level bans were effective at reducing mass shooting death rates.\nRefocusing on larger magazines\nThe debate over the value of a ban on assault weapons and large capacity magazines often includes Christopher Koper at George Mason University. Koper wrote the 2004 study that gave both sides in the gun control debate material to lean on.\nRecently, Koper has spent more time assessing the role of large capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.\u00a0\nIn an article, Koper wrote that more than the semiautomatic weapons themselves, the latest data ties the larger magazines to a rising death toll.\n\"Considering that mass shootings with high capacity semiautomatics are considerably more lethal and injurious than other mass shootings, it is reasonable to argue that the federal ban could have prevented some of the recent increase in persons killed and injured in mass shootings had it remained in place,\" Koper wrote in an article to be published in a few months.\nDemocrats introduced a legislation to block people from buying large capacity magazines.\nSemiautomatic rifles account for a small percentage of deaths, but there are a lot of them. According to the industry trade group National Shooting Sports Foundation, yearly sales averaged about 200,000 during the years of the ban. In the eight years after the ban ended, sales averaged about 700,000 a year.\nOur ruling\nClinton urged lawmakers to reinstate a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. \"After they passed in 1994, there was a big drop in mass shooting deaths. When the ban expired, they rose again,\" he said.\nClinton spoke too strongly about the drop. In simple numbers, mass shooting deaths fell during the ban years \u201415 deaths over the course of the decade. But statistically, that number is too small to allow strong conclusions. Even the author of the report Clinton relied on said the death rate might have declined \u2014or levelled off.\nThe rise after the ban expired is supported by the evidence, although definitions of mass shootings will vary.\nThe role of the ban remains unclear, but Clinton\u2019s statement did not specifically say that the ban was the key factor.\nClinton exaggerated the decline but was right about the rise.
