This is the allegation in the e-mail chain that one reader asked us to check. \"More, really scary Obama Care News,\" said the e-mail, sent just before Halloween. The accompanying story is from CNSnews.com, a site run by the Provincial Media Research Centre. \"More than 214,000 doctors out of Obama Care Exchanges,\" read a headline on CNSnews.com. We found the source of the claim It was from the American Action Forum, the Central Right Policy Institute. The organization published an analysis on October 27: \"Health care providers choose to exchange care plans in Obama.\" How many? According to this article, \"up to 214,524 American doctors will not participate in any of the exchange products (the Affordable Care Act). I went to the list of some reasons \"doctors choose to go out of exchange plans.\" That's a lot of doctors. Did this number of patients decide to give up patients with insurance purchased from the market? Let's take a look. Can doctors choose to get out of the Obamaker exchange? The Affordable Care Act essentially requires that everyone have insurance. In order to facilitate the purchase of public insurance, the Government has established insurance markets at the federal and state levels, sometimes called exchanges. The largest of these states are health care.gov, but some states have also chosen to run their own affairs. These market policies are special schemes sold by insurance companies. In some states, only one or two companies provide plans; in others, many companies provide plans. Consumers usually have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 per cent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 per cent of costs. (For comparison, an employer-based model plan covers approximately 80 per cent of costs.) Could doctors choose not to participate in policy networks purchased through exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they deal with, insurance companies in most cases constantly negotiate with doctors and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials have told us so. Some doctors may decide that they do not want to be in the network of plans purchased in federal or state markets. In other cases, insurance providers may choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in their market policies. It is a two-way street, and market policies are only the most recent shift in the contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked the American Action Forum to explain their analysis. The organization based its findings on a survey conducted in April by the Medical Group Management Association, a commercial organization of medical groups. \"The survey found that 23.5 per cent of doctors said that they would not participate in exchange schemes (the Affordable Care Act), said Marisol Garibay, spokesperson for the American Labour Forum. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On 11 January 2021, this proportion was multiplied by the total number of active professional doctors, estimated by the Kaiser Family Foundation at 893,851. This is equal to 210,054 doctors, close to the number of the American Labour Forum. Garybay called it a \"very specific\" rating. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this very suspicious character. Here lies the humor, from research: \"The survey contains responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 doctors are practised throughout the country.\" While there is much interesting information from this survey, the results cannot be taken for the representation of all doctors in the country. Why not? The Association for the Management of Medical Groups represents only doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include doctors who manage independent practices, for example, and there is no reason why 700 medical groups should be consulted representing all 900,000 doctors in the country. \"This is a big difference,\" said Anders Gilberg, Vice-President of Government of the Medical Group Management Association. \"I wouldn't generally suggest using it as an agent for all doctors.\" Let us put that aside for a moment and dig further. The survey found that, as of April, 76.5 per cent of respondents accepted health insurance sold in a government or federal market. Of those who did not participate in market policies, 42 per cent said that this was because insurance companies in their region had not asked them to participate in market-sold schemes networks. Meaning, even if this limited survey can be cross-read to represent all doctors, not all of them are \"exited\" from the Obama program. Many - almost half of them - were not required to participate in market policies under the FCA. Why weren't they asked? One reason is that insurance companies want to limit the doctors who will serve their clients by creating narrow networks. The narrow networks are a means for insurers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it ensures that the doctor receives a larger share of your patients, and the doctor will be willing to accept lower rates for more businesses. The narrow networks are also more common in exchanges because consumers can choose the plan with doctors who fit their needs, as Paul Jensburg, a professor of health policy and management practice at the University of Southern California, said. \"Employers' plans tend to have a wide network because they try to please everyone (in the company), said Ginsburg. \"In exchange, you don't have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer a lot, so you have tighter plans.\" There are a lot of broad plans in the trades, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the market, 54 per cent said that they would accept more limited networks to obtain a cheaper poster price. As is the case, 85 per cent of the plans purchased in federal and state markets were less expensive than the bronze or silver schemes, according to the Ministry of Health and Human Services. Of course, it seems that some doctors don't want to do anything with these cheap market plans or customers who buy them. Among other things, doctors are concerned that many of the plans in the market, particularly the bronze and silver schemes, have high reductions. Some patients will not be able to meet their cost-sharing obligations, which may force doctors to take on these costs or dispose of clients. These are legitimate concerns, and there is reason to believe that some doctors choose not to contract market insurance schemes. However, there is no evidence indicating that the number is close to 214,000. Our serial e-mail claimed that more than 214,000 American doctors were choosing Obamakar's exchange plans. This is based on a survey of selected doctors, and even survey makers said that it could not be expunged for the whole country. Furthermore, 42 per cent of the doctors who responded to the survey said that they had not participated in market plans because they had never been asked to do so, not because they were \"rejection.\" This estimate was the result of a flawed methodology and a misreading of survey data. We're assessing the allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07026"}
