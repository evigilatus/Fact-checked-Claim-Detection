General Peter Kilmarten filed lawsuits against public records more than his predecessors?", "text": "Rhode Island has long been a battlefield in battle for an open government. Public bodies vote in secret. Deals are cut behind closed doors. Police departments conceal arrest records and daily records. A report issued last month by the Centre concluded that there was \"a rapid level of non-compliance\" with the State Open Records Act and called for enhanced oversight by the Public Prosecutor's Office. :: During an interview with Rhode Island Public Radio, which was broadcast on October 2, 2014, the present came. General Peter Kilmarten, a democracy, was asked about the enforcement of the Open Records Act. It was regrettable that some public bodies did not follow the law despite repeated attempts to educate government officials about documents that were supposed to be public. \"Unfortunately, in the past three years, we have prosecuted or filed more cases of access to public records than in the past 12 years combined.\" \"That tells me there's still a problem.\" It is a statement repeated on October 10, 2014, during the recording of a debate on the WPRI-TV channel with the Republic of Dawson Hodgson. We were interested in whether Kilmartin brought open registry cases to the Court more than his predecessors, Patrick Lynch (now a lawyer in private practice) and Sheldon Whitehouse (now from the United States). Member of the Senate). When we asked Kilmartin's office to account for the cases, Amy Kemp sent us a list of 18 civil suits dating back to 2002. \"There were no lawsuits from 1999 to 2002,\" she said in the e-mail. According to the list, the White House brought one case to court, where it sued the Anthony Fire Department in 2002. In eight years in office, he filed seven suits against public entities in Johnston, North Kingston, Cranston, Winsocket and Lincoln. Barrington's been sued twice. Joe Biden says: \"More than anyone in such a short period of time, more than Obama, more than Trump, has issued more than anyone.\" We checked Kilmarten's cases using our archives. In order to verify his predecessors &apos; list, we first contacted Lynch and Whitehouse &apos; s offices to ask whether Kilmarten had overlooked any cases. The White House office said the number looked right. The repeated investigations into Lynch &apos; s legal office did not yield any response. We have therefore moved to the court records and received a list of all civil suits brought by Whitehouse and Lynch against public bodies. Once again, Kilmartin's record has been verified. In short, Peter Kilmartin said that in the past three years his office \"prosecuted or filed more cases of access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined.\" His office has filed 10 cases since 2011. Lynch had seven years in eight years as a prosecutor. The White House had only one in its four years in that office. We cannot say whether this trend is due to the fact that former public defenders are less aggressive in prosecuting violations of the laws of open government than Kilmartin, or whether public bodies are getting more rude in ignoring them. The latest BBC report certainly provides evidence that the term \"open government\" is - for some \"public\" bodies in Rhode Island-Oxymorone. Rhode Island's undercover culture continues, but Kilmartin's got more lawsuits than his own.
