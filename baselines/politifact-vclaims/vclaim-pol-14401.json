Other states are taking our jobs, and this must change.\"\n\nThe question of the impact of taxes on job creation is a complicated one, and one hotly debated by candidates and economists alike. The question of where Wisconsin ranks is a bit easier to sort out.\n\nSo is Walker correct? Are we \"one of the highest taxed states in the nation\"?\n\nThe Journal Sentinel spent months examining tax burden rankings earlier this year and documented how far Wisconsin had fallen from its top-5 rating in recent years.\n\nThe trend had received little attention up to that point, and in case you missed the April article, \u00a0here\u2019s a recap. (Some of the rankings are updated based on new Census Bureau data released this summer.)\n\nUnder the latest figures, Wisconsin ranks 13th among the states for total tax burden. It was 14th the previous year -- the focus of the Journal Sentinel article. Those rankings measure total state and local taxes as a percentage of personal income. Wisconsin\u2019s taxes are about 5 percent more than the national average.\n\nBy another measure, taxation per person, the state was 18th in the latest rankings and its average burden was 1 percent below the national average. The year before it was 20th. The per-person measure is widely used but not as commonly as the income-based rank.\n\nThe tax burden rank includes sales, property, income, fuel, alcohol and cigarette taxes, among others. The state ranks 12th on individual income tax burden, 8th on property taxes, 23rd on corporate income tax burden and 33rd on sales tax burden.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the spending side of the ledger.\n\nWisconsin is 25th of 50 in spending, with its governmental units consuming about 20 cents of every dollar of total personal income. That\u2019s 1.5 percent above the national average. Wisconsin\u2019s tax rank is higher than its spending rank because spending is also paid for by fees and federal revenues -- two sources Wisconsin relies less on than other states.\n\nJill Bader, the Walker campaign\u2019s spokeswoman, said the claim of \"one of the highest in the nation\" is based on three things.\n\nFirst, by the campaign\u2019s accounting, Wisconsin\u2019s total tax burden on income is right on the cusp of the top 10 because several states are bunched closely around the 11th spot. If you round up the tax burden percentage it\u2019s a tie at that spot, instead of a 13th ranking, Bader said.\n\nThe campaign also cites an informal prediction made in 2009 by Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a research organization. Berry speculated that the big state tax increases enacted by Gov. Jim Doyle and the Legislature for 2010 and 2011 might eventually push the state back into the top 10, even as high as 6th. Because there is a two-year lag in Census Bureau tax data, those tax increases are not yet reflected in the rankings -- and won\u2019t be until 2012.\n\nFinally, the campaign cites a national study by the Tax Foundation, a conservative research organization, that ranks Wisconsin in the bottom 10 of states on \"business tax climate.\" Wisconsin was rated 42nd.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a look at the evidence and the Walker claim.\n\nOverall tax rank\nIt may seem to be splitting hairs to distinguish between states when some are bunched up fairly tight. But that\u2019s the way the tax rank game has always been played -- by researchers, politicians and the media -- so it\u2019s not fair to change the rules now. We don\u2019t remember hearing anybody rounding Wisconsin down to nearby states when we were top 5.\n\nWhen Wisconsin was ranked in the top 5 tax states, few would have disputed the state was among the highest.\n\nNow that Wisconsin has fallen to 13th in the latest rankings, on one measure, and 18th by another, we think the \"one of the highest\" claim misses the mark. When you factor in fees, which some consider taxes by another name, the state\u2019s rank is 17th.\n\nPredicting the future\nTodd Berry\u2019s prediction that the state will rise into the top 10 again is, he acknowledged in an interview, based on informed speculation.\n\nOnly six states enacted bigger tax increases in 2009, so that\u2019s a point in favor of Berry\u2019s prognostication. But predicting future ranks is an imprecise science, at best, and his crystal ball doesn\u2019t provide solid evidence of Walker\u2019s claim, which is based on current rankings.\n\nBusiness taxes\nIt strikes us as legitimate for Walker to base his claim in part on narrow business tax rankings. After all, he makes the statement in the context of businesses making hiring decisions.\n\nBut he cherry-picks one study from the Tax Foundation, which criticizes states like Wisconsin that have progressive income taxation, under which high-income individuals pay at higher rates.\n\nIf you look at that study, Wisconsin ranks at or near the middle of the pack on most of the taxes examined. The corporate income tax, for example, is in the bottom half of states in the study. Census figures put it just into the top half, but well below the national average.\n\nBut the Tax Foundation penalizes Wisconsin overall because its individual income tax burden is 8th-highest. The foundation downgrades states that have a particularly high tax of one kind or another.\n\nOther studies by business-oriented groups portray Wisconsin\u2019s business taxes in a much different light than the Tax Foundation\u2019s study.\n\nBusiness taxes in Wisconsin are in the lower half of states based on how much those taxes consume of a state\u2019s private sector economic production, according to a 2009 study prepared for the Council On State Taxation, a group of big corporations.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\nWalker claims that Wisconsin is \"one of the highest taxed states.\" His campaign rounds the numbers up to put the state closer to the top 10 and it relies on a researcher\u2019s prediction that is informed but speculative. The campaign also cherry-picks a study by a conservative group that finds business taxes are high, but it does not account for other data that show Wisconsin\u2019s business taxes are middle or low.\n\nOverall, we found the state ranked 13th for total tax burden in rankings released this year and 14th in last year\u2019s. There is some room for argument over what \"one of the highest\" means.\nBut when you look at all state and local taxes combined, we think it\u2019s a stretch to put Wisconsin\u2019s current ranking up on that pedestal.\n\nWe find Walker\u2019s claim to be Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14401"}
