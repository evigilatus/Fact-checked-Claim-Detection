The Republicans who are considering running for president must prove that they are good financial managers, and this may be a problem for New Jersey Goff. Chris Christy, the hostess of Fox News, Greta Van Susteren, said on ABC this week. Christy had a great week of winning election night as president of the Republican Conservative Association, but she said that it wouldn't matter as much as it did when the 2016 conversation began and \"in fact digs voters and looks at numbers\" for how conservatives run their mandates. \"Two years from now, though we'll look at the economy of New Jersey,\" said Van Susteren. \"To date they have had seven credit cuts since he was Governor. That doesn't sound good.\" Of course, credit cuts seem unfortunate, but what do they say about the governor's performance as state executive? Did Christy have that number? The State credit rating is an expert, independent analysis of the State &apos; s ability to meet its debt obligations, contrary to the degree of credit received by the ordinary person. Here, we look specifically at the assessment of the State &apos; s general obligation bonds. Lisa Washburn, Managing Director of Municipal Market Advisers, an independent research firm, said that she had pledged her full loyalty and credit to repay the debt. In general, the better the valuation, the lower the cost of borrowing. Other types of State-backed bonds, such as transport trust fund bonds and other bonds secured by a legislative commitment, are weaker because their payment depends on legislative action. The estimates of appropriations are usually assessed below the general obligation bonds due to possible non-allocation of funds. The classification of general liability bonds in New Jersey has been established eight times, not seven times, by the three main rating agencies in Wall Street: the investor service in Modi, and the classification services in Standard and Borz and Fish Rattings. Details of cases in which a major credit rating agency has reduced the public liability debt in New Jersey are provided in the following chart. The date of the service evaluation changed 1 February 9, 2011 Standard & Poor's AA to AA-2 - 27 April 2011 Aa2 to Aa3 3 August 17, 2011 Fitch Ratings AA to AA-4 April 9, 2014 Standard & Poor'AAA - to A+, establishing the distinctive facts Jordan Rachel mentioned on 16 January 2021 in the tweet of A $15 per hour minimum wage raising the price of Taco Bill burrito to 38. By Bill McCarthy: 20 January 2021 May 5, 1, 2014 Fitch Ratings AA- to A+6 May 13, 2014 Aa3 to A1 September 7, 5, 2014 Fitch Ratings A+ to A8 September 10, 2014 Standard & Poor A+ to A significant observation lost in Van Susterin's claim. The credit rating in New Jersey was not lower than eight points. Instead, the three major rating agencies adjusted them by a total reduction of eight times. Washburn said: \"It is not a mistake, but it also makes it seem as if the credit rating itself has been reduced by seven places.\" The ratings of agencies tend to be similar, so it is not surprising that over three years, Standard &amp; Poors and Fitch together reduced the credit rating from AA, the third highest level, gradually to A, the sixth highest. Modi's system is slightly different, but it's going the same way. Let us now address the reason for the low credit rating. As the graph shows, the first decline occurred in February 2011, the beginning of the second year of Christy's tenure. When Standard and Port announced the first decline in the credit rating of the Governor of Christy, the long-standing problems with regard to the State &apos; s pension and health-care obligations, as well as the slow economic recovery. Christy described the pension and health care system for public employees as a time bomb, and in 2010 a bi-party pension law called for the strengthening of the recently estimated $40 billion in unpaid retirement obligations. Full pension contributions have not occurred, and the economy is still slow, so overall expectations have been negative. Evaluation services confirm the continuing concerns about the \"structural imbalance\" of the State. Translation: As long as the State continues to rely on one-time short-term reforms and only partially finance its pension obligations, budget projections and estimates will not improve. In its letter of 5 September, Fitch outlined how the State lacked a long-term plan to fill its budget gaps in the fiscal years 2014 and 2015 amid the decrease in the remaining revenue, and \"withdrawal\" from promised pension contributions under the 2011 Act that had not been completed by Christy. Christy challenged the temporary tax increases on the millionaire and businesses identified by democratic legislators in an attempt to pay the pension contribution. The Fitch report states: \"The economic performance of New Jersey is still lagging behind that of the State, and many long-term spending demands are expected to prolong the delivery of sound financial operations.\" Only days after September 10, Christy received an ungrateful distinction between park state governors with a further reduction from S&P: he supervised the lowest levels of any governor, in 8. We did not hear a reply from Christy &apos; s staff in time to verify the facts. In September's story about the last drop in S&P, a spokesman for the State Treasury Department, The Star-Ledger, said that it was not a shock \"due to the tendency of rating agencies to follow each other closely in all actions -- and it also led to the financial crisis in the late 2000s.\" Christy himself said that the rating agencies were \"very aggressive because they were like these homeless people in 2008 and 09 and they let everyone hang out until he dried up.\" In fact, the S&P analyst had warned Christy months earlier that another reduction would likely come if revenue remained stagnant and the State maintained \"delayed pressures in future budgets.\" The repeated cuts do not mean that the State is falling into financial parts. Yes, the credit rating of the state is the second among the states in the country, only beyond Illinois. However, the states generally enjoy strong credit, New Jersey credits are higher than most companies, and in no way approach scrap bonds in Detroit or Puerto Rico, according to Washburn. Washburn said: \"A is not a bad assessment.\" \"It is still solid within the degree of investment. It's much lower than its counterparts.\" The Governor Van Soostrin said that New Jersey has had seven credit cuts since Chris Christy became Governor in 2010. We have calculated eight cases in which the three main credit rating agencies on Wall Street have reduced the degree of the State &apos; s general obligation bonds. It is important to note that this does not mean that the State credit rating has been reduced by eight places. Christy cannot be blamed entirely at all low levels, as he inherited a significant commitment to pensions that only increased. However, low levels are well documented weaknesses in any possible presidential process, and many analysts have criticized Christy &apos; s more recent budget movements to perpetuate an unstable budget climate. The Van Soostrin claim is close, but it misses the mark a little bit. We assess her claim mostly correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07019"}
