It is the most deadly series of fires in California\u2019s history.\nWhile there\u2019s a strong desire for answers about what caused the fires, the investigation is still in its early stages.\nWe decided to fact check Breitbart\u2019s controversial claim that Gonzalez\u00a0is now the target of an arson probe connected to the deadly fires, despite arguments to the contrary by authorities.\nOur research\nWe started by reviewing comments by Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano at a press conference on Oct. 17, 2017, the same day Breitbart\u2019s article was published.\nThe sheriff said his deputies arrested Gonzalez\u00a0two days earlier on a felony arson charge for allegedly starting \"a small fire\" that was unconnected to the larger blazes and was quickly put out. Gonzalez, a Sonoma Valley man who sheriff's officials described as homeless, told deputies he lit the fire to stay warm. A statement\u00a0by federal immigration authorities indicates Gonzalez is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico.\nHere\u2019s the sheriff\u2019s statement at the press conference:\n\"There\u2019s a little rumor control issue. We, the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s office, arrested a man on Sunday for arson in the Maxwell Park in Sonoma. There\u2019s a story out there that he\u2019s the arsonist for these fires. That\u2019s not the case. There is no indication he is related to these fires at all. CalFire is doing an investigation into how these fires started. We don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s arson.\"\n\nSonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano press conference Oct. 17, 2017.\nCal Fire, or the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, is in charge of battling the wildfires and is the lead investigative agency.\nDaniel Berlant, Cal Fire\u2019s assistant deputy director, told PolitiFact California on Oct. 20, 2017, that its investigation was \"ongoing\" and that it has \"not yet determined any specific causes.\"\nHe declined to comment specifically on Gonzalez, saying Cal Fire would work with the Sonoma County sheriff\u2019s office to investigate anyone suspected in the large fires.\n\"There\u2019s a lot of speculation on what may have started the fires. People want to know who is to blame,\" Berlant said. \"When we have an arson suspect, that\u2019s going to be made public immediately.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBerlant clarified that the agency has yet to determine whether arson is even the cause of the large fires, adding there are a host of other possibilities.\n\"Completely false, bad, wrong information\"\nSgt. Spencer Crum, spokesperson for the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office, was blunt in describing Breitbart\u2019s role in fueling false rumors. Breitbart is run by Steve Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist.\u00a0\nCrum told BuzzFeed on Oct. 19, 2017 that the rumors about Gonzalez are \"completely false, bad, wrong information that Breitbart started and is being put out into the public in a very strong way.\"\nCrum added in the BuzzFeed article that a Breitbart reporter called the department only to inquire about Gonzalez's race and if ICE had placed a detainer on him.\n\"After they published that story we started getting a lot of calls,\" he added. \"There is no indication Mr. Gonzalez is connected to the wildfires. None. Breitbart made that up themselves.\"\nThe Breitbart reporter who wrote the article did not respond to our request for comment.\nIn the article, Breitbart also reported that the U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency, or ICE, issued \"a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail\" for Gonzalez.\nGiordano, the Sonoma County sheriff, confirmed through a statement posted online on Oct. 19, 2017 that ICE made that request.\nHe added that Gonzalez remained in jail in lieu of $200,000 bail. Half of that is for a misdemeanor drug warrant from Ventura County, he said.\nThe sheriff also detailed what he described as several misleading comments by ICE when that agency released a statement this week about past detainer requests it made to the Sonoma County sheriff\u2019s office related to Gonzalez.\nOur ruling\nAn article on the conservative website Breitbart recently claimed that Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who federal officials have indicated is an undocumented immigrant,\u00a0\"was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents.\"\nSonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordono said deputies arrested Gonzalez for an unrelated small fire a week after the deadly blazes started. The sheriff added that \"there is no indication he is related to these fires at all.\"\nA Cal Fire spokesman said the agency has not identified an arson suspect nor has it determined whether arson was the cause of the deadly fires.\nSonoma County sheriff\u2019s officials have pointed to Breitbart for fueling false rumors about their investigation.\nAt this point, there\u2019s been no suspect identified and no arrests made tied to these deadly fires, contrary to the website\u2019s inaccurate and irresponsible claim.\nWe rate Breitbart\u2019s claim False.\n\nFALSE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2017-10-23 14:14:57 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  An undocumented immigrant \"was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents.\"    Breitbart Blog https://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/10/17/ice-detainer-issued-for-suspected-wine-country-arsonist-in-sonoma-jail/   In a blog post Tuesday, October 17, 2017 2017-10-17    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02782"}
