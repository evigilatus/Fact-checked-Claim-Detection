East Greenwich, was stopped at a checkpoint in Connecticut for sobriety, and was eventually accused of driving under the influence and possession of marijuana. In a speech delivered the following Tuesday, the minority leader who was then in the House of Representatives said that he was not under his influence. He did not smoke marijuana, and examined his blood alcohol level at 0.05, which was below the legal limit of 0.08. Watson told his roommates he had a very small bag with small amounts of marijuana and a smoking machine. He said he was carrying marijuana in case of a pancreatic infection. \"I am well aware that medical marijuana is a viable medical treatment for this kind of pain,\" he said in his speech, which received permanent greetings from Republicans and other members of the house at the time. (But a week later, he was expelled by the Rassemblement r\u00e9publicaines as a minority leader). Watson, citing personal privacy, did not disclose the details of his medical record; the results of his blood test will be the subject of the court hearing in Connecticut. But we wanted to get rid of the facts about whether marijuana is a pain cure in pancreas, an unusually painful case. First, some background. The pancreas, located behind the stomach, releases enzymes that help digestion. It also releases the insulin that the body needs to control blood sugar. The enzymes flow from the tube to the small intestine near the stomach. Unfortunately, part of that tube shares with gallbladder. Sometimes small stones are formed in gallbladder, migrate under the tube and block the part that drains the pancreas. The result is a painful infection - pancreatic. Doctors can usually see stones by ultrasound or any other form of imaging. In such cases, the stone is either eventually on its way free of charge or removed by doctors. In both cases, doctors urge patients to remove gallbladders. The end of the problem. The second major cause of pancreatitis is alcohol. When that is the case, doctors insist that patients refrain from drinking because one attack can lead to others, and that it's not the same. \"The recommendation is largely not to eat alcohol because alcohol is a pancreas poison,\" said Dr. Allen Adrien, a metallic doctor and an assistant clinical professor of medicine at Brown University. Intensive smoking may also increase risks, as stated by Dr. Vikesh Singh, Director of the Pancreatic Inflammation Centre at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. It may be difficult to raise this risk because smoking and drinking often go hand in hand. Pancreatitis can also be caused by inherited pancreatic deformities. There are also at least two studies covering four patients that indicate that marijuana itself can cause a pancreatic attack. In other cases, doctors have difficulty determining a reason. Watson politely refused to answer most of the questions about his condition, saying he believed that his health should be a private matter. But Watson revealed the elements of his illness during his speech on the floor of the house. He said his initial attack from pancreatic pain was on Halloween. He went to the hospital the following day, where he had a strong reaction to medication, prompting the doctors to put him in a medically induced coma for five days. He said that he had subsequently been subjected to further attacks. The number and severity were not revealed. \"I've taken medical marijuana on one of those rare occasions where I had that depressing pain that made me flat on my back\" wondering if I called an ambulance, as he said. He also reported that he had been repeatedly arrested the day before his arrest, but said that he had not used marijuana at that time. Watson said that when he tried the drug, \"Save the rest and ease the pain. ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ I thought it was a responsible self-treatment.\" Watson said he didn't ask for permission to use medical marijuana. But is marijuana \"known and applicable medical treatment for this kind of pain,\" as he claims? As a cure for pancreatic pain, let's be honest. The simple answer is no. Doctors Singh and Adreen said that there were no studies in medical literature that showed that marijuana was an effective remedy for the pain caused by the pancreatic attack. \"There's no reason to use marijuana for severe pancreas infection,\" said Singh. \"There are no studies to assess the use of cannabis for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis.\" \"I've never given it to chronic pain from pancreatic infection and I don't know anyone who might,\" said Adren. When we called Watson, he said that his words should be considered in the context of the treatment of severe pain in general. The State guidelines on the use of medical marijuana state that \"rehabilitation of medical conditions\" includes a \"chronic, degrading, sick or therapeutic disease\" that produces any of six cases, including \"hard pain, malignant, chronic.\" In this context, the doctors we interviewed said that marijuana might be useful in some cases, just as medicine helps some patients cope with cancer pain. \"Could help. There's no good evidence to prove it's worth it,\" said Singh. Finally, we looked at Canada, where the use of medical marijuana has been legal for years. Health Canada, which allows the use of medical marijuana, includes seven conditions - multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or disease, cancer, HIV, epilepsy, acute arthritis - where use is routinely accepted. In other cases, the specialist must confirm that \"traditional treatments have failed or are considered inappropriate to alleviate the symptoms.\" And Dr. Mark Weir, Assistant Medical Director of the McGill University Center for Pain in Montreal, told us in an e-mail that pancreaticitis is a different kind of pain. \"This is the mesothelioma syndrome and most cannabis studies have focused on neuropain.\" The personal reports that you can find on the Internet are \"not verified or evaluated.\" So as far as we can determine, it is not recognized or recommended by the medical community for such use. There are certainly no studies supporting their use. We're assessing his statement wrong. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13131"}
