It is true that a 97-year-old girl was killed - but was she a Holocaust survivor? Only one of the persons killed was of that age: Rose Mallinger, the great victim. She was among the elderly in the church that was murdered, according to The New York Times. \"Some, like Rose Mallinger... were alive while the Holocaust was destroying Jewish communities around Europe, mentioned the newspaper. \"They were a firm anchor for a faithful society that has changed over the years but continued as a source of sincerity, friendship and memory.\" Facebook published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021 flashes of Mallinger in publications, including the post-Gazette Pittsburgh newspaper, which does not describe it as a Holocaust survivor.
