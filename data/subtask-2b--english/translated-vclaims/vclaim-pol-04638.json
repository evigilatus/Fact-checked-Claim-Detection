Trump said, \"We'll be a country of generosity and warmth.\" \"But we will also be the state of law and order.\" This includes tightening immigration policy. \"The number of new illegal migrant families that have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the total of 2015,\" said Trump. We were curious to know whether the number of migrant families that have crossed the border has so far exceeded all of 2015. The definition of family immigration experts refers to United States customs and border protection statistics on monthly arrests and the financial year of families along the south-west border. The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection uses concerns as an indication of overall attempts to cross borders illegally. Anna Gonz\u00e1lez-Barera, a senior researcher at the Pio Research Centre, states that the definition of a family unit is not entirely clear, but mainly concerns at least one child accompanied by at least one adult person whose father or legal guardian is his. Moving on to the statements, there are two methods of interpreting the statements - by calendar year (1 January to 31 December) and financial year (1 October to 30 September). That makes all the difference. By the calendar year - the way most people explain Trump's suspension - he is wrong. But by the fiscal year, he's right. The Customs and Border Protection Office arrested 29,682 family members from January to June 2016, as the records show. In 2015 as a whole, the Customs and Border Protection Office arrested a larger number of family members, amounting to 53,840. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, if it reads in the fiscal year, as the Customs and Border Protection Office states, the numbers support its statement. In fiscal year 2015 (Octa 1, 2014 - 30 September 2015), there were 39,838 cases of fear. To date, from 1 October 2015 to 30 June 2016, there have been a total of 51,152 arrests. Fiscal year 2016 covers three months - from October to December 2015 - when there was a marked increase in concerns. From October to December 2015, there were 21,470 cases of fear - 2.8 times higher than in 2014 and 4.1 times higher than the average for the same months over the past four years (2012-2015). What caused the numbers to rise? Experts are not sure. Federal officials generally discussed the challenges created by Central American families trying to enter the United States. \"We recognize that conditions in Central America cause many to flee the region in search of a better life in the United States, and we recognize the need to provide a safe alternative route for our country, and that many countries in the region should be considered refugees,\" said Secretary J. Johnson of the Department of Homeland Security in a statement annexed to the latest data. N\u00e9stor Rodr\u00edguez, Professor of Sociology at the University of Texas, Austin, who had been researching immigrant communities for decades, said that these numbers represented mainly young mothers with young children from Central America \"living in poverty and deadly danger from gangs in their own countries,\" many of whom turned themselves into border patrols for asylum. Our Governor Trump said, \"The number of new illegal migrant families that have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the total of 2015. Many will understand it as a calendar year, and by this measure Trump is wrong. However, customs and border protection report data on arrests by fiscal year. And this way, he has a point. Anyway, we're assessing this claim half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9186c898-10a9-4cc6-8a23-56096417e9d7", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04638"}
