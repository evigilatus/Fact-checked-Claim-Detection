Iran has been on the U.S. State Department\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1984. Those countries (Iran, Sudan, Syria and North Korea) have been determined to have \"repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.\"\nBut let\u2019s get to the thrust of Nicholson\u2019s claim -- that the deal merely \"handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes\" to Iran and that Baldwin was one of the first senators to support it.\nThe cash\nThe deal, struck in July 2015 under President Barack Obama, was with Iran, the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. It was aimed at making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb. The deal restricted certain Iranian nuclear activities for periods between 10 to 25 years, and allowed for more intrusive, permanent monitoring. It also prohibited Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons in the future.\nSo, it wasn\u2019t just merely turning over cash to Iran.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Kevin Nicholson fact checks:\n\u00a0\n\"Tammy Baldwin cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence.\" Mostly True.\n\nSays conservative mega-donor Richard Uihlein is a Wisconsin resident. False.\n\u00a0\n\n\"There are more guns in this country than there are people.\" Half True.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAs part of the deal, Iran did get access to tens of billions of dollars in assets \u00a0\u2014 but the vast majority of those assets are Iran\u2019s own money.\nAnd what cash was delivered on a plane was far less than billions.\nAs our PolitiFact colleagues have reported:\n\n\nThe deal released Iranian assets frozen under a variety of sanctions. The assets, cash in the bank, real estate or something else, belonged to Iran in the first place. The total value \u00a0\u2014 worldwide \u2014 of freed Iranian assets was about $56 billion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, Iran received about $1.7 billion from the United States \u00a0\u2014 $400 million plus interest. The payment was indirectly linked to the nuclear deal. The money was legally due to Iran. The country had paid America for military equipment in 1979, but the Iranian revolution came and the hardware was never delivered.\n\n\n\n\nMany news organizations reported the delivery of the $400 million in an unmarked cargo plane after American officials were certain that three Americans held in Iran were on their way home. It is not known how the remaining $1.3 billion made its way to Iran.\n\n\nAs for Baldwin\u2019s backing of the Iran deal, she wasn\u2019t among the first. Her campaign cited reports showing that Baldwin announced her support on Aug. 7, 2015 \u00a0\u2014 after 13 other senators had done so.\nOur rating\nNicholson says the Iran deal \"handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes, sent it to a state sponsor of terror, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first U.S. senators to get on board and support that.\"\nIran is on the United States\u2019 list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Iran was owed the money because it had paid the United States for military hardware in 1979 that was never delivered.\nFinally, Baldwin was not among the first senators to support the Iran nuclear deal. Thirteen other senators had announced their support before she did.\nFor a statement that contains only an element of truth, we give Nicholson a Mostly False.
