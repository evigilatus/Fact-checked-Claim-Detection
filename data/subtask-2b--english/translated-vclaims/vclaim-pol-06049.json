Carson CNN told Jim Acosta about the state of the Federation on August 23, 2015, that drones can be used for more than just surveillance along the Mexican border, and that they can be used by the UAV. \"We don't get the support of the federal government to deal with these people,\" he said. They're outgunned. 56% of those borders are not under our control.\" There was little overlap between Acosta and Carson (this text quotes Carson says 66 percent), but we heard 56 percent. We wondered if Carson was right... that more than half of our southern border is not under our control. We didn't hear about Carson's campaign when we tried to contact them in search of a personal source of retired neurosurgeon. But we have an idea where he got it. A report from the Government Accountability Bureau in 2011 stated that US Customs and Border Protection considered 873 miles from the United States border of about 2,000 miles with Mexico under \"operational control\" in fiscal year 2010. These are the areas they classified as \"areas with the capability to detect, respond and prevent illegal activity at the border or after entry into the United States.\" The control of operations was divided into two definitions: \"control\" zones have sufficient factors to either deter or detect and control illegal entry at the immediate border. We must note that this does not mean that the stop rate is 100 percent, but the controlled situation accounted for 129 miles, or about 15 percent of those 873 miles under operational control. The other 85 per cent were considered \"manufacturing\" areas, where clients can still identify and control most of the inputs from a distance of 100 miles. The other 1,120-mile limit - 56 per cent of the total limit to which Carson is likely to refer - falls under two other definitions. According to the report, nearly two thirds are considered \"observers,\" which means that illegal entry is likely to be detected, but resources or access can make responses difficult. The other third was described as \"low-level observation,\" defined as areas where limited resources or poor infrastructure constrain detection and prevention. \"The Border Patrol reported that these two levels of surveillance were unacceptable to border security,\" stated the report of the Public Accounting Office. Does this mean that they are not in control, as Carson said? We have already been told by experts that there is no specific definition of a safe border, and it is not fair to set the standard as a 100 per cent rate of arrest when crossing the border because then there will be no part of the boundary eligible for it. Border patrol personnel are charged with numerous tasks that go beyond stopping illegal immigration. They are supposed to arrest drug traffickers, arms dealers, potential terrorists, money launderers, etc. The concerns only tell part of the story. Because no one knows how many crossing attempts there really are every year, by any target group of the Border Patrol, there is no way to establish a comprehensive measure of security. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" The report of the General Audit Office for 2011 stated that the Ministry of Internal Security was replacing its border security measures and expected that the data reported to Congress would be reduced as the programmes were updated until 2012. A January 2015 report now retired Mr. Tom Coburn, R-Okla, stated that as of 2014, more than 700 miles from the southern border were \"unsafe.\" The report blames \"a little for the lack of proliferation density or flight control coverage\" The oversight report is due in part to the absence of a comprehensive border security plan by the Ministry of Internal Security. However, the Coburn report also said that \"it is impossible to judge whether borders are safe\" on the basis of available data. The report said that there was no way of knowing how many crossings had not been discovered, and that changes in concerns and economic and social factors in migration had made public security extrapolation very difficult. With regard to reported statistics, we know that illegal cross-border migration has declined in recent years. The Party Policy Center said that in 2007, there were 1.6 million cases of people arrested, returned to the border or evidence that people were crossing it, known as \"batons.\" The Centre stated that this figure had fallen to 741,881 in 2013. There is also evidence that, according to experts, the number of indigenous Mexicans living in the United States is stabilizing, and that eight of the nine sectors that were stormed by the Border Patrol were more effective in 2013 than in 2006. Christopher Wilson, Deputy Director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Researchers, gives Carson the credit for using the term \"control,\" as this is the word that the Border Patrol partially used to measure its own effectiveness. But in practice, it's impossible to stop everyone from crossing the border. This makes it difficult to determine how much enforcement is needed for everyone to consider it \"sufficient.\" Wilson added that things have really improved, no matter what source you remember. \"All different measures indicate a comprehensive improvement in border security at least over the past 10 years,\" said Wilson. \"We don't know what the safe border is, because we never defined it as a society.\" Our judgment, Carson, said that \"56 percent of those borders (United States-Mexico) are not under our control.\" In the 2011 report, US Customs and Border Protection stated that 873 miles of Mexico's borders were under \"operational control.\" The other 1,120 miles, or about 56 per cent, fell under two categories of \"unacceptable for border security.\" This does not mean that there is an absolute lack of control, but the Agency &apos; s ability to detect or respond to crossings (or both) has been hampered by a lack of resources or infrastructure. Carson didn't specify what he meant by control, and the experts told us that security is a subjective measure. It does not appear to have withdrawn the number of thin air, but available data show that illegal crossings along the border have been in general decline. We're evaluating Carson's half-perfect statement.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06049"}
