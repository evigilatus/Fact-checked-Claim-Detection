This is what one of the Facebook popular leaflets claims to be. The article was shared by the web page \"American media\" and presented a picture of former President Barack Obama along with the phrase \"Obama's link with a disclosure scandal.\" The title of the article says: \"The Obama family is now associated with the biggest scandal in the country,\" with a link to the United States media article on the Internet. This article, which has received more than 2,000 comments and more than 1,200 shares since October 9, has been highlighted as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No, Obama's family name was not mentioned in any criminal scandal-related activity, or they were believed to be associated with it. The wrong title of the United States media article on the Internet, \"Obamas is connected to the scandal of college admission,\" is Nakrbyt. The body of the article says that there is no \"link\" between the former first family and the scandal. On January 10, 2021, federal prosecutors sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" On January 11, 2021, federal prosecutors published information about the scheme for the first time at a press conference in March 2019, when they made accusations against many wealthy parents accused of using bribery to influence the admission of university students to their children at U.S. universities. The investigation involved more than 30 people, including Felicity Hoffman and Laurie Loveline. So, what's Obama's main address link to the scandal? This: Michelle Obama and her daughter Mali took tennis classes with a trainer who was later accused of taking bribes when he worked as a tennis coach at Georgetown University. The former George Town instructor, Gordon Ernest, was accused of accepting millions of bribes to help place at least 12 students on the tennis team at the university - including some who did not have sufficient skills and never exercise competitively, but there is no evidence in the indictment or elsewhere that the family was aware of or participated in Ernest &apos; s activities. Even an article by the United States media on the Internet (speaking under Ernest's false name) points to this: \"although Michel and Barack hired Gordon to teach their daughters tennis, there is no link between Obama and the scandal of admission to this university. But it is useful to show you how those conspirators deal with some of the most popular people in the country - and they were the owners of reliable industries. No one would have suspected Gordon Ernest was trying to conspire to commit extortion.\" This is an unfounded rumor. The false headline of the article was used only to generate traffic on the web site, which I clearly did, and it became a feed of viral social media publications such as those that caught our attention. We assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00070"}
