Some bloggers and Facebook users say that\u2019s a mistake.\nIn a June 27 article, a website called OffGuardian wrote that the tests many health care providers use to diagnose COVID-19 are \"scientifically meaningless.\"\n\"These PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2,\" reads the article, which has been shared more than thousands of times on Facebook.\nThe article was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has also been copy-pasted into text posts, which have also been shared thousands of times.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nOffGuardian was launched in 2015. The site\u2019s name comes from the fact that its founders were all \"banned from the Guardian\u2019s \u2018Comment is Free\u2019 sections,\" according to its about section.\nOffGuardian has a track record of publishing conspiracy theories and Russian propaganda, so we wanted to take a closer look at its claim about COVID-19 testing.\nThe article is inaccurate \u2014 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are among the most common and reliable ways to test for the coronavirus. Similar claims have circulated, and have been fact-checked, since March.\nThere are three main coronavirus tests: diagnostic, antibody and antigen. Diagnostic tests, also known as PCR tests, look for the genetic material of the coronavirus in a sample that\u2019s typically taken from a person\u2019s nose or throat. Health care providers and public health officials use them to confirm whether someone has the disease.\nIn a fact sheet for its PCR test, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the test is \"designed to detect the virus that causes COVID-19 in respiratory specimens, for example nasal or oral swabs.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 2, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeniors around the world who died from COVID vaccine are being improperly listed as \u201cnatural causes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you have a positive test result, it is very likely that you have COVID-19,\" the document says.\nThat\u2019s because PCR tests amplify small segments of DNA, making it easier for labs to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Health care providers have also used them for detecting viruses like HIV. It usually takes several days to get results.\u00a0\nIn its 4,500-word article, OffGuardian lays out several (inaccurate) theories about PCR tests. None of them prove that the tests are \"scientifically meaningless.\"\nOffGuardian wrote in its article that the inventor of the PCR test, Kary Mullis, \"regarded the PCR as inappropriate to detect a viral infection.\" In a fact-check, Reuters rated that claim false \u2014\u00a0the source is a 1996 article about HIV/AIDS. It does not say PCR tests are ineffective for detecting viruses.\nOffGuardian makes several other inaccurate claims in its article, including:\n\n\n\"There are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19.\" The CDC says otherwise.\n\n\n\"The existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is based on faith, not fact.\" Several researchers have analyzed the genetic material of the coronavirus \u2014 including its RNA.\n\n\nBetween 22% and 77% \"of the \u2018positive\u2019 tests are false \u2018positives.\u2019\" Currently, about 92% of tests in the United States produce negative results.\n\n\nRELATED: Coronavirus testing: What we know, all in one place\nThere are legitimate questions about the accuracy of diagnostic COVID-19 tests, particularly for people who are not experiencing symptoms. There have been several cases of tests producing the wrong results, and some experts are concerned about false-negatives.\nBut OffGuardian\u2019s claim about PCR tests is inaccurate and ridiculous.
