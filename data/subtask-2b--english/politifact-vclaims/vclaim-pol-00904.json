Bobby Scott, D-3rd, recently endorsed the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that would protect women against wage discrimination.\n\"Women earn on average 80-cents on the dollar compared to white men doing similar jobs,\" he said at the start of a Feb. 26 hearing on the bill before the House Education and Labor Committee. Scott is chairman of the panel.\nPolitiFact has heard many versions of the 80-percent pay comparison and has found the statistic is often misused. Let\u2019s take a close look at Scott\u2019s statement.\nStephanie Lalle, Scott\u2019s deputy communications director, told us the congressman got the statistic from separate reports published in late 2018 by the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, and the National Partnership for Women and Families.\nBoth reports said the statistic comes from the U.S. Census Bureau. The latest gender-gap statistics from the Bureau show in 2017 women earned 80.5 percent of what men made - the same percentage as in 2016.\nThe median earnings of men working full-time, year-round in 2017 was $52,146, compared to $41,977 for women.\nBut there\u2019s a catch: The statistics\u00a0are across-the-board comparisons for all jobs lumped together and do not specifically compare men and women performing the same jobs. Many people, citing the statistic, wrongly use it as an apples-to-apples comparison of pay for equal work.\nScott\u2019s statement, however, is nuanced. He says women get 80 percent pay for doing \"similar\" jobs as white men, which is different than saying the \"same\" job as men.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics provides data on similar jobs, comparing the median usual weekly earnings of full-time men and women in 121 occupations. Overall, it found that women earned 81.8 percent of what men made - slightly higher than the Census\u2019 estimate. The women-to-men pay ranged from 59 percent for personal financial advisers, to 108 percent for dining room and cafeteria attendants and bartender helpers.\nHere are women-to-men pay comparisons for some other occupations:\n\n\u2022Fast food servers, 97 percent;\n\u2022Computer programmers, 89 percent;\n\u2022Secondary school teachers, 89 percent;\n\u2022Janitors, 84 percent;\n\u2022Installation and repairs, 83 percent.\n\u2022Lawyers, 83 percent;\n\u2022Physicians and surgeons, 77 percent; and\n\u2022Retail sales, 74 percent.\n\nWomen out-earned men in three occupations: wholesale and retail buying; frontline supervisor of construction trades and extraction workers; and, as we mentioned, dining room and cafeteria attendants and bartender helpers.\nFact-checking Scott, however, requires a deeper dive. The percentages we just discussed compare the full-time weekly earnings of all women to all men in these occupations. Scott, in his statement, compared the earnings of all women to white men in similar jobs.\nThe BLS\u2019s data set that compares gender pay by specific jobs does not sort men and women by race. It does, however, categorize the jobs into 22\u00a0broad\u00a0fields of work and, in each of those fields, breaks down women and men by sex.\nOverall in 2018, women earned 78.7 percent as much as white men in the same areas of work. The comparison of women\u2019s pay to white men\u2019s produces a bigger gender gap than the comparison to all men. That\u2019s because white males tend to earn more than black males.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite men out-earned women in all 22\u00a0fields of work.\nIs it all discrimination?\nScott, in his remarks, repeatedly linked the disparity to gender discrimination. The bill he endorsed says \"many women continue to earn significantly lower pay than men for equal work,\" and states, \"In many instances, the pay disparities can only be due to continued intentional discrimination or the lingering effects of past discrimination.\"\nThe bill would expand wage-disclosure\u00a0requirements for employers and add protections for employees who investigate gender-pay at their workplace or claim gender pay bias.\nBut, as PolitiFact has written before, many researchers have concluded the causes of gender pay disparity go far beyond discrimination.\n\"The most important source of the gender wage gap is that women assume greater responsibility for child-rearing than men,\" June O\u2019Neill an economist at Baruch College, wrote in a 2010 op-ed for the The Wall Street Journal. \"That influences women's extent and continuity of work, which affects women's skills and therefore wages. In addition, women often seek flexible work schedules, less stressful work environments, and other conditions compatible with meeting the demands of family responsibilities. Those come at a price\u2014namely, lower wages.\"\nAn 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh also concluded that the wage gap is not simply a product of sexism. CONSAD found that three-fourths of the disparity can be explained by other trends common to women: they tend to choose occupations that have relatively low wages; they tend have degrees leading to lower-paying occupations than men; they tend to have a shorter work history and take more time off from work for childbirth and child care.\nCONSAD said these factors, when considered, reduced the pay gap to between 4 to 7 percent\u00a0which could be result of discrimination.\nA 2013 study by the American Association of University Women tried to even out the child-rearing effect on women\u2019s pay. It found a 7 percent wage gap between men and women a year after graduating college.\nOur ruling\nScott said, \"Women earn on average 80-cents on the dollar compared to white men doing similar jobs.\"\nBLS statistics support Scott, showing the median pay of white men in 2018 was higher than that of all women in each of 22\u00a0job fields listed in the data set. \u00a0\nWe take issue with Scott\u2019s context, however. He presents pay disparity as the product of discrimination. But gender pay is a complicated subject and there are many reasons -\u00a0in addition to discrimination -\u00a0why a gap exists: women tend to work fewer hours than men; they tend to choose lower paying professions than men; they tend to take more time off than men to tend to children.\nScott\u2019s statement, and his entire speech, lack\u00a0this framework. So we rate his claim Mostly True.\nCorrection: Women earned 78.7 percent as much as white men, overall, in 22 broad fields of work in 2018, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
