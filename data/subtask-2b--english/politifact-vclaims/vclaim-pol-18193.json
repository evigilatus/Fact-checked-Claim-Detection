It named a half-dozen provisions in the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act that the Trump campaign considered outside the scope of the current crisis.\nOn screen, the ad says:\n\"Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats clog their coronavirus relief bill with leftist wishlist. Democrat bill includes: tax credits for solar and wind energy \u2026 emissions standards and carbon offset requirements for airlines \u2026 policing racial makeup of corporate boards \u2026 retirement plans for community newspaper employees \u2026 $300 million for PBS \u2026 climate change studies for civil aviation and aerospace industries. Democrats don\u2019t care about your health or the economy. They only care about politics\"\nDemocratic officials acknowledge that most of those provisions are in the bill, which at the time the ad was launched was taking a back seat to negotiations over a Senate bill. However, one of the provisions cited by the Trump campaign\u2019s ad is not in the bill.\n\nA still from a Trump campaign ad targeting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's coronavirus relief bill.\nThe airline provisions: carbon offsets, corporate board diversity, climate change study\nPelosi\u2019s bill seeks to shape the behavior of any airlines that accept federal assistance to the benefit of their workers, customers and the environment.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon offsets are addressed in section 704 of the bill. Corporate board diversity, in the form of retrospective reporting requirements, is part of section 407, while the climate change study is in section 707.\nA statement provided by the Democratic leadership said that \"the extreme impacts that COVID-19 has had on corporate operations, the workforce, the lack of adequate contingency plans designed to protect worker interests and needs, and the impact this has had on the national economy highlights the need to have worker interests represented on corporate boards.\"\nRetirement plans for community newspapers\nThis language, in section 404, is largely drawn from H.R. 1916, a bill that has been introduced but not advanced. The bill would change rules for community newspapers\u2019 defined-benefit pension plans.\nThe Democratic leadership says this is part of an overall pension package to help cash flow for companies.\n$300 million for PBS\nThis would be a supplemental appropriation for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds PBS and which is facing shortfalls due to the coronavirus, the Democratic leadership says.\nTax credits for solar and wind energy\nThis is the one provision cited by the ad that is not actually in the House bill, despite pressure from the industry to include it.\nOur ruling\nThe campaign ad says that Pelosi\u2019s coronavirus bill included provisions on \"tax credits for solar and wind energy \u2026 emissions standards and carbon offset requirements for airlines \u2026 policing racial makeup of corporate boards \u2026 retirement plans for community newspaper employees \u2026 $300 million for PBS \u2026 climate change studies for civil aviation and aerospace industries.\"\nThe ad is correct that five of those six provisions are in the House bill. The remaining provision, on tax credits for solar and wind, is not. We rate the statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18193"}
