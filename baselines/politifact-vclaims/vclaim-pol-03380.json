They used to call this \"judge shopping!\" Messy system.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2017\n\nDistrict judges within the 9th Circuit have halted two versions of executive orders signed by Trump seeking to temporarily halt the U.S. entry of refugees and nationals from several countries in the Middle East and Africa. On April 25, another judge within the 9th Circuit granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against a different Trump order, one aiming to cut federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities.\nGiven Trump\u2019s record in the 9th Circuit, we wondered if his tweet was accurate \u2013 does the circuit have an overturn rate close to 80 percent? There are at least two ways to calculate that record, and by one metric the answer is yes. By another, it\u2019s far less than 1 percent.\nThe 9th Circuit\nBroadly speaking, the 9th Circuit includes the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and district and bankruptcy courts in 15 federal judicial districts (among them Hawaii, and districts in Washington, California).\nIt was a district judge in Hawaii who on March 15 blocked Trump\u2019s revised travel ban.\nOn Feb. 3, a district judge in Seattle granted a nationwide temporary restraining order on the first version of Trump's travel ban. Trump\u2019s Justice Department filed a motion appealing that district court's decision \u2013 the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied the motion but asked for more information. On Feb. 9, in a 3-0 decision the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Seattle judge's decision.\nAn overturned record is a reflection of cases in which the Supreme Court ruled contrary to a lower court. The 80 percent Trump tweeted about was in reference to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 record, and does not exactly apply to the district courts.\nThe Supreme Court typically only hears 100 to 150 of the estimated 7,000 cases it\u2019s asked to review per year. At least four of the nine Supreme Court judges must agree to hear a case, which come from the 50 state courts and 13 federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts.\nThe cases that the Supreme Court chooses to take on are often disputed among the lower courts, complex, and problematic, so there\u2019s a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will decide that the lower court\u2019s decision was wrong.\nWe previously looked at the 9th Circuit\u2019s record when Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity falsely claimed it was the most overturned in the country.\nHere\u2019s what we found then, using data from SCOTUSBlog\u2019s Supreme Court statistics archive on circuit scorecards.\nThe Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of cases it took between 2010-15. Among cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it reversed about 79 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 9th Circuit\u2019s reversal rate is higher than average, but it\u2019s not the absolute highest among the circuit courts. That distinction goes to the 6th Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, with an 87 percent average between 2010-15. The 9th Circuit placed third.\n6th Circuit - 87 percent;\n11th Circuit - 85 percent;\n9th Circuit - 79 percent;\n3rd Circuit - 78 percent;\n2nd Circuit and Federal Circuit - 68 percent;\n8th Circuit - 67 percent;\n5th Circuit - 66 percent;\n7th Circuit - 48 percent;\nDC Circuit - 45 percent;\n1st Circuit and 4th Circuit - 43 percent;\n10th Circuit - 42 percent.\nThe 9th Circuit overturned rate is similar to the findings of a 2010 analysis by Roy E. Hofer, a former president of the Federal Circuit Bar Association and the Chicago Bar Association.\nHofer found that from 1999 to 2008, the Supreme Court reversed or vacated (ruled null or void) 80 percent of the cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit.\nBut he pointed out that the percentage of reversed or vacated cases for each circuit would be significantly lower\u00a0if calculated in a different way.\n\"Reversal rates for each court of appeals would be very small, in the range of a tenth of a percent, if calculated as the total number of cases reversed over the total number of appeals terminated by that court,\" Hofer wrote in his article published by the American Bar Association. \"Conversely, if the reversal rate is calculated as the total number of cases reversed over the total number of cases reviewed by the Supreme Court, the ratio increases dramatically.\"\nIn comparing courts\u2019 \"performance,\" it makes more sense to compare reversal rate in terms of the ratio of cases reversed over cases reviewed by the Supreme Court, Hofer said.\nOver the 10-year period analyzed by Hofer, the 9th Circuit terminated 114,199 cases, in comparison, the 1st Circuit had 16,620, he found.\nIt\u2019s possible that the sheer size of the 9th Circuit, as well as some of its procedures, cause it to produce more \"outlier decisions,\" which are cases the Supreme Court always reverses, than other circuits \u2014 leading to a higher reversal rate, University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt previously told us.\nOur ruling\nTrump tweeted, the 9th Circuit has an overturned record \"close to 80%.\"\nAn overturned record can be calculated in at least two ways. By one measure, Trump\u2019s tweet is correct if examining only cases reviewed by the Supreme Court. But by factoring in cases reversed over the total number of cases ruled by the circuit court, then the percentage is significantly smaller, far less than 1 percent.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim Half True.\n Share the Facts 2017-04-26 15:39:51 UTC   Politifact    3 1 7  Politifact Rating: Half True  The Ninth Circuit has an overturned record \"close to 80%.\"    Donald Trump President of the United States   in a tweet Wednesday, April 26, 2017 2017-04-26    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03380"}
