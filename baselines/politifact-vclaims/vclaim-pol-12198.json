Blankfein.\n\nThe sign read: \"Minimum wage = $16,000/year CEO-Goldman Sachs (Lloyd Blankfein) $16,000/Hour.\"\n\nIt goes without saying that Goldman\u2019s CEO earns piles more money than most Americans, never mind Rhode Island\u2019s minimum-wage workers.\n\nEver since the New York investment bank accepted a $10-billion government bailout during the financial crisis in 2008, Goldman Sachs has made national headlines for its super-sized executive compensation packages.\n\nBut we had our doubts about whether Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s chief executive, actually earned in one hour what a minimum wage worker in Rhode Island earned in an entire year. So we decided to check it out.\n\nThe facts\n\nThe minimum wage in Rhode Island is $7.40 per hour, so simple math shows that someone who works 40 hours per week for 52 weeks (or 2,080 hours) will earn $15,392 a year. (The minimum wage was the same in 2010 as this year. Many minimum wage workers don\u2019t get benefits, unlike CEOs. But we\u2019ll get to that later.)\n\nThe protest sign said $16,000, which is pretty close.\n\nBut calculating the pay of chief executives is more complicated because a large share of their compensation is typically in the form of stock options, pension contributions and other non-cash payments.\n\nIn 2010, Goldman reported it paid Blankfein a salary of $600,000 plus a bonus of $5.4 million, for a total of $6 million, according to its 2011 proxy statement, the most recent available data.\n\nThat\u2019s 375 times more than a minimum age worker would earn in Rhode Island. But it\u2019s a mere $2,885 an hour, not $16,000. (We\u2019re basing this calculation on a 40-hour work week.)\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more.\n\nBesides his salary and bonus, the company reported that it gave Blankfein $12.6 million in restricted stock, boosting his annual compensation to $18.6 million. If he worked 40 hours per week, his hourly rate would amount to $8,942. And that\u2019s without benefits.\n\nGoldman also paid Blankfein $464,067 in 401(k) matching contributions, term life insurance premiums, medical and dental premium payments, long-term disability insurance premiums, life insurance premiums and perks such as his company car and driver. \u00a0\n\n(The protesters might have mentioned that the $185,000 Goldman paid for Blankfein\u2019s car and driver last year is more than 3\u00bd times Rhode Island\u2019s median household income in 2010.)\n\nIn all, Blankfein\u2019s compensation in 2010 totaled \u00a0about $19.06 million.\n\nBut once again, simple math shows that the estimated cash value of his compensation that year is $9,165 an hour -- not $16,000 an hour as the protest sign declared. \u00a0\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Occupy Providence protest sign was close when it stated that the minimum wage in Rhode Island is $16,000 a year (it\u2019s actually just under $15,400). And its point -- that CEOs such as Blankfein make enormous sums of money while people at the bottom of the economic ladder make almost nothing \u00a0-- is well taken. But the claim that Goldman Sachs\u2019 CEO earned $16,000 an hour was way off. \u00a0We rate it False.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.
