Beyond revelations about Watson\u2019s similarity to Hermione, her new hairdo and her research into female sexual pleasure, the Harry Potter star also shared a statistic that \"blindsided\" her from the book, Sex & World Peace. (\"The two things we want, right?\" quipped Steinem.) \u00a0\n\"There are now 101.3 men to every 100 women on the planet. So women are no longer half of humanity,\" Watson said on Feb. 24. \"I\u2019m quoting the book here but it says, \u2018More lives are lost from violence against women, sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, suicide, egregious maternal mortality, and other sex-linked causes than were lost during all of the wars and civil strife of 20th century.\u2019 \"\n\"So from this perspective,\" she continued, \"The greatest security dilemma then is systematic, social devaluation of female life. I\u2019d never come across a statistic like this. I had not understood that we were literally affecting the balance of the population of the world.\"\nThat\u2019s a startling statistic, and we wondered if it was grounded in fact.\nLooking at the available data, Watson has a point that the devaluation of female life leads to a staggering amount of lost lives. However, it\u2019s not clear that those lost lives are higher than the number of war and conflict deaths in the 20th century. The numbers are comparable, but some estimates find the number of war deaths as slightly higher.\nThe comparison\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from Watson or UN Women, but we did speak with Sex & World Peace\u2019s author, Valerie Hudson, who\u2019s a professor of international affairs at Texas A&M University.\nHudson walked us through how she crunched the numbers and shared a chart from her 2009 study comparing the deaths due to conflict and deaths due to sex-selective causes:\n\nHudson told us she tallied up the death tolls of 53 wars, conflicts and authoritarian regimes for a total of 152.75 million lives.\nShe then compared that number to the number of \"missing women.\" This concept, developed by Nobel-winning economist and philosopher Amartya Sen in 1990s, uses abnormal male-to-female ratios to determine how many women would be alive in a specific year or time period if they weren\u2019t aborted, neglected or victims of inequality.\nFor example, in 2005, the sex ratio in India was 107.5 males per 100 females. The normal sex ratio for a stable population is about 98 to 100.3 males per 100 females. (Women tend to live longer under equal circumstances.)\nThis means that there was a 6.7 percent to 9 percent shortfall in India\u2019s female population, equal to roughly 36 million to 49 million missing women.\nHudson used the\u00a0UN Population Fund\u2019s estimate of 163 million missing women in Asia in 2005 \u2014 10 million more than lives lost to 20th century conflicts.\nBut these figures aren\u2019t the only estimates out there.\nConflict deaths\nLet\u2019s state off the bat that there are many difficulties with tallying up both how many women should exist but don\u2019t, as well as how many lives were lost in all of the last century\u2019s civil strife and wars. Any estimate of missing women only works on the assumption that the skewed sex ratio is a result of discrimination. Similarly, while the specific number of casualties in World War I or under Khmer Rouge are reported, estimates for deaths in little-known conflicts like the one between Islamic separatists in the Philippines and the government are murky or nonexistent.\nThat being said, the estimates we found besides Hudson\u2019s do not show female deaths eclipsing the conflict death of the 20th century. Nonetheless, the numbers for sex-linked deaths are still considerable.\nHudson\u2019s number for conflict deaths (153 million) is a bit low. Most other tallies pin the total death toll somewhere around 200 million:\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\nDeath toll\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRummel, 2011\n\n\nAt least 169.2 million*\n\n\n\n\nWhite, 2010\n\n\n203 million\n\n\n\n\nBrzezinski, 2010\n\n\n170 million\n\n\n\n\nLeitenberg, 2006\n\n\n225.5 to 237.5 million\n\n\n\n\nBassiouni, 1996\n\n\n203 million\n\n\n\n\nAverage\n\n\n201.9 million\n\n\n\n\n(*We did not include Rummel\u2019s 169.2 million estimate in calculating the average, because the figure refers only to democides, or government-inflicted deaths, and does not include war casualties or famines associated with regime mismanagement.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHudson\u2019s missing women figure, meanwhile, appears to be an outlier when compared to other estimates:\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\nNumber of missing women\n\n\nYear\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBongaarts and Guilmoto, 2015\n\n\n150 million worldwide\n\n\n2035\n\n\n\n\nBongaarts and Guilmoto, 2015\n\n\n126 million worldwide\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n\nUN Population Fund, 2012\n\n\n117 million worldwide\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n\nAnderson and Ray, 2010\n\n\n86 million in China, India and sub-Saharan Africa\n\n\n2000s\n\n\n\n\nUN Population Fund, 2005 (Hudson\u2019s source)\n\n\n163 million worldwide in Asia\n\n\n2005\n\n\n\n\nHesketh and Zhu, 2006\n\n\n67 million to 92 million in 8 Asian countries\n\n\n2001\n\n\n\n\nKlasen and Wink, 2003\n\n\n102 million to 113 million worldwide\n\n\n1990s\n\n\n\n\nKlasen and Wink, 2001\n\n\n65 million to 107 million worldwide\n\n\n1990s\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe war on women\nExperts we spoke with expressed the toll of gendercide with more tempered, and more accurate, comparisons than Hudson\u2019s and Watson\u2019s.\n\"The number of missing females is undoubtedly of a larger order than recent demographic catastrophes such as World War II, the Chinese Famine, the HIV-aids epidemics, etc.,\" said Christophe Guilmoto, a demographer and author of several UN reports on the issue.\n\"There are more missing women today than died in the two World Wars of the 20th century,\" said Stephan Klasen, a professor of development economics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.\nWhile none of the missing women estimates top the 20th century\u2019s conflict death toll, they\u2019re a \"stock measure,\" which quantifies the impact of gender inequality in survival for generations that are currently alive, according to Klasen.\n\"(A missing women estimate) does not count those women and girls who died from discrimination decades ago and would have, by now, died from other causes,\" Klasen said.\nIf you tallied up all the missing women of the 20th century, \"the number would be well over 200 million,\" said Siwan Anderson, a University of British Columbia professor who specializes in development and gender economics.\nSince the 1970s, the number of missing women has risen and is expected to peak in 2035. There are no signs that skewed sex ratios have normalized even as we\u2019ve normalized violence against women, Hudson told us.\n\"We silo it off as \u2018stuff that happens between men and women\u2019 and do not count it as \u2018stuff that happens to human beings,\" she said. \"What an incredible level of impunity for a crime committed against a human being, just because that human being has two X chromosomes.\"\nOur ruling\nWatson said, \"More lives are lost from violence against women, sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, suicide, egregious maternal mortality, and other sex-linked causes than were lost during all of the wars and civil strife of 20th century.\"\nThe claim comes from the book Sex and World Peace by Valerie Hudson, who was citing a UN figure of 163 million missing women in 2005. That\u2019s 10 million more than her estimate of lives lost in all of last century\u2019s strife, 153 million.\nBut this is using a high estimate for the first measure and a low estimate for the second. The number of sex-related\u00a0deaths, which varies from year to year, typically falls within 100 million to 130 million range. The number of deaths due to war, according to most other estimates, is about 200 million. Both numbers are disturbingly high, but it\u2019s not clear that one is definitively higher than the other. \u00a0\nWith this caveat, we rate Watson\u2019s claim Half True.
