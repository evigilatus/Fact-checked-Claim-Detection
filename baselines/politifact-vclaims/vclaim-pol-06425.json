PolitiFact decided to check.\nFirst a little background.\nEverytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and gun-control advocate Shannon Watts, contends that stolen and illegally trafficked firearms are making their way to cities such as New York from Georgia and other states, especially in the South, that have lax gun laws via the so-called \"iron pipeline.\"\nErika Soto Lamb, the group\u2019s communications, said Everytown for Gun Safety can back up the statement. As evidence, she pointed to the killings of two NYPD police officers last December in a rampage by a convicted felon. The suspect was using a \u00a0gun that was first sold legally by Arrowhead Pawn Shop in Jonesboro, she said.\nWe asked: Is it fair to say that\u2019s \"an illegal gun from Georgia?\"\n\"The shooter in that event was a convicted felon -- which means he should not have been in possession of a gun and which makes that an illegal gun,\" she wrote in an email..\nTracing and tracking firearms\nThe job of tracing guns falls to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the only agency authorized to track firearms made in the United States and abroad when law enforcement agencies request help.\nPolice recover guns in various ways \u2013 as part of a criminal investigation, during regular patrols and even in buyback events. They can submit requests to the ATF\u2019s National Tracing Center to track a weapon\u2019s history, said ATF Agent Charles J. Mulham, the public information officer for the Bureau\u2019s New York field division.\nBecause a gun\u2019s history can become evidence in a trial, the records are not public unless the requesting agencies disclosing them.\nThe New York Police Department submitted such a request following the shooting of Moore in Queens. It later made the findings public in a press conference.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout required public disclosure of the trace records, the question of whether additional illegal guns from Georgia were used in the shooting deaths of other New York City cops becomes fuzzy to answer.\nFederal law requires only that guns stolen or lost from licensed gun dealers be reported to the ATF.\nThe District of Columbia and another 10 states \u2013 including New York and neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut \u2013 require private citizens to report the theft or loss of at least some handguns or weapons. Georgia has no such requirement.\nThat means those who aspire to make money by selling hard-to-come-by firearms in New York City for profit could, in theory, not even bother to steal them in Georgia.\nThey could buy them here, sell them for high mark-ups in New York and, if the trace came back to a legal purchase, possibly face no penalty if they claimed the weapons had been stolen but not reported, Mulham said.\nIn other words, it\u2019s a tricky definition to term a gun \"illegal\" given the patchwork of state laws that govern their purchase.\nThat complicates the definition of the gun used in the December shooting deaths of New York City officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos\nThat gun, a Taurus 9 mm, was bought legally in 1996 from the Jonesboro pawn shop, said NYPD Lt. John Grimpel.\nThe weapon\u2019s history then becomes murky before convicted felon Ismaaiyl Brinsley ended up with it and shot the officers as they sat in their patrol car.\nIt was illegal for Brinsley to have the gun, given restrictions on ownership by felons as well as New York law making it illegal for anyone to have a handgun without a permit.\nBut the gun itself was officially legal because it was legally purchased. That history was uncovered when NYPD requested the gun be traced after the shootings.\n\"After 1996, the whereabouts of the gun were unknown, until December 2014 when it was used in the murders of officers Ramos and Liu,\" Grimpel said.\nOur conclusion\nPolice have seized a gun stolen from Georgia nearly four years ago and believe it was used \u00a0in the recent, tragic shooting death of a young NYPD officer.\nBut Everytown For Gun Safety overreaches in suggesting that an earlier fatal shooting of two officers involved an \"illegal gun from Georgia.\" That weapon was sold according to federal law and therefore legal, until it found its way to someone who used it to commit a horrific crime.\nSuch overreaches allow political debate to shape facts.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06425"}
