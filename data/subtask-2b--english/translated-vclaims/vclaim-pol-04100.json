At some point, Clinton said, \"We have 33,000 people a year dying of guns.\" Is she right? According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 33,599 people died of rifles in 2014, the last available year. And the figure is 33 grand for three years. So Clinton has a strong point. However, it is important to note that it combines homicides, suicides and other types of shootings, including accidental layoffs and legally permitted killings such as those carried out by law enforcement. As the following chart shows, suicides represent the largest proportion of firearms-related deaths - about two thirds in recent years. While firearms-related suicides have increased by 10 per cent since 2010, the number of deaths from non-lethal weapons remains almost the same. 2014: 33,599, 334, 12, 265 2013 33, 636, 21 175 12, 461 2012 By Samantha Buterman: 11 January 2021 33563 20,666 12,897 2011 32,251 19,990 12,361 2010 31,672 19,392 12,380 a year, 1999-2014 31,102 18,223 12,879 Clinton carefully expressed -- she referred to people who \"died from guns\" without specifying the circumstances of their shooting. However, the fact that suicides account for a large proportion of killings of armed men is a noteworthy detail. Our referee, Clinton, said, \"We have 33,000 people a year dying of weapons.\" She is right that all the deaths caused by weapons have exceeded 33,000 during the last three years for which we have data. However, it should be noted that almost two thirds of these cases were suicides. We assess her claim mostly correct. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9a3e1667-84ed-4192-ab02-8c907f1714a0", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04100"}
