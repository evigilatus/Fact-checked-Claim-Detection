Bernie Sanders turned his eyes on Walmart this week. \"while Walmart claims that he can't pay his employees $15 an hour, he managed to find enough money to pay his CEO more than $22 million last year,\" he tweeted Sanders. Saunders unveiled Walmart's law of November 15th to end their hideous greed. The bill would prevent companies from purchasing shares again unless they adopted a fee of $15 per hour and allowed workers to take seven days of paid sick leave per year. This will also reduce the remuneration of executives by no more than 150 times the average wage of employees. \"The Walton family in the Mart is the richest family in America, valued at $180 billion,\" said Sanders in a series of tweets directed at the Mart. Middle-class taxpayers must not support a terriblely low Walmart wage of at least $6.2 billion a year. There was one particular case that caught our attention: did American taxpayers really support the working force and the mart at a cost of $6.2 billion a year? Given that the total tax revenue collected by Sanders in Vermont was $5.9 billion last year, this figure would be quite impressive. We decided to dig in. We have asked Camp Sanders for information on where this figure came from and has not been answered. But we're pretty sure we found the source. The $6.2 billion figure for the first time appeared in a report by the United States Tax Justice Advocacy Group released on Tax Day in 2014. \"Mart gets an estimated $6.2 billion a year in most federal taxpayers' subsidies,\" said the report. \"Cause: Wal-Mart pays his employees so little that many depend on food stamps, health care and other programmes funded by taxpayers.\" Google research indicates that the number was dozens of headlines when the report was released, and it continues to be cited in articles on Wal-Mart -- in last year's story of opposition, for example. So how did the Americans come to this form of tax justice? The Panel relied on data from a report issued by the Democratic Officers of the United States House of Representatives Education and Labour Committee in May 2013. For that report, researchers used the Wisconsin Medicaid registration data from 2012 \"because it looks newer and more comprehensive.\" Walmart was found to have more employees in Medicaid - 3,216 - than any other employer in the state. From there, the democratic officials assumed that the Walmart employees enrolled in the Badr + Medeked medical care programme in Wisconsin were also enrolled in other federal benefit programmes, such as subsidized housing, food stamps, home energy assistance and child care subsidies. With all these costs collected, researchers estimate that the only Woolmart centre with 300 employees costs $904,542 per year - about $3,015 per employee. They then analysed the figures again in some employees who did not join Badger Care+, but it could be, raising the figure to $1,744,590 per year - about $5,815 per employee. The Americans then took the midpoint of these figures, $4,415, and beat them in the workforce of 1.4 million in Walmart at the time. 1,400,000 x $4,415 = $6,181,000,000 from the verification of the facts cited by Jordan Rachel on January 16, 2021 in the tweeting of A minimum wage of $15 per hour raises the price of Taco Bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2012, here he is. About $6.2 billion (not least, as Saunders tweeted). However, this figure has been controversial since its inception. The report of the House Committee contains a description of the difficulty of trying to cross-examine Wisconsin data throughout the country. Wisconsin has lower levels of poverty than many other states, as noted. Wisconsin makes it easier to register in Medicaid than many other states. \"Because of the differing eligibility requirements of the programme across states, the costs of taxpayers for Walt's stores in other states are cross-checked on the basis of Wisconsin data,\" the report states. In his tweet, Sanders also referred to \"medium-class taxpayers\" paying the bill. The House of Representatives and Americans Committee for Tax Justice includes all those who help pay for public benefit programmes - not just the middle class. In 2014, when the figures were somewhat new, MSNBC's host Ed Schultz received a mostly false statement from PolitiFact to cite $5,800 in assistance to each staff member, which came from the same reports. Four years later, the numbers became more fragile. The Walmart workforce rose to about 1.5 million employees and the company increased wages significantly. In the 2013 report, Democrats referred to an average fee of $8.81 per hour for Walmart sales partners. In January this year, Walmart announced that he would raise his base wage to $11 per hour. Then there is an increase in the cost of living. So maybe these powers cancel out. But who knows? Dennis Bailey, Director of Communications for Tax Justice of the Americans, said that the group adhered strictly to its research, but had not reconsidered the figures since Wal-Mart had increased wages. Billy added that the group &apos; s critics had not submitted any data to refute their numbers. \"Take a small sample and deduce -- that's done all the time in the data world. There was no reason to believe that doing so in a different situation would yield different results.\" Walmart doesn't help much. The figures in the American report for tax justice had already been rejected by company representatives, but no alternative data had been provided. Justin Rushing, head of Walmart's corporate communications, said in an e-mail on Friday that he had no comment on the validity of the $6.2 billion. He referred to a 2005 report by Jason Forman, then Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, on the low wages he received and the martes that benefited from America &apos; s expanded social safety net. \"A large part of the benefits of these expansions goes to the workers they receive, not to the companies that hire them,\" says Foreman's report. Our rule, Sanders, said: \"Medium-class taxpayers should not support a terriblely low rate of wages until they reach at least $6.2 billion a year.\" Saunders is using old numbers that seem to be suspicious from the start. But there's no updated search we can find. One element of the truth is that some of Walmart's employees compensate for their wages with public assistance programmes. Given the size of the labour force in Walmart, it could add up to billions of dollars. Sanders also added the layer element that was not in the initial research, claiming that $6.2 billion in taxes came only from the \"medium class,\" which seems to be a political boom not based on facts. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01253"}
