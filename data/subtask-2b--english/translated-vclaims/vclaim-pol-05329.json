One record in the United States Senate", "truth_label": "mostly-true", "date": "stated on March 3, 2016 in a GOP debate hosted by Fox:", "title": "Donald Trump is right. Marco Rubio has the worst senate voting record.", "text": "In a hot exchange, the Republican candidate for President Donald Trump criticized his opponent, S. Marco Rubio of Florida, for his senatorial record. \"This man has no. One absence record in the U.S. (Senate), Tramp said on March 3, the Fox News debate in Detroit. Trump took this claim out of Rubio several times, and we found it mostly true. Let's reconsider the facts. The award \"The Most Retarded\" goes to Rubio if we look at last year. If we examine the professional records among the remaining presidential candidates who served in the Senate, it is linked to the Republican competitor Sin. Ted Cruz of Texas. From March 2015 to March 2016, Rubio missed 77 out of 263 roll-calls, according to Guftrak. Here's how Rubio is piling up against the other senators now: the votes missed by the Senate (5 March 2015 to 3 March 2016) at the rate of absence of Marco Rubio (R-Fla) are 41% Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 108.36% Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) 58% of Rubio's 41% absence rate, which means that last year he had a worse voting record than every other senator. In contrast, the average rate of absence in the Senate last year is only 1 per cent. The majority of the votes exceeded by Rubio after April 13, when he announced his candidacy, were referred to by The Tampa Bay Times. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 \"It's not unusual for presidential candidates to miss their Senate votes,\" said Rubio, a Brooke Samon spokesman for The Tampa Bay Times. \"Sen. Rubio is still fully engaged in the important issues of Florida and the assistance of Floridaians, and as the country travels to talk about its agenda to help the middle class, there will be no doubt about his position on any important issues before the Senate.\" On March 3, the rate of absence from work was 14.8 percent. Senators &apos; votes missed (post) 152 of 1,026 14.8 per cent Rubio 224 out of 1,512 Hillary Clinton (D-NY, 2001-2009) 249 out of 2,616 9.5 per cent Sanders 131 out of 2,865 4.6 per cent but outside the current domain, neither Cruz nor Rubio are the worst criminals ever, according to Washington Post analysis in May 2015. For example, President Barack Obama lost 24.2 per cent of the votes in his short career in the Senate. This compares not even with the most absent senators: Marion Allen, D-Ala, who increased the absence rate by 43.5% during his five-month term in the Senate in 1978. The governor, Trump, said Rubio had no. One record in the United States Senate It's accurate if we look at the number of votes we missed last year. Within that time frame, Rubio missed a higher percentage of votes than any other senator, including those against whom they were running. If we look at the absence records between the remaining presidential competitors, Rubio and Cruz are tied up by 14.8 per cent. Some former senators have worse records, including Obama. We assess Trump's claim mostly true.
