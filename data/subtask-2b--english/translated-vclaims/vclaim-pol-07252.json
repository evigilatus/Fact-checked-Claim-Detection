This additional information, to which a reader referred, did not change our assessment of the claim that we tested.

Austin City employees beat her up rich! I'm sorry. We were deported through a claim in a forum of Austin City Council candidates by the Association of Women Voters and the City of Austin. According to the US Austin-State News story published on the Internet on September 16, 2014, Attorney Jay Willy, the Council candidate, said the day before there was a room in the city's budget for the staff offices in each of the 10 newly established districts with one member. Wiley, who works in Area 6 in northwest Austin, also said at the Forum: \"We have, in fact, over 1,000 employees in the city who receive six-digit salaries.\" Does that make up? We failed to get to Wylie to find out who he was. Meanwhile, Melissa Alvarado, a city spokesman, sent an e-mail chart indicating that as of 1 September 2014, 879 workers earned from $100,089 to $304,657. To follow up on queries, Alvarado sent a chart containing 24 vacant posts at that time in exchange for payment of $100,000 or more. So, you could say the city had 903 jobs paying six numbers at the time that Wylie happened. Alvarado said that the city had 11,852 workers, meaning that its workers, whose income was over $100,000, represented 7 per cent of its workers. Besides, more workers were heading to the 6-digit class soon. On our query, Alvarado said that 3.5 per cent of the increases would come into effect on 21 September 2014 (before the start of the new fiscal year in October) and would result in 1,162 staff receiving $100,000 or more. At that time, she said that the city expected to have another 36 open positions, each paying more than $100,000. So at that time, city projects, 1,198 jobs will pay six numbers. Alvarado said that the city had 12,780 budgeted posts for fiscal year 2015. We also looked at which of the city &apos; s workers benefited most. Find that sample below.

After we first published this fact check, a reader pointed out that on September 23, 2014, Thar Wylie said, \"The forum of \"about 1,000\" workers earn six figures of salary. The governor, Wylie, said more than a thousand city workers were paid six figures. When he spoke, 879 workers earned over $100,000, which meant that he exceeded the limit. Again, the increases were about to enter into force by increasing the number of employees in this category of wages to 1,162. We're mostly evaluating the statement right. In fact, this statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information.
