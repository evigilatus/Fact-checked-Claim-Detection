Back then, we checked the claim by Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind. Pence said that under the Democratic health plan -- which was then in the final stages leading up to passage -- families \"will be forced to spend an additional $2,100 a year to keep their current health care.\"\n\nAs we noted then, the figure comes from a Nov. 30, 2009, analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress.\n\nThe CBO's analysis of how the law would affect premiums was broken into three categories, based on expectations for the year 2016:\n\n\u2022 Those in the small group market, or people who work for businesses with up to 50 employees and receive employer-provided coverage. This category would make up about 13 percent of the total insurance market by 2016, CBO found.\n\n\u2022 Those in the large group market, which would account for about 70 percent of the insurance market.\n\n\u2022 Those in the non-group (or \"individual\") market, who purchase insurance as individuals. This group is expected to grow to about 17 percent of the insurance market. Today, these individuals purchase plans on their own, but most purchases made after the health care law is fully in place in 2014 would be made through the newly created insurance \"exchanges\" -- virtual marketplaces where Americans without employer-sponsored coverage can browse through insurance offerings and choose which plan to buy.\n\nAccording to the report, the CBO estimates that the average premium per person in new individual policies would be about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than the average premium for individual coverage under current law.\n\nSpecifically, the average premiums per policy in the non-employer-provided market in 2016 would be roughly $5,800 for single policies (up from $5,500 under current law) and $15,200 for family policies (up from $13,100 under current law).\n\nThe latter comparison, for families, is the source of the Senate Republican Conference\u2019s number (and Pence\u2019s) -- $2,100.\n\nSo the web video is correct that for families with non-group coverage, premiums could rise by $2,100.\n\nBut the video also leaves out some important context.\n\nIt ignores subsidies that many purchasers will receive. The CBO report notes that the majority of non-group enrollees -- about 57 percent -- would receive federal insurance subsidies, which on average would cover about two-thirds of the total premium.\n\nIt ignores improvements in the plan for beneficiaries. Much of the coverage purchased on the individual market prior to the law included high deductibles and restrictions. But the plans to be sold on the exchanges will be required to offer a minimum benefit package that should, in most cases, be superior what was offered in policies sold before the law took effect.\n\nSo while the new coverage may cost more, beneficiaries will get more insurance for their money and should see their out-of-pocket medical costs go down. According to the CBO report, an \"apples to apples\" comparison of the average price of equivalent insurance under the Democrats' plan would translate to an average premium about 7 to 10 percent lower than under current law.\n\nUsing the individual market as the standard is cherry picking. The other two categories -- the small group and large-group markets -- are entirely ignored by the video, even though the vast majority of people -- 83 percent -- get private health care insurance that way.\n\nAnd the impact of the law on premiums for these groups is far lower than for the individual market. CBO projected that small-group premiums would jump just $100 by 2016, while large-group premiums would jump by just $200. Neither figure is as eye-popping as the $2,100 figure cited in the video.\n\nPut it all together and what the CBO actually projected is that the vast majority of families with private insurance would see little change in premiums -- some because they\u2019ll have employer-sponsored insurance that won\u2019t experience big premium hikes, and some because they\u2019ll have federally subsidized coverage in the individual market.\n\nThe families at risk of having to pay $1,200 in extra premiums would be those who have individual market insurance in 2016 but no subsidies -- about 7 percent of all Americans who have either individual or employer-sponsored insurance.\n\nUsing statistics for the individual market is a non-sequitur. The video airs a clip of Obama promising to \"work with your employer to lower your premiums by $2,500 per family per year.\" As we recently noted, we\u2019ve given Obama a rating of Stalled for his promise to lower employer-provided family premiums by $2,500, so noting that failure is a legitimate point.\n\nBut video goes on to note that Obama law \"raises premiums in the individual market by $2,100 per family.\" The individual market is the only type of private insurance where the employer plays no role.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Senate Republican Conference video claimed that while Obama promised to \"work with your employer to lower your premiums by $2,500 per family per year,\" his health care law \"raises premiums in the individual market by $2,100 per family.\"\n\nThe number does come from a Congressional Budget Office analysis, and it\u2019s phrased accurately. But it\u2019s stripped of crucial context and distorts the truth. It ignores subsidies that would ease the financial burden for a majority of those seeing premium increases; it ignores that the additional premium dollars will pay for more generous benefits; and it ignores that the vast majority of Americans with private insurance will pay no more than $200 extra for their premiums due to the law -- and possibly less than that.
