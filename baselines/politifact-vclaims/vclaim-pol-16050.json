The law prohibits legislators, state officers and employees, as well as judges, from soliciting or receiving gifts from a person with interests affected by the state government.\n\n\nIn his speech at the Democratic National Convention, Illinois state Sen. Emil Jones Jr. cited Obama's efforts in shepherding this legislation, noting that it was a difficult bipartisan task to get legislators to vote on regulating gifts they receive.\n\n\nKirk Dillard, a Republican in the Illinois state Senate, worked with Obama on the ethics bill and was impressed enough to appear in an Obama presidential campaign TV ad even though he's endorsing GOP Sen. John McCain.\n\n\n\"Sen. Obama worked on some of the deepest issues we had and was successful in a bipartisan way,\" Dillard said in the ad. \"Republican legislators respected Sen. Obama. His negotiation skills and an ability to understand both sides would serve the country well.\"\n\n\nDillard said in an interview he made the ad primarily because of his work with Obama on ethics reform, but also mentioned his cooperation on changes in the state's death penalty laws. \"Sen. Obama, even on a topic more suited for liberals, worked extremely well with conservatives,\" he said. Obama collaborated with another Republican, Rep. Sandra Pihos, on legislation expanding the state's KidCare and FamilyCare health insurance programs.\n\n\nStill, by most indications Obama compiled a Democratic voting record in Springfield. In 2001, he received a 100 percent rating from the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council and in 2002 received a grade of \"A\" from Illinois Citizens for Handgun Control. He consistently received high scores from the Illinois AFL-CIO.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince arriving in Washington in 2005, Obama has also voted consistently with his party while also attempting to work with Republicans on several high-profile issues.\n\n\nObama worked with Republican Richard Lugar of Indiana on several energy bills and on Jan. 11, 2007, President Bush signed their bill to expand U.S. cooperation to destroy conventional weapons.\n\n\nObama and Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma successfully pushed through Congress legislation creating a database to track federal grants and contracts. Open-government advocates said the legislation would help provide more public access to the so-called earmarking process, where individual lawmakers secure funding for particular projects.\n\n\nBut the picture isn't all rosy. Perhaps signaling battles to come, Sen. John McCain accused Obama in February 2006 of partisan posturing over ethics reform. Obama had taken his party's lead on the issue, and he had asked McCain to support his version of a bill.\n\n\n\"I failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self-interested partisan posturing appear more noble,\" McCain wrote in a letter to Obama. \"Again, sorry for the confusion, but please be assured, I won't make that same mistake again.\"\n\n\nIn June, McCain sought to poke holes in Obama's claims of bipartisanship, noting that he, McCain, was the one who in the spring of 2005 joined the so-called Gang of 14, a small bipartisan group that resolved a bitter partisan dispute over three conservative judicial nominees named by President George W. Bush.\n\n\nAs part of the compromise, the Democrats agreed not to support furthering the filibuster of the judicial nominees and the Republicans agreed not follow through on the threat of the \"nuclear option,\" which would have effectively killed the practice of filibustering.\n\n\nWe\n\nexamined this claim\n\n, and ruled that McCain was correct that Obama did not participate.\n\n\nFor his part, Obama said he didn't participate because he felt like the Republicans got everything they wanted. \"I don't think it was a particularly good compromise,\" Obama told the\n\nSt. Petersburg Times\n\non May 21, 2008.\n\n\nA review of Obama's votes as a senator also doesn't bolster his argument of bipartisanship.\n\n\n\nCongressional Quarterly\n\ndoes vote studies each year and found that in the Bush era, Obama voted his party's position 96 percent of the time on votes where Republicans and Democrats were divided.\n\n\nBottom line, while it's clear that Obama has had some bipartisan success, when it comes to voting on key pieces of legislation, Obama's record is almost in lockstep with the Democratic Party. Therefore, we can only give Pelosi's claim a Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16050"}
