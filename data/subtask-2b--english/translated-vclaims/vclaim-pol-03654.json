The raids aren't business as usual. The raids are carried out without discrimination. The senator from New Jersey said in a video that was posted on his Twitter account in February 13. Because the administration has eliminated the enforcement priorities of the Obama administration - the first and highest execution by the foreign criminals to be deported, and then recently crossed the border, and then the third and final level of any other person - because they have eliminated that list of enforcement priorities, and now anyone who comes to it and who may not eventually have identity documents are picked up and sent away. For the so-called Family Values Party: ripping up immigrant families is not the solution. #ICERAIDs pic.twitter.com/hVASZprcFw-Senator Bob Menendez (@Senator Menendez) February 13, 2017 Trump Campaign on Promises for the Illegal Deportation of Migrants in the Country, giving priority to the expulsion of those convicted of crimes or a threat to national security, such as drug traffickers and murderers. Is Men\u00e9ndez accurate in claiming that recent immigration inspections are not normal work and involve persons without criminal convictions? We found that recent operations were routine, but also included arrests of individuals who would not have been a high priority under the administration of former President Barack Obama. The Trump Executive Order, which gives priority to deportations less than a week after assuming office, signed an executive order instructing the Minister of Internal Security to give priority to the expulsion of a wide range of persons, including individuals convicted of \"moral offences\" (e.g. murder); involvement in terrorist activities; conviction of any criminal offence; indictment of any criminal offence, even if the charge has not been solved; final deportation orders; and individuals who commit acts constituting a criminal offence for which they are charged. In Fox's analysis, David A. Martin, an honorary professor of law at the University of Virginia and an expert on immigration, said that Trump's priorities were \"dispersed on a much broader scale,\" and \"do not establish an internal hierarchy to refer to categories that should be emphasized when resources are limited - as they always are.\" The executive order essentially took the broadest possible definition of \"criminal alien,\" and Martin, a former senior deputy general adviser at the Ministry of National Security, said in an interview with Politi Factte. In recent years of the Obama administration, the highest priority for expulsion has been threats to national security, border security and public safety; the second priority has been individuals convicted of offences, those who have recently violated immigration law, and those who have \"breached to a large extent the use of visa programmes\"; and the lowest priority has been individuals who have been issued with a final deportation order on or after 1 January 2014. Before setting these priorities in November 2014, Obama's immigrant rights activists described him as \"the public official\" because his administration deported more than 2 million people. In the early days of the Trump administration, elected officials and media outlets reported that hundreds of migrants had been arrested in cities across America, including people who, according to migrant rights defenders, did not fit Trump &apos; s prominent descriptions of threats to public safety. The Secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly, issued a statement on 13 February in which he said that an agency in his Ministry, the United States Department of Immigration and Customs, had last week conducted a series of targeted enforcement operations in several cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta, which had led to the arrest of more than 680 people. Some 75 per cent of them had been convicted of crimes involving, but not limited to, murder, aggravated sexual assault and drug trafficking. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverdi, 3 February 2021, the operations also targeted \"individuals who violated our nation's immigration laws, including those who returned illegally after their deportation, and fleeing immigration by order of federal immigration judges,\" Kelly said. The targeted processes had been a common practice for many years. A speaker on behalf of the Institute presented the fact sheets of Politifakt for targeted operations in recent days and also highlighted previous operations under the Obama administration that focused on the arrest of criminals living illegally in the country. A December 2012 report by the Congressional Research Service on Internal Migration Law Enforcement stated that the objectives of the Institute's National Fugitive Operations Programme included large-scale foreign criminals and \"fugitive foreigners who have not been convicted of a crime.\" As a fact checker noted in the Washington Post, fugitive operations in fiscal year 2010 (the first full financial year in Obama) resulted in the arrest of 35,774. In fiscal year 2011, 39,466 persons were arrested. However, the Men\u00e9ndez office referred to parts of Kelly &apos; s statement that 75 per cent - not 100 per cent - of the detainees were foreign criminals, and to the line that the detainees included individuals who violated immigration laws. In contrast to the policies of Tramp and Obama, the Senator &apos; s team also referred to one of the recent deportees, Guadalupe Garc\u00eda de R\u00edos. The 35-year-old woman lived in Arizona and had a deportation order, but instead of being removed from the country, the Obama administration asked her to check periodically while focusing on the deportation of violent criminals, reported The New York Times. She was arrested during her last investigation with the CIA and left on 9 February. The ICS said they removed Garcia de R\u00edos because she had a felony conviction and deportation order. A Mexican citizen used a false social security number to work and pleaded guilty to a criminal impersonation charge, a sixth-degree felony, according to the Washington Post. A day after Men\u00e9ndez claimed that recent immigration inspections were \"not business as usual,\" the mayor of Los Angeles Erik Garcetti, in an interview with the Ministry of National Security and Political Affairs in February 14, said that the CIA had told him that there were persons who had been arrested and had no other violation besides their illegal presence in the country. \"But some of them were caught in the wrong place, the wrong time. They're after someone. Someone else was in the apartment and they were taken.\" Garcetti said. On 15 February, Reuters reported that a 23-year-old Mexican man, Daniel Ram\u00edrez Medina, who had been granted deferred deportation protection during the Obama administration, had been detained by immigration authorities on 10 February in Washington State. IC told Reuters that Ramirez was arrested \"on the basis of his belonging to recognized gangs and his danger to public safety.\" Ramirez's lawyers told the news agency that he had been pressured by CIA agents \"to admit false affiliation.\" The Institute stated that the detention of Ramirez was not linked to recent targeted enforcement actions. He was arrested when the police went to one of the houses to detain another person, a criminal who had been deported. Our governor Men\u00e9ndez said that recent immigration raids \"is not business as usual. The raids are carried out without discrimination. They don't focus simply on alien criminals.\" The deportations take place on a broader basis than before. However, his statement gave the impression that there were large-scale deportations of law-abiding persons. In most cases, deportations continue to focus on persons who commit other crimes. Men\u00e9ndez's statements are partially accurate, but they ignore important details. In general, we value it half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2bebb6ca-9052-404a-a8b1-fd006c70c1c1cb", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03654"}
