Patrick and incumbent Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst are slated to run off for the Republican nomination on May 27, 2014.\nThe ad, sponsored by Dewhurst, included this curious claim: Patrick, the announcer said, \"supported giving a $5,000 taxpayer-funded voucher to every family to buy a car.\"\nDid Patrick, a radio talk-show host and businessman who hasn\u2019t served in Congress, do that?\nBy email, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine sent us Dewhurst\u2019s backup document for the ad, which states that twice on CNN\u2019s \"Lou Dobbs Tonight,\" Patrick suggested vouchers for Americans to buy cars instead of the federal government bailing out automobile manufacturers.\nOn the Nov. 25, 2008, edition of the show, Dobbs suggested an urgency to the then-proposed bailout and sought Patrick\u2019s thoughts, according to CNN\u2019s transcript.\nDobbs: \"This auto industry bailout, we got to have it. There's just no question. Whatever the reason is, national security, you name it. Three million people lose their jobs. We have got to do something. I don't get why Congress is so uptight about this idea after basically signing on for $8 trillion. Do you, Dan?\"\nPatrick: \"Well, I do get it from this standpoint, Lou, is until we see a plan that they're going to change their business model, we're bridging the gap until they eventually go bankrupt. I'm not in favor of any of these bailouts but I would rather see let's bail out the middle class that you had a story earlier in the show that's being hammered. Give each family a voucher for $5,000 that can only be used if they buy a new truck or automobile.\"\n\"That will start moving inventory,\" Patrick then said.\nThe Texan added: \"We need some practical thinking on the main street level to help the average, American family. That's what we need to help get the economy rolling. Once the economy is rolling, everything takes care of itself but I'm tired of giving money to Wall Street, tired of seeing Congress have no transparency where this money is going.\n\"Let's put it in the pockets of the people,\" Patrick said. \"We got here, Lou, because once upon a time, the saying was, we're spending our children's money and our grandchildren's money. This government is now spending our great-grandchildren's money and the factor of inflation and debt is going to destroy this country.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier on the program, Patrick said: \"Most people don't want to see General Motors fail but they also don't want their tax dollars and bail out a company that has had bad ideas and bad management.\"\nPatrick also brought up the voucher idea on the March 31, 2009, edition of Dobbs\u2019 program, we confirmed from the CNN transcript.\n\"Six months ago,\" Patrick said to Dobbs, \"I was on your show here after the first stimulus, Lou, and I suggested that the government send a $5,000 check to every head of a household who had an auto registration and it could\" only be \"used to buy a car.\" (Patrick wasn\u2019t that specific earlier, at least according to the 2008 show\u2019s transcript.)\nPatrick continued in his 2009 appearance: \"If we want to use stimulus money effectively, send a check for five grand to everyone in America, head of a household, that they can only use to buy a car. That will move cars.\" Later in the interview, Patrick said: \"But instead of sending Detroit the money, send it to people\" to go buy a car.\nAsked about the senator\u2019s statements to Dobbs, Patrick spokesman Logan Spence pointed us to a Patrick campaign web page including a section declaring Dewhurst\u2019s voucher claim a lie. \"This is a misrepresentation of\" Patrick\u2019s \"position,\" Patrick\u2019s camp says. \"He said that the money the federal government was playing with to bail out the auto industry would be better served being returned to their rightful owner\u2014the taxpayer\u2014for use of buying a car should they want to.\" Vouchers, Spence said by email, struck Patrick as a \"better and cheaper idea.\"\nOur ruling\nDewhurst said Patrick \"supported giving a $5,000 taxpayer-funded voucher to every family to buy a car.\"\nPatrick advocated such vouchers, but this claim fails to note that Patrick pitched them as a direct way of bolstering auto manufacturing instead of the federal bailout of manufacturers. It\u2019s worth clarifying, too, that a state senator doesn't hold much sway over what the federal government does.\nWe rate this claim as Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08135"}
