Therefore, it continues, people should avoid eating the company\u2019s products or risk contracting the virus.\nThe full post: \"This is the guy who added his infected blood to Cadbury products. For the next week do no eat any products from Cadbury, as a worker from the company has added his blood contaminated with HIV (AIDS). It was shown yesterday on BBC News. Please forward this message to people who you care.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis Cadbury rumor first appeared in 2018, and has been debunked before.\nThe claim\u00a0is unsubstantiated on several\u00a0levels.\nFirst, a reverse-image search shows that the photo was published on multiple Nigerian websites in 2014 and is of Boko Haram terrorist Aminu Ogwuche, who was accused of planning the April 14, 2014, bus park bombing in the Nigerian suburb of Abuja. The blast killed 71 people and injured another 120, according to reports. The photo shows Ogwuche being extradited by international police to Nigeria from South Sudan.\nSecond, no arrests have been made and no warnings issued about the British confectionery company\u2019s products being contaminated with HIV. There have also been no recalls or media reports of such a thing.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird, and probably most importantly, it is nearly impossible to contract HIV by food consumption.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, HIV does not survive outside of the human\u2019s bodily fluids and it cannot reproduce outside a human host:\n\"You can\u2019t get HIV from consuming food handled by someone with HIV. Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus,\" the CDC says.\nIn very rare cases, HIV has been found to have been spread from an infected person to another through pre-chewed food. According to the CDC, the only known cases where this has occurred is when the pre-chewed food was shared with an infant.\u00a0 The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver\u2019s mouth mixes with food while chewing.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nPosts on social media claim that Cadbury candy products are contaminated after an HIV-positive worker was arrested for infecting the products with his blood.\nThis rumor has been going around for over a year, and is completely bogus.\nThe man in the photo is a Nigerian terrorist and there is no evidence that Cadbury products have ever been contaminated with the virus.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2019-03-07 20:01:54 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  An HIV-positive Cadbury worker has been arrested after contaminating products with his blood.
