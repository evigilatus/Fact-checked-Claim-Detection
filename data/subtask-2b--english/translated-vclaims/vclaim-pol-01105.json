He called for the start of a \"discussion\" between Democrats and Republicans about their often negative views on arms restrictions. In January, the Republican majority defeated the Northham Arms Control Package, which also included checking everyone &apos; s background and limiting the purchase of hand weapons to one per month. We asked whether the Northam Statement - namely, that high-risk bills have been passed in other states with republican legislatures and signed by Republican party governors - is correct. Thirteen states have high-risk laws, also called Red Flag laws. It allows the police - usually family members - to petition the court to order the temporary transfer of firearms from a person who may be dangerous to himself or to other persons. After a specified period of time, the weapon is returned either to the person concerned or the court order is extended. Proponents argue that laws can prevent violent and suicide crimes. It is argued that the laws allow the Government to confiscate firearms in violation of the second amendment. The National Gun Association had opposed the laws for many years, but in 2018 it had changed its position and would retract draft laws if they provided due process and required mental treatment for the person temporarily losing his weapon. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On 20 January 2021, Alina Yarmowski, Press Secretary of Northam, sent us a list of states with high-risk laws signed by Republican governors or approved in the states where the House of Representatives controlled the two chambers of legislatures. We checked the list, and it stopped. Seven Republican governors signed high-risk bills: John Roland, Conn, 1999; Mitch Daniels, Ind, 2005; Rick Scott, Fla, 2018; Larry Hogan, Med, 2018; Phil Scott, F., 2018; Charlie Parker, Mass, 2018; Bruce Rawner, El, 2018, two Republican-controlled legislatures have passed these bills: India, 2005; Florida, 2015 Our Judgment, Northham, in urging the General Assembly to enact an extremely dangerous weapons law, he said: This idea has been endorsed by Republican legislatures in other states and signed by Republican Governors. Seven General Democratic Party Governors have signed legislation on high-risk firearms since 1995. This draft law has been adopted by two republican state legislatures since 2005. We also appreciate the ability of the truth to be completed.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01105"}
