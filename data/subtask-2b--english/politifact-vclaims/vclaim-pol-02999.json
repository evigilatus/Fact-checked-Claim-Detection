We thought this deserved a closer look.\nPunching bag city\nChicago was one of Donald Trump\u2019s favorite punching bags during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he repeatedly invoked the city\u2019s murder and gun-crime rate as a byproduct of everything from its gun laws to its leadership. After he was elected, he threatened to \"send in the feds\" to tamp down the city\u2019s crime.\nIf Chicago doesn't fix the horrible \"carnage\" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017\n\n\u00a0\nSessions\u2019 invocation of \"criminal aliens who prey on their own residents\" refers to a theme that has been prevalent in Trump\u2019s platform ever since the day he announced his candidacy with a speech highly disparaging of Mexican immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally. The central premise is that undocumented immigrants present an unusually high propensity for crime.\nOn Aug. 16, Sessions doubled down on the alleged link between Chicago\u2019s violent crime and its sanctuary city status in a speech in Miami, which dropped its sanctuary status to comply with the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration.\n\"Respect for the rule of law has broken down. In Chicago, their so-called \u2018sanctuary\u2019 policies are just one sad example,\" Sessions said. \"...We have already seen that: the same Independence Day weekend when Chicago suffered more than 100 shootings and 15 homicides, Miami-Dade also had an historic number of shooting deaths \u2013 zero.\"\nThe alleged link between illegal immigrants and surges in crime\u00a0is an idea that has been debunked repeatedly for decades in numerous academic, government and advocacy-group studies. So we started our look at Sessions\u2019 statement by contacting the Department of Justice with a request for data to back up his claim.\nThe response we got back was obtuse and weird. It came from a justice department press aide and was so loaded with swampy beltway caveats--\"deep background,\" \"background,\" \"not for attribution,\" and \"off the record\" -- that we consulted our dog-eared copy of \"All The President\u2019s Men\" for guidance. But to no avail.\nTo be clear, we never agreed to any preconditions in seeking official comment and feel under no obligation to abide by them. And we won\u2019t.\nSo what follows, in full, is the official DOJ response to our question. (Click here to view in pdf format.)\n\n\u00a0\nWhere to start? Perhaps with the link to the Washington Post story, which argues vigorously against the position taken by Sessions even while acknowledging that there\u2019s no way to be 100 percent sure there\u2019s no link between illegal immigration and Chicago\u2019s homicide rate.\nAt the same time, the article does state flatly, \"There\u2019s no link between a jurisdiction being a sanctuary city and higher crime rates.\"\nIt also cites a pair of statistics that would argue strongly against the DOJ\u2019s position. While 84 percent of Chicago\u2019s undocumented immigrants come from Latin America, 82 percent of its murder victims at the time of the article were black vs. only 4 percent Hispanic, the Post reports.\n\"FBI data show that most killings in the United States are carried out by people in the same racial group as the victim. The reason for this is obvious: Homicides are usually a function of personal relationships, and people generally associate with family members and friends who share their racial identity,\" the article states. It\u2019s not conclusive evidence that immigrants aren\u2019t driving up Chicago\u2019s homicide rate, it continues, but \"this isn\u2019t what we\u2019d expect the demographics to look like if Chicago\u2019s homicides were tightly intertwined with a population of immigrants who are in the country illegally from Latin America.\"\nDOJ also referred us to a 2016 study by the Murder Accountability Project, a non-profit group that tracks unsolved homicides and advocates for better crime reporting, that showed Illinois had the lowest homicide clearance rate in the nation. But the report attributes the state\u2019s poor showing to record-keeping methods used by the Illinois State Police in gathering crime data statewide.\nStill, the DOJ spokesman argues that combining those articles with Chicago\u2019s status as a sanctuary city -- in which police do not collect immigration information -- validates Sessions.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, however, has a simpler explanation.\n\"The vast majority of our issues in Chicago and our violent crime is committed by homegrown people - either individuals that were born and raised in Chicago or most certainly in this country,\" Johnson said in an NPR interview Aug. 7. \"So our instances of undocumented people committing horrific crimes and murder in particular in Chicago is just - it's nominal.\"\nAgainst those two articles stands a mountain of research that casts doubt on Sessions\u2019 assertion that illegal immigrants cause crime to rise and that Chicago\u2019s official police policy on immigrants endangers residents.\n\"Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates,\" said a 2015 report by the National Academy of Sciences.\nOne of the authors of that report explained why to PolitiFact in 2016:\nImmigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report\u2019s authors.\n\"They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police,\" he said in an email interview. \"This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence.\"\nCrime went down even as the immigrant population increased, the report said.\nThe NAS study reinforced the findings of a 2005 paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.\n\"Despite the widespread perception of a link between immigration and crime, immigrants have much lower institutionalization (incarceration) rates than the native born. More recently arrived immigrants have the lowest comparative incarceration rates, and this difference increased from 1980 to 2000,\" that report said.\nThese studies blow a big hole in Sessions\u2019 underlying assertion of \"criminal aliens\" being significantly responsible for the increase in gun violence in Chicago.\nSanctuary safety\nBut what about Sessions\u2019 allegation that Chicago\u2019s \"official policy\" protects \"criminal aliens?\"\nCPD\u2019s directive \"Responding to Incidents Involving Citizenship Status\" lays out the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for officers dealing with undocumented immigrants. Essentially, it prohibits officers from detaining anyone based on questions about citizenship status and sharply limits interaction with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. However, it also establishes exceptions for suspects with outstanding criminal warrants, who are known gang members or convicted felons or are on trial for a felony.\nThe city defended its policy in its lawsuit against the federal government: \"(T)his policy\npromotes public safety by ensuring that no city resident or visitor, regardless of immigration\nstatus, is afraid to cooperate with law enforcement, report criminal activity to the police, testify\nas a witness in court, or seek help as a victim of crime; and by ensuring that police officers focus on criminal activity occurring in Chicago instead of federal civil immigration infractions.\"\nA 2017 report by the National Immigration Law Center that focused specifically on counties that employed \"sanctuary city\" policies bolsters Chicago\u2019s case.\n\"Crime is statistically significantly lower in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary (sic) counties,\" the report said. \"The data support arguments made by law enforcement executives that communities are safer when law enforcement agencies do not become entangled in federal immigration enforcement efforts.\"\nThe problem for Chicago here is that, because its police department does not collect immigration data, the city can\u2019t unequivocally state that its murder or gun violence rates are not attributable to immigrants. The anecdotal evidence in Chicago\u2019s favor appears strong, but it\u2019s still anecdotal.\nOur ruling\nU.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions said Chicago\u2019s leaders \"have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents.\"\nChicago\u2019s Welcoming City Ordinance does prohibit Chicago police officers from using citizenship information as the sole grounds for detaining people and sharply limits the interaction between city police and federal immigration agents.\nBut evidence overwhelmingly suggests this is much less a matter of \"protecting criminal aliens\" than of fostering trust between local law enforcement and immigrant communities. Yet because Chicago does not collect immigration data in police interactions, it can\u2019t be known conclusively how many of its murders and gun crimes are committed by illegal immigrants \"who prey on their own residents.\"\nThat absence of conclusive data to disprove Sessions doesn\u2019t give him license to make claims that are groundless. Chicago\u2019s sanctuary city policy does not protect undocumented people who commit crimes, despite what Sessions claims. Only the \u00a0microscopic sliver of ambiguity about conclusive data prevents us from labeling his statement \"Pants on Fire,\" our lowest possible credibility rating.
