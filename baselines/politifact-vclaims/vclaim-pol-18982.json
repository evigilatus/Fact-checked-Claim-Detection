The IRS respects taxpayer privacy, and this suggestion is simply not true.\"\nIn 2018, the IRS was looking for ways to use social media platforms like Facebook to catch tax cheats, Quartz reported at the time.\u00a0 However, we found no evidence to support the claims that this challenge was planted by Facebook and the IRS or by a pedophile.\u00a0\n\"Historically,\" the New York Times reported in March, \"internet challenges have taken hold when people have some time on their hands to get creative \u2014\u00a0usually during the summer.\"\nIf evidence emerges that this first-born challenge is related to nefarious or IRS activity, we\u2019ll revisit this fact-check.
