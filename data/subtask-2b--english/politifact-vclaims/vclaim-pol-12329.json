Gov. David Dewhurst to the mythical chupacabra, saying his opponent -- the Republican frontrunner for the seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison after 2012 -- isn\u2019t engaging with his opponents. Specifically, the narrator says: \"Since he entered the race on July 21, Dewhurst has skipped nine candidate forums.\"\n\nNine skips in nine forums?\n\nCruz\u2019s campaign passed us a list of nine Senate candidate forums that took place from July 21 through Sept. 15, 2011, with contact information for each event\u2019s organizer. And in telephone interviews, forum organizers confirmed to us that Dewhurst did not appear at the gatherings.\n\nThe Cruz campaign did not list an Aug. 28 event near Sugar Land, organized on behalf of U.S. Rep. Pete Olson, R-Houston; both the Dewhurst and Olson campaigns confirmed that the lieutenant governor and other GOP Senate candidates attended and were given five minutes each to speak.\n\nThus, out of 10 forums between July 21 and Sept. 15, Dewhurst did not appear at nine.\n\nBut is not showing up the same as skipping? We wondered.\n\nThe organizers of seven forums told us Dewhurst\u2019s campaign told them beforehand that Dewhurst would not participate.\n\nExceptions: Marc Moffitt of the Denton County Republican Party said Dewhurst\u2019s camp said he couldn\u2019t come until after he declared his candidacy and then he announced his candidacy the same July night as the party\u2019s forum, meaning he wasn\u2019t even a candidate until then. And Toby Walker of the Waco Tea Party said she never heard from Dewhurst\u2019s camp about her invitations to its Aug. 13, 2011, event. Walker said: \"It\u2019s almost worse never to get a response. It\u2019s like you\u2019re not worthy.\"\n\nAmong other forum organizers, Dean Wright, who steered the July 30, 2011, Austin Tea Party forum, said the group set out a chair for Dewhurst in case he changed his mind. Robert \"Gonzo\" Gonzalez, overseeing an August forum for the Clear Lake Tea Party, said Dewhurst\u2019s camp told him it was \"early in the campaign (to attend); I accepted that.\" Capy Alexander of the Republican Women of Kerr County said Dewhurst\u2019s camp sounded interested in its Aug. 19, 2011, event, but \"as it turns out, he was unable to come. I don\u2019t know why.\"\n\nMost of the nine organizers told us they did not view Dewhurst\u2019s non-attendance as \"skipping.\" Maria Acosta of the Central Texas 9-12 Project said she would better describe its Aug. 20, 2011, gathering as a \"lost opportunity.\"\n\nHowever, Katrina Pierson of the Garland Tea Party said that even though Dewhurst\u2019s campaign said before its Sept. 15, 2011, event that Dewhurst had a prior commitment, she still views him as skipping out because the group initially told him about its plans in May.\n\nThe Dewhurst campaign responded by stating that Dewhurst was acting governor on six of the nine event dates listed by Cruz and had a previously scheduled Republican event on another.\n\nDewhurst himself, after he held an Austin town hall event Oct. 3, told us, \"There is a whole other dynamic that folks are forgetting. Every week now for six weeks in a row, and maybe for another 13, 14 or 15 months, I\u2019m the acting governor. ... I\u2019m having a hard enough time just to go out and do some of our campaign events when we have both paperwork, responsibilities -- when we had the Bastrop (wild)fire, I was over there almost the whole week, totally consumed by it. So state business for me comes first.\"\n\nOf the candidate forums, Dewhurst said: \"Quite frankly, I\u2019m interested in getting our message out to the people, not necessarily spending a disproportional amount of time (with) the candidates talking to each other. \u2026 What I think is in the voters\u2019 best interest is to hear from the candidates, and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re going to almost a different city every day.\"\n\nLooking forward, he said, that \"as we can, we\u2019re going to go to a forum or so every month.\" This month, he said, he plans to appear at an Oct. 21 candidate forum hosted by the Spirit of Freedom Republican Women PAC in Sugar Land.\n\nOur take: Dewhurst did not appear at nine forums, eight of them after the night he announced his candidacy. But it\u2019s a mite questionable to say he outright skipped the events. In most cases, his campaign said beforehand Dewhurst wasn\u2019t going to appear.\n\nWe rate Cruz\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.
