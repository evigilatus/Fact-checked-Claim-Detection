A jury found that under his leadership as CEO of Massey Energy, the company systematically refused to take steps that would have prevented a deadly combination of methane gas and coal dust that left 29 West Virginia miners dead in 2010.\nHe has always insisted that the fault lies with federal mining regulators who forced the company, he said, to use a defective ventilation system.\nNo investigation, and there have been several, has reached that conclusion.\n\"The mine operation, not MSHA, caused the explosion,\" said one independent report.\nMultiple inquiries found that Massey Energy knew there was risk that methane gas could build up in an active mining location\u00a0in the Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, W. Va. The company had also been warned that it needed to do more to\u00a0reduce the levels of combustible coal dust there. The company maintained two sets of records of conditions in the mine. The one it shared with government inspectors listed fewer problems than the one it kept for internal purposes.\u00a0In one tragic moment, dull blades used to cut free coal created enough heat to ignite\u00a0gas and\u00a0coal dust. The explosion that followed killed 29 people.\nBut Blankenship\u2019s ad presents a series of statements to suggest foul play by the government. After saying an internal report was fixed, the ad shows an image of an internal MHSA document that says \"MSHA was responsible for a defective ventilation plan at UBB.\"\n\nThe ad goes on to say \"documents were shredded,\" and that \"government corruption is pandemic.\"\nIf, as the ad says, the government\u2019s own documents prove that the internal review was \"fixed,\" then those documents ought to be available.\nGreg Thomas, spokesman for the Blankenship campaign, told us this ad, along with another, refers to internal government emails the campaign received \"in the last couple of weeks from a very reliable source.\"\n\"At this juncture, we\u2019re not going to release the emails,\" Thomas said.\nWhen we asked why the campaign wouldn\u2019t release the emails, Thomas at first said he didn\u2019t know, but later explained that \"we want everybody (in the government) to come out and stick to their story.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas said the emails might be shared at some point, and when they were, they would show how the government covered up its role in the mine disaster.\nA search of the government\u2019s internal report, an independent assessment of that report, and the West Virginia governor\u2019s independent panel investigation produced nothing to support Blankenship\u2019s statement.\nWe plugged the key quotes into the Nexis database of news reports. Again, nothing.\nDavitt McAteer, former head of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, led the special investigation team created by West Virginia\u2019s governor. McAteer told us that Blankenship is \"incorrect.\"\n\"I would have known whether the agency report was fixed,\" McAteer said. \"It was not.\"\nThe agency report criticized agency staff, saying they \"did not follow established Agency policies and procedures.\" Inspectors failed to spot deficiencies in some of the mine operations and didn\u2019t look closely enough at company records of problems that had gone uncorrected.\nMcAteer\u2019s group took a harder line on the Mine Safety and Health Administration.\n\"Despite MSHA\u2019s considerable authority and resources, its collective knowledge and experience, the disaster at the Upper Big Branch mine is proof positive that the agency failed its duty as the watchdog for coal miners,\" the report said.\nAnother review by the U.S. Labor Department, which oversees the mine safety agency, echoed that, saying \"if MSHA had engaged in timely enforcement of the Mine Act and applicable standards and regulations, it would have lessened the chances of -- and possibly could have prevented -- the UBB explosion.\"\nNone of this points to a whitewash of the government regulator\u2019s contributing role in the accident. However, every investigation put Massey Energy at the center of the conditions that produced the disaster.\n\"Massey, through its subsidiary Performance Coal Company, violated numerous, widely-recognized safety standards and failed to prevent or correct numerous hazards that ultimately caused the catastrophic explosion,\" the government\u2019s accident report said. \"The evidence accumulated during the investigation demonstrates that PCC/Massey promoted and enforced a workplace culture that valued production over safety, including practices calculated to allow it to conduct mining operations in violation of the law.\"\nOur ruling\nBlankenship produced an ad that said the Obama administration\u2019s internal review of the Mine Safety and Health Administration\u2019s role in a deadly mine explosion was \"fixed.\" The ad said the government\u2019s own documents revealed \"Obama\u2019s deadliest cover-up.\"\nBlankenship\u2019s spokesman claimed to have emails that proved the point, but said the campaign would not share them.\nAn extensive review of multiple government reports, plus a search through a database of thousands of news articles produced no supporting facts.\nThe head of an independent investigation said he had come across nothing that pointed to a fix. In fact, his group\u2019s report along with one other sharply criticized government regulators for failing to crack down on the abuses of Blankenship\u2019s company.\nThere is no substance to this claim and the campaign did not provide anything that would back it up. We rate it Pants on Fire.\nAdditional reporting by Ken Ward, Charleston Gazette-Mail\n Share the Facts 2017-12-11 23:16:59 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says \"Obama\u2019s deadliest cover-up (in an explosion that killed 29 miners) has been uncovered\" by internal government documents.
