Some of the demonstrations turned violent.\nThe post showed four images. Three depicted fire and violence in the streets \u2014 one labeled June, one July and one August; superimposed over each was a photo of Biden, with his eyes closed. A fourth image showed a tightly packed crowd and a superimposed photo of Biden, looking forward, with a quote: \"This violence is a threat and must end now.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\"He was asleep the whole time,\" reads the accompanying caption. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nDuring the attack on the Capitol, Biden called on Trump to go on national television \"and demand an end to this siege.\" \"This is not dissent, it\u2019s disorder, it\u2019s chaos.\" Biden said. \"It borders on sedition, and it must end. Now.\"\n\nBut Biden also spoke out a number of times when violence broke out during some Black Lives Matter protests.\nBiden denounced violence\u00a0\nOn May 30, Biden said in a statement about Floyd: \"Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It\u2019s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 20, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Exotic was pardoned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a campaign speech on June 2 about the Floyd protests, Biden said: \"There\u2019s no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches or destroying businesses.\"\nOn July 28, he said: \"I\u2019ve said from the outset of the recent protests that there is no place for violence or the destruction of property. Peaceful protesters should be protected \u2014 but arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted \u2014 and local law enforcement can do that.\"\nAfter protests in downtown Portland, Ore., for every night for nearly three months following Floyd\u2019s killing, Biden said Aug. 30 in a statement while campaigning: \"I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same.\"\nOn Aug. 26, in the wake of violence in Kenosha, Wis., following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, Biden said in a video: \"Burning down communities is not protest, it\u2019s needless violence \u2014 violence that endangers lives, violence that guts businesses, and shutters businesses that serve the community.
