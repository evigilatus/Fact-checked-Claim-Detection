On October 28, the majority leader of the Harry Reed Senate, D-Nev, wrote a fund-raiser for the Campaign for Progressive Change, claiming that \"the Republican House and the Senate can go beyond the closure of the government - they can waste months of our lives on isolation.\" In the South, the New York Times story indicated that the colour of change in the progressive civil rights group echoed similar sentiments in a racist letter to minority voters. The Organization had taken that feeling another step, saying that Republicans were actually moving towards isolation. \"Enough! The Republicans are targeting our children, quieting our voices and even trying to accuse our president, \"said a publication published by the group in Arkansas. The Executive Director of the Agenda for Change, Rashad Robinson, defended the publication in a statement to the Polyte Vac Foundation: \"The Republican leadership has shown an inability to contain the most enthusiastic wing of a party that can never accept the Black President's idea.\" The isolation card proved to be effective for the collection of democratic donations in the summer. But is it true that the Republicans are trying to accuse Obama? There are no formal efforts to isolate him and the possibilities of isolation, no matter what happens on Tuesday, are very, very weak. However, you can find examples of a number of Republicans talking about it anyway. There is a high barrier to isolation set out in the Constitution. It is defined as the act of accusing a non-military federal officer of \"treason, bribery, high crimes (or misdemeanours). The process must begin in the Chamber of Deputies with the materials of isolation, i.e., The allegations. Materials require a simple majority to pass. After the Chamber of Deputies votes to dismiss, the Senate will try the case, hear the testimony, examine the evidence, and then vote. The conviction, which leads to removal from office, requires the support of two thirds of the senators. The Council has started 60 indictments in its history, according to the Council's archives, although its President was dismissed only twice: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither of them was removed from office because their cases did not receive sufficient \"guilty\" votes to constitute two thirds of the senators. We have considered all draft laws of this Congress and we have found no member of the Council that has submitted legislation to initiate impeachment proceedings against Obama. It should be noted that since 2011, the Republicans have taken control of the house, which means that they have the figures to isolate Obama for three years, and no official effort has been shown. If they had tried to isolate, the Democrat-controlled Senate would not have voted to convict Obama. Even if the Republicans succeed in the election on Tuesday, the scariest expectations will make them far less than two thirds of the votes required in the Senate to remove Obama from office without democratic support. In order for isolation to be a real possibility, it needs the support of Republican leaders to consider isolation articles - but there is no such support. Neither the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Bohner, the leader of the minority in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, nor the President of the National Committee of the Republic, Raines Bribos, have called for isolation. Bohner was the most explicit against dismissal, probably because the process starts in his room. At a press conference on July 29, Bohner said the threat of isolation was a \"cam\" released by Democrats to rally their base. He said, \"We have no plans to isolate the president.\" \"We don't have future plans.\" On October 30, spokesman Kevin Smith Poletti Fuckett said, \"Boner took the isolation from the table. His position has not changed.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: 11 January 2021 (Bonner, however, began the process of prosecuting the President for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but those plans appear to have been postponed). Throughout June and July, there was another prominent institution of Republicans and potential presidential competitors in 2016, such as Cince. Rand Paul from Kentucky and Marco Rubio from Florida spoke against isolation. In some cases, Republicans seem to believe that dismissal may be counterproductive; it is widely believed that voters punished Republicans in the polls in the 1998 elections for isolating Clinton. In other cases, Republicans seem to reject the idea of isolation on the merits. Obama's actions, despite her dissatisfaction with the Republicans, did not amount to an insult that could be isolated - they did not \"upgrade to high crime and delinquency\" - Paul Ryan, R-Wis, said in an event of the Christian Science Observatory. The list of Republicans who warn of isolation procedures also includes some powerful conservatives, such as the Republic. Mo Brooks from Alabama and Raoul Laborador from Idaho -- who said that Republicans shouldn't even \"talk about isolation at this time.\" Republicans for dismissal doesn't mean that some Republicans didn't discuss dismissal. There are Republicans in strong red zones who say they prefer to be dismissed, and others say it has to be an option. We found about a dozen cases where legislators said they were willing to dismiss Obama. The reasons for the consideration ranged from the attack on an American consulate in Benghazi to the fear of unilateral executive action on immigration. In May 2013, R-Utah, R-Jesson Chavez, said the insulation was \"surely possible\" and was \"not removing it from the table.\" At about the same time, Mr. James Einhoff, R-Okla, who didn't insinuate to a great extent, said, \"People may start using the first word a very long time ago,\" while Deputy Michelle Bachman, R-Min, said, \"There is no weekend that no one has ever had to tell me, Michelle, what are you all waiting for in Congress? Why don't you accuse the president?\" Others are even more rude. The Republic of Kerry Bentivolio, R-Mich.; Steve Stockman, R-Texas; Paul Brown, R-Ga.; and Randy Webber, R-Texas, all said that Obama deserved to be isolated. Deputy Kenny Marchant, R. Texas, said that isolation might be necessary but should be considered for political purposes until after the November elections. The concept of isolation is often raised as a threat if Obama takes certain actions. For example, in July, the Republic warned Steve King, R-Iowa, \"If the President (takes further executive action on immigration), we should bring the dismissal sessions directly to the House of Representatives.\" In June, Sin Lindsay Graham R-S.C. warned that if Obama released prisoners from Guant\u00e1namo Bay, \"there would be people on our side calling for his isolation.\" These threats sometimes take the form of legislation. The Republic of Walter Jones, R-N.C., filed a decision when Obama weighed military action in Syria, which said if the president used military force without Congress's consent, :: Brooks of Alabama has drafted a bill that would make it possible to isolate the President from failure to prevent a financial deficit. :: During the 2014 campaign season, particularly in the competing Republican presidential elections, how a candidate was subjected to the issue of isolation has sometimes become a test for his good faith governors. Johnny Ernest, now a candidate for the senate in Iowa, was pressured to isolate during the candidates' forum in January, according to Yahoo! The news. Ernest said that Obama should face \"remediation\" for his vacation dates (which were later considered illegal) \"whether it was removed from his post, whether it was isolated.\" Similarly, Ryan Zenke, a Republican candidate for the Montana seat in the Grand House of Representatives, was pressured by one of the main opponents as to whether he would support isolation. Xinky said he would. So, is the disqualification on the cards? Let's hope we have the votes,\" he said. This is partly due to feelings among many of the Republican voters who have identified themselves, and who were ultimately in favour of isolation. According to a survey in July CNN, 57 percent of Republicans supported isolation. In total, 33 per cent of Americans prefer isolation, a figure consistent with the 1998 and 2006 polls when Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, respectively, had entered their second term of office for two years. The civil rights group courier said the Republicans are trying to accuse our president. No member of the current Congress has submitted legislation to convict Obama, and the leaders of the Republican Party have closed this possibility. Some Republicans and congressional candidates called for Obama's isolation. However, most of these speeches were isolated to a few party members and not to a loud chorus. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07049"}
