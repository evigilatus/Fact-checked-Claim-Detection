Pants on fire!", "text": "In an announcement made in the last weeks prior to special elections in the Ninth Congress Department of North Carolina, Republican Dan Bishop claimed that his opponent was Dan McCready Socialist. The announcement opens with confusion from video clips in which President Donald Trump says, \"Dan McCreedy... is an extremist liberal. He loves open borders, and he really likes socialism.\" The footage comes from a gathering in Greenville, NC, in July when Trump Bishop believed and attacked his opponent. Although the words come from Trump, the Bishop's campaign chose to use the claim in its declaration, so we evaluate the Bishop in this fact check. After that, the Declaration appears as McCreedy, together with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Belusi, C. Bernie Sanders, and the first student in the Alexandrian Republic, Okasio Cortez, while drones voted, \"Dan McCreedy, liberal, supported by extremists who want open borders and social medicine.\" The other Republicans filed similar charges about McCreedy, the Democratic candidate, for being a socialist, so we decided to check it out. We realize that this is a familiar page of Republican Playbook. Polyte Fact has explored numerous similar allegations concerning Barack Obama, Sun. Bill Nelson and three members of the Ohio Congressional delegation, among others. (In the case of Ohio's Democrats, not only socialists, but \"socialists with cards.\") All of these claims have been classified as firepants. So it's not surprising that Bishop's claim is ridiculously false. In fact, McCreedy is a business owner who proudly declares capitalist. (McCreedy) Keeps himself away from left-wing nationalist politicians under socialism, the government controls the means of production. However, McCready did not demand an end to the private sector. On the contrary, its clean energy investment company has begun to double its time capital. We called Bishop's campaign to find out what evidence she had from the social mcreedy and didn't get a reply. So we tried alone. We searched the McCready web site and its data and found no evidence to support the allegation contained in the Bishop Declaration. The National Republican Congress Committee suggested that McCreedy was a socialist in the May statement linking him to \"the ideas of his extremist party such as killing children, the socialist takeover of the entire economy with the new green deal and government-run social health care.\" Facebook published on January 23, 2021 in social media \"Baiden invested the entire family's wealth in Ukrainian gas and oil. Then closes the Keystone pipeline. This is a common tactic, as stated by Dr. J. Michael Pitzer, Professor of History and Politics at Katauba College. The Republicans often try to bring together local democratic candidates with more liberal national politicians to influence voters. \"First, she was connecting all the democratic candidates to Nancy Pelosi in 2018 to try to reduce their preferences. Then, with the president going after AOC and the band, guilt by association has become a standard slogan for Republican campaigns, \"He said Beatzer. In fact, experts say that McCreedy deliberately took himself away from the left-wing Democrats in Congress. One of Washington Post's articles records all the ways he's done: \"Nancy Belusi has pledged not to support the Speaker of the House. He opposed the dismissal. He returned a donation from the Republic, Elhan Omar, from Minnesota, after suggesting that the defenders of Israel were buying from Congress.\" McCready does not support open borders or social medicine. Trump recently replied that \"MacCreedy wants open borders, holy cities, and socialism.\" \u2219 (Politi Fuckett reviewed Trump's claim about McCreedy's immigration positions and assessed them mostly as false). The McCready political proposals are far from socialist. They often do not even reach the core democratic base. Dr. Susan Roberts, Professor of Political Science at Davidson College, said: \"There is some distance between McCreedy and the National Democratic Programme.\" \"He does not support medical care for all. It does not support the prohibition of offensive weapons.\" It has repeatedly rejected the New Green Accord and other policies adopted by many democratic presidential candidates. In an interview with CNN, McCready mocked Bishop's attacks. \"Unfortunately for him, he does not run against the socialist. He's running against a capitalist who built a job from scratch.\" Our ruling Bishop, Trump, and the National Reconciliation Council are trying to portray Democratic candidate McCready as a socialist, but there is simply no evidence to support their ridiculous accusation. McCready is a businessman who has benefited from capitalism and has even distanced himself from liberal Democrats. As election day approaches, we have to take a match with Truth or Meter.
