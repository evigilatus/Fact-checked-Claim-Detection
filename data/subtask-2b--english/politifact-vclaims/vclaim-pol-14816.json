Mark Homer", "text": "All wasn\u2019t back slaps and hugs at the Republican State Convention in Dallas last month. Party delegates switched to a new chairman in Houston lawyer Steve Munisteri. And a critic of House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio distributed a letter the morning of June 12 all but indicting Straus and his closest GOP House allies as dangerously beholden to Democrats. The letter from David Barton of Aledo, the state party\u2019s former vice chairman, lists nearly 20 indicators he says show Straus working against both conservative Republicans and the advancement of a conservative legislative agenda. Talk about a Truth-O-Meter dream. If every politico issued such missives, we\u2019d postpone vacations, double up staff, contemplate a reality show. But we digress\u2014and are reviewing just a handful of Barton\u2019s statements, starting with this: \u201cStraus Republican lieutenants Charlie Geren, Jim Keffer, and Byron Cook aired radio ads supporting Democrat Mark Homer over conservative Republican Kirby Hollingsworth, helping the Democrat to a narrow win.\u201d Background: Barton\u2019s statement refers to three GOP House members endorsing an East Texas Democratic incumbent facing a Republican foe. Homer, of Paris, prevailed with 52 percent of the 2008 vote, according to the Texas secretary of state. To our request for back-up information, Barton passed along a copy of a newspaper ad with pro-Homer quotations from the cited GOP House members plus audio of a radio ad narrated by then-Rep. Brian McCall, a Plano Republican recently appointed chancellor of the Texas State University System. The newspaper ad, headlined \u201cRepublican Representatives Endorse Mark Homer,\u201d quotes Geren, R-Fort Worth, saying Homer \u201cworks with everybody to bridge divides;\u201d Cook, R-Corsicana, calling Homer a \u201cproblem solver;\u201d McCall rating Homer \u201cone of the best\u201d and Rep. Tommy Merritt, R-Longview, saying: \u201cThe only team Mark is on is yours.\u201d The radio spot features McCall saying: \u201cDuring campaigns you hear a lot of talk about breaking gridlock. Candidates all talk about it. Some even mean it. Mark Homer has done it. Mark works with everybody, Republicans, Democrats, doesn\u2019t matter. He works for you...\u201d McCall then identifies himself as a Republican House member and says he\u2019s joined by Keffer, Cook, Geren and Merritt \u201curging you to re-elect\u201d Homer. \u201cMark bridges divides, he looks for common ground, creates solutions,\u201d McCall says in the ad. \u201c...So this time, send a problem solver back to Austin. The only team he\u2019s on is yours.\u201d That certainly sounds like several House Republicans touting a Democratic colleague. Anything askew in Barton\u2019s recap? When we reached them, Homer, McCall and Keffer each confirmed the Republicans pitched in after Homer asked for help, though each man bridled at parts of Barton\u2019s description. For starters, Homer said, his 1,899-vote win was not the squeaker Barton suggests. \u201cFor him to call it narrow is stretching it,\u201d he said. Also, he said, the Republicans didn\u2019t air the radio ad, or pay for it, as Barton\u2019s letter says. Instead, Homer said, his campaign wrote the script, which each Republican approved. Homer said his campaign also bought air time. And was the ad a difference-maker, as Barton suggests? We don\u2019t know how to gauge that. Homer said: \u201cIt certainly contributed... If I didn\u2019t have it, could I have won? I feel strongly I could have won. But it was nice to have it.\u201d Homer said he\u2019s lined up similar commitments from Republicans this year. Like who? \u201cI am not ready to say,\u201d Homer said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say yes (about who\u2019s endorsing me) and if it doesn\u2019t work out for some reason, I don\u2019t want that to become a campaign issue.\u201d Keffer noted that Homer was vice chair of a House committee that Keffer chaired. He said of his endorsement: \u201cWe are not so polarized and partisan (in the House) that we can\u2019t look at good members on either side of the aisle . . . I am not afraid to do that. We need the best people we can get down in Austin.\u201d McCall questioned the part of Barton\u2019s statement calling Homer\u2019s GOP helpers lieutenants of Speaker Straus. At the time of the 2008 election, McCall pointed out, Straus wasn\u2019t yet the House speaker; he didn\u2019t launch his unexpected candidacy for the post until later. McCall said he doesn\u2019t know if Straus knew about the pro-Homer ad.Upshot: The radio spot wasn\u2019t aired by the Republicans, as Barton puts it, and only one Republican voice -- McCall\u2019s -- was heard. Also, Straus wasn\u2019t House speaker when the ad aired in 2008, so he had no \u201clieutenants.\u201dBut the GOP members Barton named have proven to be Straus allies. And they earlier joined hands in a radio ad for Homer, their Democratic colleague. Barton\u2019s statement is Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14816"}
