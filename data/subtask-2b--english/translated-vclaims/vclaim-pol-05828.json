While O'Malley Clinton was accused of volatility around a variety of issues close to the hearts of the progressives, he said that she had not broken ties with Wall Street, a New York-based state that she represented in the Senate. O'Malley said Clinton didn't have \"independence\" to protect the main street from major bank abuses. \"There were so many things that they changed the right attitudes before the debate... whether it was the Trans-Pacific Partnership or whether it was Keystone,\" said O'Malley in October 19. \"But she couldn't say that we needed to separate commercial banks from speculative banks, that is, rebooting Glass Stigall, because she couldn't.\" We decided to take a closer look at O'Malley's claim that Clinton \"cannot say that we need to separate commercial banks from speculative banks, that is, rebooting Glass Stigall.\" First, the update of the Glass-Steagall Act: it was promulgated following the Great Depression to keep commercial and investment banks separate, as a means of protecting the wider economy from the downside of speculation. As noted in an earlier examination of the facts, the law has been repealed over the years, until President Bill Clinton completely repealed the law in 1999. Since the recent financial crisis, the restraint of large banks and other financial institutions has been a call for a rally for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. But is it true that Clinton does not say that weeping? At the outset, the Clinton official plan for Wall Street reform does not include the rebooting of glass-stigall or the reintroduction of its provisions. Based on her recent comments, as reported in the O'Malley and Clinton camps, she believes that the recovery of Glass Stigall is the red herring. The following are some examples: 23 July on a campaign occasion in South Carolina: when asked why its economic policy does not include the re-establishment of Glass-Steagall, Clinton replied: \"This is a more complex issue than referring to any single legislation and saying if we succeed, everything will be fine. Our first objective must be the full and effective implementation of Dodd Frank,\" referring to the historic law signed by President Barack Obama, which established a consumer protection agency and imposed regulations on financial institutions. \u2022 29 September in an interview with Lena Dunham's actress and writer: \"Some people say that all we have to do is dismantle banks. The problem is that banks did their fair share of problems, but a lot of problems weren't from these traditional banks. They were from a so-called shadow banking world. So I think we should be more inclusive. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman on January 11, 2021 - October 6, in the first democratic initial discussion: \"Well, my plan is more comprehensive (than the rebooting of Glass-Stigall). And frankly, it's hard because of course we have to deal with the problem that banks are still too big to fail.\" \u2022 8 October in Bloomberg column: a serious approach being advocated is the enactment of an updated Glass-Stigall Act, separating commercial and investment banking, in order to reduce the size of banks and the risk of saving taxpayers. I certainly share the goal of not having to save big banks again, but I prefer the way to deal with the most serious risks in a different way.\" \u2022 16 October in a municipal hall in Kane, N.H.: \"I fully respect my colleagues who have said let's get Glass-Stigall back. And if I think that alone will prevent the next potential crisis, I'd like to raise my hand and join, but that's not my assessment. Glass Stigall wouldn't have done anything about it if he were returned tomorrow. In short, Clinton revolved around the case. She had expressed doubts that reimposed Glass-Stigal, or something close to it, would solve problems arising from financial regulation. However, it argues that addressing the problem differently - for example, by imposing \"risk charges\" on financial institutions with assets of more than $50 billion, and regulations for the \"invisible banks\" sector (i.e., the \"invisible banks\" sector). Precautionary funds (and guidelines for the prosecution of financial irregularities) would in fact be a more effective response. Our government said O'Malley that Clinton \"can't make itself say that we need to separate commercial banks and speculation, that is, reboot Glass-Steagall.\" The Clinton Wall Street Reform Plan does not indicate that it will reintroduce Glass-Stegal, and has repeatedly underestimated the idea that it should be revived. However, Clinton argues that its alternative course would be more comprehensive and effective than simply re-establishing the old law. That an O'Malley claim is accurate, but it needs an additional context, so we often evaluate it correctly.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05828"}
