In 2001, Texas lawmakers passed (almost unanimously) and Gov. Rick Perry signed into law a measure allowing certain immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children to attend state colleges and universities at the tuition rates charged to legal in-state residents.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez, a Fort Worth native and Mexican-U.S. studies professor who was tapped in 2001 to be Mexico\u2019s special adviser on migrant affairs, said he was among many who supported the legislation.\n\nThough sometimes called the \"Texas Dream Act,\" the law is much narrower in scope than the national DREAM Act proposed in various forms since 2001.\n\nThe federal Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, said a June 22, 2012, PolitiFact story, also pertains to certain children brought to the United States illegally by parents or relatives. But the national legislation would create a new way to give those immigrants legal status and avoid deportation, if they have stayed out of trouble and were in school or the military.\n\nState law does not (and cannot) change their legal status. Texas\u2019 law only requires that the students sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they're able to do so.\n\nTwelve other states have tuition laws like Texas\u2019, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures website, enacted in the wake of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act.\n\nOne provision in the act sought to prevent states from giving a tuition benefit to illegal immigrants that is not available to all legal U.S. residents -- that is, legal residents of other states, who pay a higher \"out-of-state\" rate. But the language was unclear, the NCSL site said, and \"there is no guidance in congressional report language or in federal regulations.\"\n\nSome states reacted by passing laws to allow the tuition benefit for certain illegal immigrants -- typically those who had attended high school in the state and intended to apply for citizenship. Other states, the NCSL site said, passed legislation banning illegal immigrants from getting in-state tuition rates.\n\nBoth types of law have been challenged in court. The national DREAM Act includes language to repeal the murky federal provision.\n\nWas Texas first to put the tuition benefit into law?\n\nYes. \"In June 2001, Texas (HB 1403) was the first state to pass legislation allowing in-state tuition for immigrant students,\" says the NCSL site in a report updated Nov. 28, 2012.\n\nNext, it says, were California, Utah and New York in 2001-02; Washington and Illinois in 2003; Kansas in 2004; New Mexico in 2005; Nebraska in 2006; Wisconsin in 2009; Maryland and Connecticut in 2011. Oklahoma granted the benefit in 2004, then rescinded it in 2008.\n\nTexas barely edged out California, though. According to California\u2019s legislative information site, Assembly Bill 540 was approved by both Senate and Assembly on Sept. 14, 2001, then signed by Gov. Gray Davis on Oct. 12, 2001.\n\nTexas House and Senate journals for the 2001 session show that versions of House Bill 1403 cleared House and Senate education panels with no opposition. The House passed the measure 142-1 on April 23, 2001; the Senate amended it, then approved it 27-3 on May 21, 2001.\n\nThree days later, the House approved the Senate's changes 130-2. Perry signed the measure into law June 16, 2001.\n\nWas this state law a \"Dream Act,\" even though it could not change students\u2019 legal status?\n\nPerry spoke of the \"Texas dream\" in a speech soon after he signed the law, telling the Southwest Voters Registration Education Project that he approved it \"so that young Texans who graduated from our public schools, regardless of their immigration status, will be able to pay in\u2011state tuition and take part in the Texas dream. We want bright, new Texans to stay here, and contribute great things to our future.\"\n\nA Nov. 15, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news story said the Texas law is \"commonly referred to as the Texas Dream Act.\"\n\nWe trawled through more news stories on Nexis.com, where the first such reference we spotted was a 2004 description of \"Texas\u2019 Dream Act.\" Thereafter, we found many in other states, usually referring to similar in-state tuition proposals.\n\nIn California and New York, however, stories from 2007 through 2011 reserved the term for legislation going further than the tuition laws already on those states\u2019 books -- granting eligibility for financial aid or drivers\u2019 licenses, for example.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez agreed the Texas law is not equivalent to the national legislation. When he was helping advocate the state law, he told us, \"we didn\u2019t call it the Dream Act.\" \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there is common ground, he said. \"We\u2019re talking about the same kids, and we\u2019re talking about finding ways to live a life in this nation,\" he said. \"I think that\u2019s why many of us say it\u2019s a type of Dream Act.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nHern\u00e1ndez said Texas was the first to pass a state DREAM Act.\n\nTexas was the first state to permit in-state tuition for certain children in the country illegally. But like other states\u2019 laws, its measure did not -- could not -- go as far as federal versions offering a possible path to citizenship. The state laws are not DREAM acts.
