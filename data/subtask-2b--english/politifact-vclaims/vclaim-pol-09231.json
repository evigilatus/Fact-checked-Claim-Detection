Political director Phillip Martin told us by email that the statement was based on a May 12, 2013, Washington Post news story about a leaked report from the U.S. Treasury inspector general that the government released two days later.\n\nThe Post story said that according to the report, \"Of the 298 groups selected for special scrutiny ... 72 had \u2018tea party\u2019 in their title, 13 had \u2018patriot\u2019 and 11 had \u20189/12.\u2019 \" That equaled 96 groups, Martin said, or 32.2 percent of the declared 298.\n\nWere the other 202 groups nonconservative? Neither the report nor the story described those groups, and Progress Texas did not reply to our follow-up requests for relevant information.\n\nThe IRS said in a May 15, 2013, press release that the groups without \"tea party\" in their names \"included organizations of all political views.\"\n\nPrecisely what happened from May 2010 through May 2012 at the agency\u2019s Cincinnati, Ohio, office, where all such tax-exemption applications are processed, has not become clear.\n\nBut according to the inspector general\u2019s report, IRS workers were instructed to look for indications of applicants\u2019 political views and activities, including some broad descriptions but also others aimed at conservatives.\n\nFor instance, the report says staffers were asked to flag groups educating Americans about the Constitution, which is a stated goal of the 9/12 Project, an activist organization founded by conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, the IRS criteria included:\n\n\n\"Political-sounding\" names such as \u2018We the People\u2019 or \u2018Take Back the Country\u2019 \"\n\n\"Issues include government spending, government debt or taxes\"\n\n\"Education of the public by advocacy/lobbying to \u2018make America a better place to live\u2019 \"\n\n\"Statement in the case file criticize(s) how the country is being run\"\n\n\"Political, lobbying, or [general] advocacy\" activities\n\nInvolved in \"limiting/expanding government, educating on the Constitution and Bill of Rights, social economic reform/movement\"\n\n\"Indicators of significant amounts of political campaign intervention\"\n\n\nIn U.S. House hearings May 17 and 22, 2013, lawmakers questioned acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller and the Treasury\u2019s inspector general, J. Russell George, about the 202 unlabeled groups.\n\nOn May 22, Miller said that \"202 non-Tea Party cases... were reviewed for indications of significant political campaign intervention, which was our key criteria,\" helping to determine whether a group\u2019s activities affected its eligibility for the 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) designations. \"We did not evaluate whether or not they were conservative groups, or -- or progressive groups, or liberal groups, or whatever term you want to use,\" Miller said.\n\nAsked May 17 whether liberal buzz words such as \"progressive\" or \"organizing\" also were used to identify groups for scrutiny, Miller said they were not.\n\nIRS employees, Miller said May 17, were grouping similar applications together for efficiency. The method they used, he said, \"while intolerable, was a mistake and not an act of partisanship.\"\n\nGeorge said his report did not break out the political makeup of the 202 groups because it looked only at the names of the organizations: \"Certain names were so generic that we were unable to determine whether or not they had a particular point of view.\"\n\nA full breakdown of the scrutinized groups, or even types of groups, might not surface. On May 20, 2013, Senate Finance Committee leaders asked the IRS for information including the names of the 298 targeted groups; they had not received the names as of June 6, 2013, committee spokeswoman Julia Lawless told us via email.\n\nOur ruling\n\nProgress Texas has twice said that two-thirds of the groups whose applications for tax-exempt status were scrutinized by the IRS were not conservative.\n\nThe group\u2019s fraction appears to be an unsupported assumption tied to a government report saying that 96 of 298 IRS-scrutinized organizations, or about a third, had \"tea party,\" \"patriot\" or \"9/12\" in their names. The report listed other criteria the IRS used, some of which appeared to be aimed at conservatives.\n\nBut the report has no information on the political makeup of the other groups, and we see no other indications that their political leanings have been authoritatively summed up or individually revealed, though the IRS has said the scrutinized groups without \"tea party\" in their names reflected \"all political views,\" which presumably would fold in liberals to moderates to conservatives.\n\nProgress Texas\u2019 claim shakes out as incorrect and, given the lack of backup documentation, ridiculous.
