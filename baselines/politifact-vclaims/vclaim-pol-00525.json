We found similar results searching for an abbreviated version of the quote.\nNext we searched the Nexis database for the quote in all available English-language publications and found nothing. Searching for \"John Wayne\" and \"American flag\" and \"town square,\" we couldn\u2019t find the quote or anything similar, though a 2003 story about rural Texas auctions in the Los Angeles Times quotes a man who wants a full-sized American flag emblazoned with Wayne\u2019s image.\nWe\u2019ll reconsider this fact-check if a source for this statement surfaces.
