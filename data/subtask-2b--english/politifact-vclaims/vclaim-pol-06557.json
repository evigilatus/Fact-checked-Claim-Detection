After all, the office of chief justice is never on the ballot.\nCurrently, the justice who has served longest on the high court is automatically made chief, and remains in that role as long as he or she is on the court. That process has been in place since an amendment was made to the state constitution in 1889.\nWith the referendum, voters decide to keep the seniority system, or instead have the justices choose a chief from among themselves, every two years.\nThe liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee, through a group it created called Make Your Vote Count, released a radio ad on March 30, 2015 that urges a vote against the change. The ad is narrated by Janine Geske, a Marquette University law professor who served on the high court from 1993 to 1998.\n\"For 125 years, it's been the votes of the people of Wisconsin determining who serves as chief justice. After all, it\u2019s the people of Wisconsin who elect the Supreme Court,\" Geske says at the start.\nShe adds near the end: \"Our democracy and your vote are threatened by a referendum April 7th that takes the choice of chief justice away from the people.\"\nSo, is the Greater Wisconsin Committee right -- would the referendum take \"the choice of chief justice\" of the Supreme Court \"away from the people,\" when the voters don\u2019t directly elect a chief justice?\nPolitical backdrop\nThe state high court has seven justices. Voters elect them to 10-year terms in non-partisan spring elections. (Justice Ann Walsh Bradley is running for re-election against Rock County Circuit Judge James Daley on April 7.) Sometimes, a justice gets on the court by being appointed by the governor to fill a vacancy, but then he or she must run for election.\nOn the surface, the referendum would merely change the process for deciding which justice has administrative control of the court. But if it passes, it would also have, as the radio ad notes and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported, political implications. The conservative majority on the court likely would replace Shirley Abrahamson, the court\u2019s leading liberal, as chief justice.\nReferendum\nSo, do the voters choose the chief justice? Abrahamson\u2019s example helps sort it out -- though it's important to note she is an exception, having been a member of the Wisconsin Supreme Court longer than anyone.\nAbrahamson was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1976, then won election in 1979 and was re-elected in 1989. She ascended to chief in 1996 when she became the court\u2019s most senior member. When voters subsequently re-elected Abrahamson to the court in 1999 and 2009, they ensured that, as the longest-tenured justice, she would remain the chief.\nThe Greater Wisconsin Committee argues that the voters who re-elected Abrahamson wanted her to remain as chief justice.\nBut there's no way to know how many felt that way, since there was no actual vote on who would be chief. Some voters might have simply favored Abrahamson over her election opponent for a seat on the court, but may not necessarily have wanted her to be chief justice.\nIt's also worth noting that Abrahamson aside, under the current system, voters often don't get to vote for, or against, a sitting chief justice. Here\u2019s a look at the chief justices going back for two decades before Abrahamson became chief, based on \"Portraits of Justice,\" a book published by the Wisconsin Historical Society Press.\n\n\n\n\nChief Justice\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime on Supreme Court as chief justice\n\n\nNumber of times sought re-election while chief\n\n\n\n\nRoland Day\n\n\n1995-1996\n\n\n0; retired from court in 1996\n\n\n\n\nNathan Heffernan\n\n\n1983-1995\n\n\n1; retired from court in 1995\n\n\n\n\nBruce Beilfuss\n\n\n1976-1983\n\n\n0; retired from court in 1983\n\n\n\n\nHorace Wilkie\n\n\n1974-1976\n\n\n0; died in 1976\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo that history undermines the idea that voters get much of a say in terms of who is chief justice. Given her longevity, some 19 years as chief, Abrahamson is an unusual case.\nOur rating\nThe Greater Wisconsin Committee said an April 7, 2015 referendum would take \"the choice of chief justice\" of the Wisconsin Supreme Court \"away from the people.\"\nVoters elect the Supreme Court justices, but they don\u2019t get to vote for chief justice. Currently, the justice who has served longest is automatically made chief justice. If the chief comes up for re-election for a seat on the court, voters can, in effect, make that person the chief for 10 more years by re-electing him or her to a new 10-year term.\nHowever, often voters never get such an opportunity. A justice becomes chief by virtue of seniority, but may then leave the court altogether before facing re-election, as has occurred several times in recent history prior to Abrahamson.\nFor a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06557"}
