Ron Johnson says deficits under Obama total $5.3 trillion, compared with $2 trillion under Bush", "text": "Remember those nerdy\u00a0charts that Ross Perot flashed during his third-party run for president in 1992?\n\nThe Texas billionaire\u2019s visual aids warned of the perils of America\u2019s mounting government debt.\n\nTwenty years later, Wisconsin\u2019s junior U.S. Senator, Republican Ron Johnson, is taking a page from Perot as he acts as a surrogate for Mitt Romney and advocates for a spending slowdown.\n\nExplaining one of his digital charts during a Sept. 11, 2012 campaign stop in Sheboygan, Johnson ripped Obama for saying his administration\u2019s proposed \"Buffett rule\"\u00a0 tax plan for million-dollar earners would \"stabilize our debt and deficits for the next decade.\"\n\n\"I haven\u2019t yet publicly called President Obama a liar,\" Johnson told his audience. \"But I\u2019m saying he lies. Slight diplomatic difference.\"\n\nJohnson said the \"Buffett rule\" would raise just $5 billion a year. He\u2019s right, as PolitiFact Ohio found in rating True a claim by Sen. Rob Portman that it would \"bring in less than $5 billion per year. ... Enough to pay one week\u2019s interest on the national debt.\"\n\nJohnson\u2019s presentation uses a chart to contrast the \"Buffett Rule\u2019s\" revenue potential to the deficits accumulated under Obama (2009-2012) and over the two terms of his predecessor, Republican George W. Bush (2001-2008).\n\nThe chart shows deficits totalling $2 trillion in eight years under Bush, and $5.3 trillion under Obama in just four years. A caption on the chart says those deficits \"exploded during the Obama administration.\"\n\nIs Johnson right on the deficit numbers and their rapid growth?\n\nAs backup, Johnson\u2019s campaign cited numbers from the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget.\n\nThe figures show red-ink budgets in seven of eight years that coincide with Bush\u2019s term. The annual deficits totalled $820 billion in his first term and nearly $1.2 trillion in his second.\n\nAdd them up and there\u2019s the $2 trillion figure cited by Johnson.\n\nThat same White House table shows four years of deficits for 2009-\u201912, the time frame that coincides with the Obama era, ranging from $1.29 trillion to $1.4 trillion. The total, including estimated figures for 2012, is $5.33 trillion.\n\nThat\u2019s nearly triple the Bush deficit figure, in half the time.\n\nIt seems simple, with the numbers and the trend matching up with Perot\u2019s, er, Johnson\u2019s chart.\n\nWe wish it were that simple.\n\nBut there is considerable disagreement in academic and political circles over how to assign responsibility to presidents for spending and deficits.\n\nUsing the same table and a slightly different approach can put a somewhat different spin on the trend line -- though we found no scenario under which the Bush-era deficits top those under Obama.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nThe big question any researcher faces is when to start and end the clock when looking at spending and deficit by presidents.\n\nIt would be tidy to start the clock on Inauguration Day, but the federal budget year begins Oct. 1. That means an incoming president inherits a budget-in-progress from his predecessor, though he often makes changes.\n\nThat timing mismatch makes a pretty big difference, for example, in pinning deficit numbers on Bush and Obama.\n\nTo wit: Democrat Bill Clinton\u2019s last budget, for fiscal 2001, resulted in a surplus of $128 billion -- the last black-ink budget on record. But Johnson attributed that surplus to Bush, who entered office Jan. 20, 2001. Johnson argues that once elected the budget can be changed by the new president.\n\nSimilarly, on the back end of the Bush years, Johnson gives the eye-popping 2009 deficit of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $1.4 trillion all to Obama -- even though Obama was working with Bush\u2019s last budget, which took effect in October 2008, during the final months of Bush\u2019s second term.\n\nThat methodology becomes even more important when you consider that just before Bush left office, the deficit for fiscal year 2009 already was projected to be $1.2 trillion, according to the scorekeeping agency for Congress, as reported by PolitiFact.\n\nSo, Johnson attributes the 2009 deficit entirely to Obama even though much it was already anticipated before the Democrat\u2019s inauguration. (By the end of the 2009 fiscal year, the deficit rose to $1.4 trillion in part due to Obama\u2019s economic stimulus plan).\n\nWhat about Johnson\u2019s methodology?\n\nWe asked three experts who closely follow the budget, and each said there is no consensus on how to attribute the overlapping budget years.\n\nSteve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said apportioning responsibility is \"really tricky.\"\n\n\"Looking at what has happened -- budget deficit-wise -- during the Bush and the Obama presidencies doesn\u2019t tell the whole picture because of the differences of the fiscal year and impacts of policies that were enacted prior to either of them assuming office,\" Ellis wrote in an email.\n\nStill, Ellis said he considered Johnson\u2019s numbers correct even if the presentation was simplistic.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there are some extra complicating factors unique to the Bush-Obama changeover, such as how best to parcel out the deficit blame for such things as Bush\u2019s major tax cuts and Obama\u2019s more modest tax trims, two wars that overlap their presidencies, two recessions, a Wall Street bailout that each supported, and major new programs under each (Medicare prescription drugs, stimulus).\n\nThe Great Recession of 2007-2009, which fueled deficits when tax collections fell, also overlapped the two presidencies.\n\nJason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Johnson\u2019s numbers were defensible. He suggested looking at the increase in debt -- as opposed to deficits -- because it can be tracked to the day a president starts and ends a term.\n\nBy that measure, we found a $4.9 trillion increase in gross public debt in Bush\u2019s two terms vs. $5.4 trillion so far in Obama\u2019s single term.\n\nGary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said \"there is no good answer to your question that is going to satisfy everyone.\"\n\nOur rating\n\nJohnson\u2019s chart showed $2 trillion in deficits under Bush and $5.3 trillion under Obama, and concluded that deficits \"exploded\" during the Obama administration.\n\nThe numbers check out, but comparing presidents\u2019 budget records is not as simple as Johnson\u2019s chart suggests. For instance, Bush owns some debatable piece of the Obama deficits.\n\nWe rate Johnson\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10295"}
