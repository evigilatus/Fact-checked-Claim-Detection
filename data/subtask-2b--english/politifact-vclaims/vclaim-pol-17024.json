While they are both married to immigrants,\" said the April 23 Facebook post.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nFirst lady Melania Trump was born in Slovenia. Elaine Chao, who serves as U.S. Secretary of Transportation and is married to McConnell, was born in Taiwan. So the part of the claim about Trump and McConnell being married to immigrants is correct.\u00a0\nWhat about the claim that they are \"blocking\" stimulus checks for Americans married to immigrants? The $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was signed into law by Trump on March 27. But it did not become law against Democratic wishes. The bill passed unanimously in the Senate and only three House Democrats opposed it.\nUnder the CARES Act, eligible people who filed tax returns for 2018 or 2019 and earned up to $75,000 are set to receive $1,200; married couples who jointly earned up to $150,000 are expected to get $2,400. Eligible tax filers with dependent children under 17 years old are expected to get $500 per qualifying child.\nIndividuals and couples who earned more than the $75,000 and $150,000 thresholds \u2014 but not more than $99,000 or $198,000 \u2014 will get some aid, but not as much as those who earned less.\nWhat about Americans married to immigrants?\nThe Facebook post gives the misleading impression that all Americans married to immigrants won\u2019t get a check. That\u2019s not the case.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. citizens are ineligible for a stimulus check if they filed a joint tax return with a spouse who used an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. There is an exception to that rule: If either spouse is a member of the U.S. military at any time during the taxable year, then only one spouse needs to have a valid Social Security number.\nAmericans and immigrant spouses who filed a tax return both using a Social Security number are eligible for the stimulus check (if they meet the income criteria).\nBeing married to someone who has an ITIN instead of a Social Security number is not a disqualifying element by itself, either. If the couple filed their taxes separately, then whoever filed using a Social Security number is eligible for the check.\nITINs are issued by the IRS for tax purposes, so that foreign nationals and other individuals who don\u2019t have a Social Security number can use it to pay income taxes. Some immigrants in the country illegally pay taxes using an ITIN.\nAbout 1.8 million spouses who are either U.S. citizens or green-card holders will be excluded from the stimulus payments, according to estimates from the Migration Policy Institute.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said, \"Trump and McConnell are blocking stimulus checks for Americans married to immigrants.\"\nThe post wrongly makes it seem as if the law providing the stimulus payment was a doing only of Republicans. The CARES Act passed with bipartisan support.\nNot all Americans married to immigrants are barred from getting a stimulus check. That applies to couples that filed a joint tax return, one using a Social Security number and the other using an ITIN. That exempts military families.\nIf a couple files tax returns separately, the spouse who filed with a Social Security number is eligible for the payment.\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
