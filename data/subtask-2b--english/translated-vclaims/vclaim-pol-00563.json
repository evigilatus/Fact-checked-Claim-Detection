Michael Bennett of Colorado, who is running for President, said in the CNN City Hall on May 30 that the public perception was in line with that consensus. \"The vast majority of Americans believe that climate change is real and we need to do something about it,\" he said. We looked into this allegation and found that Bennett, who recently developed a 2020 plan to address climate change, is right that most Americans say that climate change is happening. However, opinion polls indicate that public opinion shows less conviction when asked whether the Government should address this issue, although much seems to depend on how questions are asked. Let's take a look. The general views on the Bennett Climate Change Plan, released in May, include a United States target of achieving net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Bennett based his claim on the policy and global warming report published in April by the Yale Climate Change Communication Programme and the Climate Change Communication Centre of George Mason University. The Yale University and the World Mothers &apos; Federation programmes use social sciences to help communicate climate change to the public. According to the report, 70% of registered voters in the United States said global warming was happening. The majority support \"hard\" or \"to some extent\" investments in renewable energy research and infrastructure (87 per cent), pollution regulation (82 per cent) and/or pollution taxation (72 per cent). Furthermore, approximately four out of ten voters said that the candidate &apos; s position on global warming would be very important when deciding who to vote for in the 2020 presidential election. We looked at other surveys on climate change and found that responses differ about whether Americans believe climate change is real or not. One way to analyse the first part of the Bennett statement is to examine the views of Americans on the timetable for the effects of global warming. According to an opinion poll conducted in Gallup in March, 59 per cent of Americans said that the effects of global warming had already begun and 66 per cent believed that the main cause was pollution from human activities. The percentage of people surveyed who believe that the effects of global warming are already taking place has fluctuated over the years, but has risen steadily from 49 per cent in 2011 to 52 per cent in 2012 to what we are today. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the US Navy commander, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security purposes, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, Gallup noticed differences in how Americans view the issue based on their political preferences. Of those who described themselves as conservative, only 25 per cent were classified as relevant believers, compared with 81 per cent of liberals and 56 per cent of moderates. So, did you also point out the point when he says that most Americans are in favour of doing something about climate change? The results are mixed. A 2018 survey at the University of Kuenyebek found that the majority of American voters, 69 per cent, are \"something\" or \"very\" interested in climate change. However, a survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre in January found that only 44 per cent of Americans said that global climate change should be a top priority for President Donald Trump and Congress. This number was low in a list of 18 priority cases by the adults surveyed. However, the environment, classified as a separate issue, was in number 1. Behind the economy, health care, education, terrorism, social security, medical care, the poor and the needy. An opinion poll conducted last year found that 62% of Americans believe that the U.S. government does not do much to protect the environment. The majority of Americans support government policies to mitigate climate change, such as increased spending on solar and wind energy (76 per cent), higher emission and pollution standards for business and industry (74 per cent) and mandatory controls on greenhouse gas emissions (67 per cent). John Kocher, Assistant Professor of Research at the Communication Centre on Climate Change of the World Federation of Morocco, said to Politi Fact that views on climate change among scientists and the general public differed in part because people did not always view this issue as an issue that directly affected them. \"In historical terms, climate change has been developed as a distant environmental issue in terms of time and space - a problem for plants, penguins and polar bears.\" Kocher helped carry out the survey campaign referred to in the Bennett campaign. Our Governor Bennett said that \"the great majority of Americans believe that climate change is real and we need to do something about it.\" The polls we reviewed show that the majority of Americans believe that the effects of climate change are occurring and are concerned about them. While one poll found that less than half of Americans believe that Congress and Trump should make it a top priority, other polls show that when asked for specific policies to address global warming, the majority of Americans say they support action. We assess Bennett's claim mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00563"}
