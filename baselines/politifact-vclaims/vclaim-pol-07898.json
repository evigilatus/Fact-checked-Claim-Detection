Okay? It was beyond heartbreaking and beyond infuriating.\"\u00a0\nStevens' body was not dragged through the street, at least not in the way Ingraham suggests, multiple accounts and\u00a0three official reviews\u00a0make clear.\u00a0\nPolitiFact\u00a0examined\u00a0a similar\u00a0claim in\u00a0September 2013\u00a0and the facts remain the same.\u00a0\nThe bottom line: Good Samaritans took Stevens\u00a0to a hospital where he could\u00a0receive\u00a0medical treatment.\u00a0\nThe most recent summary\u00a0of the events\u00a0came from the\u00a0Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\u00a0in January 2014. In an appendix, the report provides a timeline. It has this entry for\u00a01\u00a0a.m.\u00a0Sept. 12, 2012:\u00a0\n\"Local Libyans found the Ambassador at the Mission Facility and brought him to a local hospital. Despite attempts to revive\u00a0him, Ambassador Stevens had no heartbeat and had perished from smoke inhalation.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo other government bodies said much the same thing. An\u00a0Accountability Review Board, headed by former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering,\u00a0declared that Stevens was brought to the hospital by six civilians.\u00a0\"To the best knowledge of the Board these were \u2018good Samaritans\u2019 among the hordes of looters and bystanders,\"\u00a0the review concluded.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0House Oversight and Government Reform Committee\u00a0-- controlled by Republicans -- reported that \"local Libyans found the remains of Ambassador Stevens in the main diplomatic building at the Benghazi Mission and transported him to the hospital. The Libyans apparently did not realize who the Ambassador was, but they alerted the State Department of his location by using the cell phone that was in the Ambassador\u2019s pocket. Libyan doctors tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate Ambassador Stevens upon his arrival at the hospital.\"\u00a0\nThe Associated Press interviewed the Libyan doctor who treated Stevens. CNN spoke to Libyans who said they had found Stevens. The CNN report includes amateur video that shows rescuers pulling Stevens through a window.\u00a0\nIt seems established fact that Libyans brought Stevens directly to the hospital and there were no signs that anything else took place.\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nIngraham said that the body of Ambassador Stevens was dragged through the street.\u00a0We reached out to Ingraham but did not hear back.\nAfter reading three government reports and independent press accounts, we find that Stevens, overcome by smoke from the fire, was brought to a Libyan hospital where efforts to revive him failed. To be dragged through the streets implies disrespect.\u00a0There are no reports of public abuse of his body.\u00a0\nThis claim was debunked long ago and the truth has been widely available. We rate Ingraham's claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07898"}
