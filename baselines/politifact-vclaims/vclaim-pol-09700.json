And whether incivility affects the court's productivity is a matter of opinion.\n\nWe can, however, test Fallone's claim that the court is deciding fewer cases.\n\nDisorder in the court\n\nPerhaps most Wisconsin voters planning to vote in the Feb. 19, 2013, primary for the Supreme Court (attorney Vince Megna is the third candidate) don\u2019t follow the court\u2019s inner workings. But it was hard to ignore headlines in June 2011 that revealed that Justice Ann Walsh Bradley had accused Justice David Prosser of putting his hands around her neck.\n\nOther witnesses said Bradley came at Prosser with fists raised and he put up his hands to block her or push her back.\nThe June 2011 confrontation came during a discussion on the day before the high court released a 4-3 decision upholding Gov. Scott Walker's highly controversial bill to curtail the collective bargaining rights of public employees. A special prosecutor investigated the incident and decided not to file any criminal charges.\n\nOn Feb. 13, 2013, news surfaced that Bradley had received stepped-up security from law enforcement more than two months before the incident.)\n\nRancor on the court had already been an issue. In March 2011, it was revealed that 13 months earlier, Prosser called Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson a \"bitch\" and threatened to \"destroy\" her. And in June 2010, the justices deadlocked 3-3 on whether Justice Michael Gableman violated judicial ethics with an attack ad he used in 2008 against his Supreme Court opponent.\n\nRoggensack was elected in April 2003 to a 10-year term on the court. That's an important time element in evaluating Fallone's claim, given that he contends that if he replaced Roggensack, relations among the justices would improve.\n\nState statistics\n\nState court information officer Tom Sheehan told us the most readily available statistics on opinions issued by the Supreme Court cover six terms -- 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. New terms, for purposes of deciding cases, start each September.\n\nWe found that the court has issued an average of 65 opinions in civil and criminal cases per year during that span:\n\nTerm \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 '06-07\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 '07-08\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 '08-09\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 '09-10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 '10-11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 '11-12\nCivil \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a047\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 43\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 40\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 44\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 42\nCriminal\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 17\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 21\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 23\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 18\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 20\nTotal\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 64\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 74 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 64 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 63 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 62 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 62\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, in five of the past six terms, which cover the majority of the time Roggensack has served on the Supreme Court, the number of opinions issued has not dropped off but rather stayed within a narrow range.\n\nIndeed, the court issued virtually the same number of civil and criminal case opinions in the term after the Prosser-Bradley incident (2011-2012) as it did in each of the three previous terms.\n\nFallone's figures\n\nFallone told us that attorneys who have appeared before the state Supreme Court believe tensions among the justices rose notably in 2008 during Gableman\u2019s run for the court.\n\nThat\u2019s inconsistent with when Fallone said the drop-off in opinions occurred -- following the court\u2019s 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 terms.\n\nBut let\u2019s take a look.\n\nFallone cited a report that indicates that from January through August of 2005 -- in other words, the latter part of the 2004-2005 term -- the Supreme Court issued 129 opinions. (Fallone spokesman Nathan Schwantes said Fallone focused on the January-through-August period because that's when the vast majority of opinions are issued during a term.) Fallone also cited a report that indicates that from January through August of 2006, the latter part of the 2005-2006 term, 98 opinions were issued.\n\nBoth figures are considerably higher than the figures we listed above for the six most recent terms. But Fallone is mixing apples and oranges -- and ending up with an overcount.\n\nSheehan, the state courts spokesman, told us that older reports, such as the two Fallone cited, combine civil and criminal opinions with opinions issued in attorney discipline cases, thus producing a higher total number of opinions. Reports in more recent years, he said, break out tallies for opinions issued in the three types of cases.\n\nFallone also said his own \"hard count\" of opinions issued in 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 indicate there were more than 100 opinions issued in civil and criminal cases in each term. But even if he were correct, that would indicate the number of opinions issued dropped off before 2008, which is when Fallone says tensions among the justices spiked upward.\n\nGoing back further\n\nFallone also cited a 2010 article in the magazine of the Wisconsin Public Research Institute, a conservative think tank, which argued that discord among the justices led to reduced productivity. The article said the state Supreme Court was issuing fewer opinions than it had in \"decades,\" but the statistics it cited lumped attorney discipline cases in with civil and criminal cases that were decided by opinion.\n\nWe examined annual reports from the court dating to 1992, hoping to gather two decades\u2019 worth of data, but there were two problems. Reports issued before 2006-2007 did not provide separate statistics for opinions issued in civil and criminal cases -- the opinions in attorney discipline cases were included in the totals. Moreover, the tallies were on a calendar-year basis, rather than following the September-through-August Supreme Court terms, like the newer reports do.\n\nOur rating\n\nCiting incivility on the Supreme Court in the past several years, Fallone said the court's justices are \"deciding fewer opinions in civil and criminal cases than they used to.\"\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t provide evidence to establish that. Official figures show the number has been steady in the six most recent Supreme Court terms, which dates to when Fallone suggests that tensions on the court were high.\n\nWe rate his statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09700"}
