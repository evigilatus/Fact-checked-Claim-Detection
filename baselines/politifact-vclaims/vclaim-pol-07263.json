I wonder what mine is worth?\"\nAn updated version is making the rounds again, urging people to vote this November. A PolitiFact Oregon reader received it from an acquaintance and passed it along to us.\nThe claim:\nThe email focuses on Robinson, who is first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s brother and President Barack Obama\u2019s brother-in-law. The piece alleges that Oregon State officials in 2010 were \"seriously considering\" firing Robinson after his team\u2019s \"dismal\" start to the 2009-10 basketball season.\n\"When word reached Washington, D.C.,\" it continues, \"Undersecretary of Education Martha Kanter was dispatched to Corvallis with $17 million in stimulus money for the university. Craig Robinson\u2019s job is safe for another year.\"\nIt notes the first family connections and closes: \"If this doesn\u2019t anger you, nothing will \u2026 remember to vote this fall!!!!\"\nThe analysis:\nThe crux of the claim involves the charge that Bob DeCarolis, Oregon State\u2019s athletic director, was preparing to fire Robinson after a \"dismal 8-11 start (2-5) in the Pac 10 Conference.\"\nThe university changed its mind, supposedly, only after Kanter, formerly the Obama administration\u2019s highest-ranking higher education official, was \"dispatched\" to Corvallis with oodles of stimulus money.\nWe called Steve Clark, OSU\u2019s vice president for university relations and marketing. \"It\u2019s interesting that it comes up again now,\" he said, \"just a few months before the elections.\"\nAs for stimulus money -- from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, passed by Congress and signed by Obama after the 2008 onset of the Great Recession -- Oregon State did receive some.\n\"As did public universities throughout the nation,\" Clark said. OSU\u2019s share totaled $26.4 million. \"That funded 61 research projects and some infrastructure,\" he added, \"all associated with issues consistent with Oregon State\u2019s research mission.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Huffman\n\n\nstated on September 17, 2010 in a television/web ad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Ron Wyden spent $2 million \"to study exotic ants.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ian K. Kullgren \u2022 September 24, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a problem of timing surfaces immediately.\nBy Oct. 12, 2009, OSU had already received and spent $17.8 million in stimulus money, according to a story by education reporter Betsy Hammond of the Oregonian (the remainder was spent later, on a rolling basis).\nSo that\u2019s likely where the $17 million referred to in the chain email came from.\nBut when OSU\u2019s 2009-10 basketball season came along, that money was already gone. The Beavers didn\u2019t get to two wins and five losses in league play -- the point at which DeCarolis, according to the email, was mulling firing Robinson -- until their Jan. 23, 2010, road loss to California.\nIt should also be noted that the funds came through the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, a program set up to help educational institutions retain top teachers and professors. Individual states, not the federal government, chose the recipients.\nWe emailed Kanter, now a visiting professor at New York University Steinhardt.\n\"I have no idea where this rumor stems from,\" she wrote. \"I never traveled to Corvallis to award $17 million in stimulus money in 2010, nor do I personally know Craig Robinson.\" She also provided a link to another fact-checking site that debunked the claim.\nOSU officials said they have no record of Kanter showing up in Corvallis around that time, nor is there any evidence of news stories detailing a trip.\nDeCarolis has flatly denied the story several times. It would also be highly unusual for any major college program to fire a coach so early in a season, especially considering that Robinson\u2019s team the year before finished with an 18-18 win-loss record and earned OSU\u2019s first post-season championship by winning the 2009 College Basketball Invitational.\nAs for Robinson, the run didn\u2019t last forever. DeCarolis fired him May 5, 2014, after six seasons and a win-loss record of 94-105.\nThe ruling:\nA recycled chain email claims OSU basketball coach Craig Robinson -- Michelle Obama\u2019s brother and the president\u2019s brother-in-law -- avoided losing his job in March 2010 only because a high-ranking administration official was \"dispatched to Corvallis with $17 million in stimulus money for the university.\"\nRecords show that OSU had spent $17.8 million in stimulus funds months before the point when Robinson\u2019s job was supposedly on the line. And there is no evidence that an administration official was \"dispatched\" to Corvallis. The state, not the feds, also chose how to spend the money.\nThe claim has been debunked repeatedly, but keeps cropping up with nothing changed but the date. It\u2019s not only false, but ridiculously so. We rate it Pants On Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07263"}
