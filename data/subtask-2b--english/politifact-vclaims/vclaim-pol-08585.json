There\u2019s rage at every turn, for the millions of policy cancellation notices in Americans\u2019 mailboxes, for the faulty online marketplace, and for President Barack Obama\u2019s leadership in general.\nDavid Axelrod, Obama\u2019s former campaign strategist and adviser, tried batting down the dearth of bad press with some positive statistics about the law Thursday on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.\nThe law allows young adults under 26 to stay on their parents\u2019 plan, prohibits insurers from refusing coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, and eliminates lifetime caps, Axelrod said.\nPlus, \"8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care.\"\nShortly after his segment, Axelrod took to Twitter and said he was talking about rebates sent in 2013.\nWe wanted to know if his point is accurate.\nYou\u2019re probably wondering who got free money from their insurance companies, and why, because it likely wasn\u2019t you.\nOne of the health care law\u2019s many requirements demands health insurance companies spend at least 80 percent of each dollar they charge in premiums on medical care, not for administrative purposes. Policy wonks know it as the medical loss ratio, or the 80/20 rule (for larger employers, it\u2019s more like the 85/15 rule, but that\u2019s more than we need to know for this fact-check).\nSome Americans know it as the way they got paid by their insurer. If a company spends less than 80 percent on medical services, it must return the difference to the consumer either as a cash payment or as a reduction in future payments.\nTwo-thirds of insurance companies were already meeting the ratio without a policy change, according to a 2011 Government Accountability Office study, though compliance varied upon policy type. For example, 77 percent of companies that sold to large employers with more than 100 employees met the 80/20 rule, while only 43 percent of companies serving customers in the individual market were in compliance. The ratio does not apply to self-funded plans.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsurance companies had to report their premiums and spending for the first time in 2011. Companies returned $1.1 billion in total rebates to 13.1 million policyholders in 2012, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data.\nCompanies returned about half as much in rebates in 2013 to 8.85 million policyholders (Axelrod was citing the agency\u2019s original estimate of 8.5 million recipients). The average rebate was $98.\nSo Axelrod is on somewhat solid ground here. But there\u2019s a caveat.\nWhile 8.85 million policyholders were due rebates, it doesn\u2019t mean people are getting checks as Axelrod claimed. Our colleagues at PolitiFact \u00a0pointed this out in a statement from Obama over the summer. (Obama also tried to put a dollar amount on the checks, which led to a rating of Half True.)\nAbout one-third, or 2.9 million people, received rebates for coverage in the individual market in 2013 (the proportion was about the same in 2012). That means they physically got a check. The rest of the rebates went to the small and large employers who manage health insurance plans for their employees.\nEmployers and employees often share the cost of health insurance, with employers picking up the bulk of the cost. In those cases, the rebate goes to the employer because they buy the insurance. But the law requires that the rebate be split proportionately. Employers can pay their employees in a lump sum, reduce future premiums or act by \"applying the rebate in a manner that benefits its employees,\" such as shoring up the health fund or offering better benefits.\nAgain, the rebates came but they doesn\u2019t mean it trickled down to policyholders in the form of a check.\nOur ruling\nAxelrod said, \"8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care.\"\nHe is correct on the number of rebates. However, like Obama before him, Axelrod\u2019s claim isn\u2019t clear on the fact that these checks are mostly going to employers who run plans for their workers, not individual Americans. Employers can then choose to pay their employees in a lump sum, reduce future premiums or act by \"applying the rebate in a manner that benefits its employees,\" such as shoring up the health fund or offering better benefits.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08585"}
