Ron DeSantis\u00a0asked each other for receipts during a Florida gubernatorial debate: DeSantis asked\u00a0who paid for Gillum's\u00a0ticket to a Hamilton show, and Gillum called out DeSantis for travel paid by taxpayers.\n\"I would ask him, what happened to the $145,000 in receipts of public taxpayer money that he has yet to reveal?\"\u00a0Gillum asked Oct. 24 during a WPBF 25 News debate.\nHere are the facts: DeSantis hasn\u2019t released detailed receipts on $145,000 spent on travels, but he broadly reported the travel charges.\nGillum cites Naples Daily News article as evidence\nGillum\u2019s campaign linked his claim to an Oct. 18 Naples Daily News article headlined, \"Candidate DeSantis won't disclose details of taxpayer-funded travel while in Congress.\"\nThe story says that DeSantis spent more than $145,000 in taxpayer money for travel as a congressman, including at least two trips to New York City to appear on Fox News shows. DeSantis was sworn into Congress in January 2013 and resigned in September to focus on his gubernatorial campaign.\nThe story did not say DeSantis traveled to New York City to talk about his campaign \u2014 the known trips happened before he officially announced his candidacy in January 2018, although he had been expected to enter the race for months and President Donald Trump in December 2017 tweeted that DeSantis \"would make a great governor of Florida.\" The story also doesn\u2019t say that his spending broke House rules or laws.\nThe crux of the story is that DeSantis hasn\u2019t disclosed detailed travel receipts and that lack of information leads to uncertainty over how exactly he spent taxpayer money.\n\"Without receipts, it remains unclear how many trips DeSantis took at taxpayer expense to make media appearances. It's also difficult without those records to know how often he traveled at taxpayer expense to locations other than his Florida district or Washington office,\" the Naples Daily News story said.\nFunds come from the Members' Representational Allowance\nThe money at issue comes from the Members' Representational Allowance, an annual allowance members of congress get to support their official and representational duties. The amount appropriated can vary per year. During his time in office, DeSantis\u2019 allowance was more than $1 million but not more than $1.4 million.\nAuthorized spending includes personnel salaries and benefits, travel, and office expenses.\nThe funds cannot be used to pay for expenses \"related to activities or events that are primarily social in nature, personal expenses, campaign or political expenses, or House committee expenses,\" and members may be held personally liable for misspent funds or excess spending, said a September 2017 Congressional Research Service report.\nHouse members\u2019 spending is published in a quarterly public report called Statements of Disbursements. The Naples Daily News analyzed reports submitted by DeSantis and found more than $1,000 spent on seven hotel stays since 2013, and 71 commercial transportation expenses totaling about $143,000.\nDeSantis did not provide to the news outlet details on where and how long he stayed in the hotels; nor receipts on the commercial transportation that would detail where, when, why or with whom he traveled, how many trips were by plane or train, and whether he traveled first-class or coach.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeSantis\u2019 campaign did not respond to multiple PolitiFact queries.\nNew York City trips to appear on Fox News\nThe Naples Daily News identified travel expenses listed in DeSantis\u2019 spending reports that matched the dates of at least two appearances on Fox News TV and radio shows, in July and October of 2017. DeSantis discussed issues of the day, including Trump\u2019s policies.\nDeSantis by that point had not officially entered the race but was expected to join.\nDeSantis\u2019 appearances on Fox News and Fox Business propelled him into the national spotlight and helped him win Trump\u2019s endorsement. \"The once little-known congressman spent so much time broadcasting Fox News TV hits from Washington this year that he learned to apply his own powder so he could look as polished as he sounded,\" Politico reported.\nStephen Lawson, DeSantis\u2019 campaign spokesman, told the Naples Daily News that the trips to New York were \"official office travel that included official media appearances.\"\nIf a member of congress is\u00a0invited in his or her official capacity to do an interview with any media organization, then use of the Members' Representational Allowance\u00a0would be considered permissible if that was the member\u2019s primary purpose for travel, said Courtney Parella, spokeswoman for the Committee on House Administration.\nDeSantis could voluntarily release records detailing his travels, but without itemized receipts there isn\u2019t a way of knowing exactly how he spent taxpayers\u2019 money, said Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs at the government watchdog group Public Citizen.\nThe level of transparency as it relates to the release of detailed receipts varies among lawmakers, and they are not legally required to provide itemized receipts to the public, Gilbert said.\nOur ruling\nGillum claimed DeSantis has not revealed $145,000 in receipts of public taxpayer money.\nDeSantis like other members of Congress received an allowance to cover expenses related to official duties.\nDeSantis has not disclosed \u2014 in detail \u2014 how he spent more than $145,000 in travel.\nBut DeSantis has disclosed broad description for the expenses. Some reported expenses are listed as \"commercial transportation,\" but do not specify when or where the trip was taken. At least two travel expenses reported by DeSantis match the dates of 2017 appearances on Fox News shows. DeSantis\u2019 campaign said those were official media appearances, because he was answering questions as a House member and had not yet entered the governor\u2019s race.\nDeSantis is not legally required to disclose detailed reports of his travel. But a watchdog group said that without itemized it\u2019s not entirely clear how DeSantis spent taxpayers\u2019 money.\nGillum\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
