(Dial-up\u00a0uses a modem and standard phone line to establish an internet connection.)\u00a0Broadband technologies include Digital Subscriber Line, or DSL, cable modem and fiber.\nThe FCC benchmark for fixed (not mobile) broadband internet is speeds of 25 Megabits per second for downloads and 3 Megabits per second for uploads.\nA section of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the FCC to determine annually whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans \"in a reasonable and timely fashion,\" and if not, to take immediate action to accelerate deployment.\nRegarding Georgia\u2019s rural population without high-speed internet access, Kemp\u2019s campaign referred us to a May 2017 presentation from the House Budget and Research Office given at a House Rural Development Council meeting.\nPart of that presentation said an estimated 626,070 individuals, or 25 percent of the rural population, were without access to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps internet.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose figures trace back to the FCC\u2019s 2016 Broadband Progress Report, which also found that 39 percent of all rural Americans did not have access to broadband internet.\n\"The largest factor preventing access to unlimited \u2018high-speed\u2019 broadband is the cost of buildout for the infrastructure,\" said Eric McRae, associate director of the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia.\nDepending on the technology being implemented, cost can range from $18,000 to $30,000 per mile, McRae said. \"Many carriers are developing new technologies (wireless) to help drive down the cost of buildout to make it a more cost-effective endeavor in the rural portions of the state,\" he said.\nA more recent FCC report on broadband deployment, released this month, found that 71.9 percent of rural Georgians had access to fixed terrestrial broadband at speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps, suggesting 28.1 percent did not.\nThe new report also looked at populations\u2019 access to mobile internet, but said it was not establishing a benchmark for mobile, as it does for fixed services.\nWhile both fixed and mobile services enable access to information and entertainment, there are notable differences between the two technologies and limitations in the FCC\u2019s data collection, the report said. Mobile broadband speeds can vary based on capabilities of consumers\u2019 devices and transmissions can be subject to environmental factors that fixed services may not face, the FCC said.\nGenerally, FCC reports have shown that rural communities tend to be at a disadvantage in receiving high-speed internet. PolitiFact Missouri found that Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., accurately claimed in September 2017 that nearly 2/3 of rural Missourians don\u2019t have access to broadband.\nOur ruling\nKemp said that in in Georgia, \"25 percent of rural residents\" are \"without access to high-speed internet.\"\nKemp\u2019s claim is backed by data reported by the FCC in 2016. New data shows that the percentage of rural residents without access to fixed terrestrial broadband is 28.1 percent.\nWe rate Kemp\u2019s statement True.\n Share the Facts 2018-02-12 15:37:03 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  In Georgia, \"25 percent of rural residents\" are \"without access to high speed internet.\"    Brian Kemp Georgia gubernatorial candidate https://www.kempforgovernor.com/sites/default/files/A%20New%20Day%20in%20Rural%20Georgia.pdf   campaign website Wednesday, February 7, 2018 2018-02-07    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02417"}
