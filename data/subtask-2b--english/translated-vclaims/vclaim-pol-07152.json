The Democratic Michel Nun carried out several attacks and allegations against the Republican David Birdo based on his explicit statements about outsourcing in the 2005 Certificate. Most of the political straw comes from Birdo saying that \"he spent most of my career\" in establishing lines of work and supplies in foreign countries. In the debate on 7 October, Nan came across something else that I found in a 186-page document. \"I've talked about 16 countries,\" Nan said. \"Not once did he talk about job creation in the United States.\" Since the result of the race is expected to help decide on the control of the Senate, and polls show that there is a possibility of ending the race, the claim has called for a tour of the \"Truth-O-Meter\" site. First, some background. The certificate was taken as part of a bankruptcy suit against Pellowtex, a textile company in North Carolina, which failed shortly after Birdo took office as Executive Director. Birdo, who was CEO of Dollar General when it was removed, said that his conversion plan when he joined Pellowtex in 2002 called for a mix of marketing and outsourcing. High-quality products will be manufactured in America, while low-cost products will be manufactured abroad. This was the idea, at least, until the directors of Birdo and other executives of Pellowtex found significant unfunded liability when the company came out of bankruptcy. He couldn't carry out his plan, left Birdo less than a year later and the company eventually collapsed. Legal questioning illustrates this failure and includes Birdo &apos; s description of various executive functions where he specializes in outsourcing with companies such as Rebok and Sarah Lee. When asked specifically about his \"experience\" in outsourcing, Birdo expands on that background. \"I have dealt with companies from Japan west along the way to Kenya and Lesotho in Africa, Dubai, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, all points west of Japan,\" said Birdo in part of his answer. In addition to those 12 countries, Birdo mentions three other countries, Hong Kong, which is now part of China. It does not refer to the United States. This is technically 16 States. So has the case been closed? On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" As for the interrogation, Birdo would have been sworn in, swearing to answer truthfully the questions asked. The testimony is similar to that of witnesses, but there is no judge present to judge questions and answers, said Jill Bolster, Attorney for the Defence of Atlanta. This means that the lawyer of the person being dismissed requires them to be sure to answer only the question asked. \"I'm telling all my witnesses, you answer the question that was asked and not more,\" said Bolster. \"The witnesses can sometimes talk about anything they want to talk about, but that would be weird in the testimony. It's a narrow question.\" In the Birdo case, this narrow focus was, not surprisingly, on its commercial success in finding low-cost industrial plants and workers. The questions that led to his experience in other countries included the following: \"Can you describe your experience with outsourcing?\" \"When I joined Rebok, Rebok was outsourcing each of his products to Asia?\" And, \"In any of your jobs before Pellowtex, have you ever been involved in building outsourcing infrastructure?\" In other words, there were no questions about the United States. The certificate structure will not allow a free discussion about jobs there, even if Birdo wants to mention it. Derek Dickie, a Birdo spokesman, said that a thorough reading of the testimony could show that Birdo was trying to demonstrate efforts to save American jobs - not just outsourcing - with his pillow transformation plan. Moreover, Birdo was beginning at that time to create thousands of jobs in the general dollar, through the massive expansion of the discount chain. However, as Dickie said, the list of countries is not included, because he has not been asked any questions to answer. \"He had to answer what the lawyer was asking about,\" said Dickie. \"It's disgusting to twist it to say otherwise.\" It is true that Nan states that Birdo lists job creation in 16 countries in his 2005 testimony. The United States is not one of them. However, legal experts say it would be unfair to focus too much on a missing answer in the certificate, because the real offender would be a missing question. The N allegation contains an element of truth but is out of context to be misleading. We mostly rate it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07152"}
