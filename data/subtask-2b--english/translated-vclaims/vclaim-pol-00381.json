I've mispronounced.", "text": "A viral image shows that thousands of people are gathered on a ship trading social media, and while the image is real, it's not just that. The address above says: \"These aren't Syrians. They are Europeans trying to reach North Africa during World War II. So next time you think about closing the border, you might want to check with your grandparents.\" The picture was highlighted as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The picture is real -- but it's wrong. The false images have been spreading over the Internet for years, and they have been dismantled by several media outlets and fact-checking sites. Research of the opposite image reveals that the original version of the picture is coloured, not black and white, and that social media also report that it shares it, and it was found that it was actually taken in August 1991. The picture is one of many who imagined a mass exodus of Albanians who had hoped to escape the end of the chaos of communist rule in their country at the time. The picture shows that the Flora ship brings thousands of Albanian immigrants to the Italian port of Barry after fleeing their homes in the Balkan peninsula in South-Eastern Europe. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. An Italian documentary entitled \"La Nave Dolce\" was also produced on the incident. The title literally translates into \"The Sweet Ship\" in English, but the title of the alternative film in English was \"Human Shipment.\" Benjamin White, a historian and professor at Glasgow University, wrote about the picture in 2015 on his website: \"This picture shows us that refugees are interchangeable. You can pretend that the image of people fleeing political uncertainty and economic misery in Albania a quarter of a century ago shows Tripoli or Tartus this summer, and some people will believe you (and retweet). Or you can put the same picture in black and white and claim that it shows European refugees in the 1940s, and other people will believe you (and send you back). One of these allegations is intended to provoke hostility towards refugees, the other is intended to provoke sympathy - but it is surprising that both are reducing the refugees themselves to silence in exactly the same way.\" Our ruling social media bulletins share a picture of thousands of immigrants on a ship claiming to be depicting \"Europeans trying to reach North Africa during the Second World War.\" The picture is true, but it was taken in 1991 at an Italian port and it appears that thousands of Albanian immigrants are trying to enter the country. We're assessing this wrong. Correction, 29 July 2019: \"La Nave Dolce\" translated literally into \"The Sweet Vessel\" in Italian. An earlier version of this story wrongly stated that it was translated into an alternative title for the film in English, \"Human Shipment.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00381"}
