He predicted that Trump would win a contested election, sparking chaos.\n\"And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,\" he said, according to the report. \"The drills that you\u2019ve seen are nothing.\"\nCaputo told gun owners to \"buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it\u2019s going to be hard to get.\" He also leveled unsubstantiated accusations against scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and said his own \"mental health has definitely failed.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCaputo has since shut down his personal Facebook account, but he related what he said in the video to several news outlets, and Yahoo News\u00a0released snippets\u00a0of the livestream. Caputo apologized to colleagues for his remarks in an emergency staff meeting, according to reports.\nOn Sept. 16, HHS announced he would be taking a 60-day leave of absence.\u00a0\u00a0\nCaputo already was facing criticism after Politico and others reported that he and an aide had pressured the CDC to let them review and revise weekly scientific reports in order to portray the Trump administration\u2019s coronavirus response more positively.\nAs for his comment about left-wing hit squads? Experts who closely follow domestic terrorism and extremist groups said there\u2019s no evidence that left-wing groups are \"being trained\" or organizing underground to stage the type of armed revolt that Caputo described.\n\"I would just file this under the latest outlandish, unproven argument about left-wing violence that is ultimately aimed to serve the Trump 2020 campaign,\" said Mark Bray, a historian and part-time lecturer at Rutgers University.\nWhat groups is Caputo referring to?\nCaputo and HHS did not respond to requests for comment, nor did the FBI or the office of the director of national intelligence. It\u2019s not clear which left-wing groups he was referring to.\nTrump and his allies have lumped wide swaths of people protesting police brutality and racial injustice in with antifa. Antifa stands for \"anti-fascist\" and refers to a broad movement \u2014 including communists, anarchists and socialists \u2014 that has been around for decades.\nIn his Facebook monologue, Caputo said the suspected killing in August of a Trump supporter by a self-described anti-fascist in Portland, Ore., was a \"drill\" foreshadowing more violence.\nAntifa activists have sometimes turned to violence to push back against right-wing activists, although much of their organizing is peaceful, as PolitiFact has\u00a0reported.\u00a0\nRELATED: Ask PolitiFact: What is antifa, and why is it all over my timeline?\nAnti-fascist groups typically aren\u2019t large in number, and their focus is often on counterprotesting, said Bray, who wrote a book on antifa.\n\"Most of the time when you see counter-demonstrations against far-right events, it\u2019s the anti-racist, anti-fascist crowd that usually doesn\u2019t have guns,\" Bray said.\nOther left-wing groups such as Redneck Revolt, the Socialist Rifle Association and the Not F------ Around Coalition, have also been violent, experts said. Redneck Revolt, for example, will openly carry firearms while opposing far-right events and is known to conduct target practice.\nA recent report from the Network Contagion Research Institute, a nonprofit organization, found that Redneck Revolt and other left-wing groups were growing their networks online and on some occasions circulating memes and messages with depictions of violence.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of Redneck Revolt and the John Brown Gun Club protest outside the Phoenix Convention Center on Aug. 22, 2017, in Phoenix. (AP)\nExperts tracking domestic extremism see no evidence of hit squads\nStill, experts told PolitiFact that they have seen no evidence in their tracking of domestic terrorist and extremist groups that left-wing \"hit squads\" are getting ready to mount an armed insurrection after the election. Here\u2019s a sampling of how they responded to Caputo\u2019s claim:\n\n\n\"We have not seen in our review of online activity of the far-left the existence at this time of anything matching Mr. Caputo's reference of \u2018hit squads,\u2019 though there certainly is an intensity to the rhetoric,\" said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.\n\n\n\"I haven\u2019t heard anything that would suggest there are organized groups that are plotting this type of violence,\" said Mary McCord, legal director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law and a former Justice Department attorney.\n\n\n\"I have not seen any evidence of hit squads being trained to violently oppose a second Trump term. What I have seen is the politicization of extremist threats,\" said Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism.\n\n\n\"Regardless of which side is declared the winner, there is absolutely no evidence to support Mr. Caputo\u2019s claims,\" said Michael Jensen, senior researcher at the University of Maryland\u2019s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism.\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t discount the possibility that some extremists could act on their own or in very small circles through the use of encrypted messages or private online forums, experts said. McCord noted that mass shootings have often been carried out by a single gunman.\u00a0\n\"Now, if you were talking about coordinated attacks across the country all on the same day or something, then obviously that takes a big infrastructure,\" McCord said.\nMcCord also noted that Caputo\u2019s HHS role wouldn\u2019t necessarily make him privy to the same insight as intelligence, national security or law enforcement officials. \"He really wouldn\u2019t have access to the information that would support those claims,\" McCord said.\nPast left-wing violence doesn\u2019t fit the \"hit squad\" mold\nHow various groups might react to a Trump election victory is an open question, although academics have run simulations to game out the possibilities, and experts PolitiFact consulted said some street-level violence could happen depending on the result.\u00a0\nBut the type of coordinated political assassinations that Caputo evoked with his reference to \"hit squads\" are largely inconsistent with the way left-wing groups have operated, experts said.\n\"According to the propaganda that I\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re not advocating that type of hit-squad, offensive paramilitary tactics,\" McCord said.\n\"It doesn\u2019t in my experience fit with what they have done, which is usually just essentially target practice and show up to oppose far-right events,\" Bray added.\nNeil Shortland, director of the Center for Terrorism and Security Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, said that while groups such as Redneck Revolt could pose a threat of violence if Trump wins, there\u2019s no open-source evidence to prove they\u2019re currently organizing as hit squads.\nThe reference to hit squads is \"overly dramatic and alarmist,\" said Jeffrey Bale, professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, because \"it suggests that operational teams are being organized throughout the country to carry out political assassinations.\"\nA June report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said the election \"will likely be a significant source of anger and polarization that increases the possibility of terrorism\" from either the right or the left.\u00a0\nThe report noted that \"far-right terrorism has significantly outpaced terrorism from other types of perpetrators,\" which aligns with what experts told PolitiFact.\u00a0\n\"While there is a smattering of left-wing militias and there is an upswing in extreme left-wing online and violent activity, including the movement's first homicide in years, the most mass casualty violence has emanated from the far-right,\" said Levin, the expert from California State University, San Bernardino.\nOur ruling\nCaputo said \"there are hit squads being trained all over this country\" to violently oppose a second term for Trump.\nPost-election protests featuring violence are a real possibility, experts said, and there are some left-wing groups that believe in openly carrying firearms.\nBut experts who track domestic terrorism and extremist groups said there\u2019s no basis to Caputo\u2019s claim that these groups are organizing nationwide as \"hit squads\" and \"being trained\" to carry out widespread political assassinations should Trump win on Election Day.\nWe rate this statement False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18948"}
