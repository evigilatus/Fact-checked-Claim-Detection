It would therefore be politically dangerous for a candidate to declare his or her wish to interrupt medical care and social security. However, Democratic Dan McCreedy recently accused the Republican Mark Harris of confessing to that. Harris and McCready are running for the Ninth Congressional District of North Carolina, which runs from Charlotte to south-central North Carolina. It is currently carried by Robert Pettinger, who was beaten by Harris in the presidential primary elections. There are 116,000 people in the Ninth District over the age of 65 (the age at which most people become eligible for medical care and full social security benefits) and about 100,000 others who are able to receive social security benefits within the next 15 years. In a discussion held on 10 October, Harris and McCreedy became increasingly involved after a coordinator asked how they would continue to pay for social security. \"Mark Harris said he'd cut off social security and medical care,\" said McCready. The full discussion is available on Charlotte &apos; s observer &apos; s website, and McCready presented this allegation about a 12-minute video marker. Harris said that he was offended by McCready's accusation. \"I never said that.\" Harris said that this was a lie committed throughout the campaign and throughout the province. \"I have always said that we must keep social security dissolved, we must make sure that it is a promise made and fulfilled. And we'll keep doing that.\" Harris McCready was then accused of wanting to increase taxes to support those programmes. \"I think we need to look at a graduated system that fulfils the promise we made towards retirees and pensioners. I think when you come back more in the younger years, we need a graduation program that might include options.\" The McCreedy McCreedy argument then presented a three-dimensional argument as to how Harris referred to his intentions to cut off medical care and social security. \"You supported $1.9 trillion in tax bills that take $25 billion from medical care,\" said McCreedy to Harris. \"You said you would join the Freedom Caucus, whose stated objective is to reform social security as we know it,\" said McCready. \"In 2014, I said in the Norman Lake debate that young people will be the biggest losers in your plan.\" Harris replied: \"I have never expressed a comprehensive plan but to make clear the point that today's young people who do not see social security are there when they arrive at it need some kind of choice.\" On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" :: By Paul Spectt: 1 February 2021, who was contacted by Polyte Fact, McCreedy &apos; s e-mail campaign published a video of a major debate in the United States Senate in 2014, in which Harris participated, a link to an online voter &apos; s guide filled by Harris for this year &apos; s initial news, and two news stories -- by the Washington Post and Reuters -- on how the Republicans want to reduce the entitlement programs to offset revenue losses from recent tax cuts. The fiscal cuts of the Republic are expected to reduce the life expectancy of the programmes, as previously reported by Politic Fact. The tax law reduced one year &apos; s liquidity from the Trust Fund for Primary Medical Care and had a negative impact on the Trust Fund for Social Security. But it is not fair for McCready to say that, because Harris supports tax cuts, he is also in favour of further cuts in medical care. :: Polyte Fact found no evidence that Harris expressly stated that he wanted to cut off medical care, and McCready camp did not provide any evidence. With regard to the Freedom Caucus, Harris said that he would join the conservative group. On his website, Mark Meadows, leader of the Freedom Caucus, says that \"social security, medical care and medical aid must be at the centre of any serious proposal to return spending to sustainable levels.\" However, Meadows adds, \"I am not seriously in favour of proposing radical changes in current benefits or in the near future for retirees. But if we are to continue to provide these safety nets to Americans in need, we must renegotiate expectations with younger Americans. This could include raising the retirement age of those who have just begun their careers, raising or abolishing the maximum salary taxes for higher paid workers, and creating incentives for personal retirement and health-care savings.\" What did Harris say? Let us now look at the 2014 debate and the voter guide. In the debate video, Harris looks a lot like Meadows. According to Harris, everyone over the age of 50 should be guaranteed social security when they retire, but young people should not receive the same security. \"There may be a way we can reduce our size to others under 50 years of age. Soon I will be 48, and my generation may be the biggest loser in social security, but we may be able to say that at least I took care of my father and my grandfather for what I paid them.\" He went on to say: \"I would rather, quite frankly, amend me as a 48-year-old man, free my children - 25, 24 and 22 years - than continue to tax them and put money in a system from which they will never see a cent. We must therefore find a solution that strikes those generations and must be thoughtful and productive, but it is something that we can work on and fix.\" Harris's response to iVotterGuide.com, which was completed for Republican Primary in this race, is similar. Harris wrote that social security is \"in the vortex of death\" and \"need to be repaired.\" \"In any case, we must respect our promises to current retirees and those approaching retirement age who maintain the current system in place for these people,\" Harris wrote in the manual. \"In order to maintain a system that resembles social security, the system will need to operate in a balanced manner in the sense that individuals receive only what they pay, supplemented by a government budget that should not be based on the whims of political gains but on economic sensitivity.\" Our judgment, McCreedy, claims Harris said he'd cut off social security and medical care. The Politic Fact did not find an example of Harris' description of a plan to change social security benefits and medical care for people who are now receiving them or standing for them soon. In the medical care program, McCready failed to prove that Harris said he wanted to cut the program at all. However, with regard to social security, it is clear from his earlier and recent statements that his hopes for reform include changes that would limit future government payments. Harris used the word \"overhaul\" and said that he was open to reducing social security for persons under 50 years of age. But he has consistently said that his desired reforms will not affect the people who are in the program or who will benefit from it in the next decade or so. We're assessing this claim half right.
