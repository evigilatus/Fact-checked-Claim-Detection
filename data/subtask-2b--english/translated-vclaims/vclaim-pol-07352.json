According to the meme, McDonald's pies are clich\u00e9 on real and heavy beef on \"meat stuffed,\" which connects the meme to cancer. The meat stuffer is also called \"pink swelle\" -- a pseudonym considered insulting by the beef industry -- and waves with consumers several years ago after a cycle of food revolution in Jimmy Oliver in 2011 and an investigation into 11 parts of ABC News. McDonalds then said he pulled the product out of his grill. This summer, however, the memma in circulation indicates otherwise. The claim has existed in some form since 2002. One of the most recent versions, obtained from an anonymous blog on the site of Rao For Jamal, says: \"Hamburger McDonald is only 15% of real beef, while the other 85% is the stuffing of ammonium-purified meat, causing stomach and intestine cancer. We wanted to know more about this meat stuffer, anywhere, if any, in McDonald's Burger, and if it's related to cancer. Big Mac slap first, McDonalds says he no longer uses the \"meat stuffer\" in the question. This allegation has been witnessed several times since 2011, and McDonalds has dealt with it several times. In FAQ's meat, the fast food giant admitted that he once used \"candy\" -- or that industry prefers the term \"precisely blended pure beef\" -- in its products but has since stopped this practice: \"The United States of America in McDonald had begun to remove it from our supply chain before mass media coverage over its use and was completely removed from our supply in 2011. While the choice of beef chops is safe, we have decided to stop using the product to harmonize our global beef standards around the world.\" With regard to exactly what is in the dresses, McDonalds wrote, \"Our burgers in the United States are manufactured using only 100% of the beef that the USA inspects. There are no preservatives, no fillings, no extensions, no so-called \"slime\" in beef. The only thing added to our burger is a little salt and pepper during the barbecue.\" His rumour of \"fly\" flew down below, too, forcing McDonalds Australia to issue a video and telling our client concerned, \"Sure, Dana, that's not true. Our beef pies are every 100 percent export of the quality of the Osei beef, free of preservatives, additions, fillings and folders.\" Despite the high costs of beef, McDonald's has no plans to re-present well painted skinny beef (the industry's favorite term for what critics call \"the mud bank\"), and the spokesperson for McDonald's said Lisa McCumb. But what exactly is skinny beef well painted, and is it real beef? When the beef products company began manufacturing the product in 1991, the industry encouraged it to be revolutionary. Basically, the goal is to get every piece of meat out of the bones, and then cleanse it so it's safe to eat. \u2219 Here's how the process works: about 25 percent of the body remains after its muscles are cut off (Serlons, Bosterets, ribs, etc.). The remaining fat is then placed with meat that is still attached through the heat and centrifuge process, which separates the fat and produces 93 to 97 per cent of the skinny meat, according to the purchasing power index. Because trimmings are often more susceptible to contamination, meat is then treated with ammonium hydroxide gas to kill pathogens, such as salmonella and E. Coli. The U.S. Department of Agriculture does not require the inclusion of ammonium hydroxide in the components, as part of the process rather than part of the meat. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 January 12, 2012, the resulting meat contains a finer tissue. Eric Metenthal, spokesman for the American Meat Institute, a national trade association, said: \"That's why you won't have a hamburger made out of nothing but LFTB - the fabric will be softer.\" Skinny beef usually contains no more than 15% of burgers, which consumers prefer more than 100% of rough muscular meat, according to Edward Mills, Professor of Meat Science at Pennsylvania State University. By 25%, most people will notice a clear difference in taste. So the burgers with 85 percent of the lean product -- the amount specified in the mem -- aren't realistic. Many of the meat science teachers we met consider this product to be \"real beef,\" even if consumers do not. This perspective is in line with the United States Department of Agriculture's definition of meat, which is \"meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation devices that are similar in appearance, textiles and composition to the trimming of meat and similar hand-derived meat products.\" Under this definition, skinny beef painted well -- the official term for \"slime meat\" -- is real beef, and a hamburger containing beef can be classified 100%. The U.S. Department of Agriculture does not require that its owners be rid of skinny beef accurately painted on meat labels, but some companies, such as Cargill &apos; s giant food company, have chosen to paste their products if they include this product. The cancer bond? Let us now consider the potential health effects of eating this kind of beef. Could it really lead to stomach and intestinal cancer? \"Bolift Fakt Georgia\" considered an allegation that \"soft candy\" is safe and assessed mostly correct. An article from The New York Times in 2009 explained in detail how the remarkable sanitation process behind well painted beef wasn't effective in killing pathogens, as BPI said -- even with meat moving to school cafeteria through the federal school lunch program. Between 2004 and the end of 2009, the Times report reported that the product was positive for salmon 36 times out of 1,000, four times higher than other suppliers. The story was also quoted from a scientist from the Ministry of Agriculture who referred to the product as \"nut candy.\" Gerald Zerinstein wrote to his colleagues at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2002, \"I don't consider these things beef, and I'm thinking of allowing them in beef to be a form of fraudulent labelling.\" The story raised many eyebrows, stimulating additional petitions and coverage from Oliver &apos; s food and other programmes. McDonalds joined Taco Bell and Burger King in not using ammonium hydroxide treated meat in 2012, reported in Daily Mail. But meat experts said BPI was safe - or unsafe - like all other beef products. The meat poultry industry has used fatty fat for 40 years, as Ted Laboza, a professor of food science at the University of Minnesota, said. Ammonium hydroxide is used in many food products, such as pudding and cheese, and at levels 10 times higher than meat levels, as Metenthal and Mills said. No studies have been found indicating that ammonia beef can lead to stomach cancer or other intestinal disease. Even if you eat burgers with skinny and well-touched beef every day, \"You won't even get close\" to putting a serious risk on your health -- at least, not because of ammonium hydroxide, Mills said. It is quite common to use ammonia and other chemicals -- like strick acid, which can leave acid flavor -- to treat meat, as Laboza said. He said that the risk of disease was actually lower with beef than McDonald's compared to the local butcher, which was less stringent than fast-food restaurants. Our judgment on Mimi online accuses McDonalds of using hamburger meat, which contains only 15% \"real beef,\" and the rest consists of \"filled ammonium-purified meat, causing stomach and intestine cancer.\" McDonald's stopped using \"feller\" in the question -- beef, beef, or a somewhat misleading nickname - in 2011. When the product was on the grill, the burger probably contained 85% of the meat stuffing, and experts said that most consumers would notice a difference in taste after 25%. In addition, skinny beef has no documented connection to cancer. We're assessing this pants claim on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07352"}
