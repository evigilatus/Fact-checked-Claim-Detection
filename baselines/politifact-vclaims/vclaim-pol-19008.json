But Baker didn\u2019t say that Floyd died of a drug overdose.\nThe medical examiner\u2019s office ruled that the manner of Floyd\u2019s death was homicide.\u00a0\nThe cause of death, according to the medical examiner, was \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" The report goes on to say that Floyd \"experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained\" by law enforcement officers.\nWhat that means: Floyd\u2019s heart stopped as Chauvin restrained him.\nThis blog post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease, fentanyl intoxication, and recent methamphetamine use.\nDerek Chauvin, the officer who pressed his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck, was fired from the Minneapolis Police Department and he\u2019s been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslauter in Floyd\u2019s death.\u00a0\nDocuments filed in that case include handwritten notes from a law enforcement interview with Baker, the medical examiner, a local NBC News affiliate reported on Aug. 26.\u00a0\nBaker said that Floyd\u2019s toxicology report showed he had a \"fatal level of fentanyl under normal circumstances\" and that \"if he were found dead at home alone and no other apparent causes, this could be acceptable to call an OD.\"\nBaker also said: \"I am not saying this killed him.\"\nChauvin\u2019s lawyer is asking the judge to drop the charges in the case against the ex-police officer, arguing that Floyd died from a drug overdose and not because Chauvin put his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.\u00a0\nBut the results of the two autopsies in this case don\u2019t support that.\u00a0\nOne, requested by Floyd\u2019s family, and conducted by two doctors also found that Floyd\u2019s death was a homicide, though it concluded that they thought he died of asphyxia \u2014 or suffocation \u2014 not cardiopulmonary arrest as the county medical examiner concluded.\u00a0\nWe rate this blog post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19008"}
