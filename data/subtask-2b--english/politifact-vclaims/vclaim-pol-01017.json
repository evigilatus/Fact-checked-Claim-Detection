It turns out that the biggest donor for Mitch McConnell (R. Moscow) is none other than the Russian oligarch that the GOP just lifted sanctions on.\"\nThe same post links to a Jan. 28 Medium post by the Democratic Coalition, a super PAC founded in 2016 in opposition of Donald Trump.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nAccording to the Democratic Coalition\u2019s story, Len Blavatnik, a dual U.S.-U.K. citizen, donated millions to McConnell\u2019s campaign and Senate Leadership Fund in recent years via his company Access Holdings.\nThe story also claims Blavatnik is a long-term business partner of Kremlin-linked Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, of the aluminum company RuSal, \"in which (Blavatnik) is a major investor.\" It then says McConnell led Republicans in January to vote against a resolution to maintain sanctions on Deripaska.\nWe found that this isn\u2019t all false, but the claim exaggerates Blavatnik\u2019s contributions to McConnell as being his \"biggest\" donor, and makes it look as if Blavatnik is the Russian oligarch affected by sanctions. In fact, it was another Russian with whom he conducted business.\nWho is Len Blavatnik and how much did he donate to McConnell?\nBlavatnik emigrated to the United States with his family in the late 1970s and returned to Russia in the late \u201980s as the Soviet Union began to collapse. His U.S.-based holding companies \u2014 Access Industries Inc. and AI-Altep Holdings Inc. \u2014 are conduits for his largest political contributions, according to Federal Election Commission records.\nIn 2015-16, Blavatnik\u2019s contributions went to GOP PACs and top Republican leaders, including McConnell, according to FEC records.\nIn that cycle, his companies contributed over $6.3 million, with $2.5 million going to McConnell\u2019s Senate Leadership Fund. In 2017, Blavatnik donated another $1 million to the committee, records show, bringing the total to $3.5 million.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Blavatnik certainly donated a lot of money to McConnell\u2019s committee, he is nowhere near the majority leader\u2019s highest contributor. In the 2017-18 cycle alone, at least two other donors, Sheldon D. Adelson and Miriam Adelson, gave $25 million (a piece) to his leadership fund.\nThe sanctions and Blavatnik\u2019s connection\nIn April 2018, the Trump administration announced sanctions on multiple Russian oligarchs and their companies, including Deripaska and his aluminum company Rusal, the second-largest aluminium company in the world. Deripaska is known to be closely allied with the Kremlin, and his name has come up in emails turned over to the Mueller investigation. \u00a0\nThen, in December, the administration agreed to lift the sanctions on Deripaska\u2019s companies in exchange for him giving up majority ownership, along with other concessions.\nAbout a month later, McConnell led Senate Republicans and blocked a Democratic effort to keep the sanctions on Deripaska\u2019s companies.\nNow that we are all caught up, how are Blavatnik and Deripaska connected?\nAs two of the richest Russian men in the United Kingdom, it\u2019s not entirely surprising they have had business dealings. According to a report by the Dallas News, Blavatnik and business partner Viktor Vekselburg hold a 20.5 percent stake in Rusal.\n(Vekselberg made news in May 2018 after it was revealed that a U.S. firm he invests in wired $500,000 to a company owned by Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former attorney.)\nOur ruling\nA post says McConnell\u2019s \"biggest donor\" is a Russian oligarch who was released from U.S. sanctions.\nBlavatnik is involved in Deripaska\u2019s businesses, on which sanctions were lifted recently, but it is inaccurate to call him the Russian oligarch \"that the GOP just lifted sanctions on.\"\nBlavatnik also donated money to McConnell\u2019s Senate Leadership Fund, but he wasn\u2019t the highest donor, records show. He also contributed to other Republican leaders and GOP-affiliated PACs.\nThe attack on McConnell gets a lot of the details wrong.
