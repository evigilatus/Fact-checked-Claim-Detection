Jim Renacci tossed plenty of that dirt two years ago when the incumbent Democrat he defeated, former Rep. John Boccieri of Alliance, hung onto campaign cash he got from veteran New York Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel after the House Ethics Committee chided Rangel for taking a Congressional Black Caucus trip that was improperly funded by corporations.\n\n\"As if John Boccieri\u2019s voting record isn\u2019t troubling enough, the fact that his campaign coffers have been fueled by the fruits of Washington\u2019s culture of corruption raises further questions about his judgement and his ethics,\" said a March 1, 2010 statement from Renacci\u2019s campaign.\n\nSimilar attacks have been leveled at Renacci since a May 18 article in The New Republic revealed that federal law enforcement authorities were examining donations that Renacci\u2019s campaign got from employees of a North Canton direct marketing firm called Suarez Corporation Industries.\n\nFederal agents sought contribution records from \u00a0the campaigns of Renacci and GOP U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel after the Toledo Blade published a report about large donations Suarez employees made to the two campaigns.\n\nWealthy political donors sometimes try to skirt limits on the amount they can give campaigns by having other people write checks and reimbursing them. That practice is illegal. The company and its employees deny any wrongdoing, as do the political campaigns. Mandel subsequently returned the money.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Renacci held on to the cash, pending the investigation\u2019s outcome, and that has prompted the same sort of attacks as this year\u2019s election looms that Renacci directed at Boccieri two years ago.\n\n\"Since news broke that over $100,000 in questionable donations to Congressman Jim Renacci\u2019s re-election campaign are the focus of a federal investigation, Jim Renacci has yet to do the right thing and return or donate them,\" says a notice on the campaign website of Renacci\u2019s Democratic election rival, Rep. Betty Sutton of Coply Township, near Akron..\n\nRenacci was queried about the controversy at a June 14 town hall meeting in Rocky River. He responded with an attack against Sutton: \"My opponent, in 2008, had contributions investigated by the federal government.\"\n\nSutton, he said, \"kept them for two years until there was a final decision made, and then she returned them.\"\n\nPolitiFact Ohio wasn\u2019t aware that the federal government had investigated political contributions that Sutton received, so we asked Renacci\u2019s campaign to explain his assertion.\n\nCampaign spokesman James Slepian said the congressman misspoke, and that he instead meant to reference a past investigation into Rangel, her campaign donor. Slepian said Renacci accidentally referred to Sutton\u2019s campaign \"contributions\" rather than using the word \"donor.\"\n\n\"When he said \u2018contributions\u2019 under investigation in reference to Sutton, what he clearly meant to say was \u2018donor\u2019 under federal investigation,\" said an email from Slepian. \"As you know, Jim has issued numerous statements to the press (including The Plain Dealer) that one of Sutton\u2019s donors was under investigation for two years and that he is following the same course she took by waiting for the outcome of the investigation before deciding whether or not to return the donations. That is what he was trying to communicate.\"\n\nSlepian also blasted Sutton and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House of Representatives\u2019 Democrats, for stating that Renacci himself is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The DCCC made that claim in a June 1 press release. PolitiFact Ohio rated that it False after the head of the FBI\u2019s Canton office debunked the accusation.\n\nSutton was among dozens of Democratic office holders to whom Rangel donated money. It is true that allegations about Rangel began to surface in 2008, when The New York Times ran a series of articles about Rangel that suggested irregularities.\n\nAllegations in those articles included abuse of \u00a0rent-stabilized apartments and failure to report $75,000 in income, as well as his protection of a tax loophole that favored one of his donors. Within a week of the House Ethics Committee's Feb. 25, 2010, report on Rangel\u2019s improper junket, Sutton announced that she was giving the $7,000 she got from Rangel to charity. Sutton subsequently called on Rangel to resign\u00a0from the House of Representatives.\n\nSlepian says Renacci\u2019s decision to wait until the FBI probe is complete before deciding whether to get rid of the the Suarez money parallels Sutton\u2019s decision to wait. But does it?\n\nThe Rangel conduct under investigation had nothing to do with Sutton or the donations Rangel made to her campaign. The FBI\u2019s investigation specifically involves donations made to Renacci.\n\nAlso, Rangel was being probed by the House Ethics Committee for violating House of Representative rules. The FBI is probing donations to Renacci as potential crimes.\n\nAnd the amounts of money involved are significantly different: $7,000 from Rangel to Sutton\u2019s campaign; more than $100,000 from Suarez employees to Renacci\u2019s campaign. Data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics says Suarez is Renacci\u2019s biggest political donor.\n\nRegardless, the claim on the Truth-O-Meter is Renacci\u2019s statement to the town hall audience that \"my opponent, in 2008, had contributions investigated by the federal government.\"\n\nPolitiFact Ohio doesn\u2019t play \"gotcha\" games. To their credit, the folks in the Renacci camp acknowledged he provided incorrect information to the crowd in Rocky River.\n\nBut to those in attendance, the information they have to go on is what Renacci told them that night. That\u2019s why the comment merits a check from PolitiFact Ohio.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, Renacci\u2019s statement rates False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10885"}
