Now, he calls for a \"main investigation\" into voter fraud, written in January 25. We have dismantled Trump's allegations of massive fraud of voters over and over (and over again and again) over the past year. Trump has not yet provided any evidence in support of these allegations - as none exist. On 24 January of the daily press briefing, a journalist asked White House Press Secretary Sean Spyser how Trump had come to believe that potential illegal votes were to blame for losing the popular vote. \"I think there are studies,\" answered Spyser. \"There was one out of Pyo in 2008, which showed 14% of the people who voted were non-citizens. There are other studies that have been submitted to him. \"It's faith he holds on to.\" The Spyser mixes two different studies that were used wrongly to support allegations that non-citizens pressured the elections with illegal voting. There is no study showing that 14 per cent of the votes cast in 2008 were cast by non-citizens. This would have increased the number of false votes to over 18 million - an unreasonable assertion, given that the total population of non-citizens was about 22.5 million in 2010. The Pio study misinterpreted the study \"Out of Pyo in 2008\" in fact appeared in 2012, which is about the old voters' lists, not the false voices. The 2012 Bio Study - Inaccuracy, Cost and Incompetence: Evidence that the US voter registration system needs to be upgraded - makes no mention of non-citizens who vote or register to vote. It found that some 24 million people, or one in eight, of the voter registrations in the United States were inaccurate or no longer valid, but found no evidence of actual voter fraud. The study on record-keeping was poorly managed and in disarray. Here's what the former director of the Pew election program said about the study in November: We found millions of old records because people moved or died, but we didn't find any evidence that voter fraud resulted. The old Dominion study, which shows that \"14% of those who voted were non-citizens,\" was widely criticized for its methodology, cites the results wrongly. The study, which was probably referred to, was carried out by professors at the Old University of Dominion and published in 2014. According to researchers in the Washington Post, about 14 per cent of non-citizens in the sample said they were registered to vote, and they concluded that about 6 per cent of non-citizens had already voted in the 2008 elections. This means somewhere on the 1.3 million-vote field, using estimates of the non-citizens' population. Therefore, the study does not show the statistics that Spyser says. Furthermore, many reliable researchers described the study as methodologically inappropriate to use an Internet opinion poll originally designed to survey citizens and not consider the possibility of an error in responding to the survey. In a recent post, one author, Mr. Old Dominion Jesse Richman, said that he stood by his study, but \"our findings suggest that almost all elections in the United States are not defined by the participation of non-citizens, with occasional and very rare exceptions. There may be a problem of voting by non-citizens, but it is not nearly as great as statistical spices. These studies do not support Tramp &apos; s belief that millions of illegal votes are cost by popular vote. Hillary Clinton won about 3 million votes over Trump. Therefore, eliminating Trump &apos; s popular vote deficit requires the assumption that all three million votes were cast illegally, each of which went to Clinton and not Trump. Furthermore, no official or well-known academic sources provided any evidence of large-scale voter fraud in the 2016 elections, and numerous studies have shown that voter fraud is rare.

Spicer confuses and misquotes two studies: a report on outdated voter lists in 2012 and a study by the Old University of Dominion in 2014 concluded that 6 per cent of the non-citizens surveyed had voted in 2008. The study of the former University of Dominion was widely criticized for its methodology. No study found statistics to indicate this. While 14 per cent of all voters in 2008 were non-citizens, that meant that more than 80 per cent of the non-citizens in America had voted. The Spicer claim is false. Political Facts 4 shared the policy assessment: \"There was one (study) that came out of Pyo in 2008 showing that 14% of those who voted were non-citizens.\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spieser, White House Press Briefing, Tuesday, 24 January 2017-01-24/2017.
