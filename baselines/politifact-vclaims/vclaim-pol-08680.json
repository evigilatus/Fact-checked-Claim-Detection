Nationally, the number of people working from home increased by 2 million from 2005 to 2010, according to the U.S. Census.\nIn Oregon, the city of West Linn has long claimed a relatively high number of home-based businesses, with City Council members and others routinely referring to the city as having one of the highest rates per capita in the state.\nRep. Julie Parrish, R-West Linn, took things to a new level during the recent legislative special session, when she spoke on the floor to support a small-business tax cut. She said the proposed cuts would save enough for many businesses to hire an additional employee, then added, \"West Linn has one of the highest per capita rates of home-based businesses in the United States.\"\nThat caught our attention. Does West Linn\u2019s per capita rate of home-based businesses top almost anywhere in the country? PolitiFact Oregon decided to check.\nWe contacted Parrish by email and received a quick reply. She cited a May 2, 2013, article in the West Linn Tidings newspaper. The article, referring to U.S. Census data, stated that West Linn ranked second in Oregon in the rate of home-based businesses per capita at 8.9 percent. Only Lake Oswego, at 10.9 percent, ranked higher.\nParrish offered additional figures to bolster her case. As of April, she said, 2,769 businesses with West Linn addresses were registered with the Oregon Secretary of State\u2019s office.\nFurther, West Linn has a population of about 25,600 and 9,779 households, according to the 2010 Census. Of those, 777 units are vacant. That leaves 2,769 businesses spread among about 9,000 households.\nSuitably crunched, those numbers indicate that about 28 percent of households have a registered business, Parrish said, adding, \"Of course, not all of those are going to be home-based.\"\nFrom there, however, the slope got more slippery.\nWe took Parrish up on her suggestion to contact West Linn City Councilor Thomas Frank, who, she said, had cited 2010 Census Bureau data for statewide numbers of home-based businesses in one of his recent blog posts.\nFrank said West Linn used to call itself Oregon\u2019s leader when it came to the number of home-based businesses. He then cited the same figures used in the West Linn Tidings article.\nAsked whether West Linn had, as Parrish stated, one of the highest per capita rates in the nation, Frank said, \"I\u2019ve not heard that one before.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, at Frank\u2019s suggestion, we turned to Chris Kerr, West Linn\u2019s economic development director. He also could not pinpoint the origin of West Linn\u2019s reputation for having a high concentration of home-based businesses.\n\"I have heard similar statements about the comparatively large number/percentage of home-based businesses in West Linn,\" Kerr wrote by email. \"However, I am not familiar with any comparative data on this subject; certainly not related to the national averages or on a per capita basis.\"\nIn the end, neither he, Frank nor anyone else contacted by PolitiFact Oregon could cite numbers supporting the notion that West Linn is a leader in home-based enterprises, even though that\u2019s been the conventional wisdom for years.\nKerr said the city probably does have a beefy number of home-based businesses because of its high percentage of residential to nonresidential land. The city last year listed 1,245 licensed businesses -- far fewer than the state listed for West Linn -- of which 423 were at residences.\nThe discrepancy underscores the difficulty of finding precise numbers. Kerr noted that some of those homes were listed for mailing-address purposes only. Other home businesses don\u2019t bother to get licenses in hopes of avoiding regulation or licensing fees.\n\"I\u2019ve been told that Southeast Portland has an unusually high number of home-based businesses, but there\u2019s no way to prove it,\" said Eric Norberg, longtime president of the Association of Home Businesses in Portland. \"Cities don\u2019t tabulate that separately, and many home businesses have no desire to tell anyone but their customers what they are doing.\"\nStill, we wondered whether cities can be ranked according to their per capita rates of home-based businesses.\nYes, said Jason Jurjevich, assistant director of Portland State University\u2019s Population Research Center, but not by using full Census statistics. Instead, data along these lines come from the Economic Census, a survey of business owners conducted every five years.\nThe problem is it\u2019s a relatively small survey and doesn\u2019t produce information down to cities the size of West Linn, Jurjevich said. The single source of information that could be used that way -- Public Use Microdata Sample, or PUMS -- requires population sets of at least 100,000.\nOf West Linn, he said: \"It\u2019s too small.\"\nThe Census\u2019 annual American Community Survey also gathers data from businesses and homeowners. In a question asking how many people work from home, 8.5 percent of West Linn respondents answered yes (not the 8.9 percent listed in the Tidings article). But there\u2019s no way to determine how many are simply employees who work from home.\nTo Parrish\u2019s credit, she promised to continue looking for \"the specific numbers,\" adding, \"I\u2019m willing to acknowledge that I don\u2019t have them in hand.\" She stood by saying West Linn has \"one of the highest\" per capita ratings in Oregon, despite the fact that no one could point to specific data to back that up.\nBut back to her original claim to House colleagues that West Linn has \"one of the highest per capita rates of home-based businesses in the United States.\" It\u2019s conceivably possible that\u2019s true, but Parrish could offer no substantiation. And we found that no such statistics exist on a city the size of West Linn. In such cases, PolitiFact rates the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08680"}
