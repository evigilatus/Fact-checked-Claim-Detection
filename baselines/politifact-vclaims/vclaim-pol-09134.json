This list was familiar until this eye-popper: \"He attacked churches for helping the poor,\" Begala wrote of Cuccinelli.\nWe asked Begala, a frequent CNN contributor, to prove his claim. He pointed to an article in The Virginian-Pilot about a Sept. 29, 2012, keynote address that Cuccinelli gave to the Cherish Life Ministries Christian Life Summit in Ashburn, Va.\nA video of Cuccinelli\u2019s speech, posted along with the story, certainly shows the attorney general heaping criticism on Catholic church leaders.\n\"One of my great frustrations as a Catholic, present company excepted, is how soft and weak the leadership of my church has been,\" Cuccinelli said. \"They have for decades lobbied government to do this and to do that -- all of which should be done by the church if they\u2019re done at all in society. And so over time they have made themselves out to be nothing but the largest special interest group in America.\"\nBegala, to support his statement that Cuccinelli \"attacked churches for helping the poor,\" zeroed in on a comment the Republican made about Catholic bishops:\n\"They\u2019ve helped create a culture of dependency on government, not God,\" Cuccinelli said, lamenting that bishops were arguing churches \"shouldn\u2019t be the primary institution in a society that is responsible for service to the poor.\"\nBut that statement doesn\u2019t strike us as \"an attack on churches for helping the poor.\" To the contrary, Cuccinelli was criticizing what he said was an effort by the church to hand off some of its charitable role to government.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCuccinelli stressed that point later in his speech:\n\"Two most important things in human life -- your faith in God and, as between ourselves, love -- and government can do neither, can do neither one,\" he said. \"And our churches are asking that institution -- and have for decades -- to step up and take on their role.\"\nCuccinelli made a similar argument in his 2013 book, \"The Last Line of Defense.\"\n\"One reason the American people got stuck with Obamacare was due to a devolution in American thinking over time that it was the government\u2019s job to provide health care for those who couldn\u2019t afford it on their own,\" Cuccinelli wrote. \"But taking care of the poor is ideally the province first of families, churches and charities, not the government.\"\nA final note: The Democratic Governors Association, for whom Begala wrote the fundraising letter, is the largest contributor to Cuccinelli\u2019s opponent -- Democrat Terry McAuliffe. It donated $2 million to McAuliffe\u2019s campaign on May 13, according to records compiled by Virginia Public Access Project. \u00a0\nOur Ruling\nBegala said Cuccinelli \"attacked churches for helping the poor,\" a statement that suggests the Republican opposes the charitable work done by religious organizations.\nBut a full reading of Cuccinelli\u2019s comments show he was saying the opposite: That \u00a0charitable work should be the responsibility of religious organizations -- not the government.\nWe rate Begala\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09134"}
