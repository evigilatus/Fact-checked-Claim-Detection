He topped it with a claim about the city\u2019s economy as a whole.\n\"And over the last six years,\" Emanuel said, \"Chicago\u2019s economy has grown faster than the economies of New York City, Washington, D.C., or the national average.\"\nThis has become a standard talking point that Emanuel has repeated often in interviews and public settings.\nWe\u2019ve heard it often, yet we\u2019ve never heard an explanation of what constitutes the economic growth Emanuel claims. We thought it was time for a closer look.\nEconomics 101\nEmanuel\u2019s claim covers a lot of ground, so we contacted his office to find out whether it\u2019s based on specific data, studies or reports. Despite several attempts and an assurance that we\u2019d hear back with an answer, we never did.\nSo our next stop was the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the U.S. Department of Commerce, which is the official source for measuring economic growth nationally and regionally. The numbers there present a mixed bag on Emanuel\u2019s statement.\nUsing gross domestic product as a yardstick from 2011 through 2016 (the most recent year available), Chicago\u2019s economy grew 7.4 percent, which was better than Washington, D.C., (3.8 percent) but lower than that of New York (7.6 percent) and the U.S. as a whole (10.9 percent).\nChicago also led Washington but trailed New York and the nation when using growth in personal income as a standard, said BEA economist Jeff Newman.\nGeoffrey J.D. Hewings, emeritus director of the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory at the University of Illinois, found largely the same results but offered a caveat to judging Emanuel\u2019s statement.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The main problem is that generalities like this depend upon context. Clearly, there is little appreciable difference in the economic performance between Chicago, (New York) and the U.S. as a whole; Chicago does do better than D.C.,\" Hewings said in an email. \"However, given the fiscal problems in Illinois, it is surprising that Chicago has done as well as it has and of course, the city of Chicago has faced significant fiscal challenges as a result of rather creative accounting manipulations in the last decade.\"\nAnother potential measure of economic growth is unemployment, the standard measure of which is gauged by Metropolitan Statistical Area rather than by individual cities.\nUsing the latest full-year average unemployment figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found metropolitan Chicago reduced its unemployment by 41 percent -- from 9.9 percent to 5.8 percent -- between 2011 and 2016. That\u2019s better than Washington\u2019s 37 percent but behind New York\u2019s 44 percent and the United States\u2019 45 percent reduction in unemployment during that time.\nIn September 2017, greater Chicago\u2019s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.1 percent and its year-to-date average is 4.7 percent, according to the Illinois Department of Employment Security.\nBut a report by Moody\u2019s Analytics in June noted that Chicago\u2019s declining unemployment, which this year dipped \"below the national rate for the first time in a decade,\" may not be cause for celebration.\n\"The decline over the past year is larger than that in all but a handful of metro areas and divisions in the country. However, it occurred only because the labor force is contracting,\" wrote Moody\u2019s analyst Sarah Crane.\nCrane cautioned, however, that Emanuel\u2019s claim still has some merit. \u00a0\n\"Chicago\u2019s economy is advancing,\" Crane said in an email, \"but its relative performance to New York, D.C. or the U.S. depends on which economic measures are considered.\"\nOur ruling\nEmanuel said that \"over the last six years, Chicago\u2019s economy has grown faster than the economies of New York City, Washington, D.C., or the national average.\"\nWe don\u2019t know exactly what criteria Emanuel bases this statement on because his office did not respond to repeated requests for specifics. But the most obvious benchmarks for judging economic growth don\u2019t back him up.\nChicago did better than Washington, D.C., on certain metrics, but we found no evidence of it out-performing the New York or national economies over an extended period.
