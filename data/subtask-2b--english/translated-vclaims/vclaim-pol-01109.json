He was sponsoring a bar in Austin, Texas, during the Southwest Music Festival in 2010. He crashed into an engagement photo shoot in 2014. Now, it seems to offer tax advice - at least according to an old viral picture that appears on Facebook again. \"The best way to teach your children about taxes is by eating 30% of ice cream,\" reading the text next to the picture of a young blonde crying boy. It is attributed to Bill Murray, and in the corner there is the Turning Point USA logo, a conservative group defending limited government and free markets. But the quote appeared elsewhere, on Penterness, Goodreads and Federalist Puppers, among others. On the point of the United States of America, in response to a letter from PolitiFact seeking further information on the quote, he pointed out that it was \"all over the Internet and has been for a long time\" before we went to CBS News. There the quotation appears in the presentation of undated images called \"the best financial wisdom lines of comedians.\" However, this picture was highlighted as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) When the quote appeared on Reddit about a year ago, users were also suspicious. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman on January 12, 2021. \"Don't think Bill Murray said that,\" says one comment. \"It doesn't even look like a joke he was making\" was pointed out by another user. Someone else taught the mail, simply: \"Not Bill Murray.\" We have not been able to find credible evidence that the representative saw the IRS. Murray himself is hard to reach. But we found the ice cream quote elsewhere: Twitter, where in March 2014 Bill Murray prady's account with @billmoreray's handle tweeted it. \"I'm not Bill Murray,\" says the resume of the account. \"This account does not in any way belong to actor Bill Murray.\" We value this allegation wrong.
