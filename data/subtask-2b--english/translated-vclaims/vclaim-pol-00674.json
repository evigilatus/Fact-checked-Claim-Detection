Several media organizations have been identified in the alleged conspiracy, including Rapler, a news website, and VERA Files, a non-profit publication to verify the facts. According to the story in the Times, written by Dante A. Aang, \"there is a clear pattern of close coordination among some media organizations to produce anti-dizziness stories in a timely manner.\" Rapler and Vera's files, among other things, denied the charge. We looked into allegations that were part of such a conspiracy and found no credible evidence to support the idea that Filipino journalists conspired to overthrow the President. Let's look at what we know. The Manila Times story, if you are unaware of Philippine politics, is fast-tracking: Rodrigo Dottie was elected president in 2016, having nominated himself as a strong candidate in the fight against crime. Since then, an anti-drug campaign has led to the deaths of thousands of people there. Since local news organizations covered the killings and drew international attention to the country of South-East Asia, Dotert accused journalists of lying, threatened to block the renewal of licences for the largest broadcasting network, ABS-CBN, and said that journalists \"are not exempt from assassination.\" In this context, on 22 April, the article accusing journalists of conspiring against the President was published on the Manila Times website. Aang's writer is the head of the honorary newspaper. He is also the Special Envoy for International Public Relations in the Philippines, a post appointed by Doterty. \"The playbook is so familiar,\" Aang wrote in the story. \"Use the media, plant false news, distribute it to friendly media, beat people's appetite, provoke anger, manipulate public emotion, touch Al Qaeda with the leftist organization, mobilize police and military support, and then go for \"murder.\" At the center of the story is a visual matrix that says Aang \"prove what appears to be a coordinated media campaign to discredit the President.\" The matrix looks like a flow chart with lines defined as \"links\" between the parties. According to the matrix, a website called Metrobalita.net is linked to a person named \"Picwe\" and \"Picwe\" associated with Ellen Tordezias, the head of Vera's files. Ang wrote that \"black publicity\" from Picoi is being directed to Tordisis. Thus, Toridias \"acts as a link and distributes materials\" to the Philippine investigative press centre, Rapler and the National Federation of People's Lawyers. Then they \"distribute their false stories to their organs\" Who's Piccoy? Piccoy is the alias of a man who recently posted videos on the Internet accusing the Dotret family members of taking advantage of the illicit drug trade, according to April 23, in Inquierer, the country's leading newspaper. Piccoy also accused former Special Assistant to the President of involvement in illicit drugs. According to Inquireer, Duttert undertook to retaliate against those behind the videos, and the country &apos; s Minister of Justice ordered cybercrime investigators to prosecute them. In the matrix in Ing's story, Picoi is associated with two parties: Tordias and Metro Paleta. When we visited Metropolita. Net on May 1, we received a false message that the IP server address could not be found. We checked with Benjamin Decker, who studies the dissemination of misleading information on the Internet, and he said that the site was created on March 31. Nevertheless, the Internet service provider in the Netherlands, he said. This area is used by a company that is a host of privacy to hide its true ownership. Who are the media organizations, and what do you say? Rappler, VERA files and Philippine investigative press centre, media organizations named in The Manila Times, \"I consider the matrix to be unfounded,\" according to April 24, Rappler. The Philippine investigative press centre states that it has not received any e-mails from Todrisella from Vera's files about Pecoy videos, nor has it published or distributed stories or comments about them. For its part, Tordias wrote about the videos on April 5 in an article entitled \"Comment\" on Vera's file site. Two videos from Picoi, who is alleged to be a former member of a drug union, appeared on YouTube two weeks after the publication of a list of local officials allegedly involved in drug trafficking, by Tordezias. She described the videos, posted pictures of them, shared reactions from the Dotret family members, but did not publish the videos herself. Tordisillas says that her involvement in the so-called conspiracy is \"fully false.\" \"That's funny,\" written on April 24th. \"But what I find disturbing is, if this is the kind of intelligence report that the President gets and builds on, his actions and policies, the country is in big trouble.\" Like PoliticFact, Vera Files and Rapler, a partnership with Facebook as a third party in fact-checking to combat misinformation on the social media platform. In 2017, the files of Rapler and VERA qualified as signatories to the International Fact-Finding Network Code of Principles. *Disclosing: PolitiFact is run by the Pointer Institute for Media Studies, a non-profit press training institution. Polyte Fact is also a member of the International Fact-Finding Network, which itself is a business unit in Pointer.) The Philippine Government protested the partnerships of news organizations with Facebook. A presidential speaker said that it was \"unacceptable\" and described fact-checkers as \"party\" and \"opponents of the administration.\" The rapler was critical of Dortity's administration, and the president attacked her reporters before. In March, Maria Risa, a co-founder of the Electronic News Organization in 2011, arrested her for violating the laws relating to the foreign ownership of a company with members of Rapler. In late 2018, Risa was one of many journalists from all over the world who used to call \"the person of the year\" Time magazine. It is also one of the 100 most influential people at the time in the year 2019. \"Her arrest is the last step in a more repressive campaign against the media by Mr. Duterte, who accused journalists of being 'cowards' and'sons of bitches',\" published by the New York Times at the time. Risa said that the attacks against her turned aggressive after Rapler published a release in 2016 showing how Dottie Facebook supporters manipulated support for his leadership, as the New York Times said, and Rapler was the focus of many of the Dotret's campaign against the media. What is the evidence of a conspiracy? The Manila Times and the President &apos; s Office did not respond immediately to e-mails sent in search of evidence that journalists were cooperating to destabilize the Government. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, but the editor-in-chief of the Manila Times, Philip Salvosa II, objected to the publication of Ang's story and resigned in its wake. Salvosa, also a journalist at the University of Santo Thomas, was asked to resign after writing on Facebook that \"the drawing is by no means a sign of \"instability\" or \"a more exclusive conspiracy,\" according to a story published in The Manila Times. Salvosa ABS-CBN News, another media outlet in the Philippines, said that he was planning to stop: \"I felt it was time to go after the publication of the Matrix. Dante Francis \"Klink\" Aang II, President of the Manila Times and Chief Executive Officer, Salvosa, said unethically, according to a story in the newspaper. It is also \"in defence of the validity of the matrix, saying that Dotiert's office itself provided information to the Manila Times.\" \"The Manila Times stands next to our article 'The Matrix', which is a story in itself,\" quotes Ang 2 as it says. \"As we explained to Mr. Salvosa, our honorary President, had a reliable source - no less than the office of the President of the Philippines. Mr. Salvosa was also informed that our Honorary President had examined his background, using several sources, before presenting his liberation project. The scrap story wasn't a piece of public relations. It was legitimate news. The appointment of Dr. Aang as Special Envoy does not have any clause, position in the Government or remuneration of any kind. He was simply acting on his journalistic instincts after giving him the opportunity to write a legitimate story, which was later confirmed by the palace.\" In a speech on 21 April, before the Manila Times published its conspiracy story, Dotiert said that he would publish smart information from a foreign country showing the extent of corruption in the media, according to Inquireer. But he said he didn't know the source of the information. \"She just arrived at my table,\" quotes Dutterte as he says. \"But based on how you write it, I know it's not Filipino. We've revised it and translated it. It wasn't written in our language.\" The story also quotes the spokesman for the Presidential Palace, Salvador Kojo, who states that the matrix was based on \"intelligence information gathered by a foreign country\" and that it was ratified. The Panel stated that it had received a copy of the matrix from the Office of the President, according to the Philippine daily Inquierer on 22 April: \"From the President himself. I don't know how he got one. But it's coming from the President. I spoke to him that day.\" But the story of May 2 of ABS-CBN shows the spokesperson tracking backwards, claiming he got the matrix from an unknown source, not Dutterte. \"President Dutert didn't give anything,\" ABS-CBN quotes Quinto as he says. Someone sent me a matrix. I told you someone sent me a message.\" When we reached out to Gemma Mendoza, who is leading Rapler &apos; s fact-finding efforts, she referred to another story that was published on the same day as the Manila Times &apos; allegations of dismissal. According to the Philippine daily Inquireer, the Armed Forces of the Philippines stated that they had not detected any specific threat to vacate Dorterty from the seat. Minister of Justice Menardo Guevara said that there was no \"now\" sufficient basis for the Ministry of Justice of the country to investigate journalists and lawyers identified in the matrix, as Rapler stated. \"We will let more facts unfold first,\" quotes the director of Guevara's statement. (The Ministry of Justice did not reply to Poletti Fact &apos; s e-mail regarding the alleged conspiracy.) On April 23, the story of Inquireer indicates that the Philippine National Police has no evidence of a destabilizing conspiracy despite the fact that its president, Oscar Albayaldi, \"said he was not ignoring the fact that there was a destabilizing conspiracy.\" \"I'm sure it's not just Picoi,\" quotes Inquireer Albayalde as he says. \"Someone's planning this because everything's written, and I'm sure it requires a little financial support.\" An attack on the free press? The media organizations mentioned in an alleged conspiracy believe that the accusations are an attack on the free press. \"Free, independent and monetary press is a feature of democracy,\" wrote by the Center for Press Investigations, and concluded its article on the alleged conspiracy. \"A press that looks to the authorities who are avoiding their responsibility to inform the people fully about issues of serious public concern is making a mockery of their purpose.\" Risa, of Rapler, called the so-called conspiracy \"another mansion trick to harass journalists.\" On 29 April, Vera's files published a story calling for an end to \"the intimidation of independent media.\" The presidential palace and the Manila Times \"didn't come up with anything to support their false report, claiming that journalists, news organizations and a group of lawyers were involved in an outcast plot,\" tell the story. He continues: \"The matrix story would have been funny if it hadn't been deliberately designed to confuse the public's mind with lies and endanger the lives of the people named in the graph,\" says the article. \"It came from the highest official in the country who swore the oath to preserve and defend the Constitution and \"the work of justice for every man\" is extremely disturbing and must not be tolerated.\" Sheila Coronel, Director of the Tony Stabel investigative press centre at Columbia University and Dean of the Press College, helped find the Philippine investigative press centre in 1989. Her name appears in the matrix. No one at the centre received messages about Pecoy videos, as the story claims, until only Tordias wrote about them told Coronel Poletti Fact. \"The matrix is part of a series of attacks on independent media,\" said Coronel. In particular, Sly said, the Manila Times charge that the files of VERA, Center and Rapler \"received the magnitude from various foreign sources.\" \"It seems that they have received substantial foreign funding, which is contrary to our Constitution, and therefore these media can't claim objectivity,\" says the original Manila Times story. Their dizzy stories become a suspect. Coronel referred to Facebook as an example. As we have stated, Vera and Rapler's files, such as Polyte Fact, have a partnership with Facebook and are paid to verify the truth of distorted information on the Internet. If an information organization receives funding from an institution from another country, can the Philippine Government say that it acts on behalf of a foreign government? \"We fear that they will eventually be used to curb independent media,\" said Coronel. Donald Trump said that United States publications could not receive funds from charitable organizations - and that a news organization would close down for such funding. Ronald Holmes, president of Asia Research Pulses, an organization in the Philippines that monitors political issues there, said that the Manila Times claims that the story is being targeted by \"independent investigative journalists.\" More than a week after the story appeared, no independent organization verified it. David Temperman, a political analyst with several decades of experience in analysing political and governance issues in South Asia, noted that Dotert and his supporters were putting \"a lot of pressure\" on independent media. He said, \"The president often cites alleged conspiracies to overthrow him as a means of discrediting him and attacking his opponents.\" John Gershman, Professor of Public Service at New York University, said that there was no press conspiracy to fire Dort: \"If this matrix is actually from a foreign intelligence source,... I was going to read it as an attempt by the President to silence his critics through intimidation and put them under the harassment of his allies.\" This is not the first time that the President has issued a \"matrix,\" as Ronald Mendoza, Dean of the Atino School of Government of the Philippines, said. In 2016, for example, officials were trapped in a matrix linking them to the drug trade and later apologized for their inclusion. The Government's allegations \"often lack strong evidence and appear to reflect more than reality,\" said Mendoza Politi Fukte. \"Many of us are now afraid that this will be a tactic to control different groups, and it has not shown exactly where he gets \"spying\" from.\" Where does that leave us? The Manila Times published a story claiming that Filipino journalists were part of a plot to expel President Rodrigo Duarte. However, we found no evidence of the allegation other than the President &apos; s statement, which made death threats against some journalists, and his spokesman. But even this source is weak. Dutert said he didn't know where the information came from: \"She just got to my table.\" Recently, his spokesman refuted earlier allegations that the President had provided him with a copy of the matrix and was now saying that an unknown party had sent it to him. Stephen Butler, coordinator of the Asia programme of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, said \"unsupported allegations of a conspiracy against the President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Dorterty, who was transferred by the President himself, poses a direct threat to critical journalists.\" Dortari's government must recognize that critical journalism is a key element of sound democracy, not evidence of a subversive conspiracy. If such evidence appears, we will revisit the allegations against Filipino journalists in the matrix. But for now, we're assessing this statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00674"}
