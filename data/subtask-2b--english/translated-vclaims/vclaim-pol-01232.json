Is McKinley's statement accurate? Earlier this year, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis - the Federal Office which calculates state economic growth - showed that West Virginia ranked eleventh in inflation-adjusted GDP growth between 2016 and 2017, with an increase of 2.6 per cent. This isn't like an eighth, but it's close. However, these data were subsequently updated, and the latest data are less favourable for West Virginia. In the most recent calculations, West Virginia in fact classified 19 out of 50 states in year-to-year changes in GDP, with an increase of 2.2 per cent. So West Virginia was in the first half of the estimate table, but much lower than eighth place ends that McKinley cited. The most impressive measure for the State was the one not mentioned by McKinley -- the increase in per capita GDP, which is a statistics that adjusts the size of growth to represent the population of the State. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy, January 20, 2012, using these statistics, West Virginia was ranked first with Washington State. Both registered an increase of 2.9 per cent between 2016 and 2017. According to analysts, the expansion of the mining sector in West Virginia was the lion &apos; s share of the growth of the State &apos; s GDP. It should also be noted that one of the reasons for the high per capita GDP growth rates in West Virginia is the loss of population - not a positive sign for the State. The McKinley office did not respond to any query. \"Last year we had the eighth fastest growing economy in the country in West Virginia,\" said Governor McKinley. In fact, the final data show that West Virginia was slightly lower, at 19. It would have been better for the State to use different statistics that McKinley did not mention -- GDP growth per capita, where it was first associated. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong.
