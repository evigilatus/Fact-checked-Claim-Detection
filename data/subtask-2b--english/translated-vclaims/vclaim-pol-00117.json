The Florida Republican Party now repeats a familiar point of dialogue that a new green agreement would create a scary price mark. \"Democracy proposes a new 93 trillion dollar green deal that trade unions have condemned as a career killer and put a tax burden of $600,000 on each family.\" Florida's GOP tweeted in September 20. We have previously validated a 93 trillion dollar claim and classified it as false. (President Donald Trump raises the claim value to $100 trillion.) We will explain here why the US$ 600,000 is also misleading. We found that there is no government analysis of the cost of the new green deal per family. This is partly due to the fact that the new green agreement reflects the objectives; it does not define specific policies. The figure of $600,000 is based on the addition of estimates in a report from the centre's right-hand group, which warned that it was a \"preliminary farce.\" However, the point of discussion in the Global Programme of Action is too much to simplify the analysis to the extent that the figure of $600,000 cannot be considered accurate. The basics of the new green agreement are the decision of the House of Representatives, submitted by the United States Republic of America, Alexandria, Ocacio-Cortez, in February. The decisions are not actual and detailed legislation per se. In this case, the resolution of the new Green Accord in the Council - and the accompanying procedure introduced in the Senate - deal with general principles for reducing climate change and protecting the environment. The decisions extend to other areas of domestic policy, including jobs and health care. However, the proposal did not specify any cost figures and did not receive an estimate of costs from the non-partisan budget office in Congress. The decision of the Council was referred to several committees and subcommittees for further review. In the meantime, the Republican-led Senate voted against this measure in March after it was introduced by Sin Ed Marki, Dr. Mass, and was co-sponsored by several Democrats in the Senate to run for President. The source of the figure did not reply to our questions about the source of its evidence, but conservative news outlets cited the figure of $600,000 from a February report of the American Labour Forum, a think tank based on the Centre &apos; s right. The American Action Forum is a sister organization of the American Action Network, a conservative advocacy organization. The American Action Forum recognized the difficulty of reaching a number of costs, saying that \"the breadth of its proposals makes it difficult to assess\" and that many of the proposed policies are redundant, \"which also complicates a thorough analysis.\" In one interview on 31 January 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \"has dropped more water in Houston in five days than in Niagara Falls in one year.\" However, it shows the estimated cost per household of different parts of the new green agreement, some of which have been expressed in ranges. The Florida GOP tweet said that the new green deal \"will place a tax burden of $600,000 on each family\" -- which could indicate a significant increase in taxes on each family. However, the analysis of the American Labour Forum does not in fact indicate that each family will pay that cost in new taxes. The costs identified in the analysis have been distributed for almost a decade, from 2020 to 2029. Douglas Holtz-Ekin, President of the American Labour Forum and former Chief of the Budget Office of Congress, told Politi Fruitte that he was adhering to the analysis. He said, \"We didn't actually add it.\" \"We tried to get the size order, what are we looking at here? That was the intention of the first piece.\" If we combine the high range in each category, this adds up to $671,010 between 2020 and 2029. If we combine the low range in each category, it amounts to $369,010. In order to arrive at an estimate, the American Labour Forum has made a series of assumptions, such as that the new green agreement will lead to sufficient rapid rail transport so that air travel is not necessary. The actual text of the resolution does not call for the landing of aircraft. \"We're not sure we're gonna be able to get out of the wind of cows and planes so quickly,\" said the Okacio Cortez team in a very folded FAQ document. However, the Staff Code does not have legislative weight.) The analysis of the American Labour Forum also took into account the costs of medical care for all provided by Bernie Sanders. However, the text of the Senate resolution itself does not include a statement on medical care for all - it calls more broadly for \"high-quality health care.\" (At least some co-sponsors, however, support separate legislation on universal medical care.) Holtz-Ikin said that he had hoped to show more detail from supporters who would allow a more specific cost analysis, but that had not happened. Our ruling in the Florida GOP states that the new green deal \"will place a tax burden of $600,000 on each family.\" The New Green Compact is a set of objectives; it does not impose specific taxes. Instead, the figure of $600,000 comes from a summary that acknowledges that its author, the right-to-status American work forum, is a rough initial estimate. The analysis did not indicate that each household would pay an additional $600,000 in taxes. Instead, costs that may be under a range of scenarios have been estimated over a period of 10 years. The decision could eventually lead to legislation that could be formally analysed to cover potential costs, but at this stage, such costs could not be determined.
