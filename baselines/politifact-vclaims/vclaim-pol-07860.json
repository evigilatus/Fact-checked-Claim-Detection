Republican strategist and Fox News commentator Karl Rove proved the point at an event near Los Angeles last Thursday.\nIn remarks reported in the New York Post, Rove raised questions about Clinton\u2019s health following a mild concussion in 2012.\n\"Thirty days in the hospital,\" Rove said. \"And when she reappears, she's wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what's up with that.\"\nMany people took Rove\u2019s comments to mean that he thinks Clinton has a brain injury, though Rove says he was just raising the question and that it should be part of any presidential vetting.\nThere are two points for us to cover in this fact check -- the time Clinton spent in the hospital and the nature of the glasses she wore for weeks afterward. (She doesn\u2019t wear them now.)\nFirst, the background. In December 2012, a stomach virus kept Clinton at home where she fainted and hit her head. During a follow-up visit, doctors spotted a blood clot, admitted her to the hospital and treated her with blood thinners.\nClinton was in the hospital for about four days, not 30, a point Rove got wrong. (In a subsequent interview, Rove said it was a \"30-day period where she\u2019s fighting something.\")\nClinton testified near the end of January at a House hearing on the Benghazi, Libya, attack, and was seen wearing the glasses Rove referred to. A State Department spokesman said they were related to issues stemming from her concussion. The peculiar shape of one of the lenses led experts and doctors to conclude they were prismatic glasses.\nThe glasses are designed to help with blurred or double vision, experts told us. We spoke with Steven Galetta, who is chair of the Neurology Department at New York University Medical Center.\n\"About 30 to 50 percent of concussions lead to some kind of visual problem,\" Galetta said. \"When there\u2019s double vision, we can manage it by putting a prism over one eye. It bends the light to line up the image from the other eye.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaletta said the glasses are often optional. Whether someone wears them depends on how quickly the person wants to get back to work.\n\"Most patients resolve (the issues) on their own,\" he said. \"I\u2019d say 85 to 90 percent of these patients do incredibly well and have no recognizable symptoms afterwards.\"\nGiven Clinton\u2019s job as Secretary of State, Galetta said he could see why her doctors might have jumped in to deal with her complaint. Rove exagerated the tie between the glasses and trauma. Galetta said such lenses are used in cases other than traumatic brain injury. Anything that affects the ocular motor nerves or the way the eyes work\u00a0together can produce double vision that then might be treated with prismatic glasses.\nSo while Rove said the glasses are used \"only\" for people with traumatic brain injury, doctors say that is incorrect.\nMore broadly, Rove\u2019s characterization of Clinton\u2019s concussion as a traumatic brain injury generated a bit of concern among the physicians we reached. Doug Smith is a professor of neurosurgery and director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania. Smith said the public might not understand how broadly the term applies.\nThe Centers for Disease Control report that 2.2 million head injuries sent people to the emergency room in 2010.\n\"Technically, a concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury,\" Smith said. \"But Rove made a linkage that doesn\u2019t fit. Having a concussion and wearing those glasses tell you nothing about a person\u2019s cognitive status. The vast majority of people with concussions make a full recovery.\"\nOur ruling\nRove said Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital and then emerged wearing glasses that only people with traumatic brain injury use. Rove since said he was wrong about the length of her hospital stay. The actual number is four days. By describing a long hospital stay and tying it to signs of traumatic brain injury, Rove associated Clinton with a more profound medical episode. Experts reject that association.\nConcussions are the mildest form of traumatic brain injury. The glasses Clinton wore are an optional treatment for temporary problems of double vision that are relatively common among people who suffer concussions along with other conditions. She has not worn the glasses for some time, and the neurologists we contacted said most people recover fully.\nWhile Rove never claimed Clinton suffered brain damage, he was wrong about the hospital stay and combined that with the glasses to exaggerate the nature of Clinton\u2019s injury. His claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07860"}
