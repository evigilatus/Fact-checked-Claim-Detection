Ron Stephens, chairman of the House Economic Development and Tourism Committee.\n\n\"We spend less dollars advertising than any other state in the South,\" Stephens said in an Aug. 6 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution about oversight of city tourism funds.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the kind of thing we\u2019d expect the head of the tourism committee to say. But is it true? We asked the Savannah Republican for more information.\n\nWe feel obliged to note that Georgia and its cities have a checkered history in tourism marketing.\n\nState taxpayers will be paying $1.2 million annually for the next few decades on former Gov. Sonny Perdue\u2019s \"Go Fish\" tourism program.\n\nPerdue's vision for the plan was to make Georgia \"a fisherman's paradise\" by developing the economy, attracting high-dollar fishing tournaments, improving access to state lakes and increasing angling participation.\n\nCritics argue it was a pork project for Perdue\u2019s hometown, Bonaire, which is near the Go Fish Education Center.\n\nAnd there\u2019s Brand Atlanta, a shuttered effort to market Georgia\u2019s capital city. It raised some $8 million between 2005 and 2006 from corporations and government, including $1 million from the convention and visitors bureau. The campaign featured a widely panned theme song.\n\nBut the budget went bust during the Great Recession, its staff was laid off in 2008 and Brand Atlanta is no more.\n\nState tourism funds shrank as the economy stumbled, and Stephens thinks it\u2019s a shame. \u00a0\n\n\"If we advertise the jewels we have, then more people will come here and we\u2019ll get that money back,\" Stephens said.\n\nStephens said his statement about low spending referred to the amount of money state governments spend to promote tourism, as well as the number of dollars spent per capita. It excludes spending by the city of Atlanta and other localities.\n\nStephens referred us to data collected by the Georgia Department of Economic Development.\n\nA department spokeswoman sent us state-by-state figures compiled by the U.S. Travel Association, an industry group that researches and promotes travel to and within the country. \u00a0\n\nPolicymakers, other trade organizations and media use USTA\u2019s numbers widely. We were unable to find another organization that collects similar data. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe started our analysis by separating out USTA data for Southern states. This is more difficult than you might think.\n\nGovernment agencies disagree on what counts as the South. Born and bred Southerners do, too.\n\nEven some newcomers get the vapors when Yankees lump South Florida in with the rest of us. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, the official U.S. census definition includes Oklahoma.\n\nReally? We thought. Do they even sell sweet tea there?\n\nWe struck a Great Compromise and focused on the 11 states that formally seceded from the Union during the Civil War, plus Kentucky. (What would the South be without Kentucky or its bourbon?)\n\nThen we crunched the numbers for fiscal year 2011-2012.\n\nGeorgia was second only to Kentucky in the lowest amount spent on tourism. Our fiscal year 2011-2012 provisional budget stood at $2,551,516, according to USTA data. Kentucky\u2019s was $1,888,300.\n\nThe Peach State fared worse in other measures of state tourism spending.\n\nThe population and budgets of Southern states vary widely, so we considered two additional pieces of data that take these differences into account: The amount of state tourism funding allocated per capita, which Stephens also said was the lowest in the South; and tourism allocations as a portion of a state\u2019s budget.\n\nGeorgia ranked last on a per capita basis at $0.26 per person. Arkansas placed first at $3.05 per person.\n\nGeorgia also ranked last on tourism advertising as a portion of the state budget. During fiscal year 2012, Georgia set aside 0.014 percent of its general fund budget toward tourism advertising.\n\nKentucky was the second-lowest on our list. Once again, Arkansas placed first.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nStephens said that Georgia\u2019s state government spends fewer tourism advertising dollars than any other in the South. He was right in the metrics that matter most: per capita spending, and spending as a percentage of state budget.\n\nIn dollars, Stephens was close. Only Kentucky spends less.\n\nStephens earns a True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10594"}
