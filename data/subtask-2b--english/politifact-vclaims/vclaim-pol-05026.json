Look no further, Amy Schumer has the product for you.\nIn a recent sketch on her Comedy Central show Inside Amy Schumer, Schumer and fellow comedian Kyle Dunnigan play infomercial hosts pitching viewers on the perfect \"stocking stuffer\": a handgun. A hopeful buyer laments that he can\u2019t get a gun because he has a criminal record riddled with felonies.\n\"Caller, you bite your tongue, you silly goose!\" Schumer\u2019s character says. \"You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies, as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show.\"\n\n\"If you go to a gun show, you can get an unlicensed seller to sell you a gun, no questions asked,\" Dunnigan added\nWe\u2019ve looked at similar claims before. Because this sketch is getting a lot of attention, we wanted to recap whether a felon can actually buy a gun on the Internet or at a gun show.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Schumer has tackled gun issues; she has been a vocal advocate for stricter gun laws since a gunman killed two and injured many others at a showing of her feature film Trainwreck in a Louisiana movie theater in 2015.\nBut it is her first time on the Truth-O-Meter.\nThe 'gun show loophole'\nTo be clear: The kind of transaction Schumer\u2019s character describes is illegal. Federal law prohibits felons from getting a gun unless their rights have been formally restored.\nFelons can theoretically get around this obstacle, however, by buying guns from unlicensed sellers who are not required to conduct criminal background checks. This is sometimes referred to as the \"gun show loophole,\" even though it refers to all private sales, and not everyone considers it a loophole.\nSchumer\u2019s sketch was referring to this aspect of current gun law, said a spokesman for Everytown for Gun Safety, gun control advocacy group Schumer promotes at the end of the sketch.\nAnyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms \"with the principal motive of making a profit\" is supposed to get a dealer\u2019s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, a gun show, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun.\nBut the law does not require a dealer\u2019s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns. If an individual buys a gun from someone who is not required to have a license, the purchaser does not have to undergo a background check.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo a violent felon could buy a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet or at a gun show because he or she would not be subject to a background check. The purchase would still be illegal, because of the buyer\u2019s felon status, but it would not create an immediate red flag. The same thing can happen at a gun show.\nThere are a few important limitations on these sorts of private transactions.\nFirst, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But private sellers \"can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions,\" Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis, previously told PolitiFact.\nSo in the case of Schumer\u2019s show, she and her co-host would not have that cushion of plausible deniability because the hopeful buyer told them outright that he is a felon. The giant \"gun show\" banner doesn\u2019t make a difference.\nSecond, private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transaction is likely to take place in person, as opposed to the buyer entering credit card information online, and the seller shipping the gun to the buyer\u2019s house.\nAnd third, several states \u2014 California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington \u2014 and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales.\nWith all these restrictions, how many people actually buy guns without a background check? The truth is we don\u2019t really know. The only statistics floating around are outdated and flawed.\nProfessors at Northeastern and Harvard universities conducted a gun survey in 2015 that isn\u2019t yet published. The national survey of 4,000 non-institutionalized adults found that 22 percent of the people who purchased guns \u2014 at gun shows, stores or elsewhere \u2014 underwent no background check, Matthew Miller, professor of Health Sciences and Epidemiology at Northeastern and co-director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, told us in January.\nWhen researchers excluded purchases between family and friends, that number dropped to 15 percent, which equates to approximately 5 million gun owners whose most recent purchase did not involve a background check.\nOne more thing: Later in Schumer\u2019s sketch, another hopeful buyer calls in to ask if he can get a gun even though he\u2019s a suspected terrorist on the no-fly list.\n\"You\u2019re fine, sweet potato fry,\" Schumer\u2019s character says.\nA March 2015 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office examined how many people applying for gun purchases went through the FBI\u2019s instant background check system and also were on the FBI\u2019s list of \"those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity.\"\nBetween February 2004, and December 2014, 2,233 people on the list applied to buy a weapon. Of those, 2,043 were allowed to proceed.\nOur ruling\nSchumer\u2019s character said, \"You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show.\"\nThe kind of transaction Schumer described is possible, though illegal, and far more complicated than her comment suggests. Federal law prohibits felons from buying guns. But with some effort, they could purchase a gun from private sellers over the Internet or at a gun show without getting caught, because private sellers are not required to run background checks.\nSchumer is doing a comedy bit, but compared with similar claims we\u2019ve checked, her phrasing makes it sound like buying guns with a felony is easy and lawful. That is not the case. The context is significant. We rate her claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ca5b556b-81f3-4a7d-bf47-77c40966a6af", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05026"}
