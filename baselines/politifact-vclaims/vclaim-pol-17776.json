To hurt us. To injure my wife and kids so I will shut up and stop disagreeing with them. They believe in force.\"\nCarlson identified the reporter of the story as Murray Carpenter, a freelance writer who sometimes writes for the Times.\u00a0\nBy the following day, people were angrily sharing Carpenter\u2019s photo online.\u00a0\n\"This puke from the NEW YORK TIMES has published Tucker Carlson\u2019s home address & location,\" one post said. \"ANTIFA has shown up threatening his wife & kids.
