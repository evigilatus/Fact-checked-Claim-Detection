Vegetable oils fall in the same category.\n\nAccording to the EPA\u2019s website, milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of President Richard Nixon.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe EPA site says \"since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of \u2018oil\u2019 from the Clean Water Act.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn February 2009, the EPA announced that it intended to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. Here\u2019s what the announcement said:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade \"A\" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance,\" or similar state laws.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn simple English, that means large milk storage containers will no longer have to meet the EPA\u2019s oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws.\n\nThe change took effect in April 2011.\n\n\"EPA determined that this unintended result of the current regulations \u2013 which were designed to prevent oil spill damage to inland waters and shorelines \u2013 placed unjustifiable burdens on dairy farmers,\" the agency said in a press release.\n\nWe\u2019re not addressing Obama\u2019s projection of costs of $10,000 to some farmers, but we note that the EPA estimated that the rule change would save the industry $140 million a year.\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama said his administration got rid of a rule that regulated milk in the same manner as oil, as an environmental hazard when spilled.\n\nThe original regulation had been in effect since 1973, and the EPA under Obama moooooooved it out in April 2011.
