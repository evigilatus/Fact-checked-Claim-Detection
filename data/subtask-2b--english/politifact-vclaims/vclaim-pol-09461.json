Could your unsuspecting roommates face a felony?\n\nThe bill, known as the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013, faces votes on a series of amendments, most prominently one proposed by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa.\n\nSo all bets are off on the bill\u2019s final language.\n\nStill, as the debate unfolds, we were curious: Does Senate Bill 649 make felons of vacationing gun owners with roommates or house guests?\n\nGun transfers\n\nAs introduced in the Senate in March, S. 649 requires background checks for all gun sales, with a limited set of exceptions.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just sales that are subject to the law \u2014 but gun \"transfers.\" In general, it would be illegal to give your gun to someone else without seeking a federal background check.\n\nBut there are a series of exceptions that seek to loosen the requirement in some situations \u2014 for example, handing your gun to a friend at a shooting range or while hunting legally together, giving a gun as a gift to a close relative or leaving a gun in a will.\n\nIt\u2019s also okay under the bill to lend your gun to someone in your own home or yard \u2014 as long as that \"temporary transfer\" lasts less than seven days.\n\nThus, the issue raised by the Arizona Citizens Defense League.\n\n\"While the proposed legislation contains limited exceptions for transfers such as between family members,\" says the email, sent to supporters April 10, \"a little digging shows that you would be committing a federal felony if you ... \u00a0leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms.\"\n\nSo, what happens if a buddy house-sits or a roommate stays home during your eight-day vacation?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer: It would likely depend on the circumstances.\n\n\"I would say it should be changed to \u2018you might be committing a federal felony if you leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms,\u2019\" said Clark Neily, who helped represent security guard Dick Heller in his successful Supreme Court challenge to D.C.\u2019s handgun ban.\n\nIf you locked up your guns and expressly forbade others from using them, you would have a pretty good argument that you hadn\u2019t transferred possession, attorneys told us.\n\nBut say your weapons were available to guests or roommates \u2014 that nothing would prevent them from using your guns while you were out of town. Then you might have a problem.\n\nThe federal government tends to have an expansive definition of \"possession,\" under various laws, Neily said.\n\n\"I would say there is a real possibility that someone could be convicted under S. 649 for leaving town for more than seven days while someone else is at home with their guns,\" he said.\n\nStill, a house guest\u2019s mere \"access\" to your weapons wouldn\u2019t necessarily qualify as possession, said Larry Rosenthal, a law professor at Chapman University School of Law who has worked as a federal prosecutor and argued before the Supreme Court as an attorney for the City of Chicago.\n\nHe pointed to a 2012 case decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals\u2019 Seventh Circuit, United States vs. Griffin, in which a felon had been convicted of illegally possessing firearms and ammunition because he lived with his dad, who had hunting gear around the house.\n\nThe court overturned the conviction, explaining the government\u2019s argument \"confuses access with possession,\" Rosenthal said.\n\nMeanwhile, just staying in a home with weapons \u2014 especially if the house-sitter or roommate didn\u2019t know they were there \u2014 wouldn\u2019t plausibly qualify as a \"transfer\" of a firearm, Rosenthal said. There would have to be a \"knowing passage of control.\"\n\nSo leaving your roommate home alone for weeks, oblivious to the shotgun under your bed, likely wouldn\u2019t violate the bill\u2019s provisions.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAn Arizona group says a gun bill before the Senate would make it a federal felony to \"leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms.\"\n\nIndeed, S. 649, as introduced in the Senate, allows for \"temporary transfers\" of guns in your own home that last less than seven days. But leaving a house-sitter or roommate with access to weapons while you\u2019re away for a longer stretch, attorneys explained to PolitiFact, could raise the possibility of violating federal law under the bill\u2019s provisions. Still, experts told us a gun owner might avoid such a consequence by locking up weapons and denying permission to use them. And it\u2019s not clear courts would interpret mere access as a transfer of possession.\n\nThe claim is just partially accurate. We rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09461"}
