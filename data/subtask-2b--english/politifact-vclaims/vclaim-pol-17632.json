They also will approve or reject a plan spearheaded by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker to replace Illinois\u2019 flat income tax with a series of graduated rates intended to make the wealthy pay more.\nThe plan has become a rallying cry for state Democrats, who say it provides an equitable way to raise much-needed revenue. Republicans have come out swinging against it, predicting it will mean future tax hikes for the middle class. We\u2019ve fact-checked a number of assertions on the issue from both sides, including one from state Senate Republican Leader Bill Brady of Bloomington, who inaccurately claimed last summer that Illinois\u2019 last tax hike sent middle-class families fleeing the state.\nAt a recent event for McClean County Republicans, Brady lobbed another attack at Pritzker\u2019s proposal, arguing the governor had \"manipulated\" the issue by touting his plan as a tax hike limited to the state\u2019s wealthiest residents.\n\"Eventually the politicians, after they\u2019ve driven out some of the million-dollar incomes, have to go back down to lower incomes,\" Brady said, according to a report from WGLT, a local NPR station.\nBrady went on to cite Oregon as an example of what Illinois\u2019 future could hold if voters OK the graduated tax measure, which would allow the state to implement higher tax rates on households earning more than $250,000 a year.\n\"In 2012 its (Oregon\u2019s) highest bracket included anyone more than $250,000,\" he said. \"Oregon expanded the upper tax bracket to a levy, the highest being 9.9%, on anyone making more than $125,000.\"\nBrady\u2019s implication is that the same thing could happen for Illinois residents. But is Brady\u2019s Oregon example accurate? Did Oregon lawmakers lower the threshold for the state\u2019s top bracket after 2012 to tax more earners at its highest rate, as Brady suggested? We decided to find out.\nRates went down in 2012 \u2014 not up\nIn 2010, Oregon voters approved a measure that temporarily raised taxes on the state\u2019s biggest earners.\nFrom 2009 through 2011, individuals there making more than $125,000 and couples making more than $250,000 paid a state income tax rate of 10.8% on every dollar exceeding those amounts. Single filers making more than $250,000 and couples earning greater than $500,000 paid 11%.\nIn 2012, the top rate fell to 9.9% for all individual income greater than $125,000 and all joint income above $250,000. Those brackets remain in place today.\nAlthough Brady\u2019s dates are slightly off, the bigger issue with his claim centers on his underlying argument. Oregon\u2019s history does not fit Brady\u2019s narrative of politicians driving out wealthy residents with high top rates and then turning to those who earn less to make up the difference.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, Oregon lawmakers did not reopen the tax code to expand the top bracket to include less wealthy earners after the tax had gone into effect. Instead, voters approved the change as part of the same package that included those higher, temporary rates from 2009 through 2011.\nWhat\u2019s more, single filers making more than $125,000 but less than $250,000 and joint filers making more than $250,000 but less than $500,000 paid less \u2014 not more \u2014 when the permanent top bracket with its lower income threshold took effect than they did as part of the temporary structure\u2019s second-highest bracket.\nSo we asked Brady\u2019s office to explain how Oregon\u2019s history backed up the senator\u2019s argument.\nA spokesman responded that Brady\u2019s claim is accurate because \"the bracket for the top tax rate was broadened\" from what it was when the law initially took effect. He did not address the fact that Oregon\u2019s law also eliminated the higher rate associated with that top bracket and reduced the rate that those who had been in its second-highest bracket now pay.\nOregon also makes a poor example for Brady\u2019s broader case that raising taxes on the rich drives them out of state. Between 2010 and 2017, the latest IRS data show, the number of taxpayers reporting income of $1 million or more grew faster in Oregon than in any other state.\nThat isn\u2019t to suggest Oregon\u2019s graduated tax helped it make those gains. But it does call into question Brady\u2019s assertion that a more progressive rate structure is a recipe for economic disaster.\nOur ruling\nCiting Oregon as an example of what Illinois\u2019 future could hold if voters approve Pritzker\u2019s graduated tax plan, Brady said Oregon\u2019s highest income tax bracket included anyone making more than $250,000 in 2012 before the state expanded that top bracket to include \"anyone making more than $125,000.\"\nIn 2010, Oregon voters approved a measure that temporarily raised the rate for income exceeding $125,000 to 10.8% and earnings over $250,000 to 11%. The same law included a scheduled rate reduction for all income over $125,000 beginning in 2012. Since then, the state has taxed income in its top bracket at 9.9%.\nBrady suggested that Oregon taxpayers earning between $125,000 and $250,000 saw an increase after 2012 because of the bracket change in the state\u2019s graduated income tax measure. While the law did lower the threshold for Oregon\u2019s top tax bracket, all taxpayers in it paid less in taxes than they had for the previous three years because the tax rate was also lowered.\nGiven that his remarks create an inaccurate impression that taxes went up in Oregon after 2012, we rate his claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17632"}
