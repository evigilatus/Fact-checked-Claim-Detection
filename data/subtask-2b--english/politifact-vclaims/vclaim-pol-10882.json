Scott Walker at mid-term, top Wisconsin Democrats insisted the June 5, 2012, election results were not an endorsement of the Republican governor\u2019s political agenda.\n\nAt the party\u2019s convention, Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, put it this way:\n\n\"The GOP is engaging in pure folly if they misread this election to think that the electorate of Wisconsin is fully behind this Walker agenda,\" Barca said. \"Because 70 percent of the people who voted just didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the recall of the governor.\"\n\nHe added: \"After all, Wisconsinites are sort of forgiving people and fair minded people. And I guess they felt when Gov. Walker said, if they gave him another chance he\u2019d do things differently, that he\u2019d build a consensus and work for bipartisanship.\"\n\nBefore the recall rancor recedes into history, let\u2019s look at how voters viewed the recall and what it says about support for Walker\u2019s policies.\n\nTo recall or not to recall\n\nWisconsinites\u2019 qualms about recalls were evident early on.\n\nIn a January 2012 poll Marquette University Law School, more than 40 percent said recalls should only be allowed in cases of criminal wrongdoing by an officeholder. By June, after the recall, another MU poll found 50 percent support for that.\n\nOn election day, widely cited exit poll results by Edison Research addressed head-on the question of the legitimacy of the recall. The firm asked 1,224 voters statewide when recalls are appropriate.\n\n--10 percent said recalls never should happen.\n\n--60 percent said recalls should only occur for official misconduct.\n\n--27 percent said they should happen \"for any reason.\"\n\nThose results show a large majority who felt the recall was inappropriate to the circumstances, at least if you read \"official misconduct\" as some kind of civil or criminal charges by the person being recalled\n\nBarca added the first two results and got the 70 percent figure he cited in his remarks, Eric Greenfield, a Barca legislative office spokesman, told us.\n\nSo, the numbers add up. But is it a fair reading of the exit polls that 70 percent \"didn\u2019t feel comfortable\" with the recall?\n\nCharles Franklin, a political scientist who directs the Marquette poll, told us Barca\u2019s comment stands up based on the exit polls.\n\nSince Walker has not been charged with official misconduct, it\u2019s reasonable to lump the 60 percent in with the 10 percent \"never\" group as people who were not comfortable with the circumstances under which this recall was held, Franklin said.\n\nDavid Wegge, executive director of the Strategic Research Institute at St. Norbert College, agreed. \"Not comfortable\" may actually understate the intensity of the anti-recall feeling, Wegge said. The institute polls regularly on politics and other state issues.\n\nThe Walker agenda\n\nBut there\u2019s another aspect to Barca\u2019s remarks.\n\nHe cited the 70 percent to bolster the notion that support for Walker\u2019s agenda is softer than it may appear from the 53 percent majority Walker rang up compared to 46 percent for Barrett.\n\nFranklin and Wegge both said it\u2019s really hard -- if not impossible -- to prove that from the available exit polling data.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s clear from the exit polls both Walker and Barrett got a large number of votes from people who seemed to think the recall was inappropriate. Nearly 95 percent of Walker supporters said recalls should never occur or only be for official misconduct. For Barrett, 42 percent of his backers felt that way.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t tell us how many of the recall skeptics disagreed with Walker\u2019s policies but voted for him anyway to somehow make a statement that the recall itself was inappropriate.\n\nThere is one hint in the exits -- from a question on whether voters approved of Walker\u2019s limits on collective bargaining by public employees.\n\nTen percent of those who disagreed with Walker on that issue nevertheless voted for Walker. And there was an equal, opposite effect: 10 percent of those who approved of the union limits nonetheless voted for Barrett. (Overall on that question, the result closely mirrored the election: 52 percent approved and 47 percent disapproved.)\n\nOur rating\n\nBarca asserted that \"70 percent of the people who voted just didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the recall of the governor\" weakening the notion Wisconsin is \"fully behind\" Walker\u2019s policy agenda.\n\nBarca reasonable constructs the figure from a widely cited exit poll. Given the negative attitudes toward the recall election, he\u2019s on safe ground.\n\nBut there\u2019s not enough information to judge the piece of Barca\u2019s statement about the meaning of the anti-recall sentiments. And the exit poll question that comes closest provides murky results at best.\n\nWe rate his claim Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10882"}
