It was one of the themes of her recent book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success.\nIn a discussion with the hosts about the nation\u2019s employment picture, Trump raised the issue of where future jobs will be coming from.\n\"A lot of them are in STEM-related fields -- science, engineering, computer science,\" she said during the June 12, 2017, segment. \"Women, for example, while we represent 47 percent of the overall work force, we only make up 23 percent of STEM-related occupations.\"\nWhen we looked into this statistic, we found that it\u2019s not far off the mark. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)\nTrump was correct about the percentage of the overall workforce that is female -- average Bureau of Labor Statistics data for 2016 finds precisely that figure,\u00a047 percent.\nAs for STEM employment, the most recent comprehensive data we could find was in a report published in 2016 by the National Science Board and the National Science Foundation, using 2013 statistics.\nThe report found that in 2013, women represented 29 percent of individuals in science and engineering occupations. That\u2019s higher than Trump\u2019s 23 percent, although it supports her broader point -- that women are underrepresented in STEM fields.\nAnd if you recalculate the raw data in the report, you can get a few percentage points closer to Trump\u2019s figure.\nIn coming up with the 29 percent figure, the report counted jobs in the social sciences. Some may not think that such fields as political science and sociology are core STEM professions, so we ran the numbers without that subcategory. This meant removing a sector -- social sciences -- that is 62 percent women.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe remaining fields -- \u00a0which include mathematics, computer science, life sciences, chemistry, physics, geology and engineering -- are just over 25 percent female. That\u2019s closer to Trump\u2019s figure, but still a little high.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that there is wide variation in the percentage of women from STEM field to STEM field. (Trump was referring to average figures, so we won\u2019t lower her rating for this part of the equation.)\nFor instance, in \"biological, agricultural, and environmental life scientists,\" there is almost gender parity, with 48 percent female, 52 percent male. In the field of non-practicing medical research, women actually have a majority of the positions, at 56 percent.\nBy contrast, engineering as a whole is only 15 percent female. The percentages are even lower in certain specialties, such as aeronautical engineering\u00a0(12 percent female), petroleum engineering\u00a0(10 percent) and mechanical engineering\u00a0(8 percent).\nWhen we ran our calculations by the National Girls Collaborative Project, a nonprofit group that specializes in increasing the number of girls and women in STEM fields, Erin Hogeboom, the group's community development and network strategy manager, said our analysis mirrors theirs.\n\"Women\u2019s representation in STEM fields is distressingly lower than it should be, and the best way to support the argument for the need to change this is through accurate data,\" Hogeboom said.\nOur ruling\nIvanka Trump said, \"While (women) represent 47 percent of the overall work force, we only make up 23 percent of STEM-related occupations.\"\nShe\u2019s right on the first figure, and she\u2019s close on the second, according to the most recent comprehensive data. But because she\u2019s a few percentage points off on the latter figure, we rate her statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2017-06-12 20:36:20 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"While (women) represent 47 percent of the overall work force, we only make up 23 percent of STEM-related occupations.\"    Ivanka Trump Daughter of President Donald Trump   an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" Monday, June 12, 2017 2017-06-12    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03221"}
