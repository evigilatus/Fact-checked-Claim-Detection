Seniority would no longer be the sole determining factor in layoffs and continuing contracts would end for new teachers and be limited for teachers already in the system. (On March 23, the Cleveland Teachers Union offered Jackson a counter-proposal which his administration is currently studying.)\n\nAt a state board of education meeting March 12, Gov. John Kasich offered strong support for the Jackson plan. At the same meeting, Ohio Federation of Teachers officials hand-delivered a letter from the union\u2019s new president, Melissa Cropper, to each member of the state board.\n\nCropper\u2019s letter and a news release OFT issued the same day both said the measure does nothing to benefit students and everything to attack teachers.\n\n\"The plan lacks any data or methods proven to raise student achievement and should not be supported blindly,\" read Cropper\u2019s statement in part.\n\nThat got PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s attention. We decided to study up on Cropper\u2019s charge.\n\nFirst, we turned the Ohio Federation of Teachers officials for supporting evidence.\n\nLisa Zellner, OFT\u2019s director of communications, said the claims stems from the fact that many of the provisions in the plan pertain to the teaching contract. She said the union knows of no empirical studies or data that backs up Jackson\u2019s specific plan.\n\n\"It\u2019s not about increasing student achievement,\" Zellner said. \"It\u2019s just about going after the teachers, it\u2019s going after the contract.\"\n\nEven provisions that may have some support in educational research \u2014 for example, increasing the length of school days or the school year \u2014 aren\u2019t spelled out enough in the mayor\u2019s plan to know whether they would be effective or not, she said.\n\nEric Gordon, CEO of the Cleveland Public Schools and the main architect of the Jackson plan, sees things differently. He said the plan is part of a broader strategy of district-wide reform known as the portfolio approach that is being tried in several dozen big-city school districts.\n\nAnd while Gordon conceded \"there is no empirical study that shows the portfolio strategy is the one strategy\" he said there is some evidence that some of the approaches in the Jackson plan have worked to raise test scores.\n\nFor example, Gordon mentioned research that has been done by the Center on Reinventing Public Education. The non-profit group recently issued a report on a number of big city school districts trying reforms similar to those in Jackson\u2019s plan.\n\nThe group\u2019s report looked at Denver schools, where many teachers voluntarily opted for a merit pay system instead of the standard teaching contract. Known as the ProComp program, it ties teacher pay to education levels and offers bonus pay to teachers who work in the toughest schools and whose students score higher on tests.\n\nResearchers at the University of Colorado found \"significant and positive ProComp effects at both middle and high school for both math and reading, and the effects are larger at high school than middle school.\" The researchers cautioned, however, that it generally was the more effective teachers who opted into the program.\n\nAnother approach tried in Colorado \u2014 a 2008 law called the Innovation Schools Act \u2014 gives school officials who opt into the program greater school autonomy and flexibility in operations and academic decisions.\n\n\"The innovation schools are experiencing growth in test scores but many were exceeding state averages prior to being innovation schools,\" said a recent report from researchers who have studied the schools.\n\nThe Baltimore school district \u2014 after working hand in hand with the union \u2014 implemented a reworked teacher contract largely based on teacher evaluations and student test scores. That contract only went into effect last year so it\u2019s too soon to say whether it has improved student test scores.\n\nThe Jackson plan also calls for increased learning time through either longer school days or a longer school year, a hot topic among educational academics. Research on the subject is mixed \u2014 a fact Gordon acknowledged. \"Well, no one factor in of itself is a magic bullet solution,\" he said. \"You are going to find time studies where it did work and time studies where it didn\u2019t work.\"\n\nIn 2005, Massachusetts became the first state to significantly expand learning time. It now has a program in several dozen schools that extended student learning time by about 25 percent. Test scores in those districts have risen by double the rate for English and math when compared to schools with normal hours and five times the rate in science.\n\nAdditionally, a charter school program known as KIPP (Knowledge is Power Program) has seen results from providing as much as 60 percent more learning time in core subjects.\n\nHowever, additional time doesn\u2019t always mean that student test scores rise. A $100 million effort in Miami schools to extend school hours by one hour and add 10 days to the school calendar hasn\u2019t produced higher student test scores and is largely considered a failure.\n\nSo where are we left on this issue as the bell rings and PolitiFact class is dismissed?\n\nOhio AFT union head Melissa Cropper said Mayor Frank Jackson\u2019s sweeping plan to improve Cleveland schools \"lacks any data or methods proven to raise student achievement\" as she labeled the proposal an attack on teachers. For PolitiFact Ohio, a key part of that statement is \"lacks any.\"\n\nWhile the specific approach Jackson mapped out for Cleveland hasn\u2019t been proven, it does clearly contain elements that researchers suggest may work \u2014 at least in some cases -- such as merit pay for teachers, greater flexibility for schools in how they go about their business and longer school days or school year.\n\nWhile the teacher federation leader\u2019s statement contains some element of truth \u2014 there\u2019s no specific study or data that proves definitively that Jackson\u2019s approach will raise student achievement \u2014 it ignores critical facts about the successes that have resulted in some places that have tried some of the elements of Jackson\u2019s plan. Those details could give a listener a different impression.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim by the Ohio Federation of Teachers rates Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11371"}
