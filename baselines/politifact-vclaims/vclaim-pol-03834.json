The discussion also turned toward education.\n\"We (Chicago) are the only city where if you get a B average in high school, community college is free,\" Emanuel said.\n\"I didn\u2019t know that,\" Kurtis responded. Emanuel reiterated his claim, further explaining that Chicago was the only city in the United States to offer this incentive. Emanuel went on to say that\u00a0if you keep the B average in community college, it was possible to get 30 percent to 40 percent off tuition for your remaining two years. Too good to be true? We decided to check it out.\nWhen we reached out to the Mayor\u2019s Office for further comment, we were directed to a press release from May 2016. The\u00a0release\u00a0announced the Star Scholarship program, an initiative created by Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chancellor Cheryl Hyman of the City Colleges of Chicago in 2014.\nThe Star Scholarship Program\nDoes the Star Scholarship program guarantee high school seniors with a B-average free community college? To an extent, but there are a few more qualifications.\nIn order to qualify for the\u00a0Star Scholarship program, a high school senior needs to have a GPA of 3.0 or higher, which is equivalent to a B. However, a high school senior also needs to be \"completion ready,\" meaning students need to receive 17 or higher in math and English on the ACT. These qualifications go slightly beyond those outlined by Emanuel.\nAnd what about students who wish to continue on after their two years in community college? Will they get a 30 to 40 percent discount off their tuition?\nMaybe. It\u00a0depends\u00a0on which university or college the student applies to, and some institutions may also require \"additional academic merits.\" As of the May press release, 15 four-year universities and colleges have become partners of the Star Scholarship program, with packages ranging from $2,500 to $50,000 per year. However, it is difficult to determine whether the 30 to 40 percent off figure quoted by Emanuel would be accurate in each student\u2019s case.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut is Chicago the only city to offer this?\nAnother part of Emanuel\u2019s claim was that Chicago was the \"only city\" in the United States to have a program like the Star Scholarship. However, a quick Google search revealed that this was not the case -\u00a0Tennessee, Oregon, Minnesota, and Kentucky all have similar programs in place, which means students in cities in those states have access to such an incentive.\nWhen we emailed the\u00a0Mayor\u2019s Office enquiring about these other programs, we received a reply saying that Chicago was \"the first city to leverage free community college for high school students.\" But when we looked at the programs\u2019 establishments chronologically, Chicago does not appear to have been the first. Tennessee beat Chicago to the punch.\nIn\u00a0February 2014, Tennessee governor Bill Haslam announced the Tennessee Promise program during his State of the State address. The\u00a0Tennessee Promise\u00a0requires students to maintain at least a 2.0 GPA after being accepted into the program, and has some additional stipulations as well (such as community service).\nEmanuel did not announce Chicago\u2019s Star Scholarship program until October 2014. Additionally, according to an\u00a0article\u00a0from the\u00a0Chicago Tribune, Emanuel himself said \"the city took a page from Tennessee's plan in developing the Star Scholarship.\"\nOur ruling\nMayor Emanuel said,\u00a0Chicago is the \"only city in the United States, you get a B average in high school, community college is free.\"\nChicago\u2019s Star Scholarship program does allow students with a B average or higher to attend community college in the city for free. However, there are a few other requirements as well.\nIn addition, contrary to what Mayor Emanuel stated, Chicago is not the only city to offer such a program. Other states, including Tennessee, Oregon, and Minnesota, and the cities within them, offer similar programs to high school students.\nWhile it is true a B average means you can go to community college for free in Chicago with some added requirements, Emanuel exaggerated his claim that Chicago is the only city in the nation to offer such an incentive. Therefore, we rate his claim Half True.\n\nShare the Facts\n\n\nPolitifact\n\n\n2\n6\n Politifact Rating:\n\u00a0\n\n[Chicago is the] only city in the United States, you get a B average in high school, community college is free.\n\n\n\nRahm Emanuel\nChicago mayor\n\n\nin interview with Bill Kurtis\nTuesday, November 15, 2016\n-11/-15/2016\n\n\nRead More\ninfo", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03834"}
