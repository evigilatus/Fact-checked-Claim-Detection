In order to prove their cause, Democrats cite impressive statistics. \"In 2016, the provinces that hosted the Trump Caucus saw an increase in hate crime of 226%,\" reading an article on Facebook from the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign. A tweet from Rip Elhan Omar from De Min, making the same claim. The provinces that hosted the Trump in 2016 saw an increase of 226 per cent in hate crimes, and mistakes are greater when cities host the Trump communities. On 7 August 2019, the reader saw Sanders' social media bulletins and sent them to us, asking him if they were accurate. We found that statistics come from an academic paper. But Sanders' mail makes the increase look dramatic and causal. The results are actually much more accurate. The statistics from the article state that the Washington Post is the source, and we traced this to an article in one of the newspaper blogs, the monkey cage. On March 22, the Code published an article entitled, \"The countries that hosted the Trump 2016 Caucus have seen a 226% increase in hate crime.\" The article summarized a paper written by three academics: Ayal Vinberg, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Texas A&M - Trade; Regina Branton, Professor of Political Science at the University of North Texas; and Valerie Martinez-Ebers, Professor of Political Science at the University of North Texas. (Sanders campaign did not respond to any query.) The authors informed Polyte Fact that the paper was currently being peer-reviewed for publication in an academic publication. In 2019, the authors presented it at meetings of the Southern Political Science Association and the Western Political Science Association. In this context, we summarized the work of the authors in the Post: using hatred, extremism, anti-Semitism and terrorist map data (Hit map), examining whether there was a connection between the provinces that hosted one of the 275 Trump presidential campaigns in 2016 and the increase in hate crime incidents in the following months. To test this, we collected data on hate incidents and collected Trump at the district level and then used statistical tools to assess the impact of the gathering. We have included controls on factors such as crime rates in the province, the number of hate groups active in the province, the number of minority populations, their percentage with university education, their location in the country, and the month when the gatherings took place. We found that the provinces that hosted the Trump Campaign in 2016 saw a 226 per cent increase in reported hate crimes over similar provinces that did not host such a gathering. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, said that Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to launch security had been rejected, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, how social media articles were found on their sites, Sanders (Omar) referred to the headline in the monkey herd blog almost literally. However, there is a discrepancy between the wording of the headline and what researchers saw in the academic paper. The wording used by Sanders implies that hate crimes rose in one jurisdiction, jumping from one level before the rally to a three-fold higher rate after that. That's not the case. According to the summary of the study, the difference of 226 per cent compares the provinces of Tramp-Ratali with those of a non-tramp grouping with similar demographics. Therefore, the more precise wording may be: \"The countries that hosted the Trump 2016 gathering had 226% of hate crimes more than the provinces that did not do so.\" There are other differences not captured by the statistics published by Sanders, and experts told Politi Fakt. In an interview with Weinberg, a participant in the study mentioned in the Post article, he referred to a few general challenges in the field of hate crime studies. First, he said, there were limitations in \"how extreme incidents, hate events and hate crimes lack a coherent definition\" under the law. What constitutes a hate crime in one State may not be in another. Some data are also reported on their own, making it difficult to determine the number of hate crimes in a given jurisdiction that are not reported. In addition, Weinberg said, \"Not all police departments investigate hate crimes or see incidents motivated by prejudice\" with the same degree of aggression. Finnberg said that these warnings are always at the top of the mind of hate crime researchers. A research project with which he had cooperated in 2018 had not found that the involvement of extreme right-wing parties in ruling coalitions in Europe had had an impact on reported anti-Semitic incidents. So when he started working on the Trump paper, he came up with an open mind. Before the study, he said, \"I was not sure that Trump's speech would have any impact on reported extremist events, incidents of hatred, anti-Semitism or hate crimes.\" At the same time, Brian Levin, Kevin Grisham and John Ritzl, three contributors to a study by the State University of California-San Bernardino on hate crime trends in recent years, told Bolivi Fakt that it was difficult to see if there were any other factors that could play a role in promoting hate crime in the provinces with the Trump Caucus. \"It's hard to break all these relationships without some in-depth interviews and qualitative data,\" said Grisham. \"I think the data is great and may be the first step in a larger and more in-depth project. But, we cannot say with absolute certainty that hatred follows assemblies.\" For example, Grisham said that assemblies may be a contributing issue rather than a dominant one. \"Any person who uses such data must be aware of the complexity of extremist acts and their links to the speech. Like anything with humans, nothing black and white.\" There is another potential problem: the difference of 226% seems huge, but in many local areas, this may mean only a small numerical difference, especially the types of low-density districts that tended to host Trump groupings. The difference between one hate crime and three crimes is 200 per cent, but with such figures, a slight difference in reporting crimes or police investigations can obscure the question of whether Trump's marches have an impact. There's a \"statistical noise\" when the raw numbers are small, as Rietzel said. He focused on percentage changes, \"Even where the figures are correct, they continue to distort interpretation,\" and said: \"Even where the figures are correct, they continue to distort interpretation.\" In general, the study is \"interesting and certainly proposed,\" Livine said. \"But I'd rather see a comparison between apples and apples.\" Our article, Governor Sanders, said: \"In 2016, the provinces hosting the Trump rally saw a 226% rise in hate crime.\" This is from an academic study. However, it is worth mentioning some warnings -- that data can be subject to \"statistical noise\" and judicial differences in the definition of hate crimes and police aggression, which cause and result are difficult to identify. Perhaps most importantly, the Sanders wording implies that the 266% jump stems from the comparison of hate crimes before and after the Trump grouping within the same province, while in fact it is a comparison between the Trump and similar provinces that did not host the Trump grouping. The statement is partially accurate but leaves important details, so we evaluate it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00282"}
