Trump presented the story of the catapult as an example of how long people would be going to bring drugs into the United States. So now they take drugs, literally, and they throw them away, a hundred pounds of drugs. They throw it up the wall, they have the catapults, but they throw it up the wall, and it goes down and it hits someone on the head. You don't even know they're there, \"Tramb September 22 in Alabama during the election campaign for Luther Strange, which was later defeated by Roy Moore for Republican candidacy in the Senate race to replace Attorney General Jeff's hearings. \"Truth or not, this is the kind of thing that happens. So you need a great wall, but you have to be seeing through, \"Trap said. Last July, Trump also spoke of the need for a transparent wall to avoid a 60-pound sack of drugs. This fact-finding will not address whether the hacked wall is the best approach to border security. What we wanted to know is whether the drugs were fired across the border and hit people on the head. Trump was quite accurate about the drugs that were tossed. Immigration officers have seized the marijuana that was fired across the border, and in some cases they have found splinters. Whether people have been hit on the head by these bags is uncertain. For years, spaghetti have been used by United States Customs and Border Protection reports on spaghetti dating from at least 2011. An attempt to toss marijuana to the United States failed in January 2011 after United States officials noticed the preparation through video surveillance. Call the Mexican authorities that went and foiled the plan. Mexican officials took over a sports car, about 45 pounds of marijuana and \"a spade capable of releasing contraband into the United States,\" said the release. The attempt took place near Nako, Ares. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2021, in February, border patrol agents in Douglas, Ares seized a package of marijuana from Mexico, weighing more than 47 pounds combined, and said the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection in a newsletter. The agents on the patrol observed that several people were withdrawing from the south side of the border fence as the agents approached, as the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection said, and at the fence \"they found the splinter system tied to the south side of the border fence.\" A search in the area led them to two packs of marijuana. #SUSBP emanates into the work CBP3HPL TuN - Arizona (@CPPARIZona) February 14, 2017, July, the Douglas Police Department in Arizona confiscated more than 140 pounds of marijuana fired over the border fence. The Customs and Border Protection Office said that an officer had responded to calls about packages that had been launched on \"a large group of marijuana broken at impact, and exposed several smaller packages inside.\" Last month, border patrol agents in Arizona were monitoring the video remotely and saw a body launched across the border. Other agents then went to the area and found a large cylindrical package of marijuana weighing more than 96 pounds valued at $48,000. Sanhu Tri, a fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies and Director of his Drug Policy Project, said that he had not heard of any injuries associated with the spastic or tributary (a common type of catapult). \"The traffickers have certainly used the spoons (Walterbotchet) to throw drug packets at the existing wall, but anyone's chance to run into this package along a 2,000-mile wall is simply funny.\" Other experts also told us that cartels were used to throw marijuana across the border, but they were not aware that anyone had already been beaten by packages. There are drug hooligans and Tribuchets that carry up to 100 pounds on the border wall, but this happens very rarely. Smaller loads of 20 to 40 pounds are more common with drug hooligans, as stated by Brandon Beldorf, Assistant Professor at the School of Emergency Preparedness, Internal Security and Cybersecurity at the University of Albany, New York University. Our governor Trump said, \"So now she literally takes drugs and she throws them, 100 pounds of drugs. They throw it over the wall, they have catapults, but they throw it over the wall and land and hit someone on the head.\" Trump is accurate in that from time to time, traffickers use spoons at the border. The marijuana packages thrown at the border range from less than 50 pounds to more than 100 pounds. But we didn't find any reports of people on the American side of the border being hit by a falling package. We appreciate what Trump often said was true.
