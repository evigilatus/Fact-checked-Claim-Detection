She\u2019s working in front of an espresso machine and appears to be blowing on small paper packages \u2014 like cupcake wrappers \u2014\u00a0to separate them so that she can put pastries inside.\u00a0\n\"CHECK THIS OUT,\" the video caption on the March 14 post says. \"CORONA VIRUS / DROPLETS IN FULL FORCE \u2026. LET THIS GO VIRAL.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nIt\u2019s noisy in the video, and two more people can be seen in the background, including a man rolling dough. But like the woman in the foreground, neither of them is wearing a mask.\u00a0\nUsing InVID, we searched for other places that this video has appeared online. In recent days and weeks, many people have shared it on social media. One tweet, from March 15, says: \"You can wash your hands ALL day long, use alcohol afterwards and protect yourself from the virus as much as you can ... then this happens at your favorite restaurant and you wonder where the covid is coming from.\" Another one from March 12 says: \"There is no point in washing your hands, rubbing alcohol, using a mask, but keep eating coxinha. #coronavirusbrasil\"\u00a0\nBut this video didn\u2019t make its first appearance online in March. We found it published four months ago, on these Russian sites in March and April 2017, and on gfycat.com in March 2017.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertainly, watching someone in a commercial kitchen handle food as the woman in the video does could concern viewers anytime, not just during a pandemic.\u00a0\nPaul Dawson, a professor of food, nutrition and packaging sciences at Clemson University, told us that this \"is definitely NOT an advisable practice regardless of COVID.\"\n\"There are several infectious diseases that can be transferred from the oral cavity,\" he said in an email. \"The only additional question is how long will the packaged food be held before someone eats it. The longer before someone consumes that food, the less chance that the contamination that may have been placed there by the person blowing on the wrapper will survive.\"\nThe caption on this Facebook post, and others who have posted the video online, portray the clip as having been recorded recently amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0\nIn reality, it was taken at least three years ago, long before the first case of the new coronavirus was reported in late 2019.\u00a0\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18336"}
