No", "text": "Looking to put a positive spin on a stunning political upset, President Donald Trump said Democrat Conor Lamb \u2014 the yet-to-be-declared winner of last week\u2019s closely watched special election in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th congressional district \u2014 \"ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me.\"\nTrump made the comment at a private fundraiser for Missouri Senate candidate Josh Hawley a day after the March 13 election, The Washington Post reported.\nBut did Lamb\u2019s campaign actually say \"very nice things\" about the president, or was this an attempt to minimize a looming Republican loss in a reliably red district?\nWhat Lamb said about Trump\nLamb said very little about the president during the expedited campaign to fill a seat vacated late last year by disgraced former U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy who held the spot for more than a decade. But Lamb also held off on criticizing the commander-in-chief at a time when many Democrats have made the president the focus of their calls to action.\nLamb was careful not to alienate voters in the traditionally conservative district, said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll and professor of Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College.\n\"Lamb did not want to arouse the Trump supporters in a district [Trump] won by 20 points,\" Madonna said. \"He wanted the election to be local, where he could focus on his strengths.\"\nAsked if she agreed that the Lamb campaign had praise for Trump around points of agreement, campaign manager Abby Murphy said \"No, I don't think it was ever that specific.\"\nShe added: \"What was important to the voters of this district were things like jobs and the heroin epidemic and infrastructure. I think the congressman-elect made it very clear that he\u2019s willing to work with whomever to make those things happen. I think it\u2019s very clear that that\u2019s what his intent was.\"\nLamb is the projected winner of the 18th District seat, with just a few hundred votes separating him and Republican candidate Rick Saccone, who conceded to Lamb on Wednesday. Votes were still being tallied and reviewed as of Wednesday, and the results remained unofficial. Republicans previously said they were considering challenging the results, alleging the vote was tainted by irregularities and other issues.\nOn Tuesday, Trump said Saccone had narrowly lost the race, CNN reported.\n\"It was really close,\" Trump told the crowd at a Republican fundraising event. \"We went in there. They were down. Good man, Rick Saccone. Good man. And didn't quite make it. But lost, think of it, lost by about 300 votes out of all of those votes. So, it's pretty incredible. But we can't let it happen. We have to win. There's nothing like winning. We have to win.\"\nDuring the campaign, Lamb did express support for Trump\u2019s plan to apply stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. He also told The Atlantic, \"We need the office of the presidency to succeed if we\u2019re gonna make any progress on these issues,\" when asked what he thought of Trump.\nBut experts argue that even if you judge those comments as charitable by 2018 political standards, Trump\u2019s \"very nice things\" claim remains misleading.\n\"I think the closest thing [Lamb] said to something complimentary about Trump was his endorsement of the [metals] tariffs,\" said Dave Weigel, a reporter who covered the District 18 campaign for The Washington Post.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeigel added, \"What Lamb did instead, as you probably saw, was not mention the president and make the election more about the Republicans who run Congress.\"\nLamb did criticize the tax cuts bill shepherded through Congress by Republicans and signed into law by the president last year.\nWhite House representatives declined to comment for this story.\nIn an interview with Lamb for The Atlantic, assistant editor Elaine Godfrey wrote that Lamb was \"careful not to present his candidacy as a way to oppose Trump,\" adding, \"Yes, Trump is a historically unpopular leader, and Lamb is running against a Republican who once bragged that he was \u2018Trump before Trump was Trump.\u2019 But as members of the campaign team reminded me repeatedly, Lamb wants to focus solely on local issues, and doesn\u2019t want the race to become a tribal contest.\"\nWhen asked about Trump directly, Godfrey wrote that Lamb offered this response: \"We need the office of the presidency to succeed if we\u2019re gonna make any progress on these issues. The number-one thing people talk about is wanting to get someone down there who\u2019s actually gonna attack the problem, not attack the other side.\"\nGodfrey wrote that Lamb \"never mentioned the president by name\" in the course of their conversation.\nWhat Trump said about Lamb\nWhile Lamb remained largely silent on the subject of the White House, Trump didn\u2019t always return the favor.\nAt a March 10 rally for Saccone in Moon Township, the president referred to Lamb as \"Lamb the sham\" and said \"I hear he\u2019s nice looking. I think I'm better looking than him. I do. I do. I do.\"\nOn CNN\u2019s New Day program, host Alisyn Camerota asked Lamb about the \"Lamb the sham\" comment, but Lamb quickly pivoted back to the campaign.\n\"Apart from that, there was a lot of foolishness in this election and a lot of cartoonish campaigning, and by the time of the president\u2019s visit last weekend, people were kind of tired of that approach,\" he said.\nAsked about Trump saying he was \"better looking,\" Lamb laughed.\n\"I really have no opinion on that one.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said Lamb said \"very nice things\" about him during the recent special election campaign in southwestern Pennsylvania. Lamb ran as a moderate Democrat in a conservative district and avoided openly criticizing the president. At times Lamb showed himself to be in agreement with Trump on certain policy points. But Trump equating this with high praise goes too far in interpreting and exaggerating what Lamb actually said.\nWe found no evidence of Lamb lavishing praise on the president and instead found evidence of Lamb repeatedly pivoting away from the subject on the campaign trail.\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-03-22 14:46:44 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says Conor Lamb \"ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me.\"    Donald Trump President of the United States https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/03/14/in-fundraising-speech-trump-says-he-made-up-facts-in-meeting-with-justin-trudeau/?utm_term=.aa823386a4c3   From a leaded recording of a private meeting with donors in Missouri.
