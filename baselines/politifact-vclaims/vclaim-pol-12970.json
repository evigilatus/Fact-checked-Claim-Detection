Part of a growing trend, the 2010 statistics represent an astonishing increase of 224 percent over the 492 assaults recorded in 2005,\" Jim Palmer, executive director of the group, said in a news release issued May 31, 2011.\n\n\"These disturbing figures demonstrate that our state\u2019s law enforcement community is facing a crisis caused by the state\u2019s repeated cuts to the funding it provides to cities to pay for police services.\"\n\nThe connection between assaults and budget cuts is Palmer\u2019s opinion -- a linkage even he told us is difficult to directly establish. But what about the numbers themselves?\n\nHas there really been a big spike in assaults on police, even as major crime has dropped? We can check that -- and try to get at what lies behind the numbers.\n\nBefore we jump in, we should note that assaults are broadly defined. A few \u00a0are deadly, and draw the most attention, but about one in five incidents results in injury to an officer. Most involve fists and feet rather than weapons.\n\nPalmer pointed us to state Office of Justice Assistance data that is based on local crime statistics reported to the FBI.\n\nThe overall increase cited is on target (though, for the record, the state report we say showed 490 assaults in 2005, not 492). The 224 percent increase moved the state from way below average to average in number of assaults per officer.\n\nBut we obtained the county-by-county reports and drilled down.\n\nMore than half of Wisconsin\u2019s counties actually reported fewer assaults in 2010 than in 2005, we found. And outside Milwaukee County, assaults were up only 24 percent in the period.\n\nThe Milwaukee County numbers, in contrast, were off the charts and driving the statewide increase -- a nearly fivefold increase (486 percent) in the period looked at.\n\nTo put that huge leap in focus, consider that Milwaukee County is reporting an increase of more than 1,000 assaults on officers in just six years -- from 212 incidents in 2005 to 1,243 incidents in 2010.\n\nSo, while it\u2019s the state union citing the number to bolster its position, it\u2019s more of a Milwaukee-only trend. The association does not represent Milwaukee cops; the separate Milwaukee Police Association does that.\n\nIs it a one-year blip -- or a true \"trend,\" as Palmer said?\n\nThe numbers show it has been a steady climb up, year by year, since 2005. In fact, they have been heading up gradually since the mid-1990s.\n\nPalmer called the increase \"astonishing.\" Nationally, we found, the number basically has been flat for at least a decade.\n\nDoes the huge jump in assaults of officers reflect a growing number of incidents or some change in the way assaults are accounted for -- or a combination of both?\n\nPalmer of the WPPA doesn\u2019t have an answer. He said the state should launch a study of what\u2019s behind the increase.\n\nMilwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm thinks the trend is real. Criminals are more aggressive, less likely to surrender and are under less intense scrutiny because of cutbacks in federal grants for special crime-fighting efforts, he said.\n\nMilwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said lax treatment of young offenders and weak penalties for illegally carrying weapons could explain the trend.\n\n\"We have a critical mass of undeterred juvenile offenders entering the adult system,\" Flynn said, \"and now they are carrying firearms because they have learned there is not a great risk of serious sanction.\"\n\nMilwaukee Police Association President Mike Crivello says manpower cuts have weakened the show of force necessary to discourage attacks on officers.\n\nTami Jackson, spokeswoman for the state office that collects the data, said no change in reporting method was apparent in the Milwaukee figures.\n\nLet\u2019s return to the statement and the bottom line:\n\nLobbying to save funding for law enforcement in communities across the state, the Wisconsin Professional Police Association highlighted an upward surge (224 percent) in reported assaults against law enforcement officers since 2005. The statistics are on point, but while framing it as a statewide problem, the group didn\u2019t note the jump is really centered in the city of Milwaukee. In many other parts of the state, assaults are down.\n\nSo, it needed some clarification. That rates a Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12970"}
