Marco Rubio.\nHere\u2019s the exchange:\nQuick: \"You have talked a little bit about Marco Rubio. I think you called him (Facebook founder) Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal senator, because he was in favor of the H-1B visa.\"\nTrump: \"I never said that. I never said that.\"\nQuick: \"So this is an erroneous article the whole way around? \u2026 My apologies, I'm sorry.\"\nTrump: \"Somebody's really doing some bad fact-checking.\"\nAs it turns out, Quick was, uh, too quick to apologize.\nWe looked at the immigration-policy page of Trump\u2019s campaign website and found the following:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Here are some additional specific policy proposals for long-term reform:\n\"Increase prevailing wage for H-1Bs. We graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program. More than half of H-1B visas are issued for the program's lowest allowable wage level, and more than eighty percent for its bottom two. Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities.\"\nAnd here\u2019s a screenshot we took during the debate:\n\nQuick circled back later in the debate, noting that she got her information from Trump\u2019s website. Trump did not offer a rebuttal. We did not receive an immediate response from the Trump camp.\nOur ruling\nIn the debate, Trump said he \"never said that\" Marco Rubio was Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal senator. But he may want to check his own website, which says exactly that. Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05801"}
