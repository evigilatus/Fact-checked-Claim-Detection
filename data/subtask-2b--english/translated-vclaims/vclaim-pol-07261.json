The Royal Government of Georgia has already spent $1.6 million on the Georgian Governor &apos; s race and is increasing its investments with a new announcement launched on Tuesday in most of the state. The Assembly has already been taken to the Georgian airwaves to attack Carter, a Senator from Atlanta, as a \"liberal trial lawyer\" and the expansion of Medicaid as part of Obama's care. The new 30 seconds challenge one of Carter's biggest promises - his pledge to improve education financing. \"Jason Carter is preparing to invest more in education. But Carter actually opposed more funding for education in the Senate,\" advertising states. This is a frequent demand from the campaign dealer. It is also very similar to the claim that Polyte Fruitte has previously examined it and considers it worthy of a second look - given that education is one of the most exciting subjects in the race and one of the largest investments of taxpayers. This year alone, the cost of K-12 education is $7.9 billion, or 43.4 per cent of the State budget $18.3 billion. The Declaration of the Association of Republican Governors is aimed specifically at voting on Carter at the last session of the General Assembly on the State budget for 2015 (although the Self-Government Act makes the wrong reference in the HB 744, the Appropriations Bill of 2015). Of the 56 senators, Carter was only one of the four who voted \"no\" on the budget, showing state records. The budget included austerity cuts in education totalling $747 million. However, it has been the smallest reduction since 2009, and therefore the leaders in education considered it to be highly positive. Last spring, when the 2015 budget was signed into law, Carter explained that his opposition was rooted in the belief that a separate education budget would restore all previous cuts, not just some of them. The budget reflects values, and this budget shows that the Government. The deal doesn't appreciate our students, teachers, and classes,\" Carter said in a statement in April. Carter has since expanded his idea of a separate education budget, including the flow of questionable financing from tax fraud to boost spending. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2219 On 26 January 2021, the Republicans argued that the transaction increased funding for education each year, claiming that Politi Fact had found its record exaggerated. Following the campaign, Carter repeatedly attacked the deal because of lack of funding for education. Most of his public statements as a senator focused on education and called for more money, both at the K-12 level and in colleges. \"Saying that he's not supporting more funding is completely wrong,\" said the spokesman for Carter Brian Thomas. \"It's exactly the opposite. He doesn't want our schools to continue to shrink.\" However, the Republicans pointed out that Carter &apos; s vote against the 2015 budget was merely a political position. They point out that it voted in favour of the previous three State budgets in the Agreement, all of which saw greater reductions in educational austerity. (The combined 180 education systems in Georgia were underfunded by over $1.1 billion in 2012, $1.1 billion in 2013 and approximately $1.1 billion in 2014, according to the allocation sheets of the Ministry of Education of Georgia). The austerity cuts reflect the difference in what school systems deserve and actually receive from the State under the Education Financing Formula, the 1985 Quality Basic Education Act. Carter expressed concerns about the State &apos; s commitment to public education during his short term in the Senate. In recent months, he has been increasingly critical of the education deal, with his campaign manager at some point launching the \"Georgian deal\" as the worst education governor. * See the Poletti Fact judgement on the fire in that allegation. Throughout the country, there are 36 Governor races this fall and about a third -- including one between the deal and Carter -- that are competitive, as Larry Sabato, Director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics said. Sabato said: \"The official is one of five current Republicans who are in some degree of difficulty.\" \"Proceeding is a little favourite, but Carter kept it close.\" In short, the RGA declaration claims that Carter is \"in fact opposed to more funding for education.\" It would be accurate to say that Carter voted against the current budget of the State that expands funds to schools. Carter called for more funding for education for almost all of his short political life. But when it came to the votes in the state Senate, I voted with Goof. To deal with three budgets that contain austerity cuts and against the Governor a budget that has seen the smallest austerity cuts in years. In drafting its latest announcement, the Republican Party warned that Carter was opposed to further funding for education \"in the Senate.\" This statement needs that context, but it is largely on target. We're mostly assessing the claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07261"}
