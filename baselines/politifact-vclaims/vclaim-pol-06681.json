The AP story that quotes Isakson also cites it.\nBut just how accurate is the figure? PolitiFact Georgia already tackled the problems with the figure in a fact check about \"solider suicides\" made by Democratic Congressman David Scott, who represents part of metro Atlanta.\nNow that the bill is law, the government will repay student loans for psychiatrists who join the Department of Veterans Affairs and also will develop peer support groups and community outreach with veterans\u2019 service groups. So what about those veterans?\nThe figures in question come from a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs report released in 2013, based on the most extensive data the agency has collected on veterans\u2019 suicide.\nThe study examined death certificates in 21 states, to conclude that veterans accounted for 22 percent of suicides.\nApplying that percentage to about 38,000 suicides in the United States annually that translates to about 8,300 veteran suicides, or 22 a day.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to acknowledge the study looked only at 21 states. Georgia was not among them.\nThe death certificates themselves also were imprecise. The report itself acknowledges that about 5 percent of a sub-group of the sample were misidentified as veterans or non-veterans, when checked against VA records.\nIn other words, the figures are an estimate. Although the study was the first analysis of its kind, it does not offer an actual count of the number of veterans who take their own lives.\nA study published this month does finally offer a specific number, at least for recent veterans.\nThe study published in the February issue of Annals of Epidemiology\u00a0matched military records of nearly 1.3 million active-duty veterans who served between 2001 and 2007 with the National Death Index.\nIt found 1,868 suicides through the end of 2009. That translates into a rate of one suicide per day for that specific group of recent veterans.\nSo which is accurate -- estimates of 22 suicides daily among all veterans or 1 a day for recent vets?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost likely, both, said Michael Schoenbaum, an epidemiologist who specializes in military suicides at the National Institute of Mental Health.\nNot that either number matters, without a frame of reference. And that\u2019s where it gets tricky.\nSchoenbaum points out 22 or 1 are simply numbers. Their significance is meaningless, until they are applied to how they stack up against comparable non-veterans suicides.\nThere, the data is far more clear. Suicide is the 10th most common cause of death in the United States, with a rate of 12.6 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.\nBoth studies, the estimate for all veterans and the actual count of recent veterans, show a much higher rate for veterans.\nThe VA study shows a rate that is 20 percent higher than the civilian population. The most recent study is even more alarming, showing a 50 percent higher rate, with 29.5 deaths per 100,000 veterans.\n\"To say 22 veterans a day, 8,000 veterans a year, commit suicide, it\u2019s a defensible statistic,\" Schoenbaum said.\n\"When people ask me about suicide risk in veterans, I don\u2019t talk about that. I talk about rates,\" he continued. \"The general insight there is yes, there is something about the veteran population that is leading them to have higher rates of suicide than other people. And I believe we have a national obligation to help them.\"\nIsakson said he knew of \"shortcomings\" in the VA data but said the estimates were the best available when he spoke during committee hearings.\nHe made the issue a priority when he took over the committee, he said, because of the need for more attention and information on the issue.\n\"The intent is to have a number that can reflect that this is an alarming rate, and we must address it, given our obligation to all veterans,\" Isakson said.\nThe $22 million in funding is designed to pay that debt, as federal agencies work to compile more accurate data.\nThe VA is working with the Department of Defense, to assemble the Suicide Data Repository, Schoenbaum said. Like the latest study, it will pair death records to military and healthcare records, but for all veterans.\n\"The reason to do these calculations, to track this data, is to first see if there is a problem. Now we know, there is,\" he said. \"The next step is to process where it is. Who is at risk? Why? That requires more data that we don\u2019t yet have.\"\nAnd the information we do have? Isakson said 8,000 veterans are taking their own lives every year.\nThe number comes from a VA study that is statistically reliable, if somewhat lacking context.\nIt is the context that matters here. The number fails to impart the fact that research shows veterans commit suicide at a higher, perhaps much higher, rate than their civilian counterparts.\nIsakson was correct on the numbers. But there is a bit of context missing in what those numbers mean.\nWe rate Isakson's statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06681"}
