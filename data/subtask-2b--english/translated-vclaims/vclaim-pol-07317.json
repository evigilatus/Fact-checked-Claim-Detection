So you picked up our ear when Vincent A. \"My friend\" Chianxi Jr., an independent candidate for mayor of Providence, said during an interview on WHJ-AM that one of his opponents, Democratic Jorge Elorza, wanted to impose a municipal income tax. During the interview, the host asked Ron St. Pierre Cianci, a former mayor of the city, the host of a bi-convicted public dialogue programme, how he would try to obtain unscheduled voters for consideration. \u266a St. Pierre's work with Cianci in his WPRO-AM talk show \u266a \"Just run a good campaign and talk about issues and talk about what could be Providence and should be a learning experience for the city,\" said Cheyenne. He then added: \"Protesters, for example, propose a municipal income tax. ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ He wants to impose an income tax on the municipality. I think the last thing Providence needs is another tax. It'll be simple in this election. If you vote for Elorza, you want an income tax. The municipal income tax will be the first tax on Rhode Island. We wanted to see if Elorda wanted to impose such a tax. During the successful initial campaign of Elorza, one of his democratic colleagues, Brett Smiley, criticized Elorza for the same reason. On 3 August, Smiley posted a video on YouTube about an interview on 31 July, where Elorza, speaking to a group of progressive Democrats, pledged to call for more government aid to Providence. He then said: \"In the conversations we had earlier, I stated that I strongly supported municipal income tax.\" Chayancy told us that this was the video he was counting on. However, in 44 seconds, Elorza also explains that he supports the idea of using municipal income tax to replace other taxes. He never says he's proposing it and he doesn't want to impose it. \"I've been experimenting in many cities across the country and they're working effectively and they're much more progressive than we have now, where people pay a lot for car taxes, real estate taxes and many other taxes,\" he said. \"So I am certainly committed and certainly supportive of more progressive tax policies.\" \u2022 (The progressive tax is designed to be less burdensome for persons less able to pay for it). On the contrary, a retrogressive tax, such as a sales tax, places a greater burden on persons less able to pay). We asked Cheyenne about the rest of Elorda's statement. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. \u2022 On 15 January 2021, Cianci said that the video raised many unanswered questions about municipal income tax, including taxes to be replaced. \"There are no facts. He's just saying he's thinking it through. It's just the fact that he's suggesting it is \"the sinner,\" as Shaanxi said. \"We don't need new taxes. We need to reduce what we have.\" After Polyte Fact Road Island began to enquire about the video, it was removed. Elorza told us that his statement in YouTube was taken out of context. \"I've been completely misunderstood. I never proposed a municipal income tax. It's totally wrong to say I proposed a tax on municipal income. \"I just finished saying that I wouldn't raise taxes... I said I support the idea, and I support the concept.\" Elorza was unable to provide the full video, but referred to a statement made in a six-point questionnaire from the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce on 18 August in which it was asked whether he would oppose the adoption of a municipal tax. It was the only question where he didn't check yes or no. However, he made this comment: \"The raising of taxes in Providence is not an option, period. I've said this over and over again throughout the campaign. Some states and municipalities throughout the country have adopted municipal income taxes as an alternative to increasing revenue through property or production taxes. \"I like the concept of municipal income tax, but whether it makes sense for Providence is a different question. This kind of comprehensive reform is not part of my programme, and I will not make it part of my agenda as mayor.\" Our judgment, Vincent, \"My friend,\" Cianci said Jorge Elorza, \"He wants to impose a municipal income tax.\" Elorza said he preferred tax in the context of its use to replace other taxes that he considered to be less equitable. But he also made it clear that raising taxes in the city was not an option, and he would not be part of his agenda. We didn't find any evidence that Elorza wanted to impose a municipal income tax. We value Cyance &apos; s claim as false.
