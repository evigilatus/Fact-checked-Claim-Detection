Justice Democrats, a group that backs Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and other new faces in Congress, issued a tweet thread laying out why Biden is not their candidate.\n\"Joe Biden stands in near complete opposition to where the center of energy is in the Democratic Party today,\" the group wrote April 25. \"We don\u2019t need someone who voted for the Iraq War, for mass incarceration, and for the Bankruptcy Reform Act, while voting against gay marriage, reproductive rights, and school desegregation.\"\nThe six issues in that tweet have long been seen as Biden\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel in this Democratic primary. Biden\u2019s votes are a matter of record, but on some points, such as gay marriage, Biden switched his position.\nClaim: Biden voted\u00a0for the Iraq War\nThis is accurate.\u00a0A little after midnight on Oct. 11, 2002, Biden joined 28 Democrats and 48 Republicans in the U.S. Senate to authorize the use of military force against Iraq. While the resolution encouraged working through the U.N. Security Council to disarm Iraq, it gave President George W. Bush a free hand to use American armed forces \"as he determines to be necessary and appropriate.\"\nThe night of the vote, Biden said his concerns were eased by Bush who had said \"war is neither imminent nor inevitable.\" Formally, the authorization was not a vote for war, but there was little doubt at the time that war would come.\nClaim: Biden voted for mass incarceration\nHe voted for bills that had that effect.\nBiden voted for two large bills in 1988 and 1994 that experts agree added millions of people to America\u2019s prisons. But both were sprawling pieces of legislation that included programs to reduce incarceration, too.\nThe Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 funded alcohol and drug treatment programs and efforts to reach high-risk youth.\nOn the other hand, it doubled down on imposing stiffer penalties for possession of crack cocaine, more common in African American communities, than for possession of powdered cocaine, more common among whites. And it extended mandatory minimum sentences to people under 21 who sold less than 5 grams of marijuana.\nBiden was one of 87 senators to approve the bill.\nHe also voted for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, along with 53 other Democrats.\u00a0Among other features, the bill included the Violence Against Women Act and banned 19 types of semi-automatic assault weapons. It funded 100,000 new police officers to expand community policing.\nBut it also imposed life sentences on many more people through a federal \"three strikes and you\u2019re out\" provision, and it provided over $12 billion to help states build prisons. To get the money, states had to pass laws to keep people behind bars for at least 85% of their sentences.\nWith more people serving longer sentences, the prison population skyrocketed, doubling between 2004 and 2009.\nClaim: Biden voted for Bankruptcy Reform Act\nHe did.\nIn the early 2000s, Biden co-sponsored legislation that would make it harder for people to qualify for bankruptcy protection. The financial industry, a major donor to Biden\u2019s campaigns, was eager to tighten the rules on Chapter 7, the most common path for households to wipe out their debts.\nIn 2005, Biden backed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, and on a vote of 74 to 25, it passed the Senate and became law.\nUnder it, if a person made more than the median income in their state, and could afford to pay $100 a month on their debts, then they could not file for Chapter 7 protection.\nClaim: Biden voted against gay marriage\nHe did, but he later changed his position.\nJustice Democrats told us this charge against Biden tracks back to his 1996 vote on the Defense of Marriage Act. The measure defined marriage as between a man and a woman and allowed states not to recognize same-sex marriages. Same-sex couples could not claim federal benefits.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden was one of 85 senators to vote in favor.\nBy 2012, then-Vice President Biden had changed his views. In an interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Biden said, \"I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and heterosexual men and women marrying one other are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties.\"\nAt the time, that went beyond where the Obama administration stood, which triggered some quick press work by the White House communications team.\nClaim: Biden voted against reproductive rights\nMost of his votes favored abortion rights, with limits.\nAs a Catholic, Biden has always navigated between the doctrines of his church and the policies of his party on abortion. The tension came to a head in March 1982 when Biden voted in committee to approve a constitutional amendment that allowed states to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court case that affirmed abortion rights.\nThe amendment never came to a full Senate vote. And the next year, on a second try, Biden voted against it.\nBiden settled on a position in which he separated his personal beliefs from government policy. In the 2012 vice presidential debate, he said he believes that life begins at conception, as the Catholic church says. But he rejected the idea that government could impose that belief on everyone.\n\"I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that women can't control their body,\" Biden said. \"It's a decision between them and their doctor.\"\nBiden added that the government should not help pay for women to have an abortion.\nClaim: Biden voted against school desegregation\nHe voted against busing, but he supported desegregation.\nBiden won his Senate seat in 1972 on a platform of integration, but once in office, he came under strong pressure from white constituents who hated the idea of busing to desegregate schools.\nHistorian Jason Sokol at the University of New Hampshire tracked Biden\u2019s response to local opposition. In the Senate, Biden began voting for anti-busing amendments.\nIn 1974, he said \"I have become convinced that busing is a bankrupt concept.\"\n\"Biden always claimed that he favored school desegregation but opposed busing as the means to achieve it,\" Sokol told us. \"The amendments that he proposed, or supported, in the mid and late 1970s, paint a somewhat muddled picture. He did indeed propose some amendments that would have effectively hamstrung all efforts for desegregation. When he was made aware of those practical effects, he sometimes backed off \u2014 and he sometimes pressed on nonetheless.\"\nWe reached out to Biden\u2019s campaign and did not hear back. Biden\u2019s spokesman Bill Russo told CNN recently that Biden continues to believe that busing could not deliver a true solution to unequal education opportunity.\n\"Joe Biden is today \u2014 and has been for more than 40 years in public life \u2014 one of the strongest and most powerful voices for civil rights in America,\" Russo told CNN.\nOur ruling\nJustice Democrats accused Biden on six points: Voting for the Iraq War, for mass incarceration, and the Bankruptcy Reform Act, \"while voting against gay marriage, reproductive rights, and school desegregation.\"\nOn each, there is a measure of accuracy. Biden\u2019s support for the bankruptcy law has the clearest proof, and the Iraq resolution is a close second.\nFor the others, there are varying degrees of nuance. The crime bills greatly expanded the prison population, but they included other measures that aimed to protect women and offered alternatives to incarceration.\nBiden\u2019s views on gay marriage changed.\nHe once supported giving states the option to overturn Roe vs. Wade, but then opposed such a move, and his views on abortion affirm a basic right, while allowing for limits.\nHe opposed busing, but favored integration by other means.\nThe Biden record is more mixed than this claim would suggest.
