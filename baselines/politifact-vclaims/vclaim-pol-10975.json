How did Mandel cut it? Setting the state budget is the job of the governor and General Assembly.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look and put the question to Mandel\u2019s campaign. They backed up the statement by citing a report released by the treasurer's office last July after a self-described \"top to bottom review\" from his first six months in office.\n\n\"By targeting waste and improving operations,\" it says, the treasurer\u2019s office ended the 2011 fiscal year with a $400,000 surplus that was returned to the general fund.\n\nThe general revenue fund operating budget for the 2012-13 biennium was reduced by $1.2 million, the report says.\n\nThe reductions in expenses range from $2,000 that had been used for an outside contract for a plant-watering service to $850,000 saved by reducing budgeted full-time employees from 140 to 127.\n\nWe looked at supporting documentation from the Legislative Service Commission and Office of Budget and Management, and at news coverage of treasurer's office operations.\n\nThe coverage included reports that the treasurer\u2019s overall budget had actually increased, from $38.3 million in fiscal 2011 to $41 million in 2012, the current fiscal year.\n\nLooking more closely, however, we found that the treasurer\u2019s overall budget includes state funds and benefits programs administered by the treasurer's office. The general revenue fund total, the portion of the budget that covers operating expenses, does decrease from the 2010-2011 biennium to 2012-2013, according to the Legislative Service Commission.\n\nThe amount appropriated by the General Assembly for operating expenses -- the spending over which the treasurer has the most direct control -- decreased from $8.2 million in fiscal 2011 to $7.7 in fiscal 2012 and 2013, according to the legislative Service Commission.\n\nSo where does Mandel\u2019s claim that he \"cut the budget\" rate on the Truth-O-Meter?\n\nHis statement is accurate. His office finished the last fiscal year with a surplus and his office cited specific steps it took to spend less money. Also, the money appropriated for operating expenses for this fiscal year and the next fiscal year is reduced from the FY 2011 total.\n\nThere is additional information, though, that provides clarification.\n\nAs seen in the ad, some listeners might interpret his bare claim that he cut the budget as meaning he trimmed the state budget. Money for the state budget, including the treasurer\u2019s office, is set by the General Assembly and the governor.\n\nAnd the overall total appropriated for his office in FY 2012 and FY2013, when including state funds and benefits programs administered by the treasurer's office, is actually greater than FY 2011.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, Mandel\u2019s claim rates Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60 Plus Association\n\n\nstated on November 7, 2011 in a television commercial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn independent payment advisory board created by in the health care reform law is \"like a Medicare IRS with the power to cut Medicare in order to pay for new government programs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Sabrina Eaton \u2022 November 25, 2011", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10975"}
