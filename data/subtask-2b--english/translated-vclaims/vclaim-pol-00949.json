Later that year, his proposal was raised to $10.10. In a tweet from 26 February, Mr. Bernie Sanders of the Institute of Higher Studies - which recently announced the second presidency - tweeted the benefits of raising the minimum wage to $15. He wrote: \"We must follow cities and states all over the country and raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and link it to the average wage growth thereafter.\" \"Doing so will give more than 40 million low-paid workers an increase, more than 25 per cent of the United States. Labour force.\" We must follow cities and states throughout the country, raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour and link it to the average wage growth thereafter. Doing so would give more than 40 million low-paid workers, more than 25 per cent of the US workforce. Sanders was close to describing a study released by the Economic Policy Institute in February, a left-wing think tank. However, it is important to note that this study assumes that no net jobs will be lost as a result of the minimum wage - a speculative and controversial assumption in some respects. The report examines the potential impact of the Pay Raising Act of 2019, sponsored by Sanders and other Democrats. The bill would result in gradual increases in the minimum wage to up to $15 by 2024. It will also refer to future increases in the minimum wage to average wage growth. The study took into account the expected natural growth of wages between now and 2024, and was calculated only as gains of the amount above that of basic wage growth. It also excludes workers who will not be affected by higher minimum wages, such as self-employed workers. It should be noted that Sanders said \"more than 40 million low-paid workers\" would benefit, but the same study said 39.7 million, just under 40 million. In addition, tweeting obscures the fact that the study looked at the entire period of entry into force of the Bill, from 2019 to 2024. According to the study, 39.7 million Americans will benefit once they reach a level of $15 by 2024, but before that, the numbers are lower. As shown in the graph above, the study referred to \"directly affected\" workers, as well as \"indirectly affected\" workers. Indirectly affected workers have been defined as receiving a slightly higher wage rate than the new minimum wage. The study assumes that these workers will receive an increase as employers adjust their pay scales upwards to reflect the new minimum wage. Will there be a loss of jobs? However, the main concern in the IDEP study is that it assumes that there is no net change in the employment situation as a result of the increase in the minimum wage. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy on 20 January 2021, some economists have for years warned against raising the minimum wage to $15, saying that this could increase employers' costs to a level that would lead to higher unemployment rates. The proponents of the upper minimum wage refer to a recent study which indicated that the minimum wage between $10 and $13 does not generally have negative effects on the labour force. However, the study did not test a minimum wage of $15, as this level has not yet been established anywhere. We contacted several economists who had told us in 2016 that they were at least somewhat cautious about this rise in wages. Timothy Smiding, Professor of Public Affairs and Economics, University of Wisconsin, said that the study was incomplete because it counted only the benefits and not the flaws. While conservatives \"just look at job losses,\" liberals \"just look at higher wages. The truth is they're both gonna happen.\" A particular problem is that the national minimum wage will raise more wages - and is likely to be more detrimental to employment levels - in states with low pay scales. In 2016, the average wages in three states were less than $15, while in another 11 states the average wages ranged from $15 to $16, while in another nine states the average wages ranged from $16 to $17. In these states, the imposition of a minimum wage of $15 could immediately raise wages to nearly half of the workers, with some seeing their wages nearly double overnight. This can have untold effects on employment, consumer prices and other aspects of the economy. \"I can't see how a rapid increase in the floor to $15 would be in the interest of such areas, because I fear that low-skilled jobs will be subject to real damage,\" said Gary Bertless, a senior colleague at the Brookings Institution. One of the economists we reviewed, Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, said that he finally ended his opposition to the minimum wage of $15 this week, because Sanders' bills have been increasing over several years and indicate future increases, removing them from politics. \"In the past, we had the minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, higher than the proposed rate at a time when real labour productivity was, on average, lower than today or would be five years later,\" said Aaron. \"Will there be some effects on employment in some places from setting a minimum wage of $15 in 2024? Probably. But the effects will be small and the increase in income for relatively low-wage workers will be high.\" In the end, it is impossible to know how many jobs will be lost due to the rise in the minimum wage to $15. What we know is that Sanders' tweeting focuses on benefits but not on the potentially negative side, reflecting certainty where uncertainty prevails. Our sentence (Sanders) said that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 \"will give more than 40 million low-paid workers an increase, more than 25 per cent of the United States. Labour force.\" This is closely related to the findings of a study carried out by the Institute for Economic Policy, a liberal group. However, it is important to note that the study did not assume any change in unemployment. This is a major assumption, a presumption that is not certain to succeed.
