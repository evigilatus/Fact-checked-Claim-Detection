Disgusting\u2014 Simon Rowntree (@SRowntreeNews) November 9, 2016\n\nAs Buzzfeed and others have reported, the tweet was sent from the account of a fake British sports journalist who has a history of making allegations about racist chants in mass crowds.\nAnother \"Simon Rowntree\" account was suspended over the summer, but Buzzfeed managed to screenshot his Twitter bio, which said he was a soccer writer for Forest Echo News. The site\u2018s account has also been suspended but it declared itself to be a parody in its bio, per Buzzfeed\u2019s screenshot.\n\nThe parody news site was the creation of a group of friends who set up fake sports journalist accounts, a person who responded on behalf of Forest Echo News told Buzzfeed. Rowntree is likely a Forest Echo fan jumping on the bandwagon.\nHere are some examples of Rowntree tweets alleging chants of racial epithets at British soccer games from his current account.\nI am at Old Trafford and I can hear racist #MCFC fans chating \"You're just an expensive dabbing golliwog\" at Paul Pogba. This is disgusting.\u2014 Simon Rowntree (@SRowntreeNews) October 26, 2016\n\nAtmosphere at Hampden Park building up. #RFC fans have now started to chant \"Refugee scum, fuck off back to Calais\".

According to videos, the crowds were rather subdued around that time.\nNews reports indicate Trump supporters inside and outside the Hilton did not get rowdy until about 10 p.m., when projections began favoring Trump as the winner.\nA few dozen \u2014 not \"thousands\" \u2014 supporters roaming Midtown shouted \"T-R-U-M-P, we will beat Hill-ar-y,\" \"U-S-A\" \u00a0and \"CNN sucks\" at about 10:25 p.m., according to Patch New York. And Trump supporters inside the Hilton began to chant \"lock her up\" around 2 a.m., CBS\u2019 Sopan Deb and NBC\u2019s Katy Tur both reported.\nOur ruling\nA viral tweet said, \"thousands\" of people at a Manhattan rally for Trump chanted, \"We hate Muslims, we hate blacks, we want our great country back.\"\nThe widely shared claim is baseless, sent from a fake account tied to a parody British soccer news site.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03952"}
