The average South Korean is\u00a03 inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.\" (That statement occurs about 1:00 into the accompanying video.)\n\n\nWe've examined a lot of unlikely facts in this campaign, including\n\nthe cooking of squirrels\n\nand the\n\nregulation of ham and cheese sandwiches\n\n, but this was a new one to us. So we did some\u00a0checking and found that McCain is right.
