The viral picture shows the shoes on the Capitol Park with the words, \"Shoes left by arms control supporters, 2018.\" It contains a picture of the thousands of shoes belonging to the victims of the concentration camps, with a comment next to it, which says \"shoes left by the victims of gun control, Germany, 1945.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The images are real and unmodified - both from the time and place specified in the comments (the photo of the concentration camp is derived from an annex in Dasho, Germany) - but the message that arms control measures helped cause the deaths of the victims of the Holocaust is wrong. Let's make something clear. The Nazis denied weapons specifically to the Jews. However, given the size of its forces and their methods of confiscation and extermination, this is a trivial factor. The idea that any difference could have been made was unreasonable. Previously, Polyte Fact researched the theory when the Minister of Housing and Urban Development, Ben Carson, linked the Holocaust to the anti-arms laws of the United States when he was a presidential candidate in 2015. We assessed that claim by mistake. So how is it wrong? Let's explain. First, the strict German regulation of weapons existed before Hitler came to power and later supervised the weapons laws that eased many of the restrictions on firearms. According to an analysis carried out in 2004 by Bernard Harcourt, a professor at Columbia University, and following Germany's defeat in World War I, the Republic of Faimar, a government that preceded Hitler, promulgated very strict firearms laws that essentially ban all ownership of firearms in an attempt to stabilize the country and comply with the Treaty of Versailles of 1919. By the time the Nazi Party attended in the early 1930s, the Firearms Registration Act of 1928 had replaced the complete ban and instead established a licensing system for the possession and sale of firearms and ammunition. However, Dagmar Elberbrook, an expert in German weapons policy at Dresden Technical University in Germany, said in 2015 that it was followed \"infrequently, so that only newly purchased weapons became largely registered. At that time, most men and many women still possess the weapons they acquired before or during the First World War.\" The Nazis used records to confiscate weapons from their enemies, but Ellerbrook also said that the files contained very few firearms in circulation and that many Jews and others were able to hide the weapons in the late 1930s. In 1938, the Nazis adopted the German Arms Act, which \"proscribed the acquisition and transport of rifles and rifles as well as ammunition,\" the books of Harcourt. Under this Act, firearms restrictions are applied only to pistols, permits have been extended from one to three years, and the legal age for procurement has been reduced from 20 to 18 years. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 11 January 2021, moreover, many other categories of people, including holders of annual fishing permits, government employees and members of the German National Socialist Workers Party, are no longer subject to restrictions on the ownership of weapons. However, the regulations were adopted to impose restrictions on Jews. In November 1938, regulations against the possession of weapons by Jews were promulgated. Under this law, Jews living under the Third Reich are prohibited from possessing or possessing any form of weapons, including truncheons, knives, firearms and ammunition. But the Nazis were already attacking Jewish houses at the time, and the Anti-Defamation Association, an organization founded to fight anti-Semitism, explained in 2013 that \"the small number of personal firearms in the hands of a small number of Jews in Germany (about 214,000) remaining in Germany in 1938 could in no way stop the totalitarian authority of the German-Nazi State.\" Umar Bartov, a historian at Brown University who studies the Third Reich, told Salon in 2013 that even if they had weapons, Jews might not have been very successful in fighting: \"Just imagine that Jews in Germany exercise the right to bear arms and fight the South Sudan Army, the South Sudan Army and the Pharmach. The Russian Red Army has lost 7 million men fighting in the armed forces, despite its tanks, aircraft and artillery. The Jews with guns and guns could have done better?\" Some supporters of the theory refer to the Warsaw uprising of 1943 as evidence that Jews with guns were successful in resisting the Nazis. However, in that intifada, some 7,000 Jews died and 50,000 were sent to concentration camps. Although the number of German losses from the intifada is disputed -- ranging from estimates of less than 20 to several hundred -- even the highest ranges reach only part of the number of Jews who died. Secondly, experts and historians have widely criticized this argument, describing it as problematic, suspicious and unreasonable. In the same statement in 2013, the Anti-Defamation Association stated that the comparison of American weapons laws with the Holocaust was inappropriate and degrading. \"We know that the national debate on arms control is one of the most divisive issues in the country, and while Americans have the right to have strong views, there is also inappropriate and degrading language in any such discussion,\" said Abraham Foxman, the Holocaust survivor and the National Director of the Association at the time. \"The idea that supporters of arms control do something similar to what Germany Hitler did to demilitarize citizens in the run-up to the Second World War is historically inaccurate and offensive, especially for Holocaust survivors and their families.\" Harcourt also told Politi Fuckett that the proposal was not a defenceable claim. \"There is no empirical evidence of this,\" wrote in the e-mail. \"More than that, Hitler was in favour of weapons possession, and the laws of arms control in Germany were relaxed for all, with the exception of Jews, of course. It makes no sense to compare Hitler to the current situation in the United States because all Hitler's actions can be explained only through the lens of the final solution, which is irrelevant here in the United States. Our judgment on social media, and the images showing the shoes of the victims of armed violence in the present America and the victims of the Holocaust indicate that arms control in Nazi Germany has exacerbated the Holocaust and that genocide could have been reduced or avoided if the victims had been armed. This theory has been dismantled and refuted over and over again. The Nazis did not disarm German citizens as a whole, but enjoyed more loose arms restrictions than they had in previous years. There was no shortage of weapons in the country, and if German citizens wanted to use weapons to rebel against the Nazis, they would have had access to them, but they did not. It is also irresponsible to compare the dictatorial system that treats possession of arms according to ethnic identity with democratic procedures for weapons regulations. This allegation is false.
