This may be why Brad Shimel, the Republican candidate for the post of Attorney General, calls himself \"the choice of law enforcement.\" This is probably why the first thing that appears on the website of the Wukisha District Attorney's campaign is to brag about 89 ratifications. In a new television announcement just a month after November 4, 2014, face-to-face with the Democratic Attorney and the Jefferson Suzanne Hap District, the announcer says that Brad Shimel, as \"official deputy and father of two girls, puts public safety before politics.\" The television broadcast, which began on 1 October 2014, continued: \"That is why the overwhelming majority of Republican and Democrat law enforcement leaders supported Brad Shimel.\" Is Schimel right? Behind Schimel's numbers are known as \"law enforcement commanders\" as district police chiefs and district attorneys. The solid majority of them -- about 60% -- run like Republicans, so Schimel has a natural advantage against Hap. However, a good number of law enforcement officials refuse to support, so the advantage is not guaranteed. We have analysed the lists of support for both candidates, and here is what we found: the collectors, Hap and Shimel 112 ratifications from current prosecutors and wardens. Schiel received 80 percent of those approvals. If you look at all police commissioners and prosecutors -- including those who have not made a statement -- a total of 89 will account for about 60 per cent. On January 10, 2021, in a television interview, \"It takes a long time on election day to download those cards, which is why we have 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. to throw the ballot papers at Milwaukee.\" \u2022 January 15, 2012, Shimel triumphed over more than nine Democrats and one independent. On the contrary, there were 23 approvals of Hap from within her party -- one Republican official didn't split to her side. To sum up, Schiel started with a normal 60 percent \"base,\" but ended up with 80 percent support from those who agreed. Therefore, through this measure, \"the overwhelming majority of Republican and Democratic Law Enforcement Leaders\" adheres to scrutiny. But his claim can also be read as a majority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats. With this measure, it is precise with Republicans, but not with Democrats. Of the 32 Democrats who agreed to this, Hap received 23 versus nine from Shemel. For Shimmel, that's 28% of the gestures from Democrats. This is 28 per cent higher than Hap's victory among Republicans, but not by a majority. Our Schimel Declaration says that \"the overwhelming majority of Republican and Democratic Law Enforcement Leaders have supported Brad Schimel. The candidate received 80 per cent support from those who approved, and nine Democrats were pushed into a barn. He has won a clear majority in general, and Republicans, but not only Democrats. This makes it part of the delicate claim, our definition of half the truth.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07155"}
