Nathan Deal. Kalberman claimed orders to eliminate Streicker\u2019s position and cut her own $125,000 salary by a third were politically motivated, while commission Chairman Patrick Millsaps and other commission members said cuts to the commission\u2019s budget meant it could no longer afford the executives\u2019 salaries.\n\nThe salary talks came as Kalberman was preparing to serve subpoenas on the governor, his chief of staff and associates for campaign spending documents as part of an ethics investigation. The subpoenas never were served, and the commission has asked Deal\u2019s lawyer to voluntarily turn the papers over.\n\nSome have said the General Assembly\u2019s slashing of the commission budget has weakened its ability to investigate irregularities. But when Deal was asked about it in a Q&A in the current edition of Georgia Trend magazine, he said the commission was not cut more than any other part of state government, including his own office.\n\n\"They took absolutely the same percent of cuts as most other state agencies,\" he said. \"When you\u2019re making up a $1.4 billion [deficit], we had to continue to cut. They were somewhere in the 7 percent range \u2013 same as the governor\u2019s office.\"\n\nDeal is the right man to talk to about the state budget since the General Assembly largely followed his blueprint to craft the $18.3 billion spending plan for the new state fiscal year, which began July 1.\n\nDid he get it right?\n\nLong story short, the answer is yes. But it turns out that when dealing with the state budget, getting there isn\u2019t half the fun.\n\nFrom the start, Brian Robinson laid the groundwork by saying his boss was speaking off the cuff.\n\n\"What the governor knew was that he ordered the governor\u2019s office to have as big a cut as any agency,\" he said. \"Obviously, not all agencies or departments got cuts. Education, for example, got more money than before.\"\n\nWith help from the state Office of Planning and Budget, we find there is some math to wade through before we get our answer.\n\nOn July 1, the ethics commission started out with a budget of $1,084,145, compared with last year\u2019s original allocation of $1,131,121. That\u2019s actually a 4.2 percent cut.\n\nBy comparison, the governor\u2019s office began fiscal 2011 with $6,276,732 and started this year with $5,914,065. That\u2019s a 5.8 percent cut, which would indicate the governor was more than right in that the governor\u2019s office took an even larger percentage cut to its budget than the ethics commission.\n\nBut inside every agency\u2019s budget is what the budget office refers to as \"adjustments.\" Adjustments are essentially pass-through funds given to pay for things such as health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation and are not considered part of the agency\u2019s operating budget.\n\nTake those adjustments out, and using the baseline of the original fiscal 2011 appropriation, the cut to the ethics commission\u2019s new budget is 7.6 percent. And, using the same calculation, the cut to the governor\u2019s office is 7.2 percent.\n\nRobinson said the budget numbers reflect a promise kept.\n\n\"Facing a budget deficit, Gov. Deal led the way he promised Georgians he would. He cut spending,\" Robinson said. \"He set the example by cutting the governor's office budget by 7 percent, as much as any state agency or department.\"\n\nThe governor appoints three of the five board members to the ethics commission; the General Assembly appoints the other two.\n\nIt was up to the commissioners to figure out how to spend their smaller budget. The contemplated cut to Kalberman\u2019s salary and the elimination of Streicker\u2019s position accomplished that.\n\nFor sake of context, the ethics commission\u2019s budget has been slashed 42 percent since fiscal 2008, but the new governor had no say in it until this year.\n\nWhile this likely does little to settle questions over the staffing changes at the ethics commission, it does verify Deal\u2019s statement to Georgia Trend, which we rate True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before Joe Biden signed an order \u201cfor all federal vehicles\u201d to be electric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 February 2, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12394"}
