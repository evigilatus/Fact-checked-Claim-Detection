States have procedures to prevent double voting", "text": "A widespread Facebook post wrongly claims that a loophole in mail-in voting would let people cast two ballots without election officials catching on to the scheme. The supposed trick: Vote once by mail, and then a second time in person before the mail-in ballot gets counted.\n\"This is real,\" says the Aug. 20 post, which has been shared thousands of times on the platform. \"If I mail in my ballot on Sunday and show up to the polling station on Tuesday, they won\u2019t know if I\u2019ve already voted or not. That, my friends, is a serious concern for all of us.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Like claims that receiving multiple mail ballot applications means voters can return multiple ballots, it\u2019s inaccurate.\u00a0\nThe Associated Press has debunked the same claim, and elections experts told PolitiFact that every state has procedures to detect and prevent such double voting.\n\"The entire premise is wrong,\" said Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington.\n\"All states have controls in place specifically to address this,\" added Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"States handle this differently, but the principle is that you only get to vote once.\"\nHow states check to ensure one vote per person\nTypically, experts said, poll books used for in-person voting will indicate whether you received a vote-by-mail or absentee ballot (there\u2019s no objective difference between the two). What happens when you show up in person depends on the state\u2019s laws and the type of poll book used.\nIn general, experts described a handful of ways election systems would handle the Facebook post\u2019s hypothetical scenario, assuming you are duly registered to vote in the first place:\n\n\nYou show up to vote on Tuesday. The poll worker notes that you were issued a mail-in ballot. You brought the mail-in ballot with you, so you surrender it and vote in person.\u00a0\n\n\nYou show up to vote on Tuesday. The poll worker notes that you were issued a mail-in ballot. You don\u2019t have your mail-in ballot with you. The poll worker lets you submit a provisional ballot, which election officials count only if the mail-in ballot doesn't show\u00a0up.\u00a0\n\n\nYou show up to vote on Tuesday. The poll worker notes that you were issued a mail-in ballot. The poll book is electronic, so the poll worker lets you vote in person and updates the book, which notifies the election office that you did so. When your mail-in ballot arrives later, election officials reject it and count the in-person ballot instead.\n\n\nYou show up to vote on Tuesday. The poll worker notes that you were issued a mail-in ballot. The poll book indicates that your ballot has already been accepted for counting and removed from its return envelope. You are not allowed to vote in person.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

The poll worker notes that you were issued a mail-in ballot. The poll book indicates that your ballot has already been accepted for counting and removed from its return envelope. You dispute this and submit a provisional ballot, which election officials count only if the record proves to be erroneous.\u00a0\n\n\nSome states detail their procedures online. In California, for example, voters who receive vote-by-mail ballots but want to vote in person can hand over their mail-in ballot and vote in person, or fill out a provisional ballot. But in each case, only one vote per person counts.\u00a0\nAll mail-in ballots require verification before being counted. Matt Dietrich, a spokesperson for the Illinois State Board of Elections, said mail ballots in Illinois are \"extremely carefully tracked and verified,\" with return envelopes that contain bar codes for the voter\u2019s unique voter ID number.\nVoter fraud is illegal\nThere are reasons why people who request mail-in ballots might legitimately show up at the polls, said Lorraine Minnite, an associate professor of public policy at Rutgers University, Camden.\n\"People anticipate needing to vote by mail, and then their plans change and they show up at the polls,\" Minnite said. \"Or sometimes, in the case of people whose memories are failing, they don't remember having voted a month or two before an election and proceed to the polls on Election Day, only to find out that they have already voted.\"\nBut as an intentional double-voting scheme, the process described in the Facebook post \"is not a viable loophole,\" Dietrich said. In fact, it\u2019s a surefire way to get caught committing voter fraud.\u00a0\n\"This is an easy felony to prove because the voter would be signing his or her name twice \u2014 once on the mail ballot and then again at the polling place,\" Dietrich said.\nWeil, the director of the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s Elections Project, agreed: \"It\u2019s one of the most obvious ways to get caught because you\u2019re not actually casting any ballot that they don\u2019t know about ... You\u2019d be giving them all the evidence they need to show that you double voted.\"\nWeil said voters hoping to cast their ballots by mail should send them in early, rather than waiting until the Sunday before Election Day, to ensure that they are received on time and counted.\nRELATED: How to make sure your ballot is counted this fall\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said, \"If I mail in my ballot on Sunday and show up to the polling station on Tuesday, they won\u2019t know if I\u2019ve already voted or not.\"\nThat wouldn\u2019t work in practice. All states have procedures in place to prevent double voting, and people who try it are likely to get caught.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17209"}
