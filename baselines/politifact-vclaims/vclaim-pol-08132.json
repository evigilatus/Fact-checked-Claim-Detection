Scott Walker\u2019s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle.\nWe were struck by the final statement -- that Burke \"says she\u2019s on the side of the middle class,\" but that \"Burke\u2019s 2007-'09 state budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion -- costing every man, woman and child in the state an extra $310.\"\nBurke\u2019s state budget?\nWas she governor?\nAsked for backup to the claim, state GOP spokesman Jesse Dougherty said Burke created the Commerce portion of the 2007-\u201909 budget; worked with Doyle \"on his final product\"; and promoted the overall budget.\nAs we found in rating a similar claim by the state party in February 2014, Burke was responsible for and submitted the Commerce portion of Doyle\u2019s overall 2007-\u201909 budget. We also found that she spoke out enthusiastically in favor of the overall plan, saying it \"identifies our priorities for success.\"\nBut to call it \"Burke\u2019s budget\" is something different.\nThe GOP might as well have called it Frank Busalacchi\u2019s budget (he was Doyle\u2019s transportation secretary at the time) or Kevin Hayden\u2019s budget (Doyle\u2019s health and family services secretary).\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor that matter, when Doyle\u2019s 2007-\u201909 budget proposal was introduced it exceeded $57 billion, with the Commerce Department getting about \u00a0$413.7 million, or less than 1 percent of the total.\nIn Wisconsin, the state budget is set by elected officials, not appointed Cabinet secretaries. The governor submits a budget. The Legislature, typically after making changes, adopts the budget. Finally, the governor signs the budget into law.\nAs for the rest of the claim, that the budget raised taxes by $1.8 billion, Doyle\u2019s proposed budget did seek a total revenue increase of nearly $1.8 billion -- $1.37 billion in taxes and the rest in fees. Wisconsin's total population was about 5.67 million at the time, so the total increase in taxes and fees would have been about $310 per person.\nBut, while the figures are essentially correct, the thrust of the claim is an attack on Burke.\nAnd to say Doyle\u2019s budget was hers goes too far.\nOur rating\nThe state GOP said \"Burke's 2007-'09 state budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion -- costing every man, woman and child in the state an extra $310.\"\nThe figures are basically on target, but the real target of the party\u2019s claim was Burke. And to put a governor\u2019s entire state budget on an appointed Cabinet secretary is a misfire.\nWe rate the statement False.\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's web page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08132"}
