Chris Christie says he is weaning the state off such volatile resources, known as one-shots.\n\nBut a Democratic lawmaker tells a different story.\n\nAssemblyman John Burzichelli, who represents parts of Cumberland, Gloucester and Salem counties and serves as deputy speaker, discussed the proposed fiscal year 2013 budget during a March 28 NJTV appearance. He said that \"the use of one-shot monies, which means monies found that are only going to be available one time, are exceeding $600 million dollars in this budget and last year they were $96 million.\n\n\"And that's a very dramatic change. So that tells you that the structural work that we're trying to do to keep the budget in balance is still struggling. And when you take advantage of income that is only coming one time the next year you have to find a way to replace that or you have to take other drastic steps,\" Burzichelli said, adding \"that the use of that, what is called one-shots, is a 500 percent increase over the last Corzine budget.\"\n\nNew Jersey Treasury Department documents show the state used $3.82 billion in one-shots in fiscal year 2010, the last budget former Gov. Jon Corzine signed. Christie\u2019s 2013 budget proposal includes $1.64 billion in such revenues.\n\nThat\u2019s a decrease, not a 500 percent increase, as Burzichelli claims. So what gives?\n\nLet\u2019s say a family spent less on groceries this year than last year, but spent more on cereal over the same time frame. Overall, the family spent less, even though they spent more on a particular type of food.\n\nThat\u2019s essentially how Burzichelli makes his claim. In total, Christie is using fewer one-shots than Corzine. But Christie\u2019s reliance on a specific type of one-shots has increased.\n\nChristie is proposing to use $642.3 million in a type of one-shots called revenue-related initiatives, which includes transfers from funds dedicated for specific purposes, such as clean energy. \u00a0That\u2019s an increase of more than 490 percent from the $108.8 million used in fiscal 2010. In the current budget, Christie relied on $96.4 million in similar revenues.\n\nBurzichelli cites some of those figures in the television interview, but he doesn\u2019t explain what they represent.\n\nA spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, Tom Hester, said Burzichelli was referring specifically to revenue-related initiatives. \"It\u2019s that simple. You can read it any way you want, but doing [so] ignores the irresponsible impact of these budget raids,\" he said.\n\nBut by focusing only on some one-shots, Burzichelli ignores a larger context.\n\nIn total, Corzine\u2019s last spending plan relied on $3.82 billion in one-time revenue resources. In Christie\u2019s proposal, one-time revenue totals $1.64 billion.\n\nFederal stimulus aid inflated the total use of one-time revenues in 2010. But John Sugden, a credit analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s who wrote a report in February critical of Christie\u2019s proposed budget, said the federal aid is still a source of revenue that will have to be replaced the following fiscal year.\n\nSugden said in an e-mail that \"the use of non-recurring revenues (one-shots) to fund recurring expenditures, in our view, creates budgetary gaps or shortfalls in the following year regardless of what their source is.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nBurzichelli said the reliance on one-time revenues in the governor\u2019s proposed budget is a \"500 percent increase over the last Corzine budget.\"\n\nThat\u2019s roughly correct for a particular type of one-shots that includes money diverted from dedicated funds.\n\nBut the assemblyman doesn\u2019t make that clear and the state relies on hundreds of millions of dollars in other one-time revenue-generating measures. And, in total, Christie is using less one-time revenue than Corzine. \u00a0\n\nBurzichelli\u2019s claim has a hint of truth but cherry-picks statistics and ignores critical context.
