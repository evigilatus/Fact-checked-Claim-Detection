Those dollars, as he said in his first democratic debate, could do much more. \"Today in America, we have more people in prison than any other country on Earth,\" said Sanders. \"It seems to me that instead of building more prisons and providing more prison, perhaps, just maybe, we should put money in education and jobs for our children.\" We take Sanders' use of the word \"prison\" to prisons. The United States is the third most populated country - China and India - about four times the number of people. Do we really put more people in jail than any other country? The last numbers say we do. According to the United States Office of Justice Statistics, in 2013 there were more than 2.2 million people in local prisons, state prisons and federal prisons. It is somewhat difficult to obtain solid rock numbers at the international level. The United Nations is collecting some information, but it covers only some 50 countries and does not include China. Fortunately, the Institute for Research on Criminal Policy, based at the Faculty of Law of Berkebeck, University of London, has collected more comprehensive data. At its expense, China has about 1.65 million prisoners. This puts him in second place after the United States. Russia ranks third, with about 655,000 prisoners. According to United Nations data, Russia has about 700,000 prisoners, but this includes people detained without a final decision. The number of prisoners in China may be much higher, the central observation. In 2009, Chinese government officials reported that more than 650,000 people were held in detention centres throughout China, in addition to the number of convicted prisoners. If this is the same as in mid-2013, the total prison population will be more than 2.3 million in China, pushing it higher than the United States. But we can't settle this possibility here. The experts told us that the best way to compare prison populations around the world is to measure the prison population of a country as a share of the national population. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 On January 16, 2012, the number of prisoners in the United States (707 per 100,000) was adjusted to exceed the number of prisoners in the United States in the surrounding countries, including China. However, according to the latest data, they rank second - not first - in all parts of the world. The first is the small Seychelles State, which has the highest rate of 868 prisoners per 100,000 population based on the latest data. Peter Wagner is the Executive Director of the Prison Policy Initiative, a non-profit group supporting the reduction of the prison population. Wagner told Polyte Fact in February the country is not at all in the same league. Seychelles is a group of African islands in the north-east Indian Ocean from Madagascar and home to more than 90,000 people. From the perspective, the lowest-populated American states are Wyoming with over 580,000 residents. The addition of 240 Seychellesans from 2012 to 2014 to a small prison population in the first place drives this rate significantly from 707 prisoners per 100,000 inhabitants to 868, surpassing the United States. Wagner said \"I believe small countries are not comparable,\" adding that the 2014 Prison Group Report nominated countries with a population of less than half a million. Our sentence, Sanders, said that America has more people in prison than any other country. It is likely to concern the population in state and federal prisons, as well as local prisoners. The latest federal census found more than 2.2 million people behind bars in the United States. A research centre in England reports that China ranks second with about 1.65 million prisoners. However, the Chinese figure does not include many thousands of people in detention centres, and we do not know how many of them will be. Regardless of the size of the population, America has a higher incarceration rate than any other country. We're mostly assessing the claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05860"}
