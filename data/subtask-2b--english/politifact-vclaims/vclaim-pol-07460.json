The decision in Ed O\u2019Bannon vs. NCAA said student-athletes cannot be banned from profiting off of their own names and likenesses.\nThe NCAA plans to appeal the decision, at least in part, said president Mark Emmert on ABC News\u2019 This Week Aug. 10. Emmert defended the athletes\u2019 amateur status by emphasizing their academic successes.\n\"Many, many, many thousands of student-athletes take full advantage of the opportunity to be both a student and an athlete while they\u2019re in college,\" Emmert said. \"The vast majority of them graduate. More graduate than the students who aren\u2019t student-athletes. So I believe strongly, and more importantly, the evidence demonstrates that indeed they are students.\"\nWith how much time student-athletes spend in practice, in games and on the road, we wondered if it\u2019s true that they have higher graduation rates than their nonathlete peers.\nThe rates\nThe NCAA calculates its graduation success rate by tracking how many student-athletes graduate within six years of enrolling, including students who transfer between schools in good academic standing.\nUsing this measurement, the NCAA Division I student-athlete graduation rate was 82 percent for students who enrolled in 2006 and graduated by 2012.\nIn Division II, the graduation rate was 69 percent for the 2006 cohort. Division III schools aren\u2019t required to disclose their graduation rates to the NCAA. But among those that did, the graduation rate for students who enrolled in 2005 was 88 percent.\nHowever, there is no general student body graduation data using the NCAA\u2019s parameters.\nTo show that the student-athlete graduation rate is higher than that of the student body, NCAA officials point to the federal graduation rate, which counts both student athletes and the general student body.\nIt\u2019s different than the NCAA measurement because it only counts students who graduate from the institution where they first enrolled and not transfer students. (The purpose is to measure retention.) To get an idea of the size difference between the two pools, the federal rate included 82,226 Division I student-athletes in 2012, and the NCAA rate included 91,701.\nThe federal measurement tends to calculate a much lower student-athlete graduation rate than the NCAA\u2019s measurement.\nUsing this measurement, 65 percent of Division I student-athletes who enrolled in 2006 and graduated by 2012. This is only 1 percentage point higher than the general student body, which had a 64 percent graduation rate.\nThe difference is a little bigger in the other divisions. Division II athletes had a graduation rate of 68 percent, while the general student body had a rate of 64 percent. For Division III (the 2005 cohort) the student-athlete rate was 54 percent compared with\u00a048 percent generally.\nResearchers at the College Sports Research Institute at the University of South Carolina have also expressed concern that these calculations include part-time students in the general student body. Part-time students are less likely to graduate in the six-year time frame, bringing down an institution\u2019s overall graduation rate. (The NCAA requires student-athletes to go to school full time.)\nThe institute\u2019s adjusted graduation rate calculations regularly show major negative gaps between Division I football and men\u2019s basketball graduation rates and that of their nonathlete peers.\nBreaking it down further\nThe graduation rates vary wildly by sport, school and demographic group. \u00a0For example, compare men\u2019s basketball and football (what often comes to mind when we think college sports) to the general student body and other student-athletes:\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\n\n\nNCAA grad\u00a0rate\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal grad\u00a0rate \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGeneral student body\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n64 percent\n\n\n\n\nAll Div.

Additionally, more than half of the 18 women\u2019s sports have graduation rates higher than 90 percent, while only one men\u2019s sport \u2014\u00a0fencing \u2014\u00a0has a graduation rate above 90 percent.\nUnder the federal measurement, the sports with the highest graduation rates are: men\u2019s gymnastics with 88 percent, women\u2019s gymnastics with 83 percent and women\u2019s lacrosse with 80 percent.\nSome experts have taken issue with the NCAA\u2019s claim because the graduation rates vary depending on the team, meaning one group\u2019s success could mask another\u2019s troubles.\n\"Emmert is not referring to football and men's basketball, which is considerably lower,\" said Gerald Gurney, a former senior associate athletic director for academics at Oklahoma University. \"The problem in college sports is not with the women's soccer team.\"\nAdditionally, it\u2019s difficult to compare the graduation rates and other academic successes of student-athletes to nonathletes because some programs keep their athletes up to NCAA academic standards \"by any means necessary,\" said Dave Ridpath, a professor of sports administration at Ohio University. He referenced the recent controversy at the University of North Carolina, where some football players were registered for fake classes to get easy As.\n\"Keeping them eligible by any means necessary \u2026 might lead to graduation, but are they educated?\" Ridpath said.\nOur ruling\nEmmert said, \"more (student-athletes) graduate than the students who aren\u2019t student-athletes.\"\nExperts, the government and the NCAA don\u2019t agree on how this data should be calculated. But the best and most recent measurement we have for drawing a comparison shows that the graduation rate among Division I student-athletes is about the same as the general student body, though it is higher for Division II and Division II.\nBut the graduation rates are not the same across all sports, divisions, schools or demographics, so a group with a particularly good or bad graduation rate could skew the overall results.\nBecause the data is inconclusive, we rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07460"}
