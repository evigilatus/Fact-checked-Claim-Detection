They tied the name to the 2015 Paris attacks, not to mention saying Hyde was the mastermind behind the coronavirus.\nAnd now, just as absurdly, the name has been linked to Beirut and the devastating explosion there.\nUnder the line \"They've confrimed it. Hunt this sick dog down,\" a Facebook post had side-by-side images of what looked like reports from the New York Times and the BBC. The one from the Times said \"Sam Hyde identified as perpitrator of Beirut explosion.\" The BBC headline was \"Lebanese police confrim Samuel Hyde is behind the explosion.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

He\u2019s a comedian with a right-wing bent whose name got picked up in 2015 by anonymous users of the far-right image-sharing site 4chan and attached to various incidents of deadly violence. In the immediate aftermath of a 2017 mass shooting in Texas, a U.S. congressman fell for a bogus post and told CNN that Hyde had been named as the shooter.\nNo need for you to be fooled. This is more Sam Hyde Pants-on-Fire nonsense.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17051"}
