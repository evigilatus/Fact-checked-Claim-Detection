And I mandate it. I said, \u2018Has to be.\u2019 \"\nTrump was more than likely referring to the most recent version of the GOP health care overhaul, an amendment by U.S. Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., introduced in late April.\n\"This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay? This bill has evolved,\" Trump said. \"But we have now pre-existing conditions in the bill. We've set up a pool for the pre-existing conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall.\"\nWhen CBS\u2019 John Dickerson pressed Trump on whether everyone with pre-existing conditions would be covered, Trump said, \"We actually have a clause that guarantees.\"\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said at the May 1 news briefing that Trump was referring to the MacArthur amendment and that Trump is ensuring that \"coverage of pre-existing conditions is at the core\" of the legislation.\nBut the reality of how the bill addresses pre-existing conditions -- which are health problems patients have before new insurance kicks in -- is much more complicated than Trump makes it sound.\nWhat the amendment says on pre-existing conditions\nIn March, the Republican\u2019s American Health Care Act died without a vote when Republicans couldn\u2019t agree on the bill designed to replace the Affordable Care Act. Under the new bill, called ACHA, insurers had to cover pre-existing conditions, but they could have charged more for people who are recently uninsured.\nThe MacArthur amendment would allow states to obtain waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including the \"essential health benefits\" provision that requires maternity care or mental health services.\nThe amendment has language that appears to protect those with pre-existing conditions stating that \"nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut experts say other parts of the amendment suggest that those with pre-existing conditions could struggle to maintain affordable health insurance.\nThe amendment permits insurers to set premiums based on the \"health status\" of an individual by looking at their current and past health status and make predictions about how much an individual will use medical care in the future, said Linda Blumberg, senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute.\nThat\u2019s where pre-existing conditions could come into play, because it would mean that the costs rise for consumers who are sicker, said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University School of Law emeritus professor.\n\"Health status underwriting is literally charging a higher (possibly much, unaffordably, higher) premium to people with pre-existing conditions,\" Jost said. \"Under the MacArthur amendment, they could not be refused coverage, but insurers could impose high enough premiums that coverage would be unaffordable.\"\nThe amendment says that the waiver would allow states to set up a high-risk pool or participate in a new federal invisible risk-sharing program to help states reimburse insurers for covering high-risk consumers. \u00a0\n\"No state may obtain a waiver for health status unless it has taken these efforts to protect those who might be affected,\" stated a MacArthur press release. \"In states with a waiver, individuals who maintain continuous coverage could not be rated based on health status.\"\nThat means people who stay insured without any lapses can\u2019t be charged more by insurance companies if they get sick.\nBut experts said that many low-income people aren\u2019t able to stay covered without breaks, \u00a0and that questions remain about the effectiveness of the high-risk pools.\nThe American Medical Association, which opposes the amendment, said in a statement that it \"could make coverage unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions.\" The AMA raised questions about whether the high-risk pool would be \"sufficient to provide for affordable health insurance or prevent discrimination against individuals with certain high-cost medical conditions.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said of the GOP health care amendment, \"Pre-existing conditions are in the bill.\"\nThe amendment says that health insurers can\u2019t limit access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but that insurers can charge people more if states agree. In some states, health insurers would be able to charge sicker people more. And experts warn that high-risk pools -- the mechanisms meant to keep premiums lower for sick people -- might not be effective.\nOverall, the latest proposal seems to weaken existing protections for people with pre-existing conditions, not strengthen them.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\n' Share the Facts 2017-05-01 20:27:43 UTC   Politifact    4 1 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly False  Says of the GOP health care proposal, \"pre-existing conditions are in the bill.\"    Donald Trump president    Sunday, April 30, 2017 2017-04-30    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03361"}
