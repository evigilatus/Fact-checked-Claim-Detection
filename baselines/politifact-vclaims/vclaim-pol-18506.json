Fireworks in London had been going off for several days in celebration of the Nov. 5 British holiday Guy Fawkes Day. And the church bells in a Paris suburb were reportedly sounding out for mass.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The paper said the bells were automatically programmed to ring to announce 6 p.m. mass.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

The official holiday falls on Nov. 5, but there are typically fireworks in the days before and after, especially when the date falls on a weekday.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether any of the fireworks heard in London were related to the U.S. election, but there\u2019s no evidence they were primarily set off in response to Biden\u2019s win.\nWe rate this post False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18506"}
