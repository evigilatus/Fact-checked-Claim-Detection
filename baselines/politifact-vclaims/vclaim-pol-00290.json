Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2019 \nTrump was referring to a news conference by U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley. Did they misrepresent what happened? For this fact-check, we go to the tape.\nTrump\u2019s visit\nTrump went straight from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to the hospital where he spent about two hours. No media was allowed. The White House provided video and photos. They show many smiles and handshakes as Trump met with people.\nWe love you Dayton, Ohio! pic.twitter.com/IaCZAdyuzL\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2019 \nAfterward, the hospital\u2019s CEO told reporters the visit was meaningful and at times emotional.\nA City Hall press conference\nControversy preceded Trump\u2019s visit. At a vigil after the shooting that killed nine people, Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine was shouted down by the crowd. The day before Trump came to Dayton, Mayor Whaley told reporters she was disappointed in Trump\u2019s response to the shooting and wouldn\u2019t discourage protestors who objected to his visit.\nWhaley and Brown greeted Trump at the Air Force base and accompanied him at the hospital.\nAfter he left, they took questions at Dayton City Hall. They spent the bulk of their time talking about gun policy. They said they asked Trump to support universal background checks, fund Medicaid mental health services and ban assault weapons.\nBrown downplayed the value of Trump giving awards to the police who stopped the killer. Brown suggested what he cast as a more substantive step.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The most important thing you can do for these police officers is take these assault weapons off the streets so they don't have to go up against those assault weapons, and they need to take down a shooter,\" Brown said.\nBrown criticized Trump for using rhetoric that he said divides Americans and invites racial discord. And both of them said they expected little action to come from Trump to regulate firearms.\nBrown and Whaley said very little about Trump\u2019s time with patients and others.\nBy our count, they spoke about 1,800 words in the 14 minutes they spent with reporters. Out of that, they offered about 60 words describing the time Trump spent with citizens.\nThose words did not run afoul of Trump\u2019s version of events.\n\"I think the victims and the first responders were grateful that the president of the United States came today,\" Whaley said.\n\"He was received as well as you can expect by the patients,\" Brown said. \"They are hurting. He was comforting, he and Melania did the right things. It's his job, in part, to comfort people. I'm glad he did it.\"\nViewers of the video can judge the tone of their remarks.\nImmediately after the news conference, the Associated Press reported, \"Ohio Democratic officials say they were gratified by President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the Dayton, the scene of a weekend mass shooting, and said Trump was treated respectfully, despite the fact some didn\u2019t agree with his past rhetoric or policies.\"\nThe White House declined to comment.\nOur ruling\nTrump said the remarks from Democrats Brown and Whaley misrepresented his visit with survivors, medical staff and first responders of the shooting in Dayton. He called their presentation \"a fraud.\"\nBrown and Whaley said very little about Trump\u2019s meeting, but what they said leaned toward the positive. Brown called Trump \"comforting,\" and said he was glad Trump had come. Whaley said people were grateful that the president had visited.\nThat might amount only to measured praise of Trump\u2019s time at the hospital, but it doesn\u2019t come close to being a fraud or misrepresenting the mood.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00290"}
