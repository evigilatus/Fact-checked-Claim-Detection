Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 20, 2018\n\n\nIt\u2019s clear that what is so far a mini-trade war has hurt prices. Have trade deals done the same? Trump focused on soybeans, so we took a look.\nKey takeaways\n\n\nSoybean prices have fallen since 2012, but the main driver has been weather. A drought that year cut production. Lower supply led to higher prices. Good weather followed, which boosted yields and pushed prices down.\n\n\nTrump tied falling prices to \"terrible\" trade deals, but that\u2019s misleading.\n\n\nChina is far and away the largest importer of American soybeans, buying about $12.3 billion worth last year, triple the amount in 2005. This has happened in the absence of a U.S.-China trade deal.\n\n\nThe ups and downs of soybeans\nTrump looked back to \"five years before the election.\" We asked the White House to clarify and didn\u2019t hear back. 2012 was the highwater mark for soybean prices. They topped out at $17.70 a bushel in early September 2012. At the end of 2017, the price was $9.55. Corrected for inflation, prices dropped over 50 percent.\nHere\u2019s how the futures market for soybeans has performed since 2000.\n\n\nSeveral forces drove soybean markets, but the leading one has been weather. A drought in 2012 pushed down yields, which in turn, drove up prices.\nSince then, the reverse happened.\n\"In the past five years, we have had very good weather, \" said Aaron Smith, agricultural economist at University of California-Davis. \"Yields have been higher and that means prices go down.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween cooperative weather and new growing techniques, the yield per acre went up about 25 percent since 2012, Smith said.\nSmith noted that before 2012, soybean prices rose thanks to the ripple effects of the growing use of ethanol. Corn is a major raw material for ethanol, and with rising demand, farmers shifted more acres from soybeans to corn. That kept soybean production in check and with fewer bushels of soybeans than there would have been, prices headed up.\nBut to understand soybeans sales, Smith said you need to look to Asia, and primarily China.\n\"The demand from China has tripled in the past ten years or so,\" Smith said.\nThe USDA statistics paint a clear picture.\n\n\nWhile the sales numbers bounce around a bit, China\u2019s appetite for soybeans has been strong for the past 15 years. And that has been good for American farmers.\nAndrew Muhammad, a trade economist at the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture, said trade deals could not have been a factor here.\n\"China is our number one soybean export market, and we have no trade deal with China,\" Muhammad said.\nIn the 1990s, Congress granted China Most Favored Nation status. That boosted trade between the United States and China, but Most Favored Nation sets broad rules, in contrast to micro-level details that get hammered out in formal trade treaties, such as the one with Colombia, one of the most recent agreements.\nThe United States does have a trade agreement with Mexico. Mexico is not as big of a buyer as China, but sales have gone up since 2000 and largely held steady since 2012. The North American Free Trade Agreement might present issues in other areas of trade, but soybeans isn\u2019t one of them.\nOur ruling\nTrump said soybean prices have fallen since 2012 and a big factor was bad trade deals. \u00a0\nTrump\u2019s link between trade deals and falling prices is misplaced. Experts who know agriculture say it comes down to supply and demand. On the supply side, weather is the single most important factor, followed closely by more productive growing techniques.\nOn the demands side, look to China.\nAmerican farmers have benefited from current trade rules. Their largest buyer is China, where sales to China have tripled since 2005. The United States has no trade deal with China.\nIt does have a trade deal with Mexico, where sales gradually increased and plateaued in recent years.\nTrump is correct that soybean prices have fallen, but his point about trade deals ignores the real drivers.
