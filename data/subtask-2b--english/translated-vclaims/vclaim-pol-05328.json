As an example, he revived an earlier claim - that the wives of the terrorists of 11 September knew what would have happened and fled from the United States to Saudi Arabia just before the attacks. \"A man flying at the World Trade Center and his family is being returned to where they were going -- and I think most of you know where they went, and by the way, it wasn't Iraq. But they're back in a certain area. They knew what was going on. The wife knows exactly what was going on, \"Trump said. They left early two days in connection with the World Trade Center and went back to where they went and saw her husband on TV flying to the World Trade Center. In part of the response, Trump seems to be talking about one wife, but then he makes it clear that he's talking about all the planes involved in the attack - actually there were four. So in the same breath, he seems to be talking about multiple wives. On December 15, the GOP discussion in Las Vegas was more visible when he said that friends, family and friends \"were put on planes and were, in most cases, returned to Saudi Arabia. They knew what was going on. They went home and wanted to watch their friends on TV. Regardless of this, Trump's version of September 2001 does not live up to the level of scrutiny. Of all the kidnappers, no wife, friend or family member had been in the United States during the days or months prior to the abductions, according to the report of the 11 September Commission. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, everything was not determined, but \"they certainly weren't living in the United States,\" said Philip D. Zeliko, Executive Director of the 11 September Commission, Politi Factte in mid-December. In fact, only two of the 19 kidnappers were married and only one had a girlfriend, and she lived in Germany. The Commission concluded that most of the 19 kidnappers had \"cut off regular contact with their families\" well in advance of the attacks, with the exception of the kidnapper with his girlfriend in Germany. He was on board the plane that crashed in the countryside of Pennsylvania. After extensive interviews, the investigators concluded that they knew nothing about the conspiracy. The words of Tramp may reflect some confusion with the departure of Osama bin Laden's family members, who are in a hurry - not any wife or friend of Bin Laden himself - a few days after the attack. Most of Bin Laden's relatives were in high school or college in the United States. In an interview with The New York Times, Saudi Ambassador Bandar Bensultan said that with the help of the FBI, his government had arranged for these people to gather in Washington where a charter plane would take them to Saudi Arabia. But it seems clear that Trump wasn't talking about them. The fact that some of these relatives were evacuated from the United States to protect them does not make what Trump said during Fox's discussion more precise. Trump's claim is wrong. On September 11, presidential candidate Donald Trump shared with the wives of the kidnappers \"know exactly what was happening\" and returned to Saudi Arabia two days before the attacks to watch their husbands on TV flying planes.
