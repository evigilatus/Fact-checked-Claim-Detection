Are billions at stake?", "text": ":: During a recent visit to the United States-Mexico border, Gavin Newsome, elected by the Democratic Government of California, claimed that last month &apos; s closure of Trump &apos; s interim border administration cost $5.3 million in economic loss in the region and that future closures could amount to billions of dollars. In November, United States border officials stopped 25 traffic for several hours at the port of San Isidro, which serves as a gateway between Tijuana and San Diego. It is the busiest land crossing in the United States and among the most crowded in the world. The closure took place for six hours when immigrants from Central America protested directly south of the crossing. Subsequently, a team rushed to a border fence and was interviewed by United States border agents with tear gas on them, saying that some threw stones at them. In a statement the same day, Internal Security Minister Kirsten Nelson said that her agency would \"not hesitate to close ports of entry for reasons of security and public safety\" and \"will not tolerate this kind of lawlessness.\" After days of closure, here's what Newsome claimed at a press conference near the San Isidou crossing: \"Every time, with respect, there is a volatile comment about border closures, affecting the economy and the lives of hundreds of thousands if not millions of people who depend on that trade on a daily basis. ... [There was] $5.3 million in economic loss only for a few hours of border closure.\" \"You're talking about millions and millions of dollars - billions of dollars - of economic consequences, if we continue this engagement about closing the border without thinking about what that means.\" While the debate was about the shutters, we wanted to know if Newsome got his numbers correctly about his economic impact. We've begun to verify the truth. United States customs and border protection officers attend operational readiness training at the port of Sansidro when entering the United States-Mexico border in November 2018. We have looked for an average of 90,000 people who are legally passing north through the San Isidro crossing every day, 70,000 in cars and 20,000 in feet. Many businesses go to school or shops in the community of San Isidro, the southern part of San Diego, head north, and act as an economic engine for the region. Other border crossings in California include Otai Mesa, about 11 miles east, along with Ticati, an hour east, and two in Calexico, Imperial Province. With regard to the dollar loss resulting from the closure of 25 November, Newsome appears to have relied on the discretion of Jason Wells, Executive Director of the San Isidro Chamber of Commerce. In an interview with Polyte Fact California, Wales stated that the loss figure of $5.3 million was an estimate based on an average sale day for 650 businesses in the region during the holiday period from 20 to 6 January. The region is home to shopping centres, financial exchanges and numerous immigration and tax services, all at a short distance from the border. Wales says that it attracts between 97 and 99 per cent of its clients from Mexico. The threat of violence at the border led to the closure of the mall on that day by the owners of the American exits of Primum Las, a shopping centre near the port of entry. Wells says some businesses in the region believe the $5.3 million is conservative, given the closure of the Sunday after Black Friday. Approximately 75 per cent of businesses in the region had been closed within about 90 minutes of the closure of the border crossing at 11:30 a.m. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy, 20 January 2021 \"On that Sunday alone, because of Christmas season and holidays and so forth, we lost $5.3 million. Only that day, Wales added to the San Diego Union-Tribune bulletin, the conversation. \"Tijuana itself has lost another $6.9 million. So, just between Tijuana and San Ysidro [there] there was $12.2 million lost in one day. This is not even Chula Vista, National City, San Diego, Los Angeles, all those areas affected by the closure.\" Lin Razor, Chief Economist at the University of San Diego Pointe Loma of Nazarene, said that at least some of the economic losses had recovered. \"At this point, the influence on Sansidro was probably temporary in the first place during the relatively short stop,\" said Reiser in the e-mail. It appears that shoppers have returned to shops at Las America Cafe, which means that sales could have been delayed in the first place. Of course, if border closures begin to recur, the picture can become much more dangerous.\" Wells said \"our hope and our prayers\" that $5.3 million was collected by shoppers who returned to San Isidro. Newsome did not say anything about the possibility of recovering this loss, but she was generally at stake. We have also studied his claim that future closures can cause \"billions,\" a figure that is difficult to assess. \"Billions of casualties\"? The border closures and prolonged delays may amount to billions of dollars in economic losses over the coming months, and I told Paula Avila, Vice-President of the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, Bloomberg, in a recent article. She said: \"The uncertainty in the closure of the border occurs at any time and poses a major economic threat to our region.\" \"Our economies are inextricably linked. We produce together, we work together, we have families together, we have an integrated supply chain of $2.5 billion.\" Jerry Sanders, former Republican Mayor San Diego and current President of the City Regional Chamber of Commerce, echoed those sentiments in an article in The New York Times. \"If people stay home because they are concerned, it is clear that the economic impact is significant - we have 73 million crossings a year, and we know that the region's total regional output of $255 billion depends on cross-border trade,\" I told Sanders the paper. The Newsome spokesman said that the news reports supported this allegation. The elected Government of California, Gavin Newsome, claimed that there was an estimated economic loss of $5.3 million as a result of the temporary closure of the San Isidro border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana in November of 25 years. He added that \"billions of dollars\" might be at stake if they were closed in the future. The President of the San Isidro Chamber of Commerce supported the Newsome figure of $5.3 million, representing hundreds of businesses on the American side of the border. A prominent economist in the region said that it was likely that Sansidro would recover at least some of that loss when shoppers postponed their visits, as long as there was no additional closure of the border. News can also refer to warnings from business groups about \"billions of dollars\" that may be lost in future closures. The San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, including the former Republican City Mayor, said that future closures could threaten billions of dollars in economic activity flowing through the international portal. However, this part of Nisum &apos; s claim assumes the worst-case scenario of a prolonged closure for weeks or months. While President Trump threatened to close the border, there was no evidence that his administration was seeking to close it for a long time. We also found that his brothers were correct, but they might be able to benefit from some of the Scriptures. We've mostly evaluated it right. In fact, this statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information.
