Patterson wrote, according to the report: \"Hector's a friend and fellow actor. We were both in the recent movie \u2018The Alamo\u2019, filmed near Austin, albeit on different sides in the conflict (actually Hector had a real part, I was just an extra). When Hector surrendered at San Jacinto, I should have shot him when I had the chance... \"\n\n\"I hope folks understand then we were just acting, now it's a real war,\" the item quotes Patterson saying.\n\nContacted later, Patterson \u2014 who once helped pass Texas' concealed-weapon law \u2014 said he was joking about any shooting.\n\n\"If it's not tongue-in-cheek stuff, that's a criminal offense,\" Patterson said. \"You're not supposed to threaten people. Does this put me on the (federal) no-fly list?\"\n\nProbably not. Especially when it's all just in good fun \u2014 and he didn't really make a threat. He just expressed ex post facto regret.\n\nThis is why we love Texas politics. Where else would a (pretend) gunfight spill into a (real) race for land commissioner? And where else would we get to fact check a claim like this one?\n\nFor making us laugh and for reminding us not to take this stuff too seriously, we give Uribe's claim that he was threatened a rating of Pants on Fire. And we suggest that all guns remain holstered for the rest of the campaign.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15397"}
