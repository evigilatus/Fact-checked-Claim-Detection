Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 26, 2020 \nThe following day, Trump added in remarks to reporters, \"It would be very, very proper and very nice if a winner were declared on Nov. 3, instead of counting ballots for two weeks, which is totally inappropriate, and I don't believe that's by our laws.\"\u00a0\nHowever, the president was wrong. When the media \"calls\" a presidential race \u2014 which may or may not happen on Election Night \u2014 it is because they feel that projections from the current results are strong enough to announce one candidate over the other. It\u2019s not an official result.\u00a0\n\"There are no official results on Election Night \u2014 there never have been,\" said Edward B. Foley, an Ohio State University constitutional law professor who specializes in elections. \"Election Night tallies are always just preliminary, pending certification of the canvass of returns under state law, which takes time. Every state has a law on this point.\"\nEspecially in this year\u2019s election, when many voters are sending in their ballots or voting early in person rather than voting on Election Day due to the coronavirus pandemic, experts say it will take a decisive victory by one candidate or the other to be able to declare a winner on Election Night or early the following morning. (Trump\u2019s tweet was later flagged by Twitter as potentially harming the integrity of the election.).\nHere are some of the specific reasons why Trump is off-base.\nAbsentee ballots\nAccording to the National Conference on State Legislatures, 19 states have laws allowing ballots to be counted if they arrive after Election Day, but are postmarked on Election Day (or, in some states, the day before Election Day). This number could vary this year due to pending litigation.\nIn many cases, such postmark rules for absentee ballots have been around \"for years,\" said Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\nIn close races, even a modest number of late-arriving ballots could prove decisive.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverseas military ballots\nMany states allow service members stationed overseas a grace period for ballots they mail back to the mainland. For instance, states like Texas and West Virginia will require overseas military ballots to be received by Nov. 9, while others require a postmark, but not receipt, by Nov. 3, such as Georgia and Nevada.\nProvisional ballots\nProvisional ballots are those that are cast when a voter\u2019s eligibility is in question. If election officials resolve those questions, the ballot will be counted, but the checking and counting process takes time.\nThe rules for provisional ballots were streamlined by the Help America Vote Act, a federal law passed in 2002. \"Provisional ballots by their very nature cannot be counted on Election Day or Election Night and must be verified subsequently as part of the canvassing of returns,\" Foley said.\nState certification of results\nUnder federal law, states have until Dec. 8, or six days before the presidential electors vote, to finalize their ballot count.\nThis deadline acknowledges, as a matter of federal law, that states are not obligated to have a final official result on Election Night.\u00a0\nEven if a projected winner were to be announced by television networks and other media companies on Election Night, nothing would be official until the presidential electors cast their ballots on Dec. 14, and Congress officially counts the electoral votes on Jan. 6.\nAs a practical matter, Weil said, \"the vast majority of ballots will be counted within two or three days of Election Day, even in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin that cannot start counting absentee ballots until the day before Election Day or on Election Day itself.\"\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that \"counting ballots for two weeks ... is totally inappropriate, and I don't believe that's by our laws.\"\nHe\u2019s wrong. Post-election day time to count absentee ballots, overseas military ballots, and provisional ballots are enshrined in both federal and state law. In addition, federal law allows states until more than a month after the election to finalize their results for the casting of electoral votes.\nWe rate his statement Pants on Fire.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18794"}
