We found no evidence that Cruz was immersed in Islamic or left-wing hate.\nMost of Geller\u2019s story has nothing to do with political views held by Cruz. It largely repeats an initial story by Fox News the day of the shooting and showed some of Cruz\u2019s alleged Instagram posts, identified by other teenagers as his, which included images of guns and knives as well as an image of a bullseye target with bullet holes that included the phrase \"Group Therapy.\"\nGeller included an image from what was believed to be Cruz\u2019s Instagram account showing a Google search for the Arabic phrase \"Allahu Akbar.\" The phrase, which means \"God is greater,\" is used by Muslims on many occasions and in prayers but has also at times been uttered by people commiting attacks.\nCruz\u2019s Instagram account has since been shut down; however, multiple media reports stated that Cruz appeared to make fun of Islam when he wrote that \"at least we now know what it means when a sand durka says \u2018allahu Akbar.'\"\nWe sent Geller a summary of our findings and asked if she had evidence to support her claim.\n\"He mocked the phrase, but then he turned to violence himself. This indicates that underneath his mockery, he had an affinity with those who scream this phrase while murdering people,\" she told PunditFact in an email.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly one person died on that day\u201d during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 9, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeller said that Cruz\u2019s interest in the phrase \"Allahu Akbar\" \"doesn't mean he was an Islamic jihadi, but his mockery of it may have been an attempt to deflect attention from his aspirations, or maybe even to try to convince himself not to take the path he ultimately chose. Ultimately, we cannot know for sure what was in his mind, or what was left of it.\"\nLaw enforcement are investigating motives and his social media posts. The portrait that has emerged of Cruz so far is not of a person motivated by political views, but one of a young man who was drawn to firearms and had a troubled past.\nCruz had regularly gotten in trouble at school at least since middle school and had transferred out of Stoneman Douglas in 2017 and had since attended alternative schools. He had a history of mental illness, and police had been called to his home. Cruz\u2019s mother died in November; his father died when he was a young child.\nOcean Parodie, 17, told The Daily Beast that Cruz wore patriotic shirts that \"seemed really extreme, like hating on\" Islam and would also deride Muslims as \"terrorists and bombers.\"\nIn general teenagers who knew Cruz used words such as \"off,\" \"weird\" and \"crazy\" to describe him to journalists.\nSome initial news reports stated that Cruz was affiliated with a white nationalist group in Florida, but law enforcement said they didn\u2019t have information to support that connection. A white nationalist appeared to have spread misinformation to media outlets.\nWe emailed spokespersons for Instagram, the FBI and the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office to ask some questions about Cruz\u2019s Instagram account but not did get a reply.\nBroward County Sheriff Scott Israel did not offer any involvement in Islamic or hate groups to explain why Cruz walked into the school with an assault weapon in a Feb. 18 interview with Local 10 ABC\u2019s Michael Putney.\nWhen asked why Cruz shot up the school Israel said: \"Because he is an evil killer.\"\nThe Geller Report described Cruz as being \"immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate.\" Law enforcement are investigating motives, but so far Cruz appeared to be a person who had mental illness and a fascination with guns. A mocking Instagram post attributed to him showed he Googled the phrase \"Allahu Akbar\" but that doesn\u2019t prove that he was immersed in Islamic and left-wing hate. We found no evidence to support Geller\u2019s claim. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.\n'https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/702cc05e-445f-44d6-b184-727d24449701", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02389"}
