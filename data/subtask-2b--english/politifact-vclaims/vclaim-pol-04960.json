Alan Grayson says", "text": "U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson wants voters to think he\u2019s the only true Democrat in the race for Marco Rubio\u2019s soon-to-be-open Senate seat. After all, he reasoned, his primary opponent helped Republicans create the Benghazi committee.\n\"Two years ago last Sunday, the Benghazi committee came into being,\" the Orlando businessman and former lawyer said in a fundraising email on May 11, 2016. \"There are only three Democrats in the House today who voted for it. One of them is my primary opponent, Patrick Murphy.\"\nMurphy, a Jupiter Democrat, was a Republican before switching parties two years before being elected to Congress in 2012. His moderate views have been challenged by progressives and especially Grayson, who has endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders in the presidential race.\nCould it be true Murphy was among a handful of Democrats who voted to investigate leading Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton? In a word, yes, although Murphy said it was because he wanted to clear Clinton\u2019s name.\nBack to Benghazi\nOn Sept. 11, 2012, just before President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election, Islamic extremists attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission and a CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed.\nVarious conspiracy theories and cover-ups became partisan talking points as the White House was questioned about al-Qaida involvement and what officials did and did not know about the attack. Then-Secretary of State Clinton and the State Department faced scrutiny that has continued during her presidential campaign.\nBy May 2014, seven congressional probes and a State Department review board had examined the issue. A conservative watchdog group obtained State Department emails about the attack \u00a0that had been withheld from one of these House committees, sparking calls for a new investigation.\nThe Republican-led House voted to form the House Select Committee on Benghazi, comprised of seven Republicans and five Democrats, to again question the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the incident.\nThe May 8 vote largely went along party lines, 233 to 186. We say \"largely\" because seven Democrats crossed the aisle and voted to create the committee. Murphy was one of them. (He did not serve on the committee.)\nGrayson chose his words carefully when he cited \"three Democrats in the House today.\" Four of those seven Democrats who voted for the panel are no longer members of Congress. Only Murphy, Minnesota\u2019s Collin Peterson and Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema are still in office.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurphy released a statement following the vote, saying he hoped Congress would not use the panel to grandstand on the issue. We couldn\u2019t find the press release on Murphy\u2019s House website, but the Tampa Bay Times published the statement in part:\n\"While the congressman respects the work his colleagues have done already investigating this matter, when it comes to American lives lost overseas in service to our nation, we must make sure that all questions have been answered. He sincerely hopes that this committee is not used as a way to politicize this tragedy and the deaths of four Americans.\"\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Grayson has attacked Murphy over the vote. On Oct. 2, 2015, he called the committee \"a partisan clown show\" that had been \"done with Patrick Murphy's permission.\"\nBy Oct. 21, Murphy told MSNBC that officials were abusing the process and the panel\u2019s usefulness was over.\n\"Based on what we\u2019ve heard just in the last several weeks from Leader (Kevin) McCarthy, to the whistleblower to Congressman (Richard) Hanna coming out, admitting pretty clearly that this is a political witch hunt, I think it\u2019s past time that we disband this committee,\" Murphy said.\nMSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd asked Murphy if he regretted the vote, but Murphy stayed firm: \"I stand by it, because I think it\u2019s more than proven that there is nothing to hide there.\"\nWhen we contacted Murphy\u2019s campaign, his spokesman echoed a past statement that \"Republicans turned this tragedy into a political circus\" and reiterated Murphy wanted the committee shut down.\nThere\u2019s little evidence that Clinton or other liberals are holding Murphy\u2019s vote against him. Murphy is favored by Democratic officials in the U.S. Senate race, and Clinton reportedly told donors at a 2015 fundraiser that she is \"so proud of him.\"\nRepublicans on the committee have said they expected to release a final report in the summer before the 2016 election.\nOur ruling\nGrayson said Murphy is one of \"only three Democrats in the House today who voted\" to create the Benghazi committee.\nMurphy did vote with six other Democrats to create the committee in May 2014 (four of those seven are no longer in the House). Grayson is trying to paint Murphy as a conservative in liberal\u2019s clothing.\u00a0Murphy says his vote was to help clear Clinton\u2019s name.\nThat\u2019s a bit of context that Grayson should have included, so we rate his statement Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2af8b75d-3090-4047-aaef-82791287352a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04960"}
