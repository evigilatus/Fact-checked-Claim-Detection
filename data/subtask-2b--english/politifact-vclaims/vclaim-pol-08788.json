But we didn\u2019t have to dig too far. Morgan told us he was wrong.\n\"It was a huge mistake,\" said Morgan. \"I\u2019m sorry and embarrassed I messed up.\"\nMorgan said he was \"flat out wrong\" about marijuana not being addictive and meant to focus on the use of the drug compared to more potent painkillers.\n\"Some levels of addiction kill you -- marijuana may make you slow, but it will never kill you,\" said Morgan, a personal injury attorney who is leading the group People United for Medical Marijuana. The group has launched a petition drive to add an amendment to the state\u2019s Constitution to legalize medical marijuana in 2014.\nEven though Morgan said he made a mistake, we were curious enough to check a few more sources.\nAaron Norton, a psychotherapist who specializes in addictive disorders, said that \"cannabis dependence is a diagnosable disorder.\"\u00a0\n\"Not everyone who uses it becomes addicted,\" said Norton, but some are more vulnerable, including people with mental disorders, adolescents and young adults.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the course of my career, I have probably treated hundreds of patients who are cannabis-dependent, and many of them also met the two diagnostic criteria associated with physiological dependence -- tolerance and withdrawal,\" Norton said. \u00a0\u00a0\nMarijuana abuse is\u00a0recognized as cannabis-use disorder in the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The manual\u2019s list of symptoms include craving; taking larger doses over a longer period of time than intended; recurrent use that results in failure to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home; and tolerance (needing more to get the desired high).\nIt\u2019s also described as an addictive substance by the government-funded National Institute on Drug Abuse, which writes: \"Estimates from research suggest that about 9 percent of users become addicted to marijuana; this number increases among those who start young (to about 17 percent, or 1 in 6) and among daily users (to 25-50 percent).\"\nPsychiatrist Dr. Darren Rothschild, an addiction medicine specialist, says he\u2019s worked with patients who have developed a serious dependence on marijuana and \"the impact is substantial.\"\n\"In order to feel normal, they have to have the drug,\" Rothschild said. \"Not everyone who smokes becomes addicted, but it\u2019s erroneous to say it doesn\u2019t happen.\"\nRothschild said people who smoke marijuana daily over a long period of time are the ones most susceptible to dependence on marijuana versus intermittent smokers who may occasionally smoke pot at a party. \"I\u2019d say none of those people are addicted.\"\nDr. Samir Sabbag, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Treatment and Research,\u00a0said \"long-term use of marijuana is indeed addictive,\" though he noted people can be addicted to a variety of things, including the caffeine in chocolate and coffee.\u00a0\nEven groups that support relaxing marijuana laws, such as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), concede that Morgan was incorrect to say that marijuana is not potentially addictive.\n\"Can people have an abusive relationship with marijuana? Absolutely,\" said NORML executive director Allen St. Pierre. But St. Pierre says marijuana is \"not addictive in any way shape or form the same way that alcohol, nicotine and other legal and illegal drugs, even caffeine, can cause serious withdrawal.\"\nOur ruling\nOrlando attorney John Morgan said that \"nobody\u2019s addicted to\" marijuana. Morgan quickly admitted that he was wrong, and experts agreed.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08788"}
