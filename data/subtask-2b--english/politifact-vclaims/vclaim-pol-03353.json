Now he\u2019s the focus of a tangential controversy, complete with an investigation by the Pentagon\u2019s watchdog, over payments he received from foreign governments, including Russia.\nWe were interested in Trump\u2019s statement that the Obama administration approved Flynn for security clearance, especially given that he was forced out of his Obama-era role in 2014.\nWe found that Trump has it right.\nBut that doesn\u2019t affect the main allegation against Flynn: that he didn\u2019t properly disclose payments he received from Russia, as required by law and Pentagon policy. Nor does it excuse any oversights the Trump team made while considering Flynn for a White House role.\nFlynn\u2019s foreign affairs\nFlynn, a retired lieutenant general, spent his career as an intelligence officer in the Army,\u00a0serving in both Iraq and Afghanistan and as director of intelligence for U.S.\u00a0Central Command, among other posts.\u00a0Obama promoted him to director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in April 2012.\nFlynn retired from the agency in August 2014; news reports at the time said Flynn was forced out because he ruffled feathers with his management style. Since his departure, he has said he was fired for \"calling our enemies radical jihadis.\"\u00a0\nIn 2015, Flynn received more than $56,000 from three Russian entities \u2014 $33,750 from state-backed media outlet RT, $11,250 from an air cargo company, and $11,250 from a cybersecurity firm \u2014 according to documents released by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.\nIn 2016, during the election, Flynn\u2019s consulting firm earned more than $500,000 to work on projects that benefited the Turkish government. This became public knowledge in March 2017, when the firm filed papers to the Justice Department to retroactively register as a foreign agent.\nSeveral months after Flynn left the DIA in 2014, he received a letter from the agency providing guidance on what he can and can\u2019t do as an Army retiree. The letter, which Flynn himself requested, says \"foreign compensation requires advance approval,\" per the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause.\nDespite the letter, Flynn did not disclose to the government the payments he received from the Russian entities, according to Cummings and his Republican counterpart on the oversight committee, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn April 7 letter from the DIA to Cummings and Chaffetz said the agency \"did not locate any records referring or relating to LTG Flynn\u2019s receipt of money from a foreign source\" nor \"any records of LTG Flynn seeking permission or approval for the receipt of money from a foreign source.\"\nFlynn\u2019s lawyer responded, saying Flynn briefed the Defense Department on his RT speaking event. But the lawyer did not specifically say whether Flynn disclosed the payments.\nHere\u2019s how Trump\u2019s claim about Flynn\u2019s security clearances fits in.\nRetired military officials can keep their security clearances, with periodic background checks. Flynn\u2019s last two background checks to retain his security clearance took place during the Obama administration, in June 2010 and January 2016, according to the April 7 DIA letter.\nCummings and Chaffetz said Flynn didn\u2019t report his 2015 earnings from Russian entities on his 2016 application. (The DIA provided Cummings and Chaffetz with portions of Flynn\u2019s completed form, but the pages haven\u2019t been made public.)\nThe security clearance application asks extensively about applicants\u2019 foreign contacts, activities, business and travel. The penalty for knowingly falsifying or concealing information on the form is a fine or up to five years in prison.\nThe evaluating agency may also deny the person a security clearance. Even if an applicant is candid about their foreign dealings, the evaluating agency could deny security clearance if it seems like those activities could compromise the applicant\u2019s judgment or loyalty to the United States, said Andrew Kent, a national security expert and law professor at Fordham University.\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer has used the fact that Flynn got through security clearance under the Obama administration to deflect blame for not properly vetting Flynn before Trump named him national security adviser.\nDemocrats, like Cummings and Obama-era National Security Adviser Susan Rice, have said Spicer\u2019s critique is unfair. They said Flynn\u2019s security clearance re-evaluation was a routine process that took place several rungs below the White House, and besides, Trump is obligated to vet his advisers himself.\nKent said that if those evaluating Flynn\u2019s 2016 application had some knowledge of his Russian activities, they might deserve some blame for not pressing Flynn for more details. Because Flynn\u2019s relationship with RT was public knowledge months before Trump was putting his White House team together, the transition team was \"in a different position than the security clearance investigators.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration.\"\nThe last two times Flynn applied for a security clearance, in 2010 and 2016, Obama was president.\nLawmakers allege Flynn omitted important information about payments received from Russia on his 2016 application to renew his clearance. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Trump\u2019s statement is literally accurate.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim True.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-02 21:22:01 UTC   Politifact    1 1 7  Politifact Rating: True  \"General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration.\"    Donald Trump President   a CBS interview Sunday, April 30, 2017 2017-04-30    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03353"}
