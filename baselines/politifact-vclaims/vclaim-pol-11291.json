The pipeline may still win approval, however, and some lawmakers are trying to push it forward.\n\nOne of them is U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. In a Feb. 23 speech at Dalton State College, Isakson said the pipeline could employ enough people to populate Decatur.\n\n\"From Day One, this project [the Keystone pipeline] would employ 20,000 people in the United States,\" Isakson said. \u00a0\n\nThis jobs figure is a well-worn talking point for pipeline supporters. Georgia U.S. Reps. Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey used it. U.S. House Speaker John Boehner and House Republican Leader Eric Cantor said it as well.\n\nWe decided to take a closer look.\n\nWe reviewed news accounts, read analyses of the company\u2019s job creation figures, interviewed a spokesman for TransCanada, the firm hoping to build the pipeline, and consulted critics.\n\nWe found that while the TransCanada estimate does say that 20,000 \"Americans\" will be directly employed by the project, that\u2019s not what the company\u2019s chief executive has said.\n\nFurthermore, TransCanada\u2019s numbers clash with lower estimates from critics and the U.S. Department of State.\n\nTransCanada has said in a press release that those 20,000 jobs include 13,000 for constructing the pipeline and 7,000 to manufacture steel pipes and other equipment. It predicts it will take two years to complete.\n\nBut TransCanada\u2019s estimate does not mean they expect 20,000 people to work on the project, a spokesman told us.\n\nThe spokesman provided little clarification. Fortunately, a Washington Post interview with TransCanada\u2019s chief executive and an email interview with the economist who helped produce the company\u2019s job creation estimates shed some light on the figure.\n\nEach \"job\" represents one \"job year\" or one job lasting for one year, they said. \u00a0\n\nThis means that if a single person works on the project for both years, his or her stint is counted as two \"jobs.\"\n\nThis could place the number of actual people employed by the pipeline closer to 10,000, or some 6,500 workers in construction and 3,500 in manufacturing. Not 20,000.\n\nThese construction jobs are not permanent, and for the most part, they aren\u2019t local. The positions will disappear when the pipeline is complete. The U.S. Department of State, which is in charge of evaluating the project, estimates that only 10 to 15 percent of these jobs can be filled with workers from communities in the pipeline\u2019s path.\n\nNews accounts and independent analyses have explored other shortcomings of TransCanada\u2019s figures. A study released September 2011 by Cornell University\u2019s Global Labor Institute determined that the 20,000 jobs figure is \"not substantiated.\" \u00a0\n\nAbout 50 percent of the pipe will come from an Arkansas plant owned by Welspun, a company based in India, according to a press release issued by TransCanada. The rest will come from Canada, Italy and India.\n\nIn 2009, company officials said that for an earlier phase of the pipeline, it imported bare pipe manufactured overseas. It\u2019s not clear how much finish work the pipe will need once it arrives in the U.S.\n\nWe asked TransCanada whether its manufacturing jobs estimates might include foreign workers, but a spokesman did not provide a response.\n\nOther analyses have called into question TransCanada\u2019s jobs figure. A December 2011 report by Bloomberg said the company's estimate that the project would need six or seven construction workers for every mile of the pipeline is higher than the four to five worker average for earlier phases.\n\nAn August 2011 estimate published by the State Department said that the project will employ \"approximately 5,000 to 6,000 workers\" in construction jobs.\n\nAn independent analysis of TransCanada\u2019s jobs estimates also produced lower numbers.\n\nUsing Cornell\u2019s research, William Wade, president of a consulting economics firm, found that the pipeline would create an average of about 16,100 jobs for each of the two years of construction, or 32,200 \"job years.\"\n\nWade\u2019s figure includes more than the jobs for those who build the pipeline. People such as factory workers and checkout clerks also get jobs when project funds are spent on construction materials and wages.\n\nIf Keystone were to create 20,000 job years worth of work in construction alone, then those jobs combined with spinoffs should be much higher than 32,200 job years, Wade said.\n\n\"The 20,000 jobs number seems like a mistake. It seems like an overestimate,\" Wade said.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nIsakson said that Keystone \"would employ 20,000 people in the United States.\" While any construction project creates jobs, the number Isakson uses seems misleadingly high.\n\nThose 20,000 don\u2019t represent actual people, but one job lasting for one year of a two-year project. The number of construction and manufacturing workers may be closer to 10,000, if you accept TransCanada\u2019s estimate.\n\nAnd there\u2019s strong evidence from credible sources that it may be lower. Finally, it\u2019s an open question how many of the jobs would be in America.\n\nWe give Isakson a False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Bill Gates said \u201cat least 3 billion people need to die\u201d from the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 27, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11291"}
