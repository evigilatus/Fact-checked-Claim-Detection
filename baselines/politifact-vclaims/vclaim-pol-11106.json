Rick Scott considers himself Florida\u2019s promoter-in-chief.\n\nSo it makes sense that he would use a TV interview on the opening day of the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach to show off just how important golf is to Florida.\n\n\"Golf is big for the state,\" Scott told Action News Jacksonville on May 10, 2012. \"1,200 golf courses. I think it\u2019s 58 million rounds of golf played a year in Florida. \u2026 We\u2019ve got 44 percent of all the travel golf in the country here. 5 million people come to Florida just for golf. It\u2019s big business. It creates a lot of jobs.\"\n\nLook, we\u2019re not all politics all the time. We like to unwind and embrace our Florida side, too. We decided some golf-related research was in order.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt the sport is huge for Florida. Experts we consulted agree it\u2019s the No. 1 destination for golf in the world.\n\nScott received this information from a 2004 National Golf Foundation report, spokesman Lane Wright said. We tried to get a copy but couldn\u2019t locate one.\n\nScott is mostly on the mark with his statements, but we found some rough patches that we\u2019ll explain one by one.\n\n1,200 golf courses: Scott is close. Play Florida, the state\u2019s golf marketing program, puts the number of facilities a little lower, at 1,056.\n\nDid you catch how we used \"facilities\" instead of \"courses\"? That\u2019s because one facility may have multiple courses. Take the Innisbrook Golf Resort in Palm Harbor, which has four courses but counts as one facility.\n\nFor that reason, the real number of courses is probably higher than 1,200, but \"that\u2019s the number we use,\" said Gary Jones, who manages Play Florida.\n\n58 million rounds played a year: The number of rounds played each year is the barometer of the popularity of golf, said Tom Stine, co-founder of Golf Datatech, which conducts market research for the industry.\n\nIt seems the governor caught wind of some expired talking points. The number of rounds was 59 million in 2000, according to a University of Florida study.\n\nIn 2011, the number of rounds was 41 million, Stine said. That\u2019s a slight uptick from 2010, but it still trails the annual number of rounds before the recession set in, which is probably where Scott is drawing his number, he said.\n\nRound counts are up for 2012 in Florida and the country, he said. The reason is lots of sunny weather nationwide -- good news for golf lovers but bad for people who prefer skis.\n\nFlorida gets 44 percent of all travel golf in the country: This is the hardest one to track down. Stine said he doesn\u2019t know what Scott means here, and that he\u2019s skeptical all the golf in California, the Carolinas, Georgia, Arizona, Texas, and Michigan (in the summer) comprises just 56 percent of \"travel golf.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s one of those numbers if you don\u2019t attach the methodology for it, how in the heck do you know what that means?\" Stine said.\n\nJones also couldn\u2019t be sure.\n\n\"I can tell you that it\u2019s over 40 percent,\" he said, citing a university study he could not find by our deadline.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHank Aaron\u2019s death was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we get more information on this point, we'll update our report.\u00a0\n\n5 million people come here just for golf: Scott is close here but misses a distinction between the two types of out-of-state golfers, Jones said.\n\nOn one hand, there are visitors who come to Florida just to play golf. There are about 1.5 million of these people, Jones said. They play an average of 5.2 rounds.\n\nThen there are \"amenity golfers\" who come to Florida for reasons other than playing golf but fit it in anyway. Think of fathers making a break for it on an Orlando family vacation. Jones estimates there are 3.6 million of these golfers, which play an average of 1.2 rounds.\n\nCombining these out-of-state golfers (1.5 million + 3.6 million) amounts to 5.1 million people. A chunk of these people, though, came to Florida for other reasons, which isn\u2019t exactly what Scott said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGolf is a big deal for the Sunshine State -- and now we know that more rays equal more rounds. Still, Scott needs to finesse his points before getting our hole-in-one rating. We rate his golf rundown Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11106"}
