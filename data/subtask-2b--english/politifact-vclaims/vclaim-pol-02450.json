Delivered from the heart!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 1, 2018\n\n\nTrump exaggerated crowd sizes before, so we wondered whether ratings backed up his latest boast. His claim about Fox News holds up, but not so much for total State of the Union viewership.\nState of the Union ratings\nThe Nielsen Company, the primary collector of television ratings data, indeed reported that 45.6 million Americans above the age of 2 tuned into the president\u2019s address across 12 networks between 9 and 10:30 p.m.\nThat wasn\u2019t a record, though. Trump came in sixth in total State of the Union viewers since Nielsen began collecting the data in 1993. George W. Bush garnered 62 million viewers in 2003; Bill Clinton 53 million in 1998; W. Bush 51.8 million in 2002; Obama 48 million in 2010; and Clinton 45.8 million in 1994.\nThe ranking is even lower when we also count first addresses to the Joint Sessions of Congress. That\u2019s the first-term equivalent of the State of the Union, but the president is assumed to be too new to describe how the nation is faring.\nIncluding those addresses, Trump\u2019s State of the Union ranks ninth, outdone by his own first address to the Joint Sessions of Congress, which had 47.7 million viewers. Clinton ranks first with 66.9 viewers in 1993, and Obama\u2019s 2009 address had 53.2 million viewers.\nWhen we asked about the \"highest number in history,\" the White House said Trump had been talking about cable news history. That works only if we exclude Trump\u2019s Joint Address to Congress in 2017 and only include the three major cable networks (CNN, Fox News Network and MSNBC) dating back to 2001, when all three aired the address. Nielsen does not track State of the Union viewership from cable and broadcast networks separately, so we tallied up ratings for the major networks across the years.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat wasn\u2019t clear in the tweet, however, as the 45.6 million people encompassed watchers of both cable and broadcast networks.\nFox News\nFox News had an average of 11.5 million viewers between 9 and 10:30 p.m., according to Nielsen. Using the same data set, Fox reported 11.7 million viewers between 9:15 to 10:30 p.m. (The speech ran from 9:09 to 10:30 p.m.)\nThat was a record high for Fox News during a\u00a0State of the Union speech. It came in second for a presidential address to Congress only to Trump\u2019s Address to the Joint Sessions of Congress last year.\nFox indeed beat out the other major networks, as Trump claimed. CNN raked in 3.1 million viewers and MSNBC had 2.7 million viewers during the State of the Union. ABC delivered 5.4 million viewers, NBC 7.1 million, CBS 7 million and FOX 3.6 million, according to Nielsen.\nIf, as the White House explained, Trump was talking only about cable news networks, that wasn\u2019t the first time Fox News beat out the other cable networks during a State of the Union address. While the time stamps vary slightly for each network, Fox beat out CNN and MSNBC every year according to Nielsen, save for 2016.\nOur ruling\nTrump said \"45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in.\"\n45.6 million people watched Trump\u2019s State of the Union, but that wasn\u2019t the highest number in history. Five other State of the Union speeches raked in more viewers, and eight other presidential addresses to joint sessions of Congress did, too.\nIf we only look at cable news airings of the State of the Union among the major networks, this year indeed raked in the highest numbers. That wasn\u2019t clear in the tweet.\nFox News delivered 11.7 million viewers for the duration of the president\u2019s speech, give or take a few minutes. It beat every other network airing the speech. That wasn\u2019t a first, though, as the network\u2019s ratings have consistently beaten other cable providers\u2019 during the event.\nGiven the misleading nature of the first statement, and the accuracy of the second, we rate Trump\u2019s statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-02-01 22:38:56 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in.\"    Donald Trump President of the United States https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/959034299222843394   In a tweet Thursday, February 1, 2018 2018-02-01    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02450"}
