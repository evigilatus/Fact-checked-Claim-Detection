Who changed the old whistleblowers' rules before filing the fake whistleblower report? The Trump regurgitated September 30th. \"Bleed the swamp!\" Who changed the long primitive rules before the idiot report? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 30 September 2019 was only away from one saying that the rules had changed \"before\" the report that triggered the isolation investigation was presented on August 12th. The Republican Commander of the House (Kevin McCarthy) tweeted the same thing on September 28. McCarthy wrote: \"The whistleblowers are required to provide first-hand information on the allegations.\" \"But just days before the appearance of whistleblowers in Ukraine, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Society removed this requirement from the complaint form.\" Trump Rudy Giuliani's lawyer repeated the same point on September 29. All three tweetes lead to the same article on the federal conservative website. The three are wrong. There has never been a need for first-hand information from whistleblowers since the enactment of the law protecting whistleblowers in the intelligence community. \u2022 Inspector General &apos; s staff, who are investigating a charge, need first-hand information to advance the complaint - as they have done in this case. \u2022 The present complaint is based on preliminary and indirect information. The federal article 27 September, \"between May 2018 and August 2019, the intelligence community secretly abolished a requirement that whistleblowers provide first-hand information about alleged irregularities.\" The evidence comes from a tweet that Stephen McIntyre started in the morning. McIntyre is a former director of the mining company that established the Climate Review Code, which calls into question official data underlying climate change. From this thread, some key points are highlighted: as of 24 May 2018, the Inspector General presented the model of disclosure of urgent concerns in the intelligence community - a model filled by whistleblowers - three options to describe how whistleblowers obtained their information: personal knowledge, hearing from other people, and other sources. The current format offers only two options: personal knowledge or \"heard of by others.\" This model dates back to August 2019. The previous form also contained a section under the subheading \"First information required.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 \"In order to find an urgent concern \"believe,\" the Inspector General of the Intelligence Group must have reliable first-hand information. The Panel is unable to transmit information through the Intelligence Group's whistleblower protection law, based on the knowledge of the indirect employee of the error. This information includes information received from another person, for example when a fellow employee informs you that he or she has experienced some kind of error. (Any person having first-hand knowledge of the allegations may submit a direct written disclosure to the Intergovernmental Group on Disclosure.) Similarly, the prediction of the existence of a wrongful act does not provide a sufficient basis for fulfilling the legal requirements of the Council. If you believe that the error has occurred, but it cannot provide more than indirect or unsubstantiated assurances, ICIG will not be able to process the complaint or information for submission as ICWPA.\" The current reporting format lacks this section. On the basis of these facts, Tramp and other Republicans asserted that the rules concerning the amounts had changed \"just prior to\" the submission of the present complaint. In fact, only the forms have changed. The rules remained the same. The actual sequence of whistleblowers who opened the isolation investigation filled out the previous version of the form, and no rules were changed. The Inspector General's Office issued a statement on 30 September in which it stated that \"the disclosure of the urgent interest given by the complainant on 12 August 2019 is the same as that established by the Intergovernmental Group since 24 May 2018.\" The IGO confirmed that the whistleblowers received the section on the need for direct evidence before the claim moved on to the next step. There were therefore changes in the form after the two whistleblowers were filed. With regard to the rules on what is required, these rules have been the same since 2014 under an order issued by the Director of National Intelligence. 120 Intelligence Community Directive defines protected disclosure as one that \"an employee reasonably believes evidence of a violation of any law, rule or regulation.\" The statement of the Inspector General &apos; s Office emphasized the standard of reasonable belief. \"In accordance with the law, the complainant - or any member of the intelligence community who wishes to report information concerning urgent interest in the intelligence committees of Congress - does not need first-hand information to file a complaint,\" said the statement. \"The Immigration and Naturalization Authority cannot add conditions to an urgent concern that does not exist in the law.\" The section on the need for first-hand information concerns the investigation that follows the whistleblower report, not a requirement for the report itself. \"This is their way of easing whistleblower expectations,\" said analyst Ervin McColo, with the non-profit government accountability project. \u2219 (Mack Coloff's father worked as Inspector General until 2017 and now represents the whistleblower). \"He says we may not find enough to support your complaint.\" The latest IG statement states that it changed its forms after the present case, because it understood some parts \"that can be read - wrong - as suggesting that whistleblowers must have first-hand information in order to file a complaint on an urgent matter.\" The statement indicated that the whistleblowers examined both boxes to indicate that they had both preliminary and indirect information. The Committee also notes that its investigation found the report credible and urgent. The White House didn't have a comment. Our judgment (Trap) said \"long-term rules for whistleblowers (changed) just before the false report was submitted to the whistleblowers.\" The current rules have been in place since 2014. The whistleblowers may provide preliminary or indirect information, or both. The current reporter filled out a form dating back to May 2018. Whatever changes have occurred in that form, its date begins 14 months before the submission of this claim. Investigators need more than information used to move the complaint forward, but this is not a condition before the complaint is filed. However, the IGO changed its forms after the whistleblowers were submitted, but these changes do not affect the rules under which the claim is processed.
