Good night,\" she texts back.\nSuddenly, an ominous shadow is outside a window and a figure busts into the front door. Cut to a scene with police tape outside the home, suggesting tragedy.\n\"It happens like that,\" a narrator says. \"The police can\u2019t get there in time. How you defend yourself is up to you. It\u2019s your choice. But Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights.\"\nReplace Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., with Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., and you get the ad running in Colorado.\nHow do we get from a vote in Congress to an intruder barreling through a poor woman\u2019s front door? It\u2019s far from a straight line.\nThe NRA\u2019s first justification\nWhen the Washington Post Fact Checker looked at this question, NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam pegged Landrieu\u2019s vote \"to take away your gun rights\" to her support of the Toomey-Manchin proposal (named after its sponsors, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.).\nThat proposal, which failed 54 to 46 in April 2013, did not ban the sale of any firearms. Its most significant provision would have expanded federal background checks already in place to firearm purchases made at gun shows and over the Internet. You could still buy a weapon from a family member or friend without a background check.\nThe Fact Checker concluded that it\u2019s hard to envision a situation in which Toomey-Manchin would have prevented a woman from being able to defend herself against an intruder. Assuming the woman in the ad was legally eligible to purchase a firearm (meaning she doesn\u2019t have a criminal record), she would not have any trouble owning a gun in her home \u2014 even if Toomey-Manchin passed.\nThe Fact Checker gave the claim Four Pinocchios, its harshest rating.\nThe NRA\u2019s second justification\nBy the time PolitiFact inquired, the NRA offered different evidence as support for its claim. The group told PolitiFact that its claim stems from Landrieu\u2019s vote to confirm Justice Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court in 2009, a pick the NRA opposed.\n\"Landrieu voted to confirm at least one anti-gun and anti-self defense (Supreme Court) justice,\" said NRA spokesman Arulanandam. \"Anti-self defense is life or death.\"\nDuring Sotomayor\u2019s nomination proceedings, her past ruling on a Second Amendment issue became a talking point for Republicans who were critical of President Barack Obama\u2019s choice.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second District, Sotomayor was part of a three-member panel that reviewed a lower court ruling in Maloney vs. Cuomo. At issue was whether New York could ban the chuka stick (commonly called nunchucks, a weapon with two sticks connected by a chain or rope).\nSotomayor was part of a majority opinion that ruled the New York statute legal. The Second Amendment applies to federal laws but not state laws, they wrote, citing an 1886 Supreme Court decision.\nDuring her confirmation testimony, Sotomayor reasoned that the Supreme Court had not yet ruled on whether its decision in Heller vs. District of Columbia \u2014 which overturned the federal capital\u2019s handgun ban \u2014 applied to all cities and states. So, Sotomayor said, she was applying the precedent as it was understood at that point.\nSeveral Republican senators cited this case as reason to vote against Sotomayor\u2019s nomination.\n(Worth noting, Landrieu actually supported the court\u2019s decision in Heller to overturn the D.C. handgun ban and signed onto a letter from Sen. Kay Hutchison, R-Texas, to codify the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling.)\nThe Supreme Court eventually ruled, by a 5-4 margin in 2010, to strike down Chicago\u2019s ban against owning a handgun in the home. This effectively applied the Heller ruling to all local governments. Sotomayor, by then on the Supreme Court, signed on to a minority opinion that argued the Second Amendment did not prohibit local governments from regulating firearms or banning certain weapons in the home.\nNo other major gun issues have come before the Supreme Court during Sotomayor\u2019s time. In fact, it has turned down requests to review the right to have a handgun outside the home, said Amy Howe, editor of the popular Supreme Court analysis website SCOTUSblog.\nProblems with the second justification\nSo how convincing is the Sotomayor argument? It has some considerable holes.\nFor starters, it\u2019s a slippery slope to claim that a vote for a Supreme Court justice is a vote \"to take away your gun rights.\"\nTo use the same logic, was a vote to confirm President George W. Bush\u2019s nomination of John Roberts also a vote for the Affordable Care Act just because he ruled to uphold the individual mandate? Was a vote for Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2014 the justice appointed by President Ronald Reagan who became the swing vote in the case that effectively ended California\u2019s same-sex marriage ban \u2014 a vote to legalize same-sex marriage?\nIn other words, no one can tell in advance how justices will eventually vote on issues that come before the court. Justices appointed by Republicans can surprise and take what would be considered the liberal position in a case, and vice versa.\nWe will also note that Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., joined seven of their Republicans to confirm Sotomayor\u2019s nomination. Yet the NRA gave them each an A- rating for their votes on gun issues and endorsed them for reelection this year. So this is either selective memory or the NRA applying its own logic differently to candidates.\nAs for Landrieu, her campaign said she has supported pro-gun measures over the years, including a proposal that requires states to recognize concealed carry permits issued by other states. She also voted against an assault weapons ban supported by the White House in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The NRA also opposed the measure.\nOur ruling\nThe NRA ad claims, \"Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights.\" This is quite a leap in logic.\nAfter initially staking its claim to a background check bill that didn\u2019t pass Congress \u2014 nor did it \"take away your gun rights,\" leaving women defenseless in their homes \u2014 the group now pins its claim on Landrieu\u2019s vote to confirm Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. But that\u2019s questionable, since there is no way to know in advance how a justice will vote. And the NRA has endorsed two other senators, Graham and Alexander, who cast exactly the same vote. Meanwhile, on the other major gun vote of this term, a key assault-weapons ban, Landrieu voted the NRA\u2019s position.\nGiven all this, to run an ad as scary as this one can only be described as fear mongering.
