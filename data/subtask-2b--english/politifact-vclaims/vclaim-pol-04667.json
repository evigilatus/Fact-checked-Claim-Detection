Read our comparison of the two speeches here.\n\"There\u2019s a political tint to this whole issue,\" Manafort said in a televised statement July 19. \"The Clinton camp was the first to get it out there and try to say there was something untoward about the speech that Melania Trump gave. It\u2019s just another example, as far as we\u2019re concerned, that when Hillary Clinton is threatened by a female, the first thing she does is try to destroy the person.\"\nGiven the extensive media coverage of this story, we were curious about Manafort\u2019s claim that the Clinton campaign planted it.\nAs it turns out, the Clinton campaign was not the first to note similarities between the Trump and Obama speeches. It was Jarrett Hill, a Los Angeles-based Twitter user who describes himself as an interior designer and a journalist.\n\"Melania must\u2019ve liked Michelle Obama\u2019s 2008 Convention speech, since she plagiarized it,\" Hill tweeted at 10:40 p.m. Monday night.\n\n\nHill told PolitiFact that he was watching Trump\u2019s speech, and a couple of the lines made him think, \"Whoa, that\u2019s weird. I heard that before.\" He then tweeted at some NBC journalists to draw their attention to the similarities to Obama\u2019s speech, and the story blew up.\nHill said he has \"literally no ties to the Clinton campaign,\" though he is a registered Democrat. He has not heard from anyone involved with the Clinton campaign before or since he uncovered the potential plagiarism.\nClinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri denied that it is the story\u2019s source in a tweet.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIn fact, the Clinton campaign has not issued any statement or public response to the story, other than the tweet from Palmieri's personal account. One arm, Correct the Record, retweeted one of Hill\u2019s tweets. A few individual campaign staffers have tweeted about it, too.\nBut this was all after Hill made the original connection.\nCNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo asked Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz if the Democratic Party or Clinton campaign planted the attack on Melania Trump.\nWasserman Schultz did not reply with a flat \"no,\" but she said, \"the Trump Organization, whether it's Paul Manafort or anyone, all the way up to Donald Trump himself, anytime they are caught red-handed engaging in distortions, inaccuracies, a fact pattern that is clearly not accurate, they blame someone else. And so they should be prepared to be held accountable for the content of anything delivered from the stage of the Republican National Convention.\"\nWe tried to reach Donald Trump\u2019s campaign multiple times but did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nManafort said, \"The Clinton camp was the first to get it out there and try to say there was something untoward about the speech that Melania Trump gave.\"\nThe Clinton campaign has barely reacted to the claims that Melania Trump took some phrases from a 2008 Michelle Obama speech. A Twitter user in Los Angeles, who has no Clinton campaign ties, was the first to draw attention to the similarities between the two speeches.\nWe rate Manafort's claim False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/140ee0c6-d406-4bdc-97c2-acd998adf3c2", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04667"}
