The article - which presents an aerial image of Alfred P. Murah's destroyed federal building and Clinton's image of him - says: \"Reminder: The building in Oklahoma City was blown up and destroyed just four days before Hillary Clinton was charged in the Whitewater scandal. All documents have been lost!\" As part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast, reference has been made to the Mim. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let us summarize: there is no evidence in support of the suggestion that Clinton, then First Lady, would have been charged in the Whitewater case or had anything to do with the bombing by Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people on 19 April 1995. Government officials denied that any documents relating to the case were in the Murah building, according to an article published in Washington Post in 1995 on conspiracy theories surrounding the incident. Furthermore, according to a post-bomb report, the list of government departments with regional offices in a comfortable building does not include the Ministry of Justice. The first version of the conspiracy theory, which came shortly after the bombing, involved President Bill Clinton, saying that he arranged the bombing to protect himself from the fermentation scandal. The 21st century version is re-blaming Hillary. In July 1995, the Washington Post article detailed several competing conspiracy theories that arose after the bombing, and at some point, one of the theories blames President Clinton's attempts to evade the scandal: Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen mentioned on January 22, 2021 in an article on Facebook that says that the Biden administration described liberal terrorists as terrorists. \"The common theme is that Bill Clinton, or the rogue factions within the government, ordered the bombing to divert attention from embarrassing issues such as Messer Whitewater and the siege branch Davidie in Wako, Tex.\" Remember the article. \"Theorists expected that the documents relating to Whitewater O'Wako were kept in the Oklahoma City Federal Building and destroyed in the explosion; the Government denied this. Others believe that Clinton arranged death and destruction so that he could appear as a strong leader in the chaos that followed. It is true that Clinton was investigated in the 1990s as part of the Whitewater scandal, a failed real estate investment project in which they participated with Jim McDougall, a real estate businessman. The project was flooded for several reasons, and while Clinton invested in a bad land deal, none of the investigations found that they did anything illegal. On the other hand, McDougall was convicted of crimes discovered during the investigation. However, there is no indication in the investigation files that the indictments against Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton were pending but became impossible when the incriminating documents were destroyed in the Oklahoma bombing. Also, interviews were conducted with the Clinton family to investigate three days after the bombing. If any part of the allegation were true, it would not only have been documented in the case files, but would have been widely reported as a development in scandals and explosions, and had been closely monitored by the national press. Our judgment of Emmy on social media indicates that Hillary Clinton had something to do with the Oklahoma bombing in 1995 because he was supposed to be \"charged\" in a scandal four days after the bombing, but the explosion destroyed the documents relating to the case. We can argue whether Clinton is involved in any unlawful act involving Whitewater, but the Mimi's proposal to indict Hillary after days of bombing, and the fact that the investigation documents on the scandal were destroyed in a suspicious manner in this case, is false and lacks any supporting evidence.
