Did he get away with murder? Some people think so. Why did he leave Congress so quietly and quickly? Isn\u2019t it obvious? What\u2019s happening now? A total nut job!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2020 \n\"So many unanswered and obvious questions, but I won\u2019t bring them up now!\" he tweeted May 26. \"Law enforcement eventually will?\"\nWe reached out to the White House to learn more about the unanswered questions and did not hear back.\nTo the best of anyone\u2019s knowledge, there are no questions that have any grounding in\u00a0fact.\nA 2001 death\nIn the summer of 2001, Lori Klausutis, a\u00a0 constituent services coordinator was found dead in Scarborough\u2019s congressional district office in Fort Walton Beach, Fla. PolitiFact founder and former Washington bureau chief of the St. Petersburg Times Bill Adair investigated at the time.\n\"Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Berkland has said Klausutis, 28, of Niceville, lost consciousness because of an abnormal heart rhythm and fell, hitting her head on a desk,\" Adair wrote. \"The head injury caused the death, Berkland said.\"\nRecently, Adair wrote on Twitter about the reporting experience. \"I filed public records requests and did a fair number of interviews. I talked with people who knew the aide, Lori Klausutis, and questioned the police chief and the medical examiner,\" he wrote.\nAdair said there is no evidence to support the idea that Klausutis died of anything but natural causes. She had told others on the day of her death that she was feeling unwell.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of her death, Scarborough was hundreds of miles away in Washington, D.C.\nWhen Trump raised the \"unsolved mystery\" in 2017, we rated that Pants on Fire.
