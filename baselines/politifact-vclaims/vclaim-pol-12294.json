Gov. David Dewhurst.\n\nIn a \"memo\" directed at Dewhurst the next day, Cruz\u2019s campaign consultant, Jason Johnson, said: \"Yesterday, your campaign distributed two emails -- signed expressly by \u2018Dewhurst for Texas\u2019 -- that accused Ted Cruz of being a \u2018Red\u2019 Chinese\" Communist. Cruz\u2019s campaign copied the note to \"interested parties,\" meaning reporters and anyone else tuned to the pair\u2019s rivalry\n\nFeel those not-so-good \u201850s coming back?\n\nCruz\u2019s camp sent us the two emails from Dewhurst\u2019s camp. One was headlined \"Red Ted Cruz shows his true colors, consistently stands with China against American interests\" and signed by Steven Cheung of Dewhurst\u2019s campaign. The email points out that Cruz opposes legislation offered in Congress to penalize China for propping up its currency. The email closes: \"At a time when millions of Americans are without jobs, why does Ted Cruz consistently put the needs of China before America?\"\n\nThe other email, signed by Justin Hollis of Dewhurst\u2019s campaign, has the subject line: \"What Does Ted Cruz Have Against America?\" Its text refers to Cruz\u2019s opposition to the Chinese currency measure and also quotes from a Laura Ingraham interview of Cruz and a blog post by Texas Monthly\u2019s Paul Burka about Cruz, a lawyer, acting as counsel to a Chinese company accused of patent infringement by an American. The email identically closes: \"At a time when millions of Americans are without jobs, why does Ted Cruz consistently put the needs of China before America?\"\n\nDewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch told us that Cruz\u2019s charge is false grandstanding compared with the issues raised by the Dewhurst blasts.\n\nThe legislation opposed by Cruz would compel the Obama administration to levy tariffs and other penalties against China and other countries for having \"misaligned\" currencies, according to an Oct. 7, 2011, news post by the Wall Street Journal, amid concern that China holds down the value of its currency, the yuan, in an effort to boost the country's exports. Opponents have warned that approval of the proposal could lead China to launch a trade war.\n\nAnd what of the patent infringement case? Burka, in an Oct. 3, 2011, blog post, recaps a Sept. 28, 2011, post on the San Antonio-based Plaza de Armas blog stating that in his work for a Houston firm, Cruz appealed a ruling against a Chinese conglomerate in a patent piracy case brought by a Florida businessman. Nothing wrong with that in legal terms, the originating blog says, though in political terms, \"the idea of a Tea Party darling (Cruz) representing an alleged patent thief against a geriatric American entrepreneur, at a time when the U.S. economy is in shambles and China is the largest international holder of American debt, has the whiff of trouble about it.\"\n\nPerhaps Dewhurst scores political points on these fronts.\n\nPer our review, neither Dewhurst email explicitly says Cruz is a Chinese Communist.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

John Drogin, Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, pointed us to a Dictionary.com definition of \"red\" as a \"radical leftist in politics, especially a Communist.\" He also noted a Republican blogger\u2019s post interpreting the \"red Ted\" label in the email as meaning Communist.\n\n\"You know that \u2018red\u2019 is a clear euphemism for Communist and in the context of China,\" Drogin said. \"Dewhurst's staffer's remark is even more obviously so.\"\n\nThe \"red Ted\" reference might seem especially pointed because Cruz\u2019s father fought alongside Fidel Castro and the rebels in Cuba before fleeing the island nation for Texas; he later decided Castro was not the leader he\u2019d wished for, according to a January 2006 Austin American-Statesman news article.\n\nAll told, it\u2019s reasonable to take the subject line of one Dewhurst email as calling Cruz a Chinese Communist; the other cited email similarly depicts Cruz as siding with China over the United States, but doesn\u2019t include the \"red\" label. We rate Cruz\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12294"}
