Bernie Sanders criticized defence spending during the democratic presidential debate in South Carolina, saying that the out-of-control budget did not focus enough on combating modern threats. \"Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old cold war with the Soviet Union,\" said Sanders. \" Very little of that budget - less than 10 per cent - actually goes to the fight against ISIS and international terrorism.\" This seems very little of a budget of over $600 billion for the 2016 fiscal year, so we decided to consider it. What we found was that while Sanders was talking primarily about the funds allocated to fighting the group known as the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIS), he was not thinking about the real usefulness of the Ministry of Defence budget. Sanders' self-defense campaign used this talking point before, and we participated in math. They referred to over $600 billion in defence spending and said that only $5.5 billion had been allocated to combating ISIL and some $42 billion had been allocated to operations in Afghanistan, many of which were used to combat Al-Qaida. Overall, they said that the Government had spent about 7.9 per cent of the defence budget on counter-terrorism. But the experts told us that this is a very narrow view of how the defense budget works, which is the largest country in the world. For fiscal year 2016, defence spending totalled approximately $607 billion in the expenditure bill approved by Congress in December 2015. This includes all defence-related provisions, including mandatory funding for retirement payments, pensions and nuclear weapons expenditure in the Ministry of Energy. We are primarily interested in two parts of the Ministry of Defence budget: the Basic Estimated Expenditure and the External Emergency Fund. Core assessed funding is the largest part of the budget. This is all the money the U.S. Army gets to buy planes and tanks, finance research, keep the bases open and so on. Lacey Healy, a colleague in the Foreign Affairs and Defence Budget Programme at the Stimson Center in Washington, D.C., said that the Department of Defense &apos; s 2016 base, less other defence-related expenditures, amounted to some $522.9 billion. That represented an increase of $26.8 billion over the previous year. However, the funds needed to wage war come from the so-called External Emergency Operations Fund, which was established after the attacks of 11 September. It currently includes funding for the air campaign against ISIL, but also maintains a presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. Initiatives to assist in counter-terrorism efforts in the Middle East and NATO allies in Europe involved in Russian aggression also come from the Ok Agreement. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, the box is controversial, because Congress and the White House have had a fight about using OCO to pay for things that are usually covered by core funding, in order to obtain the effects of isolation. For 2016, the Fund received approximately $58.8 billion, but the budget package allocated some $9.1 billion under the Ok Agreement for matters normally covered under core funding. This leaves $49.7 billion earmarked for war abroad, but the details of how those funds are used are somewhat vague in the bill of appropriations. There will be no clear picture until the Ministry of Defence issues its 2017 budget request in February. In the meantime, Healy said, we can use President Barack Obama &apos; s Defence Budget Request in 2016 to get an idea of how to allocate funds. Obama asked Congress for $5.3 billion to fight ISIS (delayed in 2017) and $42.5 billion for Afghanistan, to help significantly in the fight against Al-Qaida. Using these figures with the raw mathematics of the Sanders campaign, ignoring the military presence in Iraq or other counter-terrorism operations, which would be just over 9 per cent. But the thing is that policy experts have said that it is difficult to draw a fixed line between the amount of the defence budget for current operations and the amount of overall readiness. The army needs its core budget for fighting, for which the Office for the Coordination of Military Operations has been established. \"capital investments in ships and aircraft are not included in OCO, yet you needed them to launch Tomahawks and all other types of ammunition,\" said Janine Davidson, Senior Defence Policy Fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations. \"Employees and training are also not easy to express. C-17 could fly a mission around the world, and only part of the week would be to support Afghanistan or the battle of ISIS.\" Also, the Sanders calculations do not take into account counter-terrorism efforts through other sources that do not include bombs or combat aircraft, such as the Ministry of Justice or the Ministry of State. For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation &apos; s Anti-Terrorism/Spying Decision-making Unit spent approximately $3.3 billion in 2015 and requested the same amount in 2016. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) are also working to thwart terrorism. While we do not know to what extent these agencies are funded, the documents leaked by the NSA contractor Edward Snowden showed that more than $16 billion was spent in 2013 to combat terrorism. \"Bernie is taking a very limited view of the defense budget here,\" said Haley. \"while it may be true that the overall counter-terrorism budget deserves careful consideration and will benefit from greater transparency, it is not true that we are spending far less than 10 per cent overall to combat international terrorism.\" \" Very little of the budget (defence) - less than 10 per cent - actually goes to fight ISIS and international terrorism.\" This figure is obtained using a very limited vision of the public defence budget, with only specific budget allocations to address ISIL and other terrorist threats. We have been told by experts that whatever the amounts allocated for this purpose, those operations are derived from the resources paid in the core budget. There is no clear way to separate the two. The Sanders figure refers to specific funding but paints a misleading picture of overall defence spending. We mostly rate it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05534"}
