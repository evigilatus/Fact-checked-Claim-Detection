During the discussion in Telemundo on 10 October, the moderator asked candidates to explain their conflicting views on driving permits for illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children. In 2013, the Legislature passed a bill to grant driving licences to those with deferred procedures for the arrival of children, sometimes called \"dreams.\" Scott said no. During the discussion, Christ, a democracy, said: \"I am a supporter of a dream driver's license. The Governor recently signed a bill where they can get education in the state. And that was a good thing to do. But if you can't drive to school, or if you can't drive to work, good luck going to work.\" Scott, a Republican, replied: \"Nothing has changed the approved driver's licence bill. These same individuals have the right to a Florida driver &apos; s licence today.\" Scott was partially right and partially misleading. Floridaans usually get work permits that they can use to obtain driving permits. However, he overestimates the situation when he says \"nothing has changed,\" because this bill would have given these migrants the right to use their driver's license forms, even if their work permit had not arrived at the same time. In 2012, Obama announced the General Temporary Assistance Act, which allows illegal immigrants who come to the country as children to apply for a renewed temporary status to stop deportation, as long as they can prove that they are bound by the law and meet other conditions. At the end of June 2014, some 580,000 individuals nationwide received initial deferred action, including 23,196 persons in Florida. In 2013, legislators in Florida proposed HB 235. This proposal would allow dreamers to use their new federal status as a means of obtaining a temporary driver &apos; s licence. An analysis of the Florida House states that without the law, dreamers will first have to obtain a work permit before they can obtain a temporary driver &apos; s licence. In April 2013, the Florida Bill sailed through a unanimous Senate vote with only two \"no\" votes in the House of Representatives. Scott reversed the draft law of 4 June 2013. In the veto letter, he struck the Obama Administration for the implementation of the Emergency Assistance Act and argued that the bill was unnecessary: \"The Florida Act already allows those holding a federal employment licence card, regardless of their status in terms of postponement of proceedings, to obtain a temporary driver's licence in Florida. Although the legislature may have been well-intentioned in seeking to expedite the process of obtaining a temporary driver &apos; s licence, this should not have been done on the basis of the federal government policy adopted without legal basis.\" Facebook was published on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook video showing the man upset because he was added to the no-fly list to break into the Capitol. \u2022 On 11 January 2021, Politi Fact Florida asked Scott's spokespersons and carried him to explain to him his evidence that the bill would not have changed anything, and if that was why he disturbed himself by its reversal. The only reply we received was a copy of Scott &apos; s veto. The Democrats and immigrant rights groups criticized Scott &apos; s veto as a blow to the Spanish. However, some news reports have described the right of veto for Scott's driver's license as largely symbolic because immigrants can still obtain a federal driver's license. The Federation, which criticized Scott &apos; s veto, sent a letter to the Ministry of Highway and Car Security stating that \"the veto should not have any effect on the current practice of the Florida Ministry of Health and Social Protection of granting driver &apos; s licences to current beneficiaries of the International Development Assistance Agency (IDA) who have a work permit.\" Federal immigration officials told Polyte Fact Florida that people applied for both a work permit and a work permit at the same time and that almost everyone received both. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Service approved 591,555 requests for official development assistance between 15 August 2012 and 31 July 2014. During the same period, the Agency rejected 635 applications for work permits. Possible reasons include the non-signature of forms or the submission of documents of ownership. Most of the immigration law experts we interviewed said that applicants generally received work permits and work permits at the same time, although some had heard accounts of persons who had obtained work permits days, weeks or months before obtaining them. Since such a delay could occur, the legislature wanted to grant these migrants the right to use the Agency to obtain driving licences as soon as possible. \"It was primarily to give these people the opportunity to obtain their driver's license immediately,\" said the State Bill of the Republic of Randolph Brass, D-Urlando, Polyte Fact Florida. \"Sometimes they get a letter of approval and a work permit at the same time but sometimes they don't. It was just an offer to support dreams and he said, \"We're behind you.\" \"The Governor Scott said that \"nothing has changed\" for some illegal immigrants to get driver's license in a bill of rejection. There was a change in the bill: it could have been positively stated that migrants with the approval of the Board could use those documents to obtain driving permits. He refused to remain silent on the draft law, and therefore migrants did not enjoy that right. However, applicants for a work permit are generally approved at approximately the same time. If Scott had not rejected the bill, it would have meant that those who first received the work permit would not have had to wait for the work permit, although sometimes it was a short wait. The claim is partly accurate in that immigrants who obtain a work permit will receive a work permit and can use the work permit to obtain the driver &apos; s licence. However, Scott went too far when he said \"nothing has changed\" in the bill that he rejected. We're assessing this claim half right. * Editor &apos; s note: This report first appeared with conflicting decisions. The right verdict is half true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07114"}
