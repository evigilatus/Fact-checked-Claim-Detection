Is Australia closing its borders for six months, as some online posts suggest? It\u2019s possible, but that hasn\u2019t been determined.\n\"Australia Closing Borders in a few hours for 6-months,\" said the headline of a March 20 post on sydneynews.sydney, shared on Facebook.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe headline in sydneynews.sydney gives the impression that the 6-month time frame is a certainty. That\u2019s not the case. Other news outlets, including the Guardian and Sky News, have posted more cautious headlines, saying the borders \"could be closed for six months.\"\nAustralia\u2019s Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced March 19 that Australia would close its borders to all non-citizens and non-residents on March 20 at 9 p.m. Australian Eastern Daylight Time. (Exemptions apply for close immediate family members of Australian residents and citizens.)\nThe travel ban is part of a series of measures Australia is taking to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The government said that about 80% of coronavirus cases in Australia were people who caught the virus overseas or people in contact with individuals who returned from overseas.\nThe Australian government has said that the virus could be around for at least six months and that Australians should brace for disruptions in daily life. Whether the ban lasts six months is uncertain, as it\u2019s exact duration has not been determined.\nIn media interviews, Australia\u2019s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the travel ban would last as long as medical experts say it\u2019s necessary, but that it was hard to put a precise date on when the ban would be lifted.\nHere\u2019s an exchange he had March 19 with Patricia Karvelas of ABC Radio National, according to a government transcript:\nKarvelas: \"So just, again, level with us. Could this travel ban last for six months at least?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrydenberg: \"The travel ban will last as long as the medical experts tell us that we need to prevent the spread of the virus, and one way to do that is through the steps that announced today.\"\nKarvelas: \"So you accept that it could be closed. I just want to nail down a timeframe for this six-month period that we're looking at.\"\nFrydenberg: \"You're asking me to put a date on something that not even the medical experts can put a date on.\"\nKarvelas: \"No, but the Prime Minister has put a date on it. He said for six months you can expect these changes, so I expect that's the timeframe.\"\nFrydenberg: \"To be fair to him, he actually said six months at least.\"\nKarvelas: \"Does that mean a travel ban could even be longer than six months?\"\nFrydenberg: \"Again, as your listeners would expect us to do, we follow the medical advice and not even the medical experts know how long the spread of the virus will continue and the date upon which a vaccine will be found.\"\nOur ruling\nAn online post said, \"Australia Closing Borders in a few hours for 6-months.\"\nOfficials have said the coronavirus outbreak and related disruptions in Australia could last at least six months. To slow the spread of the virus, Australia has banned entry to non-Australian residents and citizens and their immediate families. But it has not determined whether the travel ban will last six months.\nOfficials say it will remain in effect until it\u2019s safe to lift, but have not given a specific date for its end date.\nThe online post is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
