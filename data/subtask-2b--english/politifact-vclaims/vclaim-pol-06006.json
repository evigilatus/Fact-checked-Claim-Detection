First, in a large survey of climate scientists, \"57 percent don\u2019t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2,\" according to Santorum. (We found that claim False.)\nSecond, Santorum said that a\u00a0widely cited figure of scientific consensus on climate change \u2014 97 percent \u2014 has been debunked by the \"head\" of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, he said.\n\"The 97 percent figure that\u2019s thrown around, the head of the UN IPC (sic) said that number was pulled out of thin air. It was based on a survey of 77 scientists,\" he said on Aug. 28. \"Not even 97 scientists responded to that survey.\"\nSeveral readers asked us to look into Santorum\u2019s claim. His campaign didn\u2019t get back to us, but we found that Santorum misstated both who objected to the figure and what that person objected to.\nFrom 2002 until recently, the chairman of the IPCC was climate scientist Rajendra Pachauri, who resigned from his post in February 2015. To our knowledge, neither Pachauri nor current chairman Ismail El Gizouli has criticized the 97 percent figure. Pachauri has, in fact, endorsed the notion of scientific consensus on climate change.\n\"By overwhelming consensus, the scientific community agrees that climate change is real,\" he said at a press conference in 2010.\nSantorum is likely referring to Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex who\u2019s been a vocal critic of the 97 percent figure. He is not, as Santorum claims, the \"head\" of the IPCC, though he was the convening lead\u00a0author of a chapter of the IPCC\u2019s fifth report. He has since parted ways with the IPCC.\nCurrently, Tol serves as an adviser to the Global Warming Policy Foundation. That group, says Stephan Lewandowsky, a psychologist at the University of Bristol who studies the rejection of climate science, is \"the U.K.\u2019s most prominent source of climate\u00a0change denial.\"\nThe \"thin air\" quote Santorum cited\u00a0is from Tol\u2019s testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.\n\"I mean it is pretty clear that most of the science agrees that climate change is real and most likely human-made,\" Tol said on during a 2014 hearing on the IPCC. \"But the 97 percent is essentially pulled from thin air. It is not based on any credible research whatsoever.\"\nTol was specifically referring to a 2013 survey by John Cook, who studies climate communication at the University of Queensland.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCook\u2019s study found that among over 4,000 studies that took a position on man-made climate change, 97.1 percent \"endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global phase\" and 97.2 of 1,300 authors who responded agreed with the position.\nTol takes issue with Cook\u2019s methodology. By his analysis of Cook\u2019s data, the real figure is around 91 percent. (Cook replied critiquing Tol\u2019s methodology and standing by his survey\u2019s original finding of 97 percent.)\n\"There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans,\" Tol writes in his analysis. \"I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct. Cook et al., however, failed to demonstrate this.\"\nSo Santorum is talking about the wrong person. And\u00a0his reference to \"a survey of 77 scientists,\" is talking about something else entirely.\nThe study Santorum is attempting to describe is a 2009 survey by Peter Doran, a professor of earth science at Louisiana State University. About 90 percent of around 3,000 surveyed earth scientists said they think climate change is happening, and about 82 percent said human activity is contributing to it.\nThe 97 percent figure comes from a subsample of climate scientists in Doran\u2019s study, and Santorum correctly describes its small size: 74 out of 77 respondents said they agreed that climate change is man-made.\nBeyond his and Cook\u2019s study, a 2010 study of over 1,300 climate researchers and their work also showed a 97 to 98 percent consensus.\n\"They keep talking about how \u2018the\u2019 97 percent study is wrong,\" Doran told PolitiFact in an interview. \"Well it turns out, we never know which study they are referring to because there have been three peer-reviewed studies of late that have arrived at this 97 percent number in different ways and by different people.\"\nOur ruling\nSantorum said, \"The 97 percent figure that\u2019s thrown around, the head of the UN IPC (sic) said that number was pulled out of thin air. It was based on a survey of 77 scientists.\"\nSantorum\u2019s claim confuses several points. First, the critic of the 97 percent he\u2019s referring to isn\u2019t the \"head\" of the UN\u2019s climate panel, but an economist who has collaborated with but has since left the IPCC.\nSecond, the 97 percent doesn\u2019t come from one specific survey \u2014 it appears in at least three. And finally, the study Santorum describes isn\u2019t the one the economist objects to. Moreover, Tol himself doesn\u2019t refute the notion of broad scientific consensus on man-made climate change.\nSantorum\u2019s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.\nCorrection, Sept. 3, 2015, 10:45\u00a0a.m: Cook's analysis looked at over\u00a04,000 studies that took a position on man-made climate change. An earlier version of this fact-check had a different figure.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06006"}
