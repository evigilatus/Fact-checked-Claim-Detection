Maxine Waters, D-Calif., getting criminally charged?\nWaters\u2019 call to confront members of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration during a June 23 rally in Los Angeles not only drew criticism, but sparked a series of inaccurate headlines and stories.\n\"Maxine Waters Is Getting Criminally Charged!,\" read a headline on ConservativePost.com. Like the claim that a Trump supporter had tried to murder Waters, this headline is false.\nFacebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\"Laura Loomer, a conservative investigative journalist, is charging \u2018Auntie\u2019 Maxine for assault, citing Waters hit her hand and swatted her face with office papers,\" the article reads.\nThe blog post cites a tweet by Loomer that reads: \"BREAKING: Today I filed a police report w/ @CapitolPolice against @RepMaxineWaters. Yesterday when I confronted her on Capitol Hill, she ASSAULTED me. She hit my hand, then she swatted me in the face twice w/ her papers. I\u2019m pressing charges against her.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly one person died on that day\u201d during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 9, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBREAKING: Today I filed a police report w/ @CapitolPolice against @RepMaxineWaters.Yesterday when I confronted her on Capitol Hill, she ASSAULTED me.

Waters responds each question by saying a variation of, \"Come to my office, I\u2019ll be happy to sit down with you. We can\u2019t talk on the run.\"\nWhen Loomer does not desist, Waters holds a piece of paper over her face and waves Loomer\u2019s recording device away. Waters eventually walks into a members-only elevator on her way to a vote.\nFiling a police report does not equate having criminal charges brought against Waters. A criminal charge can only be made by a government authority, which Loomer is not.\n\"A police report could trigger a criminal charge if a prosecutor brought the charges to a grand jury and they chose to pursue it,\" Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University, told us. \"But the mere filing of a complaint by an individual who feels aggrieved does not constitute a criminal charge.\"\nBloggers said Waters is getting criminally charged. But that\u2019s a misreading of what happened, and how the U.S. criminal justice system works.
