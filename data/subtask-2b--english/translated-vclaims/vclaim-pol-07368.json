The four-page publication goes on to carry out a number of attacks, including these: \"It's really worrying that Scott Walker gave a tax discount of $10,000 to the millionaires who send their children to exclusive private schools. Some asked why Walker was granted tax relief to the millionaires who could afford education rather than invest in children receiving education in public schools. Working families are still waiting for an answer.\" So, did Walker deduct $10,000 from the private school tax to take advantage of the millionaire? What happened was not only AFL-CIO to denounce the tax measure, which was adopted as part of the 2013-15 State budget, which is for students from kindergarten to secondary school. The Wisconsin Budget Project, part of the Liberal Wisconsin Council for Children and Families, criticized it as being larger than the tax deduction available for university education. At the same time, the President of the Senate Education Committee commended the tax exemption because it \"may make it easier for parents to afford private school if they feel that this is the best option for their children.\" Here's how it works: starting with the 2014 tax year for tax returns due in April 2015, taxpayers can subtract from their income payments to private schools for tuition fees and compulsory education. Schools can be inside or outside Wisconsin, although expenses such as room and food cannot be deducted. For each kindergarten student up to the eighth grade, the maximum discount is $4,000; for each secondary school student, the maximum is $10,000. An important point is that discounts are available to anyone, regardless of income, including the millionaire. The discount will represent a reduction in the government income tax for the model family of approximately $240 per primary school student and $600 per secondary school student, according to an approximate calculation by the non-partisan budget office of the legislature. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January, 2021 in percentage terms, savings have had a greater impact on low-income taxpayers, although this will not in itself be sufficient for many low-income families to pay for a private school. On the other hand, the State is expected to receive $30 million per year less than tax revenues as a result of the tax exemption. The Association claims that in the light of Walker &apos; s cuts in public school aid in its budget for 2011-2013, the $30 million represents a larger amount that can be invested in public schools rather than lower taxes on people who can be said to be at the highest income level. However, the Governor &apos; s Wisconsin Institute for Policy Research noted that reduced revenues could be offset if tax exemption led to the temptation of more students - about 3,000 - to move to private schools. This is because public schools receive the aid of taxpayers from the State based on the number of students they have. While many private school students belong to richer families, many other students come from families with more modest incomes. Before we conclude, let us consider another perspective. In June 2013, a few days before the tax exemption was granted, the headmaster of the government schools, Tony Evers, declared it \"the most generous school in the country.\" We've evaluated his claim for half the truth. We found that, compared to the other five states that offered either a special tax deduction in schools, or a tax exemption, the tax exemption in Wisconsin is one of the most generous tax exemptions for parents with multiple children attending a private high school, for example. However, depending on different factors, it is not necessarily more generous than other States. Our assessment is that Walker said, \"He's deducted $10,000 from taxes for the millionaires who send their children to private schools.\" There is an element of truth, with millions benefiting from tax relief. But also taxpayers from other income levels who send their children to private schools. We assess the claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07368"}
