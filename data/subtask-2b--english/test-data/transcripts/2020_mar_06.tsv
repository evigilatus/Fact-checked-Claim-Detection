3	Bret Baier	Good evening from the Scranton Cultural Center in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
4	Bret Baier	Tonight, the battle for the White House comes to the Keystone State.
5	Bret Baier	Good evening.
6	Bret Baier	I'm Bret Baier.
7	Martha MacCallum	And I'm Martha MacCallum.
8	Martha MacCallum	Great to be here tonight.
9	Martha MacCallum	Pennsylvania, of course, was critical in securing President Trump's victory in 2016.
10	Martha MacCallum	And it is a state that he may need again this November.
11	Bret Baier	This comes as the Democratic field hoping to challenge him is narrowing.
12	Bret Baier	Only two major candidates remain, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
13	Martha MacCallum	President Trump has already held rallies across the country, touting record jobs, new trade deals, and an overall strong economy.
14	Bret Baier	So, will that message resonate here, as he looks to become the first Republican since Ronald Reagan to win Pennsylvania twice?
15	Martha MacCallum	Ladies and gentlemen, President Donald Trump.
16	Martha MacCallum	[Applause, Cheering]
17	Donald Trump	Thank you.
18	Donald Trump	Thank you.
19	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
20	Donald Trump	Whoa!
21	Donald Trump	[Applause, Cheering] Thank you.
22	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
23	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
24	Donald Trump	Thank you.
25	Donald Trump	Hi, Bret.
26	Bret Baier	Mr. President, thanks for being here.
27	Donald Trump	Nice to be invited.
28	Donald Trump	[Crosstalk]
29	Bret Baier	Nice to see you again.
30	Martha MacCallum	Thank you for being here.
31	Donald Trump	Great.
32	Bret Baier	Thank you.
33	Martha MacCallum	Great to have you.
34	Martha MacCallum	[Applause, Cheering]
35	Donald Trump	Thank you.
36	Donald Trump	Thank you.
37	Donald Trump	[Applause, Cheering] Whoa.
38	Donald Trump	Thank you.
39	Donald Trump	So great.
40	Martha MacCallum	Well, you got a great crowd here.
41	Donald Trump	Nice audience.
42	Bret Baier	Nice crowd.
43	Bret Baier	[Applause, Cheering]
44	Donald Trump	Thank you.
45	Martha MacCallum	Terrific crowd here tonight.
46	Martha MacCallum	Thank you so much, everybody.
47	Bret Baier	We would love to get into a lot of questions tonight.
48	Donald Trump	Good.
49	Bret Baier	And there are a lot of good questions from residents here in Scranton, who will want to talk about big issues.
50	Martha MacCallum	So, we are going to jump right in with the first questioner from our audience.
51	Martha MacCallum	Thank you again, Mr. President, for being here tonight.
52	Donald Trump	Thank you.
53	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
54	Martha MacCallum	Katherine Pugh is joining us.
55	Martha MacCallum	She's an undecided voter.
56	Martha MacCallum	And she has a question for President Trump.
57	Martha MacCallum	Katherine?
58	Question	Mr. President, at the outset of the coronavirus, your administration's response seemed to some as being confusing or minimizing.
59	Question	What plans are being considered on a federal level for the possibility of a long-term disruption from the novel coronavirus?
60	Donald Trump	Well, actually, we are giving -- I think really given tremendous marks -- you look at Gallup poll, you look at other polls, for the way we have handled it.
61	Donald Trump	And one of the things I did is, I closed down the borders to China and to other areas that are very badly affected, and really having a lot of troubles, I mean, countries and areas of countries that have had a lot of problem.
62	Donald Trump	And I closed them down very early, against the advice of almost everybody.
63	Donald Trump	And we have been given rave reviews.
64	Donald Trump	And that's why we have only right now 11 -- it's a lot of people, but it's still 11 people, versus tremendous numbers of thousands of people that have died all over the world.
65	Donald Trump	We have 11.
66	Donald Trump	We have 149 cases as of this moment.
67	Donald Trump	This morning, it was 129.
68	Donald Trump	And I just see you -- right now, it's about 149 cases.
69	Donald Trump	There are 100,000 cases all over the world.
70	Donald Trump	So we're really given tremendous marks for having made the decision.
71	Donald Trump	And that was a decision I made to close down the borders, so that people from China, where we take in thousands and thousands of people a day, they stopped coming in very early, weeks ahead of where they normally would have been stopped.
72	Donald Trump	Thank you.
73	Bret Baier	Mr. President, you have said you want to take politics out of dealing with this crisis.
74	Donald Trump	Right.
75	Bret Baier	But in the White House yesterday, you said that about the testing kits and the delay, you blamed President Obama.
76	Donald Trump	Well, I don't blame anybody.
77	Donald Trump	I want to get everybody to understand, they made some decisions which were not good decisions.
78	Donald Trump	We inherited decisions that they made.
79	Donald Trump	And that's fine.
80	Bret Baier	As far as regulations?
81	Donald Trump	We undid -- yes.
82	Donald Trump	We undid some of the regulations that were made that made it very difficult.
83	Donald Trump	But I'm not blaming anybody.
84	Donald Trump	It just seems that the Democrats, some of them, I must say -- and you know it better than anybody, Bret -- it's become much better.
85	Donald Trump	But some of the Democrats have said, no matter what -- if we found a cure, and everybody's better tomorrow morning at nine o'clock, they would say, he's done a terrible job.
86	Donald Trump	It's just automatic.
87	Donald Trump	How is the president doing?
88	Donald Trump	Oh, terrible, terrible.
89	Donald Trump	They don't mean it.
90	Donald Trump	And we have done a great job.
91	Donald Trump	Again, we have gotten the highest poll numbers of anybody for this kind of a thing.
92	Donald Trump	And it's -- and the other thing, I'm working with phenomenal people, with CDC and all of the people involved.
93	Donald Trump	Mike Pence is doing a fantastic job.
94	Donald Trump	I mean, Mike Pence is working 20 hours a day or more on this, and really doing a fantastic job.
95	Bret Baier	I guess the critics say that, why wait until the testing issue became a crisis before dealing with it?
96	Bret Baier	If you wanted to change the regulations, why not change them either when you took office or when you first learned of the virus in January?
97	Bret Baier	For example, South Korea really got their act together right away.
98	Bret Baier	That's what they say.
99	Donald Trump	Well, when you say take office, we just learned about this a very short while ago.
100	Bret Baier	Sure, but -- or when you learned about the virus in January.
101	Donald Trump	I know, but you're not going to be thinking -- I'm thinking about a lot of other things too, like...
102	Bret Baier	Sure, yes, yes.
103	Donald Trump	... like trade and millions of other things.
104	Donald Trump	I mean, we are doing some job with the economy and all.
105	Donald Trump	So, I'm not thinking about this.
106	Donald Trump	But as soon as I heard that China had a problem, I said, what's going on with China?
107	Donald Trump	How many people are coming in?
108	Donald Trump	Nobody but me asked that question.
109	Donald Trump	And you know better than -- again, you know, you both know that I closed the borders very early.
110	Donald Trump	And we were given A-pluses for that.
111	Bret Baier	And you were given applause for that.
112	Donald Trump	Yes, saved a lot of lives.
113	Bret Baier	But I'm just talking about the testing -- the testing kits.
114	Donald Trump	Well, the testing, we did it -- as soon as we found out that it was a problem, we did it.
115	Donald Trump	It's not the kind of a thing you say, gee, I just got elected.
116	Donald Trump	Let's do some testing on this.
117	Donald Trump	They had some bad decisions.
118	Donald Trump	Some bad decisions were made.
119	Donald Trump	We corrected those decisions.
120	Martha MacCallum	So, obviously, you care a lot about the economy.
121	Martha MacCallum	And we are seeing some impacts.
122	Martha MacCallum	It is kind of surprising how many conferences are being shut down, and meetings are being canceled, and flights.
123	Martha MacCallum	A lot of flights have been canceled.
124	Martha MacCallum	Even the James Bond movie, they're delaying because of coronavirus.
125	Martha MacCallum	I'm wondering what you think is the long-term -- over the course of the year, Wall Street says that they don't expect U.S. companies to have any growth in 2020, which is pretty surprising.
126	Martha MacCallum	What's the impact on the economy and also potentially on your reelection?
127	Donald Trump	Well, I think people are viewing us as having done a very good job.
128	Donald Trump	What we have to do is do a very professional job.
129	Donald Trump	Nobody is blaming us for the virus, nobody.
130	Donald Trump	I mean, I haven't heard that, even from some of the so-called enemies or whatever you want to call them.
131	Donald Trump	They're not blaming us.
132	Martha MacCallum	No.
133	Donald Trump	This started in China.
134	Donald Trump	How it started, there is question, but thousands and thousands of cases in China.
135	Donald Trump	And it infiltrated to almost 100 countries right now.
136	Martha MacCallum	But I'm not talking about the handling of it.
137	Donald Trump	Nobody is blaming me.
138	Martha MacCallum	Excuse me.
139	Martha MacCallum	I don't mean to interrupt.
140	Martha MacCallum	But I'm just asking about in terms of things you can't control, right, the impact on the economy, and that potentially that could -- if people feel like the economy is turning around, that that could be an election issue as you go into it.
141	Donald Trump	Well, look, we were set to hit 30,000 on the Dow.
142	Donald Trump	This is a number that nobody ever even came close to.
143	Donald Trump	And, already, we have the number.
144	Donald Trump	And even though it's down 10 or 11 percent, it's still the highest it's ever been by far.
145	Donald Trump	It certainly might have an impact.
146	Donald Trump	At the same time, I have to say, people are now staying in the United States, spending their money in the U.S. And I like that.
147	Donald Trump	I have been after that for a long time.
148	Donald Trump	You know that.
149	Donald Trump	I have been saying, let's stay in the U.S., spend your money here.
150	Donald Trump	And they're doing that.
151	Donald Trump	They sort of enforced doing that.
152	Donald Trump	We met with the airline companies yesterday.
153	Donald Trump	They're doing a fantastic job.
154	Donald Trump	And they are just not flying to areas that have a big problem.
155	Donald Trump	So it's going to all work out.
156	Donald Trump	Everybody has to be calm.
157	Donald Trump	It's all going to work out.
158	Bret Baier	But, to Katherine's original question, there is a long-term plan if it lasts longer than we think?
159	Donald Trump	Sure.
160	Donald Trump	We could have a very long-term plan.
161	Donald Trump	We hope that doesn't happen.
162	Donald Trump	But we're -- we have plans for every single possibility.
163	Donald Trump	And I think that's what we have to do.
164	Donald Trump	We hope it doesn't last too long.
165	Bret Baier	We want to get to audience questions.
166	Bret Baier	Robert is a Trump supporter.
167	Bret Baier	He does have a question about rhetoric here in the campaign.
168	Bret Baier	Robert.
169	Question	Mr. President, thank you so much for returning back to Northeastern Pennsylvania.
170	Donald Trump	Good.
171	Donald Trump	Thank you.
172	Question	I have been a big supporter of you for the duration.
173	Donald Trump	Thank you.
174	Question	And you every -- for everything that you have done for this country and continue to do for this country.
175	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
176	Question	Unfortunately, insult politics have become a staple of this political environment.
177	Donald Trump	Yes.
178	Question	Joe Biden has suggested to take you out back behind the gym and fight you.
179	Question	Maxine Waters has a low I.Q.
180	Question	Could there be a way that we can deliver your message without the controversial rhetoric, in efforts to reunite this country during these divisive times?
181	Donald Trump	Well, I have to tell you, I think -- I appreciate the question.
182	Donald Trump	I think the country is far more united than people think.
183	Donald Trump	And, ultimately, what is uniting the country is success.
184	Donald Trump	And we're having more success than we have ever had.
185	Donald Trump	We got hit with the virus really three weeks ago, if you think about it, I guess.
186	Donald Trump	That's when we first started really to see some possible effects.
187	Donald Trump	But even despite that, the country, we are having the greatest year.
188	Donald Trump	We had -- last year was the greatest year we have ever had economically.
189	Donald Trump	And I think the way we unite is really through success.
190	Donald Trump	But when they hit us, we have to hit back.
191	Donald Trump	I feel that.
192	Donald Trump	I mean, there's two ways of doing it, turning your cheek.
193	Donald Trump	But I wouldn't be sitting up here if I turned my cheek.
194	Donald Trump	If I said, OK, let them just keep hitting at me, and I won't do it, they're not interviewing me right now.
195	Donald Trump	They're interviewing somebody else.
196	Donald Trump	Maybe they won't even be doing that, because if they don't get ratings, they don't interview anybody.
197	Donald Trump	[Laughter] That, I have learned.
198	Donald Trump	[Applause, Laughter] But you know what?
199	Donald Trump	You can't turn your cheek.
200	Donald Trump	I mean, we get hit.
201	Donald Trump	[Applause] Thank you.
202	Donald Trump	[Crosstalk] We get hit so hard.
203	Donald Trump	And we have a media that is, I say, to a large extent, it's a part of the Democrat Party.
204	Donald Trump	It really is.
205	Donald Trump	It's terrible.
206	Donald Trump	It's unfair.
207	Donald Trump	I call it fake news.
208	Donald Trump	I have used that.
209	Donald Trump	And people are using that, I guess, all over the world right now.
210	Donald Trump	And that's the way it is.
211	Donald Trump	We have to fight back.
212	Donald Trump	If we don't fight back, you won't be a fan of mine very long.
213	Donald Trump	But I appreciate the question.
214	Donald Trump	Thank you.
215	Donald Trump	[Applause]
216	Martha MacCallum	All right.
217	Donald Trump	Thank you.
218	Donald Trump	[Applause]
219	Martha MacCallum	So, I -- speaking -- speaking of rhetoric, I want you -- to ask you to listen to this.
220	Chuck Schumer	[Begin Video Clip] I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price.
221	Chuck Schumer	Now, I should not have used the words I used yesterday.
222	Chuck Schumer	They didn't come out the way I intended to.
223	Chuck Schumer	[End Video Clip]
224	Martha MacCallum	So, going over some of the response to all of that, President Trump, some of your critics are saying, well, President Trump has also gone after liberal judges, and that Chuck Schumer...
225	Donald Trump	You mean they're blaming me for Schumer?
226	Martha MacCallum	No.
227	Martha MacCallum	[Laughter]
228	Martha MacCallum	Well, they're saying that, then he came out... [Applause, Cheering]
229	Martha MacCallum	So, he made sort of an apology there.
230	Martha MacCallum	[Applause, Cheering]
231	Martha MacCallum	Do you ever -- do you think that you should make any apology for your -- what you have said about liberal judges, or not?
232	Donald Trump	Well, look, I mean, we had a justice come out and criticize me badly.
233	Donald Trump	And I just responded to what she said.
234	Donald Trump	I had it twice.
235	Donald Trump	And when you look at -- I had a very harsh criticism, as you know, Justice Ginsburg, during the -- just before a debate during the election, as I was getting elected.
236	Donald Trump	She came out.
237	Donald Trump	She had to apologize.
238	Donald Trump	It was a terrible thing she said.
239	Donald Trump	She should have never been allowed to say it.
240	Donald Trump	But if they say something to me, I'm not allowed to say back?
241	Donald Trump	You had another justice say something that was somewhat derogatory.
242	Donald Trump	And all I did was respond.
243	Donald Trump	But I didn't respond like Schumer.
244	Donald Trump	Schumer, that was a physical thing, in my opinion.
245	Donald Trump	He tried to say, oh, well, that has to do with the election.
246	Donald Trump	That had nothing to do with the election, the way he said, we're going to hit back, like you have never seen before?
247	Donald Trump	That was a real intimidation.
248	Donald Trump	And the best you can say is, they're trying to intimidate, so that the judges vote -- so the justices vote their way.
249	Donald Trump	That's no good either.
250	Donald Trump	But that was a physical -- that was really -- if a Republican did what Schumer did, they'd be in jail right now, I'll tell you right now.
251	Donald Trump	[Applause]
252	Bret Baier	Mr. President, just follow up on that really quickly.
253	Bret Baier	Chief Justice Roberts obviously put out a statement and really rebuked Senator Schumer for those words.
254	Bret Baier	The last time he put out one of these rare statements, it was about you and the federal judge that you called an Obama judge.
255	Bret Baier	So, to Martha's question, is there something about apologies on both sides when dealing with justices or judges?
256	Donald Trump	Well, look, I have to state the facts.
257	Donald Trump	I'm not threatening anybody physically.
258	Donald Trump	But if we have an Obama judge, we don't do very well.
259	Donald Trump	Now, we have appointed 220 federal judges, the most, I think, in history.
260	Donald Trump	It's a record.
261	Donald Trump	It's a record.
262	Donald Trump	Because -- because, number one, Mitch McConnell did a great job, but the Republicans did a great job.
263	Donald Trump	But the bottom line is, President Obama gave me 142 openings when I first got there.
264	Donald Trump	Normally, you would have -- there's never been anything like that.
265	Donald Trump	Normally, you would have no opening.
266	Donald Trump	Now, you say he's a great president.
267	Donald Trump	The most important thing you have to do, I say, is the military, but a lot of people say is judges and justices of the Supreme Court.
268	Donald Trump	President Obama gave us 142.
269	Donald Trump	It's unheard of.
270	Donald Trump	If you have one, it's like you got lucky -- had 142.
271	Donald Trump	We're up to 220 federal judges and court of appeals judges, two Supreme Court justices.
272	Donald Trump	I mean, it's incredible.
273	Donald Trump	But we were going -- if you go to the Ninth Circuit, if you go certain places, it's almost impossible to win.
274	Donald Trump	So, I was surprised at Justice Roberts.
275	Donald Trump	And I have a lot of respect for him.
276	Donald Trump	I like him personally.
277	Donald Trump	I have a lot of respect.
278	Donald Trump	But I think that could have been left unsaid, because a lot of people, a lot of very top legal minds disagreed with him when he said it.
279	Donald Trump	Now I'm just talking about the facts.
280	Donald Trump	I'm talking about sort of the facts of life, that's the way it is.
281	Bret Baier	Well let's get back to our questions, our next question is from David Hines, he's a Democrat who decided to vote for you in 2016.
282	Donald Trump	Good.
283	Question	Mr. President, welcome back to Scranton.
284	Donald Trump	Thank you, David.
285	Question	Everyone supports protecting the environment, but the EPA seems too focused on complex regulations, fines, fees, and lawsuits.
286	Question	What can you do to lead the EPA to focus more on proactive compliance instead of punitive enforcement to protect the environment?
287	Donald Trump	David, I love the question because our EPA is much different.
288	Donald Trump	We're very tough, but we get things done, and we're taking regulations off like nobody's ever seen.
289	Donald Trump	And I say very simply, I want to have the cleanest air on the planet.
290	Donald Trump	I want to have the most crystal clear beautiful water on the planet.
291	Donald Trump	And our conditions now are much better than they were three years ago.
292	Donald Trump	But you know very well David, because you're into the world of regulation -- I think it was maybe one of the biggest things we've done.
293	Donald Trump	I've cut regulations more than any president -- whether they're eight years, four years or one case quite a bit more than eight years.
294	Donald Trump	I cut more than any other president in the history of our country, and I did it in less than three years.
295	Donald Trump	So it's a great question.
296	Donald Trump	The EPA was -- this is why I was able to get the country going, because so many jobs were stopped, by not only EPA, so many other agencies where you'd have to go get 11 different permits for essentially the same thing.
297	Donald Trump	I opened up LNG plants in Louisiana where they were for years -- for 10, 12, 14 years and longer trying to get permits -- they couldn't get permits.
298	Donald Trump	I got them built.
299	Donald Trump	A $10 billion plant in Louisiana.
300	Donald Trump	They Keystone XL pipeline, I gave it -- in my first week I got approval.
301	Donald Trump	The Dakota Access pipeline, I got the approval -- 48,000 jobs.
302	Donald Trump	And frankly, it's more environmentally -- you know, it's better than having the train going up and down tracks, and you don't know what happens with the train -- plenty of bad things happen with those trains.
303	Donald Trump	Here you're underground, environmentally better.
304	Donald Trump	So I think it's a great question.
305	Donald Trump	We're really -- one of the reasons the economy is so strong is because of what we did with regulations.
306	Donald Trump	If the other side -- we'll call it the other side, affectionately, got in they would have made regulations much, much tougher.
307	Donald Trump	Thank you.
308	Bret Baier	Well that's it, we're going to…
309	Martha MacCallum	I want to ask him…
310	Bret Baier	Oh, thank you.
311	Bret Baier	They're talking about the rain tax here in Pennsylvania.
312	Martha MacCallum	I want to ask David, actually a follow-up question, because you are really the typical voter, I think you were -- you were a lifelong Democrat who crossed over and voted for President Trump in 2016 in areas like we are in right now in Lackawanna County.
313	Martha MacCallum	So you know, obviously now Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders -- whoever it is, is going to try to get your vote back.
314	Martha MacCallum	So I'm just -- I am curious, is there anything or any issue that they could answer for you that would change your mind, do you think?
315	Question	I'm focused on the economy, and on regulation and deregulation, and I like what's happened in the country in the last four years…
316	Donald Trump	Thank you.
317	Question	…and I'm thankful for your efforts, sir…
318	Donald Trump	Thank you, David.
319	Question	…and I hope we can continue on that.
320	Question	[Applause]
321	Martha MacCallum	Thank you.
322	Martha MacCallum	So the answer would be no, nothing would change your mind?
323	Martha MacCallum	No -- he's shaking his head, no, nothing.
324	Donald Trump	I think they thought you were going to give them a different answer.
325	Martha MacCallum	No, I wanted to hear because I do think it's very, I mean he is…
326	Donald Trump	That sounded like a setup question -- no, no, no David, you're my man.
327	Donald Trump	David's my man, I like that guy.
328	Martha MacCallum	No, I wanted -- you know what, I love that too.
329	Donald Trump	I like that guy.
330	Martha MacCallum	I said, I'm very interested in voter, because we want to know what -- you know, how voters like you are going to vote next time around because we love to follow the story of the movement of the electoral.
331	Martha MacCallum	And I think it's fascinating that you -- you know, answered as you did.
332	Donald Trump	Well Martha, this area of Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania itself has the best numbers it's ever had.
333	Donald Trump	It's got the best economy it's ever had -- has the best unemployment numbers it's ever had.
334	Donald Trump	And Scranton has the lowest and best unemployment numbers they've -- and employment numbers too -- that they've ever had by far.
335	Donald Trump	So you know, we're very happy about the job -- the people in Pennsylvania they're very happy with the job.
336	Donald Trump	You know, it was 30 years since a Republican won Pennsylvania, and based on results, I think we'll win it again very easily.
337	Martha MacCallum	Yeah.
338	Martha MacCallum	I mentioned… [Applause]
339	Martha MacCallum	President Trump, I mentioned Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders because Elizabeth Warren dropped out today, and I want to know what your reaction to that was?
340	Donald Trump	Well, look, if she's a true progressive, which probably she is -- she should have dropped out three days ago.
341	Donald Trump	It would have been a whole different race.
342	Donald Trump	Texas was close, she got votes -- she didn't do well, but she got a lot of votes -- far more than the difference.
343	Donald Trump	I think about Maine.
344	Donald Trump	Maine was almost a tie.
345	Donald Trump	They had to wait a day and a half before they could even call it, it was so close.
346	Donald Trump	She, I guess, came in third, and it was, you know, a very distant third.
347	Donald Trump	But she got a lot of votes.
348	Donald Trump	Maine would have gone to -- I think he would have gotten everything, right?
349	Donald Trump	Bernie Sanders would have won five, six, seven states -- would have won Minnesota, would have won at least another two or three states.
350	Donald Trump	So when you look at it, she did him no favors.
351	Donald Trump	That was not a good friendship.
352	Donald Trump	That was -- we started to see that during the debates, by the way, that one became unhinged.
353	Martha MacCallum	Yeah.
354	Donald Trump	But you know, if she would have gone out -- she didn't even have to endorse him.
355	Donald Trump	If she weren't -- if she just dropped out of the race without an endorsement, he would have won a tremendous number of states that he lost.
356	Donald Trump	You know, he lost states by not very much.
357	Donald Trump	And she got enough votes that it would have made a big difference.
358	Donald Trump	I think he would be leading by a lot right now, had she not been in the race.
359	Bret Baier	You know, tonight you're in the boyhood home, obviously of Joe Biden, who is sort of like a phoenix from the ashes in this Democratic race.
360	Bret Baier	And tonight looks likely that he could get the Democratic nomination.
361	Bret Baier	Now Democrats insist that you were impeached because you were trying to damage Joe Biden, were you?
362	Donald Trump	So, it was a fake impeachment.
363	Donald Trump	[Applause] We had 100 -- think of it, of the Republicans in the House.
364	Donald Trump	We had 107 -- 196 votes in favor, zero from the Republicans, zero against.
365	Donald Trump	We picked up three Democrat votes on top of that.
366	Donald Trump	And we had one Democrat -- was so angry by it that he left the party, became a Republican, which I think is a first time because he left a majority and went in to a minority.
367	Donald Trump	Van Drew.
368	Donald Trump	And it was a whole fake deal.
369	Donald Trump	And everybody knows that.
370	Donald Trump	I made a phone call, it was a perfect phone call, there was nothing wrong with it.
371	Donald Trump	And they said, let's impeach.
372	Donald Trump	Now the real back story is when the phony whistleblower – who's a total phony -- he heard the call supposedly, you know, through somebody -- through the informant.
373	Donald Trump	You notice the way everybody disappeared once -- thank goodness I had a transcriber -- we had more than one.
374	Donald Trump	Thank goodness we had that call transcribed, because the transcripts of the call reveal that it was a perfect call.
375	Donald Trump	By that time they were already talking about impeachment, and they were going by a phony whistleblower rendition of a call that didn't exist.
376	Donald Trump	Just like Adam Schiff, he goes before Congress and he starts talking about eight quid pro quos, and don't call me I'll call you.
377	Donald Trump	Well that's a mob expression.
378	Donald Trump	Don't call me, I'll -- and everybody's saying that's a terrible call.
379	Donald Trump	He made it up -- it was totally made up.
380	Donald Trump	And I said, oh good, we'll sue him, we'll take him down.
381	Donald Trump	And then I find out he's got immunity because he made it in Congress.
382	Donald Trump	It should almost be the opposite.
383	Donald Trump	You should almost have to be more honest if you're in Congress.
384	Donald Trump	[Applause]
385	Bret Baier	Do you think Biden is damaged?
386	Bret Baier	Do you think he's damaged?
387	Donald Trump	I think that Biden has been damaged, yeah.
388	Donald Trump	A lot of people -- I saw a couple of statements, very strong statements by very respected people in your world saying they aimed at Trump, but they took Biden down.
389	Donald Trump	And really that's what happened, when you think.
390	Donald Trump	Because you look at the son -- here's a guy, didn't have a job, was unfortunately, sadly -- the military was a very sad experience for him.
391	Donald Trump	He goes out, he gets $3 million plus $183,000 a month to be a board member of a company that a lot of people said was corrupt.
392	Donald Trump	Worse -- just as bad, China -- I just made a great China deal.
393	Donald Trump	China is paying us billions and billions of dollars because of what I did to them with tariffs.
394	Donald Trump	Billions of dollars -- I mean, to a point where my farmers are in love with me because I took some of that money, gave it to them.
395	Donald Trump	[Applause] But his son walks out of China with a billion and a half dollars for a fund.
396	Donald Trump	Now a billion and a half dollars for a fund, meaning he's going to make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and much more than that.
397	Bret Baier	So you want to face Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, that's my question?
398	Donald Trump	I'll tell you, I was all set for Bernie, because I thought it was going to happen.
399	Donald Trump	And you know how we get ready for things, right?
400	Donald Trump	So mentally I'm all set for Bernie -- communist, I had everything down, he's a -- I was all set.
401	Donald Trump	[Applause] And then we have this crazy thing that happened, right?
402	Donald Trump	On Tuesday which he thought was Thursday.
403	Donald Trump	[Laughter] But he also said 150 million people were killed with guns, and he was running for the United States Senate.
404	Donald Trump	Support me, I'm running for the United States -- there's something going on there.
405	Donald Trump	But I was all set -- I was all set.
406	Donald Trump	And, you know, when I focus and we all focus, sometimes you do well and some people choke.
407	Donald Trump	I watched mini Mike choke.
408	Donald Trump	When mini Mike was hit by a very mean woman, he said get me off this stage -- just get me off.
409	Donald Trump	And that wasn't a pretty sight to be -- but I was all set to take on Bernie.
410	Donald Trump	I was ready, and then all of a sudden they say, guess what.
411	Donald Trump	I went to the first lady, who people love.
412	Donald Trump	I go in to the first lady -- [Applause] -- and I said -- I said, he just won Texas, he just won, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
413	Donald Trump	And by the way, so close.
414	Donald Trump	It was a whole different thing because of her.
415	Donald Trump	So now I'm ready for Bernie, and now all of a sudden I have a whole different -- you know, it's a whole different deal -- two very different people.
416	Donald Trump	I think in a certain way Bernie would be tougher, because he's got a base.
417	Donald Trump	It's a much smaller base than my base.
418	Donald Trump	I think a lot of my people are here because -- and I did nothing to do that -- but we have a lot of support in Pennsylvania.
419	Donald Trump	And I think we have a lot of support everywhere, look at the rallies -- look at the rallies.
420	Donald Trump	[Applause] But I was all set -- I was all set for Bernie, I was ready to go.
421	Donald Trump	And then I say, you know, I don't think I'm running against Bernie, I think it's going to be very hard for him to come back.
422	Bret Baier	We'll cover it.
423	Bret Baier	Many more questions to come -- healthcare, also the economy, immigration.
424	Bret Baier	Please stay with us on this special town hall.
425	Martha MacCallum	We'll be right back.
426	Note	[Commercial Break]
427	Martha MacCallum	Welcome back everybody to our town hall with President Trump.
428	Martha MacCallum	Let's go right to Audrey who has a question for President Trump.
429	Martha MacCallum	Audrey?
430	Martha MacCallum	Right here -- here we go, hi Audrey.
431	Question	Mr. President, thank you -- Pennsylvania thanks you, Bucks County thanks you for everything you're doing for our country.
432	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
433	Question	We look at your energy, and it makes me get up and say, if he can do it, I can definitely get up and do everything I've got to do.
434	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
435	Question	I want to say, Republicans have failed to come up with an alternative plan to Obamacare, how do you plan to rally the Republicans around a plan, and what would be included in that?
436	Donald Trump	Thank you very much, that's a great question and very important -- healthcare, and I think it's probably the thing that I'm most disappointed that I haven't been able to say what a good job we've done.
437	Donald Trump	I haven't been able to tell what a great job we've done.
438	Donald Trump	First of all, I got rid of the individual mandate, which was the worst part of Obamacare.
439	Donald Trump	That's where you paid a fortune not to pay for horrible and -- healthcare and insurance.
440	Donald Trump	And it had a tremendous impact.
441	Donald Trump	Preexisting conditions, 100 percent, we take care of.
442	Donald Trump	But we have many healthcare plans now, where it's 60 percent, even 65 percent less expensive than Obamacare.
443	Donald Trump	It's better than Obamacare.
444	Donald Trump	And what we really have left is the carcass of Obamacare, or you could call it new healthcare, because, without preexisting, without -- without the whole thing with the individual mandate, it's a whole different ball game.
445	Donald Trump	It's a much different -- it's a much different plan.
446	Donald Trump	And what we'd like to do is totally kill it, but come up before we do that with something that's great.
447	Donald Trump	What we have done is, we have really managed Obamacare, the remaining portion -- we got rid of the bad part -- but the remaining portion really well.
448	Donald Trump	And before I got involved, you know what was happening with the rates on Obamacare, they were going up at levels that nobody's ever seen before.
449	Donald Trump	We are managing it.
450	Donald Trump	And I had a decision to make.
451	Donald Trump	This was very important.
452	Donald Trump	I said to my people -- and we have great people -- Seema, Azar, I mean, great people that are so good at it.
453	Donald Trump	I said, you know, I have a little problem.
454	Donald Trump	Do we manage it great until we get something much better?
455	Donald Trump	Or do we manage it poorly, and say, Obamacare is horrible?
456	Donald Trump	And I said, we have got to do the right thing.
457	Donald Trump	We have got to manage it really, really good.
458	Donald Trump	So, it's not great healthcare, but we're managing it fantastically.
459	Donald Trump	And you don't see all those stories about the rates going through the roof anymore because we know what we're doing.
460	Donald Trump	At the same time, we want to get you really fantastic healthcare.
461	Donald Trump	If we can win back the House, we will be able to do that.
462	Donald Trump	We have to win back the House, keep the Senate, keep the White House.
463	Donald Trump	[Applause, Cheering] And we will be able to do it.
464	Donald Trump	Thank you.
465	Donald Trump	Thank you for the question.
466	Donald Trump	[Applause]
467	Martha MacCallum	So, Mr. President, I just want to follow up quickly on that, because the issue of preexisting conditions...
468	Donald Trump	Right.
469	Martha MacCallum	... you say you're going to protect them.
470	Donald Trump	Right.
471	Martha MacCallum	But your administration is also fighting Obamacare in the courts.
472	Martha MacCallum	So how do you -- how do you promise people that you're going to protect them, based on that?
473	Donald Trump	Well, that's what I said.
474	Donald Trump	That's what I said, yes.
475	Donald Trump	We want to terminate Obamacare because it's bad.
476	Donald Trump	Look, we're running it really well, but we know it's defective.
477	Donald Trump	It's very defective.
478	Donald Trump	We got rid of the worst part.
479	Donald Trump	And that was a very important thing.
480	Donald Trump	Getting rid of the individual mandate was a very important thing.
481	Donald Trump	But we -- we want to get something.
482	Donald Trump	If we can get the House, you will have the best healthcare and health insurance anywhere on the planet.
483	Donald Trump	But we have to get the House back.
484	Donald Trump	Now, that means we have to hold the Senate, we have to get the House, we have to obviously keep the White House.
485	Donald Trump	But what we're doing is managing it really well.
486	Donald Trump	Now, it's a case, it's called Texas versus -- you understand, it's Texas is suing.
487	Donald Trump	They want to terminate it.
488	Donald Trump	But everybody there is also saying and everybody -- we have our great senator from Pennsylvania.
489	Donald Trump	Thank you very much, Pat, for being here.
490	Donald Trump	[Applause] And -- and Pat Toomey.
491	Donald Trump	And -- but very important.
492	Donald Trump	And our -- by the way, our great congressmen, I have to say they were warriors, right, real warriors in terms of the fake impeachment, I will tell you that.
493	Donald Trump	[Applause] But -- so Texas is trying -- and it's Texas and many states.
494	Donald Trump	They're trying to terminate.
495	Donald Trump	But they want to put something that's much better.
496	Donald Trump	They're terminating it to put much better.
497	Donald Trump	And they have all pledged that preexisting conditions 100 percent taken care of.
498	Bret Baier	Immigration.
499	Donald Trump	Thank you.
500	Bret Baier	The next question is from Jennifer.
501	Bret Baier	And she has a question about this issue.
502	Donald Trump	Hi.
503	Question	Hi.
504	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.
505	Question	This is truly an honor and one of the best days of my life.
506	Question	Just don't tell my husband.
507	Donald Trump	Wow.
508	Donald Trump	[Laughter]
509	Question	And I want to know, how are you going to control the illegal immigration without support from the Democratic Party?
510	Donald Trump	Well, you know, it's been hard, but we have done it incredibly.
511	Donald Trump	It could have been -- we have things called loopholes.
512	Donald Trump	And the loopholes are terrible, like lottery, where you give lotteries.
513	Donald Trump	They pick lotteries, and they have people coming into our country.
514	Donald Trump	We have ended catch and release.
515	Donald Trump	We have right now 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border, saying that, if they don't do that, we're going to have to be very tough on Mexico.
516	Donald Trump	And they're doing it, because our soldiers aren't allowed to be there for a lot of reasons.
517	Donald Trump	And we're very politically correct as a nation.
518	Donald Trump	Mexico perhaps is slightly less politically correct.
519	Donald Trump	And we have the best numbers that we have had in many, many months.
520	Donald Trump	We have had -- I guess it's now nine or 10 months where the numbers are way down.
521	Donald Trump	And we can keep them down.
522	Donald Trump	But we need the wall.
523	Donald Trump	And, most importantly, the wall is way under construction.
524	Donald Trump	We're up to 129 miles already.
525	Donald Trump	Where we have a wall, by the way, nobody's coming through, practically nobody.
526	Donald Trump	We will have, by early next year, almost 500 miles of wall.
527	Donald Trump	And once we have that wall, it's going to stop drugs.
528	Donald Trump	[Applause, Cheering] It's going to stop big percentages of everything coming in, OK?
529	Donald Trump	[Applause] And we're really, really doing a job.
530	Donald Trump	And, by the way, it's very important, because I could have done a much less expensive version.
531	Donald Trump	I could have done a much easier version, but a version that people would get over very easily.
532	Donald Trump	You have seen the people that get caught on top.
533	Donald Trump	It's very high and very powerful.
534	Donald Trump	We are building exactly what border control -- what the Border Patrol wanted.
535	Donald Trump	They wanted a very specific wall.
536	Donald Trump	You had to be able to see through it to the other side.
537	Donald Trump	You want to see where the people -- I thought -- before I got involved, I said, I can build just a nice concrete plank wall, throw it up.
538	Donald Trump	That would be no good.
539	Donald Trump	It wouldn't work.
540	Donald Trump	We built the wall that everybody has been dreaming about in terms of law enforcement for many years.
541	Donald Trump	So, we're up to 129 miles.
542	Donald Trump	We will be at 500 miles in a very short distance.
543	Donald Trump	It's really moving up quickly.
544	Donald Trump	It's a big difference.
545	Donald Trump	Thank you.
546	Donald Trump	[Applause]
547	Bret Baier	A lot of questions, a lot of questions, by the way, about the wall.
548	Bret Baier	Also a lot of questions, Mr. President, about the national debt.
549	Bret Baier	Since being president, you have signed into law $4.7 trillion of debt, including $2.1 trillion of discretionary spending.
550	Bret Baier	I understand that you're spending on the military as well.
551	Donald Trump	That's right.
552	Bret Baier	When you ran for president, at one point, you said that you would pay off the debt within eight years.
553	Bret Baier	So now we're about four years in, and the debt is up $3.5 trillion.
554	Bret Baier	That's about 18 percent.
555	Bret Baier	Republicans and Democrats obviously are not talking about the national debt a lot on Capitol Hill or on the campaign trail.
556	Bret Baier	So, do you...
557	Donald Trump	But I talk about it.
558	Bret Baier	Do you care about the national debt?
559	Donald Trump	I do, very much.
560	Donald Trump	And I will always talk about it, because, to me, it's very important.
561	Donald Trump	Now, the good thing about the debt is, we're paying very little interest, almost nothing.
562	Donald Trump	This is a great interest climate.
563	Donald Trump	In fact, I want to refinance the debt.
564	Donald Trump	But I had to fix the military.
565	Donald Trump	The military was depleted.
566	Donald Trump	[Applause, Cheering] I had to fix the military.
567	Donald Trump	It's one thing to say -- it's one thing to say, gee, we did a good job on the debt, or, gee, we did a good job on the budget, and you have people from other countries running up the White House lawn, you know?
568	Donald Trump	Maybe they took over our country, but I did one hell of a job on the budget, right?
569	Donald Trump	No.
570	Donald Trump	I had to fix the military, $2.5 trillion.
571	Donald Trump	We had to do other things.
572	Donald Trump	The country, when I took it over, was in very bad shape.
573	Donald Trump	Remember this.
574	Donald Trump	President Obama had -- he more than doubled -- he put more debt on than all of the other presidents of the United States combined.
575	Donald Trump	Combine all the debt of every other president.
576	Donald Trump	And I took it over.
577	Donald Trump	We had 20 -- we had $20 trillion worth of debt on the country, and actually more than that.
578	Donald Trump	But he -- and we had a lot of commitments for other things.
579	Donald Trump	And on top of it, you know, it's one thing you take over something, and you have debt.
580	Donald Trump	You have a building, you have debt.
581	Donald Trump	But the building is fixed up.
582	Donald Trump	The country was a mess.
583	Donald Trump	We were in all these wars all over the place.
584	Bret Baier	So, this would be a focus of a second term?
585	Donald Trump	Oh, absolutely.
586	Donald Trump	But when the trade deals kick in -- now, again, we were disturbed by what's going on with the virus, but that's going to be fine, and everybody -- it's going to be fine.
587	Donald Trump	But that was a disturbance.
588	Donald Trump	But I will say this, we -- when these -- when these trade deals kick in, and when all -- you know, the economy is the best economy we have ever had.
589	Donald Trump	It's nothing compared to what it's going to be when the trade deals kick in.
590	Donald Trump	[Applause]
591	Martha MacCallum	But if you -- if you don't cut something in entitlements, you will never really deal with the debt.
592	Donald Trump	Oh, we will be cutting, but we're also going to have growth like you have never had before.
593	Donald Trump	We have never had growth like we're experiencing.
594	Donald Trump	We will be experiencing, when they kick in -- China, as an example, they didn't do anything with us.
595	Donald Trump	They're now spending $250 billion a year.
596	Donald Trump	And that's only for phase one.
597	Donald Trump	Phase two is going to be even more so.
598	Donald Trump	It's $250 billion.
599	Donald Trump	I just made a deal with Japan, where they're paying $40 billion.
600	Donald Trump	They never gave us anything.
601	Donald Trump	All they do is sell us cars for no tax coming into the -- to the country.
602	Donald Trump	South Korea, you know I have made a deal.
603	Donald Trump	And then I made the USMCA deal with Canada and Mexico, replacing the worst deal, which was made by -- by the way, which was made by Joe, OK?
604	Donald Trump	I didn't want to say sleepy Joe, because I want to be respected.
605	Donald Trump	I want to -- I want to respect him.
606	Donald Trump	[Laughter]
607	Bret Baier	But you got it in there anyway.
608	Donald Trump	He looks like he's going to be a candidate.
609	Donald Trump	And I just say, how did that happen?
610	Donald Trump	[Laughter] So -- but, no, Joe Biden -- in all fairness, Joe Biden made a deal, NAFTA.
611	Donald Trump	He approved it.
612	Donald Trump	He was pushing it.
613	Donald Trump	It's the worst trade deal ever made.
614	Donald Trump	We're terminating NAFTA.
615	Donald Trump	We have the USMCA.
616	Donald Trump	China -- if we look at what happened, between China and Mexico and Canada, what they were doing to this country, how they were taking advantage of us, they were -- Canada was charging us 300 percent tariffs.
617	Donald Trump	Now we have it really in good shape.
618	Martha MacCallum	All right.
619	Martha MacCallum	[Applause]
620	Bret Baier	Mr. President, turning to foreign policy, John Sullivan has a question.
621	Bret Baier	John?
622	Bret Baier	There you are.
623	Question	Hi, Mr. President.
624	Question	Thanks for coming to Pennsylvania tonight.
625	Donald Trump	Thank you.
626	Question	So my question is, ever since you have taken office in January 2017, North Korea has been in the news, and it's on the minds of many Americans and...
627	Donald Trump	Yes.
628	Question	... just like myself.
629	Question	So, if you're elected again this year, what's your plan moving forward with what you have already done with North Korea?
630	Donald Trump	I don't think it's on the minds of too many Americans, to be honest with you, but it certainly -- it should be, OK?
631	Donald Trump	And it's good that it's on your mind, because it's big stuff.
632	Donald Trump	And they do have a lot of power, a lot of nuclear power.
633	Donald Trump	So I don't take credit for this.
634	Donald Trump	And maybe I should, maybe I shouldn't.
635	Donald Trump	But when I became president, I was told by President Obama, sitting in the Oval Office, in our -- probably our only meeting, essentially.
636	Donald Trump	You know, that was enough for me.
637	Donald Trump	[Laughter] But I was told...
638	Bret Baier	And you haven't talked to him since?
639	Donald Trump	I was at the funeral of President Bush, sat next to him.
640	Donald Trump	And I said, hello.
641	Donald Trump	And then I said, goodbye.
642	Donald Trump	[Laughter] That's about -- that's about it.
643	Donald Trump	No, I didn't like the -- I don't -- I didn't like the job he did.
644	Donald Trump	I didn't like the job that he and Biden did.
645	Donald Trump	I didn't like the position they put us in.
646	Donald Trump	I didn't like what he did to our military.
647	Donald Trump	Our military -- we didn't even have a military.
648	Donald Trump	Our military was so depleted.
649	Donald Trump	[Applause] And I tell the story.
650	Donald Trump	And I hate to tell it, because it's embarrassing, but, right now, we have more ammunition than we have ever had.
651	Donald Trump	It's all over the place.
652	Donald Trump	[Applause] But when I -- when I -- we were having difficulty with a certain country.
653	Donald Trump	Remember, Donald Trump is going to start a war right away?
654	Donald Trump	Well, here it is, we're almost four years out.
655	Donald Trump	There's been no war, and we're respected again.
656	Donald Trump	But I was told by a general, sir, please don't do that.
657	Donald Trump	Why?
658	Donald Trump	We have no ammunition.
659	Donald Trump	This is the condition we were left in.
660	Donald Trump	When you look at so many different problems that we were left, I mean -- and with countries.
661	Donald Trump	But he said, the biggest problem we have is North Korea.
662	Donald Trump	That's what you're alluding to.
663	Donald Trump	And I have a good relationship with him.
664	Donald Trump	I said, did you ever call him?
665	Donald Trump	The answer is, yes, he did.
666	Donald Trump	But I will tell you, I don't think they admit that.
667	Donald Trump	Maybe they do, but called many times.
668	Donald Trump	And Kim Jong-un didn't want to talk to him.
669	Donald Trump	And me, he wanted to talk to.
670	Donald Trump	And we met in Singapore.
671	Donald Trump	And we met in Vietnam.
672	Donald Trump	And I also went to the border, first person ever to walk over from -- et cetera, et cetera.
673	Donald Trump	[Applause] And we had -- we have a very good relationship, understanding.
674	Donald Trump	Let's see what happens.
675	Donald Trump	But, you know, the pundits say, isn't it terrible, what he's done?
676	Donald Trump	He's given -- I gave nothing.
677	Donald Trump	I gave nothing.
678	Donald Trump	The sanctions are on.
679	Donald Trump	They want to see if they can do something.
680	Donald Trump	But I haven't given anything.
681	Donald Trump	If the other side got in, you would right now be in a big war with North Korea.
682	Donald Trump	Maybe it would be over by now, but you would right -- almost immediately, you would have started.
683	Donald Trump	And if you remember the rhetoric at the beginning, that was very tough rhetoric.
684	Donald Trump	But that rhetoric got us to a place.
685	Donald Trump	And the Olympics became successful because of me in South Korea, because, all of a sudden, they called.
686	Donald Trump	They said, we would like to be -- participate.
687	Donald Trump	They didn't sell any tickets, because nobody wanted to go to the Olympics.
688	Donald Trump	All of a sudden, North Korea calls up and says, we want to be a participant in the Olympics.
689	Donald Trump	Everybody fell off their seat.
690	Donald Trump	That was because of me.
691	Donald Trump	And, by the way, the president of South Korea gives total credit for that.
692	Donald Trump	So, it became successful.
693	Donald Trump	The bottom line is, I have a very good relationship with him.
694	Donald Trump	I cannot guarantee anything, but, for three years, we have spent nothing.
695	Donald Trump	We're getting sanctions, and we're not in war with North Korea, which is not bad.
696	Donald Trump	[Applause]
697	Bret Baier	All right, Mr. President, thank you.
698	Donald Trump	Thank you.
699	Martha MacCallum	We're going to take a quick break, squeeze one break in here.
700	Martha MacCallum	And when we come back, we're going to have more questions from the audience.
701	Martha MacCallum	And then we will have a lightning round for President Trump.
702	Martha MacCallum	[Applause]
703	Note	[Commercial Break]
704	Bret Baier	Welcome back to our town hall with President Trump in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
705	Bret Baier	We want to continue with foreign policy for a couple questions.
706	Bret Baier	You talked this week to the leader of the Taliban.
707	Donald Trump	I did.
708	Bret Baier	And you said it was a good conversation, in which you said you both didn't want violence.
709	Bret Baier	However, on that same day, the Taliban launched some 50 attacks in Afghanistan, 40 of them in one province.
710	Bret Baier	There are many Americans really wondering -- and the U.S. struck back against the Taliban.
711	Bret Baier	There are many Americans wondering -- [Crosstalk]
712	Donald Trump	-- very powerful.
713	Bret Baier	-- where the peace part of the Peace Plan is, and can you trust the Taliban?
714	Donald Trump	So these are warriors.
715	Donald Trump	We've been there for 20 years.
716	Donald Trump	We're really serving more as a law enforcement group than a military group.
717	Donald Trump	We could win that war very easily but I don't feel like killing millions of people in order to do it.
718	Donald Trump	We don't want to do that, you don't want to do that, nobody wants to do that.
719	Donald Trump	People are tired, even the biggest hawks are tired of being there.
720	Donald Trump	I had a very good conversation with him.
721	Donald Trump	There was a group that formed.
722	Donald Trump	And again, you know they have many tribes and they have many different -- it's hard for one -- there's not like perfectly one control.
723	Donald Trump	I spoke to a certain man who is the leader, but the leader has not -- it's not the easiest leadership position.
724	Bret Baier	Structure.
725	Donald Trump	And the structure is you know tribes all over the place.
726	Donald Trump	A tribe formed and a -- a group formed that was going to attack certain soldiers -- Afghan soldiers.
727	Donald Trump	And the military heard about it, and the military went and they took them out.
728	Donald Trump	That was it.
729	Donald Trump	I believe they really want to make a deal.
730	Donald Trump	I think after 19 -- actually going very close to 20 years, they're also tired of fighting, believe it or not.
731	Donald Trump	But they are warriors, and they are fighters and that's what they've done for a thousand years.
732	Donald Trump	You know just ask -- ask the Soviet Union, which became Russia because of Afghanistan.
733	Donald Trump	You know, it's a tough place.
734	Martha MacCallum	So given that, you have said that you want to, you know, end this.
735	Martha MacCallum	It's gone on for a long time.
736	Martha MacCallum	But what about the conditions on the ground, because, you know, General Mattis had a disagreement with you about pulling troops out of Syria and Afghanistan.
737	Martha MacCallum	If your generals tell you --
738	Donald Trump	Well, I was right.
739	Donald Trump	I was so right.
740	Martha MacCallum	If the generals say to you, Mr. President, we need more people not fewer people right now.
741	Martha MacCallum	What will you do?
742	Donald Trump	Well, Mattis said that, and I gave him more people for a short period of time and it didn't work out, and what we were doing is policing in -- [Crosstalk]
743	Bret Baier	But now with Afghanistan.
744	Donald Trump	-- Afghanistan.
745	Donald Trump	As far as Syria, I did pull them out.
746	Donald Trump	I pulled them out.
747	Donald Trump	We were -- we were securing the border between Turkey and Syria.
748	Donald Trump	I said why are we doing that?
749	Donald Trump	Turkey is big, Syria is fine; let them fight their own battles.
750	Donald Trump	What are we doing with our soldiers?
751	Donald Trump	Getting people killed.
752	Donald Trump	[Applause] Now, the one thing -- when I came in ISIS was all over Syria, all over Iraq.
753	Donald Trump	And we don't want them coming to us, and it was a mess.
754	Donald Trump	You understand that very well.
755	Donald Trump	And I knocked out 100 percent of the -- of the territorial caliphate.
756	Donald Trump	100 percent.
757	Donald Trump	We knocked the whole thing out -- [Crosstalk]
758	Martha MacCallum	But what about Afghanistan?
759	Donald Trump	No.
760	Donald Trump	But -- but just so you understand.
761	Donald Trump	So we knocked out the ISIS caliphate in vast amounts of the Middle East, and I did that fairly quickly when I came.
762	Donald Trump	Again, President Obama, it was all over the place.
763	Donald Trump	When I say we're not doing the borders, we did leave soldiers.
764	Donald Trump	We left soldiers because I kept the oil.
765	Donald Trump	And I was always against Iraq -- going into Iraq.
766	Donald Trump	I think it was one of the worst -- maybe the worst decision ever made.
767	Donald Trump	But I used to say, once they were in there, keep the oil.
768	Donald Trump	They never kept the oil.
769	Donald Trump	We have an oil area in -- near Syria and in Syria, we kept it.
770	Donald Trump	So the only soldiers I have over there, they're guarding the oil.
771	Donald Trump	We kept the oil.
772	Donald Trump	So we kept the treasure.
773	Donald Trump	That's OK.
774	Martha MacCallum	But if it takes more troops to keep the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, is that something you would be willing to do or no?
775	Donald Trump	Well, you know, there's a big question about the government of Afghanistan.
776	Donald Trump	There's a big question about that whole situation in Afghanistan.
777	Donald Trump	We're getting along very well with everybody.
778	Donald Trump	We have to get our people back home.
779	Donald Trump	It's not fair.
780	Donald Trump	We're a police force over there.
781	Donald Trump	We're maintaining things.
782	Donald Trump	Eventually we have to leave.
783	Donald Trump	We don't want to stay there for another 20 years.
784	Donald Trump	We don't want to stay there for 100 years.
785	Donald Trump	We want our people to come back home.
786	Donald Trump	[Applause]
787	Bret Baier	All right.
788	Bret Baier	Lynette has our next question from the audience about division really in politics.
789	Bret Baier	Lynette.
790	Question	I'm sorry.
791	Bret Baier	There you go.
792	Donald Trump	Hi, Lynette.
793	Question	Hi, President Trump.
794	Question	I'm so happy to have you here.
795	Donald Trump	Thank you.
796	Question	From the day you came down the escalator in Trump Towers I was on the Trump train.
797	Donald Trump	I like that.
798	Donald Trump	[Applause] I like you too.
799	Donald Trump	Thank you.
800	Question	And I -- I proudly wear my Trump pin every day of my life.
801	Donald Trump	Thank you.
802	Donald Trump	Great honor.
803	Question	My question is, we are so divided as a country.
804	Question	I have family members who do not speak to me and recently was told, if you support Trump you are no longer part of my life.
805	Question	How are you going to bring us together?
806	Donald Trump	So I -- I gave an answer before, success, but it's really a little bit more than that, because we've had great success, and there is a division, there's no question about it.
807	Donald Trump	Politicians have to be able to be civil.
808	Donald Trump	If they're not, you have to fight back.
809	Donald Trump	You have to.
810	Donald Trump	Otherwise we're not going to be -- there's a -- there's a movement on, and I call them the radical left Democrats, and it really is the radical left, because we have plenty of Democrats that are terrific and they want to see -- you know, let's get together, let's get things done.
811	Donald Trump	There's so many things we could do.
812	Donald Trump	We've done a lot.
813	Donald Trump	We've done more than any administration in three years in the history of our country for the first three years.
814	Donald Trump	And I say it all the time and the press doesn't even dispute me and they would do that.
815	Donald Trump	But we could do even so much more.
816	Donald Trump	We talked about a great question on the border and the border question's true, but we should get rid of the loopholes.
817	Donald Trump	You can't do that without Democrat votes.
818	Donald Trump	I really believe we're going to win this next election, and when we do the other side's going to say, OK that's it, let's get along.
819	Donald Trump	I really believe that.
820	Donald Trump	But we have to win the election.
821	Donald Trump	Good question.
822	Donald Trump	[Applause]
823	Bret Baier	All right.
824	Bret Baier	Mr. President, we're going to do a quick lightning round here.
825	Bret Baier	Short questions, short answers ideally.
826	Bret Baier	This one goes back to coronavirus in the beginning.
827	Bret Baier	You are a self proclaimed germaphobe.
828	Bret Baier	In the campaign, before the campaign, you didn't like to shake hands.
829	Bret Baier	You changed that.
830	Bret Baier	What do doctors --
831	Donald Trump	Well, I'm not thrilled.
832	Donald Trump	[Laughter]
833	Bret Baier	Yes, yes.
834	Bret Baier	You're not thrilled.
835	Bret Baier	What do doctors tell you?
836	Bret Baier	Have you changed anything in the way that you operate?
837	Donald Trump	So yes, it's a great question, because I've always felt, you know, I don't know from the time I was a young guy I -- you know, I always felt the concept wasn't good, and then you'd read a lot of medical reports, it's not good.
838	Donald Trump	Now especially they're saying -- by the way, if there was ever a time that you could convince people not to shake hands, this could be it.
839	Donald Trump	OK.
840	Donald Trump	This could be it.
841	Donald Trump	[Crosstalk]
842	Bret Baier	So do an elbow or fist bump.
843	Donald Trump	But you know what I did -- you know what I did, I really -- I love the people of this country.
844	Donald Trump	You can't be a politician and not shake hands.
845	Donald Trump	People come in -- when I leave I'll be shaking hands with people.
846	Donald Trump	They want to shake your hand.
847	Donald Trump	They want to say hello.
848	Donald Trump	They want to hug you, they want to kiss you.
849	Donald Trump	I don't care.
850	Donald Trump	It doesn't -- you have to do that.
851	Donald Trump	If I went around, no, I don't shake -- can you imagine?
852	Donald Trump	I'm going to speak with a group of people and they like Trump and they come up; sir, thank you very -- I don't shake hands.
853	Donald Trump	It's over.
854	Donald Trump	I don't care how nicely you say it.
855	Donald Trump	The bottom line is I shake anybody's hand now.
856	Donald Trump	I'm proud of it.
857	Donald Trump	They're people that I love.
858	Donald Trump	They're people that I want to take care of.
859	Donald Trump	Now the concept of shaking hands since this -- you know, you're hearing a lot of stuff about trying not to shake hands.
860	Donald Trump	It hasn't stopped me at all but it is -- it is a little bit of a problem.
861	Donald Trump	But I got over it.
862	Bret Baier	-- two weeks.
863	Donald Trump	Well, I was kidding.
864	Donald Trump	You know you're not supposed to -- I heard the other day you're not supposed to touch your face.
865	Donald Trump	So I went on camera and I said listen, I haven't touched my face in weeks.
866	Donald Trump	Now, obviously I'm kidding.
867	Donald Trump	I said and I miss my face.
868	Donald Trump	And one of the networks said he said he didn't touch his face and they show pictures.
869	Donald Trump	So I don't know.
870	Donald Trump	These people.
871	Martha MacCallum	So you have -- you have said, you know, about being president, I didn't have to do this, you wanted to do it.
872	Martha MacCallum	What about your old life?
873	Martha MacCallum	Is there any little thing that you miss about your old life?
874	Donald Trump	I loved my old life.
875	Donald Trump	The day before I announced I was running for president that was the best period ever of my life.
876	Donald Trump	My company was the strongest it ever was, especially, you know, being in development and do real estate all over the world.
877	Donald Trump	I built a great company, but it was the strongest, because you have times when the markets go bad and then you have to fight and then the markets are good and you're doing great.
878	Donald Trump	It was the strongest period of my life.
879	Donald Trump	It was sort of the best period of my entire life.
880	Donald Trump	And then I announced I was going to run for president.
881	Donald Trump	And you know the greatest day of your life, they say, is the day before you announce you're running for president.
882	Donald Trump	I don't know if anybody's ever heard that but they do say that about people.
883	Donald Trump	But in my case I won.
884	Donald Trump	You know I won.
885	Donald Trump	I saw as an example they were using numbers and they were saying how much various people spent to become president.
886	Donald Trump	And Bloomberg spent like $550 million.
887	Donald Trump	It was in of all places "The New York Times."
888	Donald Trump	And this guy, Steyer, we call him impeachment Tom.
889	Donald Trump	How did that work out?
890	Donald Trump	Not too good.
891	Donald Trump	Tom Steyer spent $250 million.
892	Donald Trump	Another one -- another one -- I know Steve Forbes spent a lot.
893	Donald Trump	A lot of people spent a lot of money and I was sort of in the middle.
894	Donald Trump	In fact this is your own money, I spent $70 million.
895	Donald Trump	And they said lost, lost, lost, lost, lost.
896	Donald Trump	Donald Trump became president of the United States, lost, lost -- and I said isn't that cool.
897	Donald Trump	Isn't that cool.
898	Donald Trump	[Applause] You know.
899	Donald Trump	So, I love it.
900	Donald Trump	You know why I love it, because we are doing more than anybody can imagine.
901	Donald Trump	Even Right to Try.
902	Donald Trump	For years they wanted to have Right to Try, where we can use our medicines if somebody is terminally ill.
903	Donald Trump	So many things we're doing --
904	Martha MacCallum	But is there any little thing that you miss?
905	Martha MacCallum	You know, I mean -- I remember Michelle Obama said she missed, you know, sort of going shopping or walking down the aisles.
906	Martha MacCallum	I mean is there anything that you can't do now that you --
907	Donald Trump	Well, yes.
908	Donald Trump	I mean I can't walk down the street now, before I could.
909	Donald Trump	I was well known, and we had a very successful business, and even my show turned out to be a success.
910	Donald Trump	I had many top best sellers of things, you know.
911	Martha MacCallum	You were used to that.
912	Martha MacCallum	Yes.
913	Donald Trump	But -- but I could walk down the street, and I could actually walk into a store and it was, you know, fine.
914	Donald Trump	It was not like some nobody knew me, but it -- now, today if I ever suggested that to Secret Service -- you know, I think I'm going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue and let's go shopping.
915	Donald Trump	[Laughter] So it's a lot different.
916	Donald Trump	So -- so I -- I do miss that.
917	Donald Trump	I miss that sort of free life.
918	Donald Trump	This is not a free life.
919	Donald Trump	But I love what we're doing because we're accomplishing more than anybody's ever -- I'm viewing it as we're saving this country.
920	Donald Trump	This country was going wrong.
921	Donald Trump	[Applause]
922	Bret Baier	Mr. President, very last question.
923	Bret Baier	Who -- who is your closest friend in Washington?
924	Donald Trump	Well, I don't want to say because I have a lot of close friends, I really do.
925	Donald Trump	You know I'm putting everybody in this fight.
926	Donald Trump	I get along great with our vice president.
927	Donald Trump	I keep hearing I'm replacing him.
928	Donald Trump	He's doing a phenomenal job.
929	Donald Trump	He's a great guy and a loyal guy, and he works so hard.
930	Donald Trump	Every day I read he's going to put this one, he's going to put that one, he's going to put -- if I did that would be a great act of disloyalty because he's been great.
931	Donald Trump	I speak to him a lot.
932	Donald Trump	But I speak to all of the senators a lot.
933	Donald Trump	I speak to all of the congressmen a lot.
934	Donald Trump	We have great people in Washington.
935	Donald Trump	And you have great Democrats too.
936	Donald Trump	I mean I speak to Democrats also, believe it or not.
937	Donald Trump	But we have great, great people in Washington, very smart people in Washington.
938	Donald Trump	And it's going to come together.
939	Donald Trump	It's going to come together, and it's going to be sooner than you think.
940	Donald Trump	[Applause]
941	Bret Baier	President Trump, we thank you very much.
942	Bret Baier	And thank you to our audience.
943	Martha MacCallum	Yes.
944	Martha MacCallum	Thank you very much, President Trump.
945	Martha MacCallum	Good to have you here tonight.
946	Bret Baier	I'll be back tomorrow for "Special Report."
947	Martha MacCallum	Great to have you with us.
948	Martha MacCallum	Thank you very much.
949	Bret Baier	Martha is on the other side of the break.
950	Martha MacCallum	So we're going to do "The Story" up on the balcony right after the break.
951	Martha MacCallum	So stick around for more.
952	Martha MacCallum	Thanks everyone.
953	Bret Baier	Good night everyone.
954	Martha MacCallum	Good night everyone.
955	Bret Baier	Thank you very much.
956	Martha MacCallum	Thank you very much.
