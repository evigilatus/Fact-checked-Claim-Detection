Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did,\" he said. \"My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy, but from all that we've seen and heard, they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly.\"\n\nObama then went through a long list of complaints about Romney\u2019s foreign policy views, including this one: \"My opponent said it was \u2018tragic\u2019 to end the war in Iraq.\"\n\nPolitiFact is evaluating other claims from Obama\u2019s speech. Here, we wondered if Obama correctly quoted Romney as saying it was \"tragic\" to end the war in Iraq.\n\nBack in October 2011, Obama announced that all troops would leave by the end of the year. Obama had always intended to draw down forces in Iraq, but by the end of 2011, the administration couldn\u2019t reach an agreement with the Iraqi government on the size of the residual force. In the final days leading up \u00a0to withdrawal, the U.S. had about 200 members remaining that operate within the American Embassy, the New York Times wrote.\n\nRomney criticized the withdrawal as too hasty, making comments at a roundtable discussion with veterans on Veterans Day in 2011 at a South Carolina barbecue restaurant. A colonel asked Romney how he would handle the influx of soldiers returning home from Iraq in need of jobs, according to a transcript of the event.\n\nRomney called Obama\u2019s troop removal \"an enormous mistake,\" \"a failing,\" and yes, \"tragic.\"\n\nHis complete response: \"Yeah. A couple of things. One, you probably know that it is my view that the withdrawal of all of our troops from Iraq by the end of this year is an enormous mistake and a failing by the Obama administration. Secretary Panetta and others had indicated they were working to put in place a Status of Forces Agreement to maintain our presence there, so that we could most effectively transition to the Iraqi military and Iraqi security forces providing security for their country.\n\n\"The precipitous withdrawal is unfortunate. It's more than unfortunate. I think it's tragic. It puts at risk many of the victories that were hard-won by the men and women who have served there. I hope the risk is not realized. I hope instead that the Iraqis are able to pick up the baton, and despite the fact that we will have walked away on a too-rapid basis.\"\n\nFrom there, Romney moved on to the issue of jobless veterans (and even praised an Obama initiative to give businesses who hire veterans a tax credit).\n\nBy this point, Romney\u2019s disdain for Obama\u2019s Iraq war policy was known for a few weeks. His campaign issued a biting statement when Obama announced his plan to withdraw all troops from Iraq by the end of 2011.\n\n\"President Obama\u2019s astonishing failure to secure an orderly transition in Iraq has unnecessarily put at risk the victories that were won through the blood and sacrifice of thousands of American men and women,\" Romney wrote on Oct. 21, 2011. \"The unavoidable question is whether this decision is the result of a naked political calculation or simply sheer ineptitude in negotiations with the Iraqi government.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign countered that Romney lacked a plan to end the war.\n\nRomney\u2019s current campaign website is vague on plans for Iraq. He buries the issue in a topics page about the Middle East, praising George W. Bush\u2019s 2007 \"surge\" of troops and bashing Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal deadline. He makes a reference to reports from field commanders who \"recommended a 14,000 to 18,000-strong residual force as the minimum necessary to carry out our transition mission.\"\n\n\"In light of these developments, it is impossible to forecast what conditions in Iraq will confront the next American president in January 2013,\" Romney states on his website.\n\nWe contacted both campaigns for our report. The Obama campaign pointed us to Romney\u2019s remarks at the veterans\u2019 roundtable. Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said Obama took Romney\u2019s quote \"completely out of context.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAccording to Obama, Romney \"said it was \u2018tragic\u2019 to end the war in Iraq.\" Romney characterized Obama\u2019s 2011 removal of troops from the country with that word, but he was talking about the pace of the drawdown.\n\nRomney\u2019s point, held by other Republicans, was that Obama\u2019s drawdown happened too quickly and would lead to an unstable transition for Iraq. Romney has said conditions in Iraq are difficult to forecast and he would prefer a larger transitional force.\n\nWe rate this claim Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlenn Beck\n\n\nstated on March 18, 2011 in comments on his Fox News show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Allen West helped thwart a terrorist plot by shooting a gun in the direction of an Iraqi detainee, then reported the incident to his superior and said it was wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 March 23, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election.
