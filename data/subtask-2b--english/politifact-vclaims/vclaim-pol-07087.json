Mark Warner tags Republican challenger Ed Gillespie as \"million dollar lobbyist\" and links him to a notorious client.\n\"His firm even lobbied for five foreign governments, including a dictator now awaiting trial for war crimes,\" narrator says.\nWe decided to take a look.\nThe dictator\nAlthough the ad doesn\u2019t name the dictator, it leaves no doubt of his identity. The screen flashes an Ivory Coast flag and a headline from the Daily Mail in England on April 12, 2011 saying \"Defiant dictator arrested.\" That article detailed the overthrow and capture of Laurent Gbagbo, who had ruled the Ivory Coast since 2000 and is now awaiting trial before the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\nThe West African nation faced violent division during Gbagbo\u2019s reign and for years, the ruler resisted international pressure to stand for reelection. \u00a0\nGillespie, meanwhile, co-founded his lobbying firm in 2000 with Democrat Jack Quinn, a former chief of staff to Vice President Al Gore. On Nov. 10, 2004, Quinn Gillespie and Associates signed a six-month contract, worth $510,000, with the Ivory Coast to improve the nation\u2019s relations with the United States. Among other things, the firm agreed to organize a visit to Washington for Gbagbo and meetings with U.S. leaders.\nYou won\u2019t find Gillespie\u2019s signature on the contract, however. That\u2019s because he was absent from the firm for almost two years when the contract was signed, according to Paul Logan, Gillespie\u2019s campaign spokesman. Logan said Gillespie went on leave in January 2003 to serve as chairman of the Republican National Committee and didn\u2019t return until March 2005. The contract and the firm\u2019s subsequent federal disclosure that it was representing a foreign agent was signed by Quinn.\nThe firm\u2019s work for Gbagbo started Dec. 22, 2004 and ended June 30, 2005, according to a disclosure statement it filed with the U.S. Department of Justice. Jeffrey Connaughton, then vice chairman of Quinn Gillespie, told The New Yorker in 2012 that firm was hoping to demonstrate that Gbagbo was willing to have free and fair elections. Those hopes soured, the article said, when Connaughton flew to the Ivory Coast, met with Gbagbo, and concluded the leader \"had no interest in democracy -- he just wanted P.R.\"\nConnaughton sent us a statement, which he also gave to The Washington Post, saying Gillespie made it \"clear\" when the firm started that he would not represent foreign governments. \"He was at the RNC when I decided to take the lead on Ivory Coast, so if anyone had checked with (the firm) or me, we would have confirmed that Ed had absolutely nothing to do with it.\"\nGbagbo finally agreed to hold elections in November 2010, but lost to Alassane Ouattara, refused to give up power and ignited a civil war. Gbagbo was arrested in May when French and rebel forces took control of the capital, Abidjan. He has been sent to The Hague, where International Criminal Court has charged him with four counts of being an indirect co-perpetrator of violent acts committed his troops. Human Rights Watch estimates at least 3,000 people were killed and 150 women were raped during the six-month crisis.\nOther nations\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarner\u2019s ad also flashes the flags of four other countries it says Gillespie\u2019s firm represented. David Turner, Warner\u2019s campaign spokesman, backed the claim by sending us Quinn Gillespie disclosure forms. They showed the company worked for:\n\n\nPakistan from April 2006 to April 2008\n\n\nCosta Rica from a few weeks near the end of 2006\n\n\nMacedonia from April 2007 to April 2008\n\n\nBosnian Serb Republic from January 2007 through December 2007\n\n\nThe firm reported earning a total of $3 million from all five nations. For perspective, Quinn Gillespie was paid $52.3 million by domestic clients from 2006 to 2008, according OpenSecrets.org. The payments from foreign nations came to 5.4 percent of the firm\u2019s revenues during the three years.\nGillespie says he\u2019s never personally lobbied for a foreign government and the records back him up. Disclosure forms filed by the firm do not list him on its lobbying team for any of the nations. The teams generally had Democratic lobbyists, as indicated by their campaign donations, which were part of the disclosures.\nGillespie left the firm in June 2007 to work in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. The company continued its relationship with Bosnia and Macedonia after his departure and signed new contracts with Japan and Indonesia.\nOur ruling\nWarner\u2019s ad says Gillespie\u2019s \"firm lobbied for five foreign governments, including a dictator now awaiting trial for war crimes.\"\nThe ad -- which is carefully worded -- has a point that Gillespie\u2019s firm lobbied for five foreign governments, including the Ivory Coast, whose former ruler, Gbagbo, is awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court.\nBut the ad\u2019s effort to link Gillespie to a brutal dictator lacks important context. Gillespie had been on leave from the firm for more than a year when the Ivory Coast deal was signed. \u00a0None of the company\u2019s federal disclosures indicate Gillespie was involved in the representation of any foreign clients, and Gbagbo was charged with crimes against humanity for events that happened in 2010 and 2011, well after the firm\u2019s relationship with the Ivory Coast ended.\nWhile there\u2019s accuracy to Warner\u2019s claim, it leaves out vital details.
