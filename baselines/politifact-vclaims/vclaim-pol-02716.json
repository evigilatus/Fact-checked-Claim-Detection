We found her tweet to be partly accurate: licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers must conduct a background check for the transfer of all firearms, but private sellers are not required to run such background checks.\nWe reached out to Milano for comment but did not hear back.\nTexas shooting and gun background checks\nLaw enforcement officials identified 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley as the gunman who killed 26 people and injured 20 others at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Nov. 5.\nFreeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety,\u00a0said at a Nov. 6 press conference that the shooting was not over religious beliefs. The suspect\u2019s mother-in-law attended the church (though not present during the shooting) and had received threatening texts from Kelley. \"There was a domestic situation going on with this family,\" Martin said.\nKelley dropped\u00a0a \"Ruger AR assault-type rifle\" and fled the church, according to Martin. Kelley was found dead in his vehicle after a car chase and crash. Details on the cause of his death are developing.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilano tweeted that in Texas there are no background checks on long guns, such as AR-15-style rifles. (AR-15-style rifles look like military rifles \"but function like other semi-automatic civilian sporting firearms, firing only one round with each pull of the trigger,\" according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation.)\nTexas does not have a state law requiring any seller to run a background check on purchasers of any gun, said Ari Freilich, a staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\nBut there is federal law requiring background checks in some cases, she said.\n\"Federal law requires federally licensed gun dealers, importers, and manufacturers to run background checks before selling firearms of any kind to an unlicensed buyer,\" Freilich said.\nHowever, unlicensed, private sellers are not required by federal law to run background checks on individuals purchasing firearms.\nMany Twitter users pointed out this distinction to Milano. Appearing to have noticed the challenges to her claim, Milano tweeted less than two hours later: \"Background checks aren\u2019t REQUIRED in Texas on long guns. If you buy from Walmart, they\u2019ll do one. If you buy privately they don\u2019t have to.\"\nBackground checks aren\u2019t REQUIRED in Texas on long guns. If you buy from Walmart, they\u2019ll do one. If you buy privately they don\u2019t have to.\u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) November 6, 2017\n\n\nWatts, whom Milano credited for her information, also later specified in tweets that no background checks were required for private sales of long guns.\nSome states do have restrictions on the private sale of firearms. For instance, in California such sales must be done through a licensed dealer.\nA study published in January 2017 asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. Twenty-two percent said they obtained their gun without a background check.\nOur ruling\nMilano tweeted, \"There are no background checks on long guns (AR15s) in Texas.\"\nFederal law does require background checks when a firearm is sold or transferred by licensed gun dealers, importers, and manufacturers. That includes long guns. But private, unlicensed sellers are not required to conduct background checks under federal or Texas\u00a0law, even though other states have added requirements to that effect. Milano noted these\u00a0distinctions in a follow-up tweet, but her original tweet lacked important context.\nWe rate Milano\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-11-06 22:46:56 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"There are no background checks on long guns (AR15s) in Texas.\"    Alyssa Milano Actress https://twitter.com/Alyssa_Milano/status/927349648972500992   in a tweet Sunday, November 5, 2017 2017-11-05    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02716"}
