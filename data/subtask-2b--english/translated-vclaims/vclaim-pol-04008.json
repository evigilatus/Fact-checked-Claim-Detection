FBI's investigating Clinton's e-mail.", "text": "Donald Trump issued a scary message about Hillary Clinton and the latest developments in her e-mail argument called \"The Biggest Scandal since Watergate.\" \"You know, the FBI re-opened its investigation at Hillary Clinton and discovered -- you heard this yesterday, hard to believe -- and discovered another 650,000 e-mails. Hillary lied under oath when she said that she delivered all of her work-related e-mails -- just one more lie from many.\" Trump said in the October 31 stunt in Michigan. Trump refers to the letter of the Director of the FBI, James Come, on October 28, informing Congress that the Bureau looked forward to examining new evidence that might be relevant to the Clinton case. But his description is slightly misleading, and the letter did not say anything about the amount of e-mails involved. First, the FBI did not \"reopen\" the investigation, because it was not officially closed. We can definitely say that the FBI is looking into a case that's been inactive before. Trump is less accurate when he suggests that the FBI discovered hundreds of thousands of new e-mails related to the Clinton case. The number, which was given by unnamed sources to the Wall Street Journal, indicates the total number of e-mails found in a separate investigation. It is unclear how many are actually connected to Clinton and how many are actually new. The 650,000 e-mails, as reported by the Poletti Fuckett newspaper, told anonymous FBI officials that the new focus began when the FBI found an e-mail on a laptop from former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner, who was under investigation for an explicit sexual exchange with a 15-year-old girl. Winner's been separated from Homa Abedine, Clinton's assistant for a long time. The investigators found a total of 650,000 e-mails on Weiner &apos; s laptop, anonymous sources reporting to the Wall Street Journal. But we still have to see how many of those e-mails include Clinton, how many work-related messages, how many duplicates of e-mails have already been reviewed by the FBI, and whether they contain confidential information. The Journal continues to say that \"in thousands\" may have been sent to or from Clinton's e-mail server. The Washington Post reported that there were more than 1,000 people on the server (although it is unclear whether this refers to the number of leads or individual e-mails). Other news reports indicate that the majority of the 650,000 e-mails have nothing to do with the Clinton case and that a small portion of them will be examined by the FBI. A re-opening case? Trump and other Republicans have said that the FBI \"reopened\" the Clinton investigation, while Camp Clinton and others reject this description, pointing out that Kumi's three-point letter to Congress or the note he sent to FBI employees does not use the word. On one level, this is a bit of a delusional evasive. Former FBI officials told us \"reopening\" is an inaccurate choice of word, but it takes place in the essence of the last development. It is likely that the FBI has not administratively closed the Clinton case, although it is no longer an actual investigation. On another level, experts said the word \"reopening\" could mean that officials found the smoking gun, but that conclusion was premature. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 FBI cases are \"open,\" according to the management evaluation, when there is sufficient information to investigate. It is also \"closed\" by administrative decision, when there is no further investigation or management work to be carried out. \"The opening and closing of a case is indeed a matter of preparing an internal communication specifying the reasons for doing so and bringing the supervisory chain of command into line with that decision,\" said Nancy Savage, who worked in the FBI for 35 years as a special agent and as an administrative officer. It is clear that the investigation into Clinton &apos; s e-mail (as well as the Weiner case) has been officially opened. However, while Comi shared the results of the investigation in Clinton's e-mail in July 2016, \"Come did not indicate that Clinton's e-mail case was officially closed at all,\" said Mark Paulette, a former FBI special agent and a teaching director at Syracuse University. \"In view of the size and scope of the case, I would be surprised that all the papers have been completed,\" said Paulette. He noted that the Clinton investigation had to be active in order for the FBI to obtain an order to search Weiner &apos; s e-mails for Clinton-related exchanges. So basically, the case was \"reopened\" in the sense that the FBI \"turned from administrative liquidation to active investigation,\" Savage said. Finally, the experts cautioned against further reading this new development. \"There is nothing unusual about pursuing this investigation. Savage said it was a standard operating procedure, adding that Komi simply informed Congress that new information required further investigation. The FBI probably didn't know and still doesn't know what all the information on this computer means, which Ben should have delivered much earlier than Abidin.\" \"The act of reopening a case does not refer to any conclusions, which is an administrative procedure within the scope of the previous e-mail review,\" said Ellen Glasser, a former FBI special agent and supervisor. \"Any suggestion that there's a smoking gun, based only on reopening the case, would be wrong.\" Our referee Trump said, \"The FBI reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton... and discovered another 650,000 e-mails.\" Trump has a point that the FBI has stopped actively investigating Clinton's e-mails until the latest developments. But the experts told us that it is unlikely to be officially closed, so the word \"reopening\" is inaccurate. The biggest factual issue is his number. 650,000 e-mails were discovered in a separate investigation, and it is not clear only how many Clinton is connected and how many copies of the e-mail have already been reviewed by the FBI. Reports indicate that the Office only examines a small portion of 650,000 e-mails. We're assessing Trump's claim of half the integrity. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a4340f93-174b-4501-8531-b8b98d2e1", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04008"}
