The most recent measles outbreak in the United States is discussed. On 6 March, a director of health and humanitarian services joined other federal officials to write an op-ed article in The New York Times calling for vaccination, saying that they saved lives and protected public health. However, a recent Facebook article indicates that the federal agency failed to ensure the safety of the vaccination. \"Health and humanitarian services recognize that they have never conducted the required monitoring at the federal level for vaccine safety for more than 30 years,\" says the April 4th article. \"There's no science! Your baby is a Vax test doll!\" This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The short version of the story is: the federal vaccination agency did not hand over some reports in response to a group &apos; s request for documents. However, Facebook goes too far to say that the agency admitted that they \"had never conducted the required federal monitoring of vaccine safety\" for decades. That's not true, the experts told us. What we found as a spokesman for health and humanitarian services did not immediately respond to Poletti Fructte &apos; s e-mail on Facebook article. On the Agency's \"Vaccination Safety\" page on vaccines.gov, it notes that \"Vaccinations are given to millions of healthy people - including children - to prevent serious diseases, they are held according to very high safety standards.\" This includes the testing and evaluation of vaccines before they are authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and the monitoring of vaccine safety after they have been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each batch of vaccines is tested for quality and safety, according to the Health Survey, and the Authority reviews the results of tests and inspects the factories where the vaccines were manufactured. After authorizing and recommending the use of the vaccine, the website states that FDA, the CDC and other federal agencies monitor its safety. The CDC and FDA are running the system for reporting against vaccine events, which tracks unusual or unexpected patterns that can mean the existence of vaccine safety. Once authorized, the rapid immunization safety monitoring system is the National Vaccine Safety Monitoring System of the Forestry Development Authority. Tony Yang, Professor and Researcher in Health and Policy Services at George Washington University, told us that Facebook's claim is \"undesirable.\" \"FDA and DCDC (both under HHS) closely monitor vaccine safety after the public starts the vaccine,\" said Polyte Fructate in e-mail. \"Monitor vaccine safety through: high-quality vaccine safety research; decision-making on whether vaccines cause reactions in specific cases; assistance in identifying preventable risk factors; and identification of events harmful to vaccine through public health surveillance.\" Daniel Salmon, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Director of the University Institute of Vaccine Safety, said to Bolivi Facket: \"Health and public health do a lot of vaccine safety monitoring.\" On 20 January 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated in an article entitled \"WHO acknowledges that its blatantly exaggerated testing of individuals was positive for the International Commission on Vaccines and Vaccines.\" Noah Y. Kim wrote: 22 January 2021 he referred to a document from the Ministry of Health in December 2008 entitled \"Comprehensive review of federal health programmes for vaccines and public health activities.\" The summary begins: vaccine safety is assessed through a network of diverse and integrated activities covering the responsibilities of federal agencies and involving the private sector and academic investigators. The development, licensing and widespread use of the vaccine includes activities and programmes from a wide range of groups, including government health departments, academia, industry, health-care providers, professional organizations, third parties paying for the vaccine, managed care organizations, charitable organizations and services, agencies within the Ministry of Health and Humanitarian Services, including the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Programme for Vaccine Injury Compensation. After obtaining a vaccine permit, the document states that FDA may obtain agreements from manufacturers to conduct studies on the risks, benefits and optimal use of the vaccine. They are usually epidemiological studies involving tens of thousands of people, according to the document. :: Dorrit Robinstein Reese, Professor of Law at the University of California, Hastings, examines legal issues relating to vaccines. When we asked her about the Facebook article, she said, \"It's not true that the Ministry of Health hasn't monitored safety in 30 years.\" Reese stated that this claim arose from an information request by the Action Network for informed consent for administrative reports submitted to Congress by the Ministry of Health. Although the National Children &apos; s Vaccines Act requires the Ministry of Public Health to submit such reports, the Ministry of Public Health said that it could not find any of them in the research. In an article published in July 2018 on its website, the Action for Informed Consent Network says, \"HHS has not acted in its duties with regard to vaccine safety, forcing 78 million American children to enter a vaccine programme without safety provisions.\" However, Reese said, while HHS said that it could not find the reports requested by the Network for informed consent, \"that is, it did not monitor safety. They did it.\" We were directed to two blogs that I wrote on the case. In paragraph 1, it states that the 1986 National Child Vaccines Act requires the Ministry of Health to report to two congressional committees on its vaccine-related activities. On 27 June 2018, the Agency responded to the request by stating that its search for records \"did not specify any records that responded to your request.\" Then Rhys details \"abundant research\" on HHS and vaccine safety, including the Institute of Medicine reports that agencies are delegated. \"In July 2014, a major report on vaccine safety commissioned by the Ministry of Health was completed.\" Although the Ministry of Public Health had \"completed and was still doing a great deal of work related to vaccine safety, the Agency should have submitted the required reports.\" Our Facebook article claims that health and human services \"accepts that they have never conducted the required federal monitoring of vaccine safety for more than 30 years.\" While the Agency was unable to find records responding to the information request of the Action Network for Informed Consent, we were unable to find evidence that the Agency had admitted that it had failed to monitor vaccine safety for more than 30 years. Instead, HHS provides details on its website on how it monitors vaccines and other agencies. Other reports, such as the 2008 review of federal vaccine safety programmes referred to by Salmon, are available on the Internet. We value this allegation wrong.
