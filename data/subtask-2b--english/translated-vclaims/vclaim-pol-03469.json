Its supporters give it a measure of credit to make the Great Depression lighter than it could have been. But critics, including Trump, argue that it was a lot of nothing. He said the same thing in the municipal hall for executives on April 4, 2017. \"As you know, there was a very large infrastructure bill approved during Obama's administration, $1 trillion,\" said Trump. \"No one has seen anything being built. I mean, until today, I haven't heard of anything that's been built. They used most of that money on social programs, and we want this to be on infrastructure.\" We have verified the allegations of motivation since the time it was proposed, as well as more recent allegations about its results. Let us take another look at the question of what the incentive has achieved and what has not. In February 2009, Obama signed a package of incentives that ultimately cost more than $800 billion. (The higher estimates were higher, so we're not going to dodge Trump by rounding it to $1 trillion.) The \"fully ready\" stimulus aspects tend to attract the greatest attention. But officially, this was only one of the aims of the law, and if you look closely at how funds are allocated, only part of the total was intended to go to infrastructure. According to the final report of the Council of Economic Advisers to Congress on stimulus, which was in progress until February 2014, about 35 per cent of expenditures went to lower taxes on individuals and companies; about 18 per cent to aid state governments with monetary constraints to offset cuts in health and education programmes; and about 14 per cent to \"safety net\" expenditures paid to individual Americans, such as additional unemployment payments. This leaves 34 per cent of the expenditure going to \"public investment\" -- barely insignificant in the $804.6 billion bill, but still a distinct minority of total expenditure. The amount actually spent on metal and concrete infrastructure was even smaller, as the category \"public investment\" also covered expenditure on such things as Bill grants, education for students with disabilities and scientific research. Michael Grable, a reporter at the Promoska investigation project, wrote a book, Mooney Will Inbit? The truth behind the Trileon dollars, the largest economic recovery plan in history. In his book, Grable estimated that only about $80 billion, or nearly a tenth of work spending, was devoted to what people usually considered to be \"infrastructure,\" of which only about $27 billion was spent on roads and bridges specifically. Thus, roads and bridges accounted for just over 3 per cent of all spending under this law. In terms of numbers, it would be accurate at least to call the stimulus a tax reduction bill, as is the case for a infrastructural bill. At the same time, the statement that the bill spent money on \"social programmes,\" as Trump has done, is at best exaggerated. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" The safety net (14 per cent of the law) and aid to Governments in the areas of health and education (18 per cent) may be considered \"social programmes,\" although not all observers will agree on this mark. In both cases, the total expenditure will be less than one third of the expenditure. It is wrong to say that even observers who see value in the act admit that it was not perfect. For example, in a 2012 op-ed article, Grable concluded that the lesson of motivation is that \"government can create jobs - it often does not do so well.\" Grable wrote, \"The money was spreading far and wide, rather than devoting it to more successful programs.\" The \"ready to live\" projects, which would put people to work immediately, took too long to break. On the other hand, investments in long-term projects have often deserved attention in fast meeting arbitrary deadlines, and the resulting poor results have distorted the profile of the projects. However, despite its limitations, spending on incentive infrastructure has led to the building of things. \"The idea that the new deal built bridges and dams while all motivation did was fill the pits is not quite real,\" wrote Grable in his book. \"From now on, there will be countless projects to which communities can refer as the permanent legacy of American law for recovery and reinvestment. 80 billion dollars for roads, runways, water stations, railways, federal buildings and public parks has been one of the largest investments in the nation's infrastructure since President Eisenhower established the interstate highway system in the 1950s.\" In order to mention a few larger projects, the Recovery Act helped to move forward with the development of the DFW-Dallas-Fort Worth highway; a $650 million high truck road to the port of Tampa; a new internal bridge for Cleveland; a tunnel linking the province of Auckland and the Cantra Costa, Califfe; new light rail lines in Salt Lake City and Dallas; a court in Austin; a hospital in the Pendleton camp in California; the Veterans' Facility in Fort Place in Texas; and a new headquarters of the Ministry of Internal Security and Coast Guard. The list of projects funded by the Act extends to nine pages in his book, although this is only a partial calculation. Was it worth it? Of course, although the act has produced tangible results, it makes sense to ask whether it has done so in the most efficient way possible. \"Keep in mind that the normal test of a positive outcome involves cost-benefit analysis,\" Dan Mitchell, an economist at the Liberal Cato Institute, told us to check the facts earlier. \"Pushing a bunch of money to the flowers of states and local governments is highly unlikely to produce good results.\" Grable said it was important not to exaggerate the effect of the arrival of the incentive. \"Despite historical investments and an endless list of projects, the Law on Recovery ultimately did not create a hole but rather a surge in the needs of the overwhelming American infrastructure,\" books. \"I have replaced or repaired more than 1,000 bridges that are incomplete or obsolete, but America has more than 150,000 bridges in such circumstances.\" Our Governor Trump said, \"There was a very large infrastructure bill approved during Obama's administration, $1 trillion. No one has ever seen anything being built.\" In practice, the incentive had a mixed record. But otherwise, Trump's description is wrong. In fact, the bulk of the law consists of tax cuts. With regard to the infrastructure part of the Act, it does lead to results, even though these results are somewhat more trivial than their supporters had hoped at the outset. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03469"}
