Martha McSally, Kelly said that McSally supports a border wall that is too costly and a \"17th century solution\" for border security. The federal government should invest in technology and more border patrol agents \u2014 and not take money away from a military base in Arizona, he said.\n\"Senator McSally voted to take away money from Fort Huachuca to pay for the border wall,\" Kelly said during a debate with McSally in Phoenix Oct. 6.\nIs that true? McSally\u2019s votes in 2019 allowed a national emergency declared by President Donald Trump to continue. The resolutions she voted on did not explicitly ask whether to divert money from Fort Huachuca to construction of a border wall; but allowing Trump\u2019s declaration to persist did have that effect. Funding for the Arizona project was deferred, not scrapped entirely.\nBackground on Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration\nCiting an \"invasion\" crisis, Trump in February 2019 declared a national emergency at the southwest border, a move that led his administration to redirect funds from planned Defense Department projects to construction at the border. \"Because of the gravity of the current emergency situation, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide additional support to address the crisis,\" Trump\u2019s declaration said.\nTrump\u2019s declaration came after he was unable to get money from Congress to pay for his promised border wall. Many immigration experts and lawmakers questioned the existence of the crisis Trump cited..\nIn September 2019, the Defense Department released the list of projects it would delay to provide $3.6 billion for border barriers. The list included a $30 million project for an equipment storage building at Fort Huachuca, an Army installation in Arizona.\nThe Defense Department said at the time that the projects were being deferred, not canceled, and that the $3.6 billion came from \"unobligated\" funds, meaning that the money for the military projects had not yet been committed in contracts. A contract for the Arizona project was expected to be awarded May 2020. Congress would need to backfill the money being diverted, the Defense Department said.\nMcSally\u2019s 2019 votes\nKelly\u2019s campaign pointed to three votes McSally cast in 2019 supporting Trump\u2019s declaration.\nMcSally in March voted against a resolution seeking to end Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration. In September, she voted against another similar resolution. In October, McSally voted against overriding a Trump veto of a resolution to end his declaration.\nMcSally\u2019s September and October votes were cast after the Defense Department publicly released the list of projects that would be sidelined, including the one at Fort Huachuca.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resolutions that McSally voted against were specific to Trump\u2019s declaration and did not include a direct reference to the delayed Defense Department projects. However, the deferral of the projects was directly tied to Trump\u2019s declaration.\nMcSally\u2019s comments on Fort Huachuca\nMcSally in March 2019 sent a letter to the acting defense secretary, asking that military construction projects in Arizona not be delayed due to shifts in funding for the border projects.\n\"While I strongly agree we must be tough on border security to protect Americans from drugs and criminals flowing across our southern border, we cannot forsake one duty for another,\" McSally wrote.\nMcSally said that Arizona military construction funding \"authorized and appropriated in recent years will enable the service members working in critical missions to have a safe, efficient, and effective working environment. Without funding for these projects on schedule and on budget, we risk disruption or degradation of several important military missions.\"\nIn September 2019, after the Defense Department included the Fort Huachuca project in its deferred list, McSally said that funding for the Arizona project was already delayed anyway, \"because of ongoing environmental cleanup that is taking longer than expected.\"\n\"The fact of the matter is that had the Army completed this sooner, the project would not have been delayed and would not have even been up for discussion,\" McSally said Sept. 4, 2019. McSally said she got a commitment from the Army that the project would be completed \"in a timely manner.\"\nMcSally\u2019s campaign told PolitiFact that the Army in April 2020 notified her that the Arizona project site had been cleared and that a contract would be awarded at the end of December 2020. Her campaign said the Pentagon had \"reshuffled money around to backfill the money.\"\nThe Arizona Republic in April reported that the Trump administration restored money for the Arizona project by taking money from the Pentagon\u2019s budget for operations in Europe and the Middle East. \"The money maneuvers are necessary as part of the military budget is redirected to pay for construction of President Donald Trump\u2019s long-promised border wall,\" said the Arizona Republic article.\nOur ruling\nKelly said McSally \"voted to take away money from Fort Huachuca to pay for the border wall.\"\nThis needs context. McSally voted against resolutions that sought to end Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration. Trump\u2019s declaration paved the way for the Defense Department to identify military projects that would be deferred \u2014 including a $30 million project at Fort Huachuca \u2014 in order to free up money for construction of barriers at the southwest border.\nMcSally in early 2019 asked the Defense Department to not delay funding for Arizona projects in order to pay for the border barriers. Later that year, she said the Fort Huachuca project was delayed anyway due to environmental cleanup issues at the site.\nKelly\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
