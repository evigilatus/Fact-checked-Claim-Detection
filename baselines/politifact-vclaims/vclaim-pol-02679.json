Bowe Bergdahl, held for about five years by the Taliban after disappearing in Afghanistan, has taken off again -- this time during his own court proceeding, says Duffel Blog.\n\"Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martial,\" said the October headline in Duffel Blog.\nHere\u2019s the accurate backstory: Bergdahl walked off his remote post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban. The military searched for him, and officers were injured in the process. Bergdahl was freed by his captors in 2014. In return, the United States agreed to turn over five Taliban officials being held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison to the country of Qatar. President Barack Obama\u2019s controversial decision to exchange Bergdahl angered many Republicans, including then-candidate Donald Trump.\nThe Duffel Blog says that Bergdahl now has walked out of a military courtroom during a pre-trial hearing, prompting a statewide manhunt.\n\"Sources inside the courtroom say that Bergdahl took only a half-full Camelbak and a long hunting knife with him as he calmly made his way to the exit during his own lawyer\u2019s remarks to the judge regarding a possible plea deal,\" states the article.\n\nHe left behind a note, the blog says:\n\"Life is way too short to care for the damnation of others. I am ashamed to even be an American (deserter).\"\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat fake news. This story is fake.\nThe article then becomes more ridiculous. It says that a few military personnel were injured in the manhunt and that \"ISIS and Al Qaida have both claimed responsibility for the casualties, though their claims have yet to be verified.\"\nThe Pentagon offered a reward for information about Bergdahl\u2019s whereabouts: \"$25,000 or seven Guantanamo detainees, depending on the credibility of the information.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Officials are warning the public that if they see Bergdahl, they should not attempt to approach him, since he may try to surrender and become their responsibility for the next five years,\" states the blog.\nThe article linked to an Oct. 12 Washington Post story previewing an upcoming hearing for Bergdahl.\nMultiple news outlets including the AP reported that Bergdahl entered a plea of guilty during the Oct. 16 hearing at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He didn\u2019t wander off during his hearing.\n\"I understand that leaving was against the law,\" Bergdahl testified.\nOn Nov. 3, a military judge ordered that Bergdahl receive a dishonorable discharge from the U.S. Army and reduced his rank from sergeant to private.\nThe Duffel Blog calls itself \"the American military\u2019s Most Trusted news source\" but readers will have to find the disclaimer to learn this is fake news.\n\"We are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet,\" states the disclaimer. \"Everything on this website is satirical and the content of this site is a parody of a news organization.
