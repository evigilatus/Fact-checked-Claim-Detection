On Sunday, the city\u2019s Republican Party made its views on the tax clear.\nCity Committee chairman Joe DeFelice wrote an editorial for the\u00a0Inquirer\u00a0headlined \"Mayor\u2019s soda tax is a Big Gulp of folly.\" One of his suggestions for Kenney for dealing with funding for Pre-K, as well as Philly\u2019s other financial problems, was to look at the size of his \"own administration,\" which DeFelice wrote \"is already 45 percent larger than his predecessor's and 40 percent more costly.\"\nHas the mayor\u2019s administration grown by that much under Kenney? And what actually counts as his administration?\nDeFelice said he was referring to\u00a0a February\u00a0Inquirer\u00a0article\u00a0comparing the organizational structure of Kenney\u2019s cabinet to Nutter\u2019s. The article noted 16 people reported directly to Kenney and 11 reported to Nutter and also gave the combined salaries for the people under each mayor's watch.\nThose numbers and DeFelice\u2019s interpretation of them check out. Kenney has 16 staffers reporting directly to him. Nutter had 11, according to\u00a0the last organizational chart\u00a0released by the city in his tenure. That\u2019s a 45.5 percent difference. Kenney\u2019s 16 staffers make $2,584,872 added together. Using the 2015 salary data available for nine of Nutter\u2019s staffers and 2013 numbers, which were the last readily available for the other two, they made $1,907,118. The percentage difference is 35.5 percent. That\u2019s not quite 40 percent but could be charitably rounded up.\nThat said, Committee of Seventy President/CEO David Thornburgh said the comparison regarding the number of people who reported to the mayor wasn\u2019t necessarily a helpful one or the same as calling it the mayor's \"administration.\"\n\"People generally think of the administration in broad strokes, like 20-some-thousand people that work for the city,\" Thornburgh said. \"That\u2019s where it kind of hiccuped in my head. But you know politics.\"\nCity employees are grouped into different categories. Those who work under the mayor -- but don\u2019t necessarily report to the mayor -- are considered part of the Mayor\u2019s Office. Kenney released a flowchart detailing the office\u2019s composition. It features 22 people, and the salaries and expenses of the Mayor\u2019s Office total about $4.26 million, according to the proposed FY 2017 budget.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last year of Nutter\u2019s tenure, his office was more expensive. According to the FY 2016 budget, the Mayor\u2019s Office salaries and expenses totaled about $5 million.\nIn terms of pure size, Nutter\u2019s administration could actually be considered larger than Kenney\u2019s. The Nutter\u00a0organizational chart, which detailed the people who report to Nutter and the people who report to them, featured 71 names, including heads of quasi-governmental agencies like DRWC and SEPTA.\u00a0The same type of organizational chart\u00a0for Kenney features 66 names. \u00a0\nSame goes for Nutter\u2019s cabinet. According to the organizational chart released by the city, 11 people report to him, but his cabinet is actually larger. His administration listed 20 people as cabinet members\u00a0in a January 2015 report about his accomplishments. That cabinet size would be larger than Kenney\u2019s 16-person cabinet. \u00a0 \u00a0\nKenney\u2019s Mayor\u2019s Office does include several new positions he created, such as digital director, deputy mayor for public engagement and chief diversity and inclusion officer. Many of these new positions command salaries of $150,000 annually. Lauren Hitt, Kenney\u2019s director of communications, said one of the cabinet positions was created because of a charter change and two others \"because of broad consensus among the public and City Council that they were needed.\"\nThe size of Philadelphia government overall has tended to grow year after year.\u00a0In the last two years, the size of the city's total workforce has gone up while total salaries have gone down. In 2014,\u00a0there were 29,779 total employees\u00a0making $1.63 billion in yearly salary. As of March 2016, there were 30,254 making $1.57 billion.\nOur Ruling\nRepublican City Committee chairman Joe DeFelice suggested Mayor Jim Kenney examine the size of his administration before enacting something like the soda tax and argued it was 45 percent larger and 40 percent more costly than his predecessor Michael Nutter\u2019s. Those numbers match up when comparing the staffers who report to Kenney to the staffers who reported to Nutter, but the reporting structure in city government doesn\u2019t give the whole picture. Nutter\u2019s Mayor\u2019s Office was more costly than Kenney\u2019s office is budgeted for this year, and his cabinet was larger than Kenney\u2019s.\nWe rate the claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05110"}
