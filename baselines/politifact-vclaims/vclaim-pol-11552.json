It cropped up in January, when Sen. Maria Sachs, D-Delray Beach, and Rep. Dana Young, R-Tampa, were garnering support for their proposal to allow dog tracks to stop racing dogs but keep their card rooms and slot machines.\n\nPeople don\u2019t flock to these tracks for the greyhounds anymore, they said.\n\n\"It\u2019s a new Florida, and this is not what we need to be remembered for, as the largest dog-racing state in the country,\" Sachs said. \"We are soon to be No. 3 in the country as the most populous state, and our culture does not look at mandated dog racing anymore.\"\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely greyhound tracks will be able to go dog-free anytime soon. A broader expansion of casino gambling has been sidelined, and Young and Sach\u2019s bills have been idling in committees.\n\nStill, we wanted to know, does Florida really deserve the rep as the nation\u2019s home for parimutuel dog racing?\n\nWe consulted the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or ASPCA, which lobbied in support of letting tracks keep gambling without dog-racing.\n\nThe nickname is deserved and then some, they said. No other state comes close.\n\n\"It's always been the largest,\" said Ann Church, ASPCA lobbyist.\n\nFor decades, greyhound racing was viewed as high-end, glamorous entertainment. It\u2019s been in Florida since 1931.\n\n\"It was firmly entrenched,\" Church said. \"It was a destination event, going down to Florida and doing that.\"\n\nRacing enthusiasts say it still appeals.\n\n\"There's still a demand and love and excitement for the sport out there,\" Gary Guccione, executive director of the National Greyhound Association, told\u00a0the Tampa Bay Times in 2011. \"I don't know that it's dying. Greyhound racing, in one form or another, has been around for thousands of years.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeaWorld\n\n\nstated on March 24, 2015 in an ad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whales live as long at SeaWorld\" as they do in the wild.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Lauren Carroll \u2022 March 24, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, greyhound racing exists in just seven states, including Florida: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Iowa, Texas and West Virginia.\n\nNone of those states has more than two active tracks.\n\nBut Florida? It\u2019s home to a whopping 13 of the nation\u2019s 22 tracks.\n\nLocations are all over the state. There\u2019s Derby Lane in St. Petersburg, Mardi Gras near Hollywood, the Daytona Beach Kennel Club and Poker Room, and Jefferson County Kennel Club in the rural North Florida town of Monticello.\n\nThe ASPCA numbers match up with a Florida Senate committee analysis and information from Grey2K USA, a nonprofit organization that campaigns against greyhound racing.\n\nCommercial dog racing is illegal in 38 states, according to the group\u2019s state-by-state comparison of dog-racing laws.\n\nOpponents and supporters can agree on one thing: Sachs\u2019 claim that Florida is the nation\u2019s largest dog-racing state is deserved.\n\nWe rate it True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11552"}
