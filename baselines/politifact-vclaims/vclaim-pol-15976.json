The move puzzled Republicans in Congress, because a few days earlier the Bush administration had refused to bail out the investment bank Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy. Moreover, the Fed and the Treasury Department had previously rebuffed AIG\u2019s appeal for a $40 billion bridge loan to avert a downgrade of its credit due to investment losses.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn the campaign trail, John McCain stuck firm to his anti-interventionist principles before the bailout was announced. Appearing on NBC\u2019s\n\nToday\n\nshow, McCain said AIG should be left on its own. \u201cWe cannot have the taxpayers bail out AIG or anybody else,\u201d he said.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe GOP presidential candidate echoed those remarks on CNBC\u2019s\n\nSquawk Box\n\nthe same day, when he responded to a question about whether, if he were in the Fed\u2019s position, he would let the firm fail. \u201cI think you have to,\u201d McCain replied, adding he knew efforts were afoot to raise enough capital to keep AIG in business.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut the day after the bailout was announced, McCain sounded more resigned than resolute, stating that the government had been \u201cforced\u201d into taking action.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cToday, the government was forced to commit $85-billion to stop the collapse of AIG,\u201d McCain said in a Sept. 17 statement. \u201cThese actions stem from failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street that has crippled one of the most important companies in America. \u2026The focus of any such action should be to protect the millions of Americans who hold insurance policies, retirement plans and other accounts with AIG. We must not bail out the management and speculators who created this mess. They had months of warnings following the Bear Stearns debacle, and they failed to act. We should never again allow the United States to be in this position. We need strong and effective regulation, a return to job-creating growth and a restoration of ethics and the social contract between businesses and America.\"\n\n\nThat certainly doesn't sound like a reversal to us. It's true that McCain could have issued a statement denouncing the bailout as the wrong decision, so it's fair to conclude that by saying the government was \"forced to commit $85-billion to stop the collapse of AIG\" he's agreeing that it needed to be done. But this is far from an endorsement of the idea and reads more like a grudging acknowledgment.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Sept. 18, McCain was a bit more clear: \"When AIG was bailed out, I didn't like it, but I understood it needed to be done to protect hard working Americans with insurance policies and annuities.\"\n\n\nObama seized on McCain\u2019s statement as evidence of a flip-flop. Speaking in Espanola, N.M., on Sept. 18, Obama said, \u201cOn Tuesday, he said the government should stand by and allow one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers to collapse, putting the well-being of millions of Americans at risk. But by Wednesday, he changed his mind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nObama\u2019s depiction strikes us as over the top. Based on his remarks, McCain seemed willing to swallow some pragmatic trade-offs, given the remarkable circumstances in the markets. And McCain in his statement added that the intervention should not apply to \u201cthe management and speculators who created this mess.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nYet it\u2019s debatable whether the government really was forced to take action. It could have allowed another giant corporate bankruptcy that would have accelerated a repricing of credit that\u2019s hitting corporations and individuals alike. Moreover, the government\u2019s action sets a precedent for more costly government bailouts, particularly if some large regional banks or the giant thrift Washington Mutual get sucked down by the crisis. In truth, the decision, for the moment, is being widely viewed as economically prudent and politically wise. Because McCain stopped short of endorsing the bailout even as he declined to criticize it, we rule this one a Half Flip.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15976"}
