It will receive financial support to purchase coverage in the private market. Proponents argue that such a plan is necessary to maintain the programme financially dissolved, while detractors say it will limit protection for a long time and count older persons. The Boxer commentary reduces the essence of whether a government-run programme such as the Medical Care Programme has advantages over a programme in which private insurers play a key role. First of all, we need to define \"the capital.\" People might think of it as things like rent and electricity. However, in the area of health care, the term usually refers more broadly to administrative costs, including expenditures not limited to purely medical services, such as marketing, customer service, billing, claims review, quality assurance, information technology and profits. To measure the administrative costs of medical care, we first turned to the 2011 annual report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Trust Funds for Hospital and Supplementary Medical Insurance - a document prepared by the financial supervisors of medical care. A summary of the trustees reported total medical care expenditure of $522.8 billion for 2010, of which $7 billion was described as \"administrative expenses.\" This works at 1.3% -- not far from what Boxer said. For the private insurance market, we went to the 2008 study by the Congressional Budget Office, Congress's non-partisan arm. The Central Data Office reported data collected by the McKenzie World Institute, which estimates the administrative costs of private insurers at 12 per cent. This is much lower than the 20-30 percent cited by Boxer. A different measure by medical care centres and medical assistance services linked the amount for private insurance companies to 11.1 per cent for 2009 - in the same stadium. However, the administrative burden of special plans becomes more complex as you dig deeper. There are significant differences between the different types of insurance schemes. The data reported by the Community Bureau concluded that the administrative costs were approximately 7 per cent for employers with at least 1,000 employees, but 26 per cent for companies with 25 or less employees. At the same time, in the individual insurance market - i.e. plans secured by individuals on their own, not through the employer - the rate was about 30 per cent, according to the Community Bureau. There is a major reason for this disparity, namely, that community organizations and others have concluded that larger plans can spread costs to more people. When we asked Boxer's office about its source of 20% to 30% statistics, spokesman Andy Stone told us that prior to the adoption of the Democratic Health Care Bill in 2010, only 70% of the premiums were required from California's health plans for medical care, with insurance companies spending up to 30% on profits and administrative costs. He also cited some opinion and news articles that cited figures in a range of 20 to 30 per cent or even higher. We have no doubt that there are cases in which public expenditures reach or exceed 30 per cent, but these are stories at the higher end of the range. The averages cited by community organizations and CMS are much lower -- 11% to 12% -- and many of the larger plans even reduce this level. There are some other factors that need to be taken into account: is the administrative cost of medical care really that low? On 13 January 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines for security, saying to her, \"We are not working for you.\" The difference is due mainly to whether medical care is discharged from other parts of the Federal Government, which private insurance companies must pay for themselves. The adjusted estimates of the administrative costs of medical care referred to by the Urban Institute, a think tank conducting research on issues such as poverty and economics, range from 3.6 per cent to 5 per cent, instead of 1.3 per cent using the data contained in the report of the trustees. However, Edwin Park, a health policy specialist at the Liberal Centre for Budget and Policy Priorities, said that the differences were exaggerated, since the total administrative costs of medical care already included payments to other agencies for such services. We will not resolve this issue, but we will point to evidence that even when you control differences, medical care is still more cost-effective. In one study, the Office of Social Affairs found that private-sector-run medical care schemes had 11 per cent of public expenditure, compared with 2 per cent of traditional medical care. Is \"public expenditure\" a useful way to measure the efficiency of the health plan? Not necessarily. As the insurance industry often says - and independent experts generally agree - the right type of administrative expenditure may in fact lead to cost savings and improved results. These programmes include disease management, health programmes and quality improvement programmes. The Civil Society Bureau notes that the heavily managed insurance plan may spend more on public expenditure but may eventually lead to lower insurance premiums and improved results, while a lightly managed programme may spend less on public expenditure but end up charging more costs to policy holders, with less positive results. From this logic, it may indeed be preferable to develop a larger plan. In addition, Henry Aaron, a health-care specialist at the Central Brookings Institution for Liberalism, indicated that in the long run, medical care could benefit financially from high administrative costs in at least one area - the enforcement of anti-fraud measures. In other words, the measurement of public expenditures is worthwhile, but it has its limits. There is some disagreement as to how much medical care is paid in public expenses. It may be a few percentage points higher than 1 to 2 per cent mentioned by Boxer. But the number of Boxers is defensible because it comes directly from the report of the medical care trustees. At the same time, the number of 20 to 30 per cent Boxer for the private sector is more obsessive. Some plans have high public expenditure rates, but only a small proportion do, and an industry-wide average is slightly lower -- 11 to 12 per cent. We are convinced that the point underlying Boxer - that private plans have higher public expenditures than government plans - is true, if only because profits matter only to private insurers. But for most plans and patients, the difference between medical care and public private sector expenditures is not as large as you suggest. So we evaluate her statement half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13022"}
