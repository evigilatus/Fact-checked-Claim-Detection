Ron Johnson.\nAfter saying Wisconsinites talked about hot topics such as income inequality, paid family leave and Social Security, Feingold turned his attention to Johnson and college students.\n\"Finally, I didn\u2019t hear a single student in this state agree with Sen. Johnson\u2019s comment that students like to take out student loans because they think it\u2019s free money,\" said Feingold, a Democrat who lost to Johnson in 2010. \"Students don\u2019t like that. It\u2019s actually scary.\n\"The average debt coming out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is something like $28,000.\"\nWith in-state tuition ringing up at just over $5,000 a semester, we wondered if Feingold was right.\nBehind the numbers\nWe checked a similar claim about student debt from Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in 2014. She claimed that \"this generation, on average, is starting their careers, if they\u2019ve been to a four-year college, with just under $30,000 in debt.\"\nWe rated her claim Half True, as she didn\u2019t mention the data\u2019s limitations and some cases suggest the level may be lower.\nFor backup to Feingold\u2019s, his team sent us links to a few news articles that cited the average debt incurred by students at UW-Madison. We reached out to the officials to confirm the numbers, which come from UW\u2019s Office of Student Financial Aid.\nThe most recent year for which statistics are available is 2014-15 and the average debt for students at the time of graduation that year was $28,769. That\u2019s slightly higher than the figure Feingold used.\nLoans taken out by students through the university are tracked by the office through its Student Information System. Loans not borrowed at UW-Madison are fed into the system through the National Student Loan Data System, a student aid database from the U.S. Department of Education. Loans taken out by parents on behalf of students are not included.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the number is a little over reaching.\nWhen UW\u2019s Office of Student Financial Aid calculates the average debt of students, it only counts those who take out loans.\nSo, how many students are included?\nAccording to the office, just about half of students at UW-Madison graduate with debt -- 3,374 of the 6,798 students who graduated in 2015.\nIf we spread out the loans among all students, average debt would hover around $14,000.\nWe think the best way to measure the amount of debt incurred is to examine only students who take out loans. And that tracks more closely with what Feingold said.\nAnother qualifier: The numbers doesn\u2019t take into account other ways students could be in debt -- credit cards, car loans, for instance. But that is impossible to track.\nMeanwhile, in the entire UW System, 73.5 percent of students borrow money, with the average debt at graduation for those students reaching $30,651.\nOur rating\nFeingold said the average student debt \"coming out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is something like 28,000 dollars.\"\nHis number was on target, but he failed to mention the average only included about half of all students -- those who borrowed money for their educational expenses. The other half left with no debt at all.\nFeingold\u2019s statement is accurate, but needs additional information.\nThat\u2019s our definition of Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04821"}
