A clinical trial run in April found that patients who took the drug were more likely to recover from the disease \u2014 and do so faster \u2014 than patients who took a placebo pill.\u00a0\nBut as excitement about remdesivir amps up, criticism has followed over the price that Gilead Sciences, the drug\u2019s manufacturer, wants to charge for it.\u00a0\nU.S. insurers, including Medicare and Medicaid, will pay $3,120 for a five-day course of the drug, while other developed countries will pay about a third less because they\u2019ll purchase from generic manufacturers to which Gilead has licensed production.\u00a0\nThe move has angered many, including the progressive advocacy group and think tank Public Citizen, which tweeted on June 29, 2020 about the price declaration, writing, \"Taxpayers spent $70,000,000 to develop this drug. It should be in the public domain. Instead, Big Pharma is robbing us blind.\"\nParts of the tweet, course, are opinions. But the $70 million claim is stated as a fact.\nHow much did taxpayers spend to develop remdesivir?\u00a0\nLet\u2019s dig in.\u00a0\nRemdesivir\u2019s ties to public funding\u00a0\nTo back up the organization\u2019s claim, Peter Maybarduk, Public Citizen\u2019s Access to Medicine director, sent a May 7, 2020 post published on their site titled, \"The real story of remdesivir.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid the worldwide Ebola outbreak in 2015, the U.S. government partnered with Gilead to identify a drug that targeted the Ebola virus and was successful in blocking the infection in Rhesus monkeys.\u00a0\nThat drug would later come to be known as remdesivir. In 2017, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report noted that an entity within the Department of Defense would cost-share with Gilead for \"continued development of this product,\" noting its antiviral activity against a number of viruses, including coronaviruses.\u00a0\nThe Department of Defense has spent $34.5 million so far on this effort.\u00a0\u00a0\nAlso in 2017, the National Institutes of Health issued a $6 million grant to researchers at the University of North Carolina to speed the development of remdesivir.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd as the novel coronavirus made its way into the world, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a division of NIH, announced it would funnel $30 million into the aforementioned clinical trial for remdesivir.\u00a0\u00a0\nSince the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health are funded through federal taxes, these three payments add up to what Public Citizen claimed.\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nPublic Citizen wrote that taxpayers paid $70 million to develop remdesivir.\u00a0\nThree separate projects from agencies that are funded by taxpayer dollars, adding up to $70 million, have commenced since 2015.\u00a0\nWe rate the claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17790"}
