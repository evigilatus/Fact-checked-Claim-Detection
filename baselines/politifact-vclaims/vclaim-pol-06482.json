Rand Paul took to the stage in New Hampshire to woo voters at a Republican presidential summit, he took aim at Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nThe pair have both formally declared their intentions to run for the country\u2019s highest office.\nPaul went after Clinton\u2019s time as Secretary of State between 2009 and 2013, criticizing several purchases and investments the department made during her tenure.\n\"Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department sent three comedians to India on the \u2018Make Chai, Not War,\u2019 \" he quipped, garnering laughter from the audience.\nIt\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s dropped that line, and it grabbed our attention.\nThe U.S. State Department pointed to a press conference in December 2011, when a spokeswoman answered questions about the comedy tour. The press conference drew some laughter from reporters, as noted in the transcript.\nThe department sent three Indian-American comedians, who were part of a show called \"Make Chai, not War\" on the seven-city tour through India as part of a \"regular global cultural exchange program,\" former state department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters during the 2011 daily press briefing.\nWhile the title of the show was intentionally a joke, the purpose of the tour was more serious. \u00a0The trip was intended to stem religious prejudice and encourage tolerance.\nThe trio of comics traveled India from Jan. 4 to Jan. 17, 2012. In addition to comedy shows, Nuland said, they held audience discussions focused on issues of religious tolerance, ran workshops and did interviews with the press.\nThe full tour cost about $100,000, and the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi sponsored it with a $88,000 grant, Nuland said.\n\"The reason we decided to support this tour is because among the things that they are known for is their talk about religious tolerance, about the importance of breaking down prejudices, and about the positive experiences they had growing up as Indian Americans in the United States,\" Nuland said at the press conference according to the transcript.\nBut the state department can\u2019t claim credit for the tour\u2019s catchy title.\nOne of the three comics, Rajiv Satyal, launched the Make Chai, Not War show in 2007 to create a platform for other Indian-American comedians, according to a National Public Radio story published before the group embarked to India.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly Ayotte\n\n\nstated on July 29, 2012 in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The president's first major foreign policy speech in Cairo was to apologize for our country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Maryalice Gill \u2022 July 31, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe show\u2019s Indian tour came about after U.S. Embassy cultural attache Michael Macy saw one of the comics, Azhar Usman, perform in London, according to NPR.\nWhen Macy switched to a post in New Delhi, he brought the comic to India for a solo tour, which paved the way to the \"Make Chai, Not War\" India tour, according to NPR.\nStand-up comedy is an American art form, that is \"all about celebration of free speech,\" Usman said Thursday.\n\"Comedy has a very unique ability to allow people to have very difficult conversations that society may otherwise ignore,\" he said. \"To me it was a huge win.\"\nDating back to the 1940s, Secretaries of State have signed off on cultural exchange programs around the world. The current state department budget contains about about $100 million for Citizen Exchange Program, which includes cultural exchanges like the one to India.\nIt\u2019s not the first time Paul has invoked the \"Make Chai Not War\" tour to make a point.\nHe brought it up while grilling Clinton at a 2013 U.S. Senate hearing about attacks on a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.\n\"I can understand that maybe you\u2019re not aware that your department spent $100,000 on three comedians who went to India on a promotional tour called \"Make Chai Not War,\" Paul said, according to a Wall Street Journal transcript of the exchange.\nPaul mentioned it again during a later hearing with Clinton\u2019s replacement, former Mass. Senator John Kerry, according to the Washington Post.\nFor the record, Paul\u2019s claim didn\u2019t cite money or motive.\nOur ruling\nPaul said \"Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department sent three comedians to India on the \u2018Make Chai Not War tour.\"\nThe State Department, while under the leadership of Clinton, did send three Indian-American comics to India in early 2012 as part of a regular cultural exchange program intended to stem religious prejudices and encourage tolerance. The State Department didn\u2019t come up with the name, but the show was indeed called \"Make Chai Not War.\"\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06482"}
