She was with her parents when the attack happened.\u00a0\nThe news outlet\u2019s March 25 story says the girl was \"stabbed to death by a stranger.\" A 30-year-old woman was arrested at the park on suspicion of murder and was \"detained at a secure facility under the Mental Health Act.\"\nThe Manchester Evening News reported that Jones died \"as a result of an incised wound of the neck.\"\u00a0\nA witness chased after the alleged attacker and detained her until police arrived, according to Sky News.\u00a0\nOn April 1, the Bolton Coroner\u2019s Court opened an inquest into Jones\u2019 death. Police coroner\u2019s officer Rebecca Gardner told the court that Jones was playing on a scooter and rode past a wooden bench when she was stabbed by the woman sitting on it, the Bolton News reported. The inquest was adjourned until July 3 while police investigate the killing.\nThe account of what happened to Jones has evolved on social media, though. An April 4 tweet, which was \"liked\" more than 33,000 times, calls the girl \"Emily Jones Bolton\" and says the \"media buried her story because her killer is a 30 year old Somali immigrant.\" Another tweet, from April 3, claims \"the media refuses to cover the story in order to protect the savage killer who is a Somali immigrant.\"\nWe read nearly two dozen news articles about the killing and none mentioned the suspect\u2019s name, nationality or immigration status.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe contacted the local police department about the Facebook post. Jonathan Bell, a spokesman for the Greater Manchester Police, told PolitiFact that authorities don\u2019t disclose the identity of people arrested until they have been charged.\u00a0\n\"This means we would not confirm name, nationality or immigration status, as this would risk identifying her,\" he said.\nIn 2013, the College of Policing in the United Kingdom advised that police in England and Wales generally shouldn\u2019t name arrested people until they\u2019re charged. At the time, the BBC reported that some newspapers claimed the policy amounted to secret justice.\u00a0\n\"They have argued that naming a suspect who has been arrested can lead to more victims coming forward and that allowing suspects to remain anonymous was making it harder for reporters to find out what police are doing in the public\u2019s name,\" the BBC story says.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nThe Facebook post says a Somali migrant decapitated Emily Jones in front of her parents at a park, and that the media covered up the murder.\u00a0\nCredible news sources have reported that Jones was fatally stabbed, not decapitated, in front of her parents at a park.\u00a0\nNews reports say the woman arrested at the scene is 30 years old, but police have not released further identifying information pending an investigation, and we didn\u2019t find any news stories reporting on her name, nationality or immigration status. Many news outlets have covered the case in the weeks since the killing and have reported the information that has been made public.\nWe rate this Facebook post Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18314"}
