Two groups reported on May 12, 2014, that the global sea level will rise at least 10 feet, accelerating to a dangerous pace after the next century.\nJust a day before those reports were released, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sat down with ABC\u2019s Jonathan Karl on This Week. Talk turned to climate change, where the possible Republican presidential candidate denied a link between humans and the changing environment.\n\"I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,\" he said. \"And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy.\"\nWe\u2019ve noted before that Rubio has disputed the basic science of climate change. So when Rubio said human activity isn\u2019t causing changes to the environment, he\u2019s got it all wrong.\nIn this case, Rubio framed his thoughts about climate change as his personal opinion. But the causes of global warming are backed up by thorough research, so we didn\u2019t see room for debate in Rubio\u2019s claim.\nRubio\u2019s said before, \"I\u2019m not a scientist, man.\" So PolitiFact reached out to scientists who could explain the facts behind climate change. We've rated similar claims False from Tim Pawlenty and Rick Perry, but we'll rate it again because it's a persistent claim we see year after year.\u00a0Rubio\u2019s staff didn\u2019t return our request for comment.\nHow our climate is changing\nHistorically, the earth goes through periods of hotter and cooler temperatures. So how do we know global warming isn\u2019t a natural part of this cycle?\nBy taking measurements, said Leonard Berry, director of Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Center for Environmental Studies.\n\"We can measure the fact that the earth is warming. We can measure the fact that the ocean is warming,\" Berry said. \"While geological history shows warming and cooling periods, as far back as we go, none shows the kind of warming and the kind of changes we\u2019re experiencing right now.\"\nScientists trace back this shift to the Industrial Revolution, which began in 1760. Since that period, carbon dioxide rose 40 percent and methane by 150 percent. High levels of these and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat at the surface of the earth, warming the planet.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy burning fossil fuels, chopping down trees, and using fertilizer, humans have directly contributed to global warming.\nThe connection between increased levels of greenhouse gases and rising temperature has been confirmed by scientists for over a century, said Jennifer Francis, a Rutgers University marine and coastal sciences professor.\n\"There is as much uncertainty about this connection as there is about what will happen when you drop an object,\" Francis said. \"It will fall.\"\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is also on board with human activity as a cause. They reported that were it not for human impact, the likely effect of natural changes to the environment would\u2019ve been one of cooling, not warming. They cite \"very high confidence\" that human activities caused a change of course.\nThe U.S. Global Change Research program published a 2014 report on climate change. It doesn\u2019t debate whether human activity causes climate change. Rather, it focuses on what actions to take to lessen its effects.\nA May 2013 report analyzing all scientific papers that address the causes of climate change showed 97.1 percent of findings that took a position agree that there\u2019s been a negative human impact on the atmosphere. Comedian John Oliver cleverly addressed the debate\u2019s conclusiveness on a recent Last Week Tonight episode by arranging a representative debate between 97 climate change scientists and three deniers.\nAs a politician from Florida, Rubio must contend with research that pegs Miami and Tampa as two of the U.S. cities most likely to be impacted by climate change. Rising sea levels will make them more prone to flooding.\n\"Whatever the cause of climate change, the impacts on Florida are already important and that it would be difficult for responsible people in Florida to ignore that fact,\" Berry said.\nOur ruling\nRubio said human activity is not \"causing these dramatic changes to our climate.\" An overwhelming majority of scientists agree that humans, by burning fossil fuels, contribute directly to global warming.\nNot only is Rubio incorrect, but he\u2019s ignoring a mountain of concrete, scientific research. We rate his claim False.\nCORRECTION: This story was updated on May 15 to clarify that 97.1 percent of the studies that took a position on global warming agreed that there's been a negative human impact on the atmosphere; more than half the studies did not take a position. Also, the story clarifies that the 2013 report looked at studies, not individual scientists.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07865"}
