Tofu ran a few percentage points shy of claiming directly the \"place 3\" seat over Chad, which received approximately 33% in the four-way race. The May 17th statement continued: \"The turnout on May 14th was only 7% - the lowest in the contracts.\" Specifically, the turnout was 7.4 per cent of the registered voters in Austin. Nothing to brag about, but was that the lowest thing in decades? We reviewed the city election summaries every year covering the elections since 1965. Through the percentage of registered voters voting - a widely accepted method of measuring participation - exit was recorded at 7 per cent in May 2000 when voters took up races for mayor and some council seats. There is a closer view of 38,166 out of the 513,072 registered voters who participated, making the actual turnout in May 2000 at 7.4 per cent -- as was the case in this May. We suspect that beyond 7% on the Internet reflects the rounding of the actual turnout, which looks as if 20 of the election results summaries we've reviewed are being reviewed. Counsel (Linda Reeve) stated by e-mail that in May of this year the number of voters (32,869) was lower than that of any general election since April 1965, when 21,605 voters, according to campaign figures, participated. Fewer voters (22,094) participated in the March 1975 ballot for two seats in the Council, according to the results announced by the city. However, Political Councillor Austin Mark Littlefield, one of the supporters of shadows who chose the numbers on which Chad relied, told us that they were special elections and he suggested that they should not be compared to general elections. Riv said that another measure compares the number of voters with the number of inhabitants of the city. About 4 per cent of the population had voted this time, less than any other elections in the city that could find the campaign. \"This number,\" Riv said, \"It seems to provide more insight into these elections.\" Not mentioned: The general population includes many non-voters, including minors and non-citizens, making this measurement less meaningful. So, the voter turnout on May 14 was almost the same as in the municipal general elections in Austin 11 years ago. Once again, the number of voters who participated in the elections was lower than in any elections to the General Council decades ago. Shadow data are often considered valid.
