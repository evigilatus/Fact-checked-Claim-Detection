The case is weak.", "text": "Mr. James Lanford, R-Ocla, who was recently taken to cable television to repeal the tax law in December 2017, said he was financially responsible. On March 6, Lanford appeared on the magazine MSNBC \"The Morning Joe,\" one day after the Treasury Department report that the federal deficit was 77% higher during the first four months of FY2019 than it was during the same period of time a year ago. \"I've had a lot of people push back and say tax cuts that occurred last year contributed to the deficit,\" said Lanford on MSNBC on 6 March. \"The facts actually appear to be different. Yesterday I said on the ground that the figures for fiscal years 17 and 18 were there. In fact, tax revenues rose by $14 billion last year after the tax cut that actually occurred. We had more revenue.\" Lanford was referring to a speech he gave in the Senate on March 5th. Here's an excerpt: \"We're now a full fiscal year. Our revenue for fiscal year 2017 - the year preceding tax reform - was $3,315 trillion. Our revenues after tax cuts and tax reform for fiscal year 2018 amount to $3.329 trillion. If you do math in your head, that's $14 billion more than the revenue after tax cuts. That means our income went up next year. Unlike all the legends that were there earlier to say we had this giant hole in the budget, our income rose after tax cuts went into place.\" Is Lankford right that tax revenues went up after the tax law was passed? His office reiterated that between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018, tax collection in nominal dollar terms had already risen by some $14 billion, according to Treasury. However, as the responsible Federal Budget Committee points out, income has declined if it is treated in inflation or calculated as a percentage of GDP. Perhaps more importantly, looking at the issue in this way masks one of the major flaws: a large share of the 2018 fiscal year's revenues that Lanford considered \"after tax reduction\" was in fact subject to the old tax code, as we noted in verifying a similar claim by Sen in October 2018. Ted Cruz, Texas R-Texas. This is the case because several months during fiscal year 2018 either occurred prior to the entry into force of the tax law (in particular October, November and December) or were dominated by annual tax payments under the rules of the old tax law (February, March and April). On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers mentioned in a story written by General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, who rejected Nancy Pelosi's request to use Marines to provide security, telling her that we \"did not work for you.\" By Samantha Butterman on January 17, 2021, the best way to compare tax collection patterns before and after the law was to look at months that were governed by different laws. Using the monthly reports of the Treasury Department, we have separated the following eight months where there is a clear comparison: June, July, August, September (2017 and 2018), October, November, December and January (2018 and 2019). This chart summarizes what we found. This graph paints a completely different picture than Lankford's presentation. Of the eight months we considered, tax collection declined in seven months after the entry into force of the new law. If the cumulative total of those eight months is combined, tax collection has fallen by nearly $61 billion -- a less optimistic discovery than the $14 billion increase that Lanford has made. Ben Paige, Senior Fellow of the Urban Institute - Brookings Institution Centre for Tax Policy, called differences in tax collection before and after the law \"try.\" Outside the recession, the combination of population growth, general economic expansion and inflation usually pushed tax collection to levels higher than one year to another. This has not happened for seven months of these eight. Our resolution, Lankford, said, \"Tax's revenues actually increased 14 billion dollars last year after the tax cut actually occurred. We had more revenue.\" This figure comes from a misleading account in which part of the increase in fiscal year 2018 came from the tax collection governed by the old law. If you look at eight months of real comparison before and after, tax collection declined in seven of those months, and collectively, revenue fell by some $61 billion. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00928"}
