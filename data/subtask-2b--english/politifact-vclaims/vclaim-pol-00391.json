Ron Johnson, R-Wis.\n\"There's a survey done in Guatemala. A third of Guatemalans intend to migrate to the United States,\" Johnson said during a July 21 interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \"That's about 5.8 million people. Depopulating Guatemala and Central America, that's not good for Central America. It's not good for us.\"\nDid a survey say that about a third of Guatemalans \u2014 or about 5.8 million people \u2014 plan to migrate to the United States? No. Johnson\u2019s claim is based on news reports that inaccurately conveyed survey results.\nJohnson points to Guatemalan newspaper article\nJohnson\u2019s press office directed PolitiFact to a blog post on the senator\u2019s website headlined \"How many people would come here under open borders?\" It was published the day after the CNN interview.\n\"39.2% of Guatemalans told pollsters they intend to migrate out of the country, and 85% of those said they would migrate to the United States,\" Johnson\u2019s post said, reflecting what Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre reported in May. Johnson also cited U.S. versions of the story written by the Washington Examiner and the Daily Caller.\nJohnson has a point: a lot of Guatemalans said they intend to leave their country. \"But the specific numbers are different,\" said professor Elizabeth J. Zechmeister, director of the Latin American Public Opinion Project at Vanderbilt University.\nHer group worked with a Guatemalan research institute and think tank to create the AmericasBarometer Guatemala national survey. It was conducted from Jan. 22 to March 20, 2019 in face-to-face interviews with 1,596 individuals. Zechmeister said the sample is nationally representative of Guatemala\u2019s adult population, 18 years and older.\u00a0\nThe survey asked participants if they had any intention of going to live or work in another country in the next three years. In response, about 25% said yes. That\u2019s much fewer than the near 40% Johnson cited.\u00a0\nThe people who said yes were then asked the likelihood that they will live and work in another country in the next three years; 39.2% said \"very likely.\"\nSo the 39% figure is a subset of the 25% of Guatemalans who said they had an intention to leave their country. These specific set of questions did not ask where they\u2019d go.\n\u00a0In a May 6 tweet, the Vanderbilt research group said it wanted to clarify Prensa Libre\u2019s reporting, noting exactly to what the percentages corresponded.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACLARACI\u00d3N: Queremos precisar la informaci\u00f3n publicada por @prensa_libre. Solo 25.3% de los guatemaltecos tiene intenciones de emigrar. De este 25.3%, apenas 39.2% cree que es muy probable que lo haga en lo pr\u00f3ximos 3 a\u00f1os.

But since we did not, attempts to use our data to answer that question will require some assumptions and, depending on what those are, there is a range of answers that one could generate to the question.\"\nJohnson also mentioned the survey in the context of a conversation about illegal immigration. But the survey did not ask people if they intended to migrate legally or illegally.\nOur ruling\nJohnson said, \"There's a survey done in Guatemala. A third of Guatemalans intend to migrate to the United States. That's about 5.8 million people.\"\nA survey of Guatemalans showed that many of them intend to leave their country, and some data suggests that the United States is a considered destination.\u00a0\nBut Johnson\u2019s estimates are based on media reports that inaccurately presented survey results. Using the survey in the kind of way that Johnson did requires assumptions that go beyond the evidence.\nJohnson repeated poorly reported information about the survey results.
