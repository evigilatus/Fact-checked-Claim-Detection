That's either the biggest building or the biggest tax scam on record.\"", "truth_label": "half-true", "date": "stated on January 5, 2008 in a debate in Manchester, N.H.:", "title": "Yes, but it's not illegal", "text": "Thousands of subsidiaries, many from U.S. corporations, have indeed set up shop \u2014 or more precisely, hung a nameplate \u2014 at the five-story Ugland House and other financial centers in the Cayman Islands.\nThey include Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, General Motors, Intel, FedEx and Sprint.\nBut while Sen. Barack Obama is right on the general point, calling the practice \"the biggest tax scam on record\" is questionable. From the quote itself, it's hard to tell if Obama is taking issue with the way companies use the Caymans as a tax shelter, or if he's objecting to the U.S. tax code that makes it possible.\n\"There's nothing better than to beat up on a tax haven on a beach,\" said Douglas Shackelford, a professor at the University of North Carolina's business school. \"It sounds crooked, but if one really thinks about the facts, I don't see the grounding.\"\nWeather isn't drawing the corporations, of course. The Caymans do not have a corporate income tax. The United States taxes corporate income at 35 percent, higher than most countries.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Federal law allows the taxation of \"passive income,\" meaning the interest earned on profits of those subsidiaries. But typically the companies reinvest the money elsewhere, Shackelford said.\nObama is the co-sponsor of legislation that would crack down on offshore activities by corporations and individuals. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act would target an estimated $100-billion annually, including $30-billion from corporations.\nAccording to published financial reports, Coca-Cola alone saved $500-million in U.S. taxes in 2003 through foreign subsidiaries. Its Cayman company controls syrup-producing facilities in Ireland. The subsidiary pays taxes in Ireland at 12.5 percent, still far less than in the United States.\nSo, Obama is right that thousands of corporations, and some do say more than 12,000, are in one building in the Caymans, but he goes too far when he implies it's an illegal scam.
