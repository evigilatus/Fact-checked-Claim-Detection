So we expanded parts of this report to explain our reasoning in more detail. The rating remains the same. \nLast week President Barack Obama told immigration reform activists he would look into reducing deportations of illegal immigrants.\nThis follows criticism that Obama is falling short of his promises on comprehensive immigration legislation. Not only that, but over the last few years, some have gone as far as to call him \"deporter-in-chief.\"\nOn Univision\u2019s talk show Al Punto, a Spanish-language political talk show, host Jorge Ramos interviewed a political activist on March 9, 2014, about her choice to use that nickname in a recent speech.\n\"The truth is we\u2019re at the point of reaching 2 million deportations,\" said Janet Murgu\u00eda, National Council of La Raza president, in an interview PolitiFact translated from Spanish. \"For us, this is a historic level, more than any other president of the United States. Our community is in crisis, and this isn\u2019t acceptable.\"\nPolitiFact has looked into deportation statistics under the Obama administration, but not since he\u2019s started his second term. Let\u2019s see how deportations under Obama compare to those under previous presidents.\nLaura Vazquez, a senior immigration legislative analyst at La Raza, told us that Murgu\u00eda was referring to deportation numbers from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nICE publishes yearly immigration statistics. However, ICE numbers lump together two separate statistics: removals and returns. Removals are formal orders to leave the country issued by a judge. A return is a more desirable option for Mexican nationals that allows them to leave the country without a restriction on when they can re-enter with a visa. There aren\u2019t formal consequences attached with returns, and returns technically don\u2019t count as \"deportations,\"according to Homeland Security themselves.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia outlets routinely cite ICE numbers. Here, we chose not to. Those numbers aren\u2019t an accurate count of deportations, because they include returns. Also, ICE numbers don\u2019t include deportations conducted by Border Patrol officers. So when we hear the word \"deportations,\" the public\u2019s definition doesn\u2019t line up with how ICE defines the action.\nInstead, we elected to reference the other common source for deportation numbers, Homeland Security\u2019s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics. Here, we can count all the removals by fiscal year. This isn\u2019t a perfect assessment, because presidents\u2019 terms don\u2019t start on the same day new fiscal years do. We only have access to this data through fiscal year 2012, so we can\u2019t track Obama\u2019s most recent deportations.\nThe more comprehensive Homeland Security data dates back to 1892. Here, we\u2019ll take a closer look at deportations under Obama and other recent presidents. Deportations ramped up starting during the Clinton years.\n\n\n\nPresident\nFiscal years\nTotal deportations\nAverage deportations/year\n\n\n\n\nRonald Reagan\n1981-1988\n168,364\n21,046\n\n\nGeorge Bush\n1989-1992\n141,326\n35,332\n\n\nBill Clinton\n1993-2000\n869,646\n108,706\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush\n2001-2008\n2,012,539\n251,567\n\n\nBarack Obama\n2009-2012\n1,582,756\n395,689\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOn average, Obama is outpacing Bush by year. But since Obama hasn\u2019t yet served two full terms, Bush has still overseen more deportations than any other president. Because ICE data is a year ahead of this chart, we can see how Murgu\u00eda pegged Obama\u2019s deportations at closer to 2 million.\nThe most recent spike in deportations started at the end of the George W. Bush administration, said Pew Research Center associate Ana Gonzalez Barrera. In 2007, Bush increased the consequences for people illegally crossing the border, a strategy Obama has continued so far.\nOur ruling\nMurgu\u00eda defended her \"deporter-in-chief\" nickname for Obama by saying he\u2019s deported more people than any other president. Her office pointed to a set of statistics that counts departures in a different way than what most people would think of as deportations. We looked at statistics that used more a literal definition of deportation. By that standard, Obama is on track to outpace Bush by the end of his term, but he\u2019s not quite there yet, according to Homeland Security data. At nearly 1.6 million deportations, that's still some distance from\u00a0\"approaching 2 million.\"\nIt\u2019s too soon to say that Obama has deported more people than any other president. But with the information available, it looks like he\u2019s on track to do so. We rate\u00a0her claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08125"}
