Six judges -- Democrats and Republicans -- ruled in their favor and they won,\" he says. \"But Greg Abbott sided with the company against the victim. Saying the company had no responsibility.\" The words \"Kirby owed no duty\" appear on the screen, attributed to Abbott, a justice on the court from 1995 until 2001.\nA Davis campaign press release announcing the ad cited rulings issued in 1998, including the state Supreme Court\u2019s 6-3 majority opinion and a dissent from Abbott.\nCampaign spokesman Zac Petkanas also emailed us a web link to a Jan. 1, 1999, Associated Press news story stating the court at that time said the Kirby Company should have required its vacuum cleaner distributor to do a background check before hiring salesman Mickey Carter, which would have revealed previous complaints of sexual misconduct. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the Dec. 31, 1998, majority opinion written by Justice Raul Gonzalez, the court agreed with the Austin-based 3rd Court of Appeals that a mandate by Kirby, the manufacturer, that its vacuum cleaners be sold only through home demonstrations gave the company a role to play in who got hired to do door-to-door sales even though a company agreement with its distributors said otherwise.\n\"We hold that the company does owe such a duty,\" the court said. Specifically, the court said that \"because Kirby required in-home demonstrations, the company exercised sufficient control over the sale of its products to end-users to justify imposing a duty of reasonable care in selecting the persons who performed the demonstrations.\"\nKirby had argued its arrangements with vacuum cleaner distributors explicitly said the company shall exercise no control over the selection of individual salespeople. Kirby\u2019s contracts specified: \"The full cost and responsibility for recruiting, hiring, firing, terminating and compensating independent contractors and employees of distributor shall be borne by distributor.\"\nAbbott\u2019s dissent to the court\u2019s ruling, joined by Justice Priscilla Owen, said Kirby retained control over where the sales work was to be performed -- but not over who was to do that work. \"Failure to require background checks of potential dealers relates to who is a dealer, not where the dealer works,\" Abbott wrote. \"As a result, the requisite relation between the control retained and the alleged injury is missing. Because the Court holds to the contrary, I dissent.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbott summed up: \"In essence, the Court rewrites Kirby\u2019s Distributor Agreement and Independent Dealer Agreement to require Kirby to assume control over dealer selection.
