Ted Cruz, R-Texas, stressed the need to secure the border to keep out jihadists masquerading as refugees.\n\"President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing bringing tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to this country when the head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees,\" he said Dec. 15, 2015, on CNN. \u00a0\nIs it true that Obama\u2019s own FBI director, James Comey, said national security and intelligence officials can\u2019t screen Syrian refugees?\nThe Cruz campaign forwarded us a report on Comey\u2019s concerns over a bill put forward by Republicans that would toughen the refugee vetting process.\nThe bill would require Comey \u2014 and other top national security officials \u2014 to personally certify every single refugee admitted into the United States was not a security threat. Comey, appearing before Congress on Dec. 9, said he couldn\u2019t.\n\"Could I certify to there being no risk associated with an individual?\" he said. \"The bureau doesn't take positions on legislation, and we don't get involved in policy decisions. But that practically would be impossible.\"\nBut that\u2019s not the same standard Cruz mentioned during the debate.\nFor the record, the United States can vet the refugees through a process that involves the FBI as well as the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and other agencies. The vetting process can take up to two years, in which refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks.\nComey has stressed, in testimony before several different congressional committees, that there are challenges (namely, information gaps) to how we screen the refugees, and that there\u2019s no risk-free process. But, he said, we\u2019ve gotten \"dramatically\" better at the task in the past few years.\nHe never said that the federal agencies \"cannot vet\" refugees in as plain of terms as Cruz suggested. (Later in the debate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie made a similar claim as Cruz about Comey\u2019s remarks.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals. \u2026 I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps.\"\nComey made similar comments before the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21 and talked about the information gaps in more detail.\n\"If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but we are not going to -- there will be nothing show up because we have no record on that person,\" he said, adding, \"The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago. The bad news is, there is no risk-free process.\"\nA day later, on Oct. 22, Comey repeated his comments before the House Judiciary Committee: \"We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news. \u2026 The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich \u00a0set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria.\"\nOur ruling\nCruz said, \"The head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees.\"\nThe Cruz campaign pointed to comments Comey made about how he cannot personally vet every refugee admitted to the United States (required by a House bill that seeks to toughen the admissions process).\nBut the FBI director never said, as Cruz claims he did, that the government \"cannot vet\" refugees.\nComey has said there are challenges and gaps to the process and that there are always risks to admitting people from conflict zones. But he also said \u00a0the process is effective and has gotten more so in the past few years.\nWe rate Cruz\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05620"}
