Trump hasn\u2019t said he would end Social Security payments, but he has made comments that many have interpreted as him wanting to eliminate the payroll tax entirely.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s memo temporarily pauses the payroll tax, which funds Social Security\nOn Aug. 8, Trump issued a memo that directed the Treasury secretary to defer the withholding of the payroll tax on wages paid between Sept. 1 and Dec. 31. Each paycheck, employees see 6.2% of their wages go to Washington to help fund Social Security, while employers pay the same amount.\nThat means someone making the median weekly wage of about $1,000 would see an extra $62 in their paycheck. Trump\u2019s memo applies to people making up to $2,000 per week, so people who earn $104,000 a year or higher wouldn\u2019t get the tax break.\u00a0\nBy one estimate, the tax holiday would initially save taxpayers, or alternatively cost the Social Security Trust Fund, $100 billion.\u00a0\nThe longer term impacts are still unclear. Employees could be asked to pay the money back, though Trump has said he hopes to forgive the payments all together.\u00a0\nIf the money isn\u2019t paid back, Congress will need to find different funding to support Social Security, as it did during the Obama years. Or the Social Security trust funds end up running dry sooner than expected.\nRELATED: Claim about 'killing' payroll tax and Social Security needs more context\nTrump\u2019s use of the word \"terminate\"\nTrump never said he\u2019d terminate the Social Security program, but has talked about terminating the program\u2019s funding source.\u00a0\nWhile speaking, Trump used the words \"terminate\" or \"ending\" to describe his plans for the tax, although sometimes he described it as a possibility, while in other statements he sounded more forceful.\nSocial Security Works pointed to these statements by Trump:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

So I\u2019m going to make them all permanent. \u2026. But if I win, I may extend and terminate. In other words, I\u2019ll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nAt an Aug. 10 briefing, Trump said: \"I signed directives to give a payroll tax holiday, with the understanding that after the election \u2014 on the assumption that it would be victorious for an administration that\u2019s done a great job \u2014 we will be ending that tax. We\u2019ll be terminating that tax. \u2026 But the payroll tax is a big deal for people. It\u2019s a tremendous saving for people. And we\u2019re going to be doing it, and we intend to terminate it at the end of the appropriate period of time.\"\nJenna Ellis, a lawyer for the Trump campaign and Trump, tweeted: \"President Trump said if he is re-elected, he will look into terminating the payroll tax permanently!\"\nAs is often the case, we are left to try to interpret Trump\u2019s spoken words, which differ from how administration officials explain them.\n\"The logical conclusion of terminating the payroll tax is that all benefits will cease,\" said Linda Benesch, a spokesperson for Social Security Works.\nAdministration officials have argued that Trump wasn\u2019t calling for permanently getting rid of the payroll tax.\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, \"I believe he was referring to doing away with the payback of the deferral. And I think his intent here \u2014 and it's written in the E.O. \u2014 it's very clear \u2014 that we will take any steps possible to forgive this deferral. That's what he was actually saying.\"\nCNN\u2019s Dana Bash replied: \"That's what you're saying. That is not what the president said at all. He said the opposite.\"\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Trump can\u2019t unilaterally end the payroll tax; he needs Congress to agree. And while it\u2019s true that the payroll tax provides nearly 90% of the revenues for Social Security, Congress could decide to use another way to pay for the program. The program\u2019s promise to people exists outside of the funding mechanism.\u00a0\nEugene Steuerle, an economist at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, compared Trump\u2019s statements about terminating the Social Security payroll tax with his promises to create a substitute for Obamacare.\n\"It doesn\u2019t mean a lot until one gets a full proposal, but the difficulty in designing a proposal is that the tax money coming in is currently less than the benefit money going out,\" he said. \"So where would the money to pay beneficiaries come from after the modest trust fund becomes depleted more quickly? And how would benefits be determined?\"\nOur ruling\nSocial Security Works said, \"Donald Trump says he will \u2018terminate\u2019 Social Security if re-elected.\"\nTrump never said he will terminate Social Security, but he has discussed terminating the program\u2019s primary funding source. Administrative officials said that he was referring to doing away with the payback of the deferral.\nCongress and the president could find an alternative way to fund Social Security. Trump hasn\u2019t proposed such an alternative.\u00a0\nThe statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17092"}
