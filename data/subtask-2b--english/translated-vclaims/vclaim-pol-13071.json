Rodney Ellis listened to legislative history, saying in the debate in the Hall on May 16: \"Members, this legislature has voted to use almost every Rene Day box four times\" since its founding in the late 1980s. The sad truth is that Texas and the Box are being held hostage to politics. Previous story: GOP Gov. Rick Perry said he agreed to take about $3.1 billion from the fund, officially called the Economic Stability Fund, to help cover the state budget that lasts until August. However, Perry and many Republicans are opposed to benefiting from the 2012-2013 budget from the Fund, which is fed from government taxes for oil and gas production. Perry asserts that he needs protection in the event of natural disasters. Noting the projected shortfall in State revenue of billions of dollars required to maintain current programmes, the Democrats say that the current difficult circumstances justify obtaining more funds. Is Ellis right about the vote of the previous legislatures four times to actually empty the fund? Jeremy Warren, Elise's spokesman, said that the Senator had relied on a report from the Centre for Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank that advocated pro-poor programmes. In order to help balance the 2012-2013 budget, the Centre urged legislators to use the fund, which the State Comptroller Susan Combs expects to have a balance of $9.7 billion by the end of August 2013, or about $6.6 billion if legislators commit to applying $3.1 billion from the fund to the deficit this year. The Centre's report on 21 February states: \"In 1991, the legislature spent the entire fund balance ($28.8 million) on public schools, and in 1993, the entire balance ($197 million) on criminal justice. \"In 2003, to address the recent economic downturn, the Legislature allocated $1.3 billion from the Rainey Day Fund - almost every penny of the balance expected by the Comptroller (State) until 2005,\" says the report. \"Again in 2005, the Legislature allocated $1.9 billion in Rene Day funds, using almost half of them for shortfalls in 2005 and the other half for 2006-2007, and disbursed almost every $2 billion that was expected to be available.\" We then confirmed the amounts that could have been spent by legislators in each of these cases by reviewing the revenue projections for the biennium developed by the State observers concerned. Finally, the Library of Legislative References referred us to a report issued on 3 February by the Council of Representatives Research Organization, a non-partisan arm of the Texas House, determining the amount of funds allocated by legislative bodies from the Fund for 1991, 1993, 2003 and 2005. The punch line: The center's profile is accurate. We also appreciate that Israel cannot be realized. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13071"}
