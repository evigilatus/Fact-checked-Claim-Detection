In May, she claimed that we often miscalculated the loss of the population in the Chicago Metro region, which was questionablely attributed to the tax burden they faced. Recently, Lightfoot expanded its message on the crushing tax burden with a national comparison. \"We live in one of the most taxed cities and, unfortunately, the most taxed provinces in the country,\" she said in a debate in November. \"Low-income families, individuals and working families have borne a very heavy burden because our tax system, our fees and our fees, has been totally regressive.\" It is common for job seekers to complain about a wide range of tax burdens. However, such overwhelming data often oversimplify the issue. It was found that Lightfoot &apos; s claim was not an exception. The definition of \"most tax\" did not say that the people of Chicago lived in one of the most taxed cities and the most taxed provinces, but what it seemed to mean was that the people of Chicago were the most tax-prone because they had to pay high taxes on Cook County on the highest taxes in the high cities. \"Taxes and fees in Chicago and Cook County force low-income families like one that grew up outside this city,\" said Laysfoot in a statement sent us by e-mail through her campaign. \"It is clear that we cannot continue to treat low-income and middle-class families like an unlimited cash exchange machine.\" To support this, Lightfoot referred to over 300 different city charges that could be levied on the population, heavy property taxes and a combined sales tax rate of 10.25 per cent on most retail purchases in the city. However, the tax burden arrangement is a much more complicated exercise than it seems to be proposed. Take Chicago's sales tax, which is actually one of the highest in the country. But what this figure does not take into account is that Illinois, and therefore Chicago, applies sales tax more narrowly than many other places in the country at lower prices. Here, only a few services are taxed. Moreover, the purchase of groceries and drugs is taxed by a sharp discount, which means that the overall high rate alone does not guarantee the population of Chicago the payment of more sales taxes. Ron Alt, a research economist working with the Union of Tax Administrators, said that it was important to calculate both government and local taxes to determine where people paid most. The evaluation of local taxes in a vacuum could be misleading, as some states bore the most costs of local jobs, allowing municipalities to reduce their taxes. Illinois is among the states that pick up less, making local taxpayers bear the lion &apos; s share of the costs of public education, which contributes to higher domestic taxes here. Richard Okser, a co-researcher at the Centre for Urban Volcings Tax Policy, added that Chicago should be judged against other large cities in view of the scope of its economy and the range of public services it provides. He also stressed the need to assess the population bearing the greatest burden in any particular municipality. What the research shows with these factors in our minds is a report issued annually by the Washington, D.C. Government, which analyses the common tax burdens of the State and the local population at five different income levels facing the largest city in each state as well as the capital of the country. In 2017, under the Tax Act 2017, \"persons receiving less than $75,000 will receive their taxes in 2021 and every two years thereafter until 2027.\" By Louis Jacobson on February 5, 2021, this analysis shows that they do not miss a point - but only when it comes to low-income Chicagoans. A presumed family in Chicago, consisting of working parents and a school-age child earning $25,000, faces the fifth highest tax burden among those 51 jurisdictions. A similar family earns $50,000, at the same time, pays the top 10 in the main taxes. However, with the increase in the income of taxpayers in Chicago, their burden is lower than that of those with similar incomes in other large cities. Chicago's families make $75,000 and $100,000 both pay 16 top taxes, while families earn $150,000 rank 22 among their counterparts. In comparison with New York, where low-income people pay taxes that place them in the middle of the group at the national level, families earning more occupy the fifth highest spot compared to their peers. But this may say more about the city's tax policy because the tax cuts offered to New Yorkers are much more generous than the similar benefits of Illinois taxpayers. Local governments can also play a role in this regard because of State restrictions on the type of taxes. The provinces of Indiana, for example, control local income taxes to the state rate, but the Illinois Constitution prohibits local income taxes. In Marion Province, home to Indianapolis, the total individual rate is 5.25 per cent, which is 4.95 per cent higher than the income tax in Illinois. This helps explain why tax studies in the capital show that the burden on low-income families in Indianapolis is almost the same in Chicago, although nominal tax rates in Indiana are much lower. \"It's hard because we want to evaluate policymakers (local) about their political choices, but all these things work together,\" said Okser. Analysis of the capital requires a few other waivers, but they do not do much to move the case forward. The study uses tax rates in effect in 2016, before Illinois raises fixed income tax from 3.75 per cent to 4.95 per cent. However, Ocker said that the increase would probably not have a significant impact on the Chicago grade. While the report deals with government and local income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes and car taxes, it does not cover the many charges referred to by Lightfoot. The Urban Institute has found that these fees represent on average a larger share of local government revenue than local sales and local income taxes combined, although the analysis does not divide costs by specific cities. It is important to note that Lautfut claimed that the residents of Chicago were among the most tax-prone people, and not that they paid the most in fees. Our governor, Lightfoot, said, \"We live in one of the most taxed cities and, unfortunately, the most taxed provinces in the country.\" In this way, it meant that the people of Chicago are among the most tax-prone because they pay high taxes on the province and the city. It is clear that the fiscal burden in Chicago is being punished for the decline, with a bite greater than the total income of the poorest population coming out of the rich. This is not only a by-product of domestic tax policy, but also of State tax policy. So Lightfoot would have been right if she claimed that the low-income people of Chicago were among the most taxed inhabitants of the country. And her broader comments suggest that these residents were the focus of her attention. Instead, I made a comprehensive statement that played directly into a common but misleading narrative that everyone in Chicago paid high taxes with punishment. We assess her claim mostly wrong. In fact, this statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.
