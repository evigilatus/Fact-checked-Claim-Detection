He\u2019s still the legitimate president", "text": "Joe Biden was duly sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Jan. 20, despite false claims that the outgoing administration formulated a scheme with the military that would have kept Donald Trump as president for another four years.\nMany who believed these QAnon conspiracies have realized the so-called \"storm\" was never coming. But on social media, some are still trying to hold on to the baseless conspiracy theory in the face of evidence that shows otherwise.\nOne post shared widely on Facebook claims that Biden took a private jet to Washington D.C. for his inauguration, an indication, the post says, that Biden is not the legitimate president and that the military will soon take over the government.\n\"That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t send a government plane for the President-Elect,\" the lengthy post says, \"because they know he is not a legitimate President and, once he was sworn in, the government became illegitimate (belligerent) and the military is now responsible for restoring legitimate civilian government.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nBiden is in fact, the legitimate president, and the military is not taking over the government.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden, once a devoted Amtrak commuter, originally planned to travel to Washington by train from Delaware, but that plan changed when it was deemed too great a security risk. So he took a private jet, which was also a break from tradition.\u00a0\nUsually the outgoing administration provides a government plane to bring the president-elect to Washington for the inauguration. Trump, who refused to acknowledge Biden\u2019s victory until early January, opted to not attend the inauguration, becoming the first outgoing president in more than a century to skip the event.\nWe reached out to the White House, but couldn\u2019t confirm whether the Trump administration offered to provide transportation to the Bidens. CNN reported that \"a source familiar with the matter\" said the government didn\u2019t offer the Bidens a plane, but did not provide further details.\u00a0\nRegardless, Biden\u2019s form of travel has nothing to do with the legitimacy of his presidency. The post is simply repeating variations of claims for which there is no credible evidence or factual basis.\u00a0\nWe rate it False.\nRELATED: Don't fall for rumors about a Trump-led military takeover, emergency alerts", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19199"}
