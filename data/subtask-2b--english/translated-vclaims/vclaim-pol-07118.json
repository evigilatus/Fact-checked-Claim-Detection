He's gonna spend billions.", "text": "Government of the Republic. Nathan's got a new TV commercial that says his democratic opponent, Sun, the state of Jason Carter, plans to spend if he's elected. It is part of the Democratic Party &apos; s strategy to paint Democrats as a tax party and a distributor. \"Jesson Carter's plan: an increase in spending of $12.5 billion,\" says the novelist at some point. These are counter-expected because the State annual budget is about $21 billion. Polyte Fact decided to reconsider this case. The spokesman for the agreement, Jane Talber, said that the Governor &apos; s campaign had projected $12.5 billion based on Carter &apos; s pledges to fully re-finance education to 12 and expand the Medicaid programme. School systems have not been fully funded by the State since 2003. This has become a major issue in the Governor &apos; s race this year. This year &apos; s reduction in educational austerity is about $747 million, which is better than in the recent past. Talaber said that projections of $12.5 billion assumed that Carter would spend $1 billion a year in each of the next 10 years, a total of $10 billion, in order to fully recover funding for education. However, this also assumes that if a Governor is elected, Carter will serve more than the maximum of two terms (eight years) permitted by law. Secondly, it is assumed that the legislature, now under the control of the Republic, will follow its recommendation and approve the funds each year. Finally, for the coming year at least, $1 billion is no longer well. Although adjustments need to be made to factors such as school enrolment growth, school systems will require some $747 million for full funding, based on additional funds allocated to education this year as recommended in the agreement. The campaign is doing the same with the cost of Georgia to expand the medical assistance programme under the Affordable Care Act. This amount is expected to be $2.5 billion for a decade, not one year. That's what makes this look tricky on his face. However, the figure already exists, in the 2012 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which focused on the ACA expansion plan for medical assistance. If states sign, the federal government pays all costs to new entrants in 2015 and 2016 and at least 90 per cent thereafter. A similar case study projected a cost of approximately $2.1 billion - still in the same overall range. Missing from the spending claim: $31 billion to $35 billion of federal funds that will return to Georgia as it expands. In other words, Georgia &apos; s expenditure would yield a 17-fold return on actual dollar investment. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021, the mandate study expects that spending will also stimulate economic activity by $65 billion over the decade. \"Saying that the state must reach $2.5 billion alone is a mistake. There will be additional funds from the federal government,\" William S. Custer, author of the state report and Director of the Health Services Research Centre at the State University of Georgia. I strongly opposed the deal to expansion and say that there is little reason to believe that the highly indebted federal government will continue to pay 90 per cent of the costs in the distant future. As mathematics becomes more complex, Georgia must spend some $2 billion in projections, even without expansion, to meet the requirements of the anti-corruption law. But without expansion, there's no balance in federal money. From the point of view of the State budget, there are also areas where expansion can reduce spending. Studies do not calculate the low costs of State-funded health care for those imprisoned or in some mental health programmes, which can be transferred to an expanded medical assistance programme. Timothy Sweeney, Director of Health Policy at the Georgian Institute of Budgets and Left Policy, said that the State had not made the necessary calculations to identify potential savings, which were likely to need to be achieved on a case-by-case basis to determine eligibility for medical aid. However, Sweeney said \"large savings\" could be achieved. \"We already serve these people, funded by the state,\" said Sweeney. \"It is clear that the transfer of that service to federal funding will reduce the cost of the state.\" These figures help many health-care leaders in Georgia to push for expansion. However, State legislators supported the position of the agreement that expansion would be a fiscal trap with the adoption of Bill No. 990 last spring. This measure requires the GOP-controlled General Assembly to approve any expansion of Medicaid \"through an increase in the income threshold.\" This leaves a gap for Georgia to expand the programme only through a gap such as what Arkansas did, using the federal subsidy to purchase private health care insurance, not Medicaid. This leaves, to some extent, the fate of the expansion of the Medicaid programme - and the potential costs - in the hands of the legislature rather than the Governor. The Declaration states that Carter's plans will entail taxes on small businesses and middle class, which Carter categorically denies. Carter is called \"Silver's tongue\" and \"untrustworthy.\" Carter says that additional funding for education will come from cuts in government waste, tax recovery and economic growth. This is the usual joke of the campaign. (We have ruled that half of Carter's claim that funding for education can increase significantly if the State goes after $2.5 billion in tax arrears. However, what about the claim that Carter's plan would cost $12.5 billion? These cost projections cannot be taken seriously. They're for 10 years -- longer than Carter can legally be in office. They ignore other critical facts -- and legislators must sign off on any major expenditure. We're assessing the advertising claim as false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07118"}
