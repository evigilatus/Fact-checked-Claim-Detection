No, no. These are serious. You read about it.\"\u00a0\n\"I said, \u2018No, thank you. No, thank you. No, thank you, madam mayor. We're going to keep the Washington Monument just the way it is.\u2019 These people. These people are crazy.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s comment mischaracterized the recommendations of a city commission that spent the summer reviewing the namesakes of more than 1,300 schools, buildings, parks, streets, public spaces and monuments throughout the nation\u2019s capital.\u00a0\nThe working group suggested that the city rename a number of its properties, often because of the namesakes\u2019 connections to slavery, systemic racism or other forms of social injustice. It also called on Bowser to urge the federal government to \"remove, relocate or contextualize'' eight federal statues and memorials, including the Washington Monument.\nBut Bowser never recommended that the city \"take down\" the Washington Monument or \"close up\" the Lincoln Memorial. The Lincoln Memorial was never mentioned in the commission\u2019s report, which has since been edited to remove the recommendations for federal properties.\nSituated on the National Mall, both the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial are on federal land, putting them outside of the control of Bowser or the city government. Renaming them would require action from Congress, according to DCist.\nThe mayor\u2019s office and Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\nBowser didn\u2019t call for removing the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial\nBowser convened the working group in July following unrest in Washington and elsewhere over the May police killing of George Floyd, a Black man from Minneapolis.\u00a0\nThe purpose of the commission, Bowser said on Twitter, was to ensure that the legacies of people honored with their names on buildings or other public spaces were consistent with the city\u2019s values. In a 24-page report published in September, the commission laid out whether certain city-owned facilities should be \"removed, renamed or contextualized.\"\nThe group looked primarily at whether the namesakes had \"key disqualifying histories,\" such as participation in slavery, systemic racism or the mistreatment of minority groups. It suggested that the city rename 21 of its public schools; nine of its residential buildings and campuses; 12 of its parks, fields and playgrounds; and seven of its government buildings.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelevant to Trump\u2019s claim, the commission also recommended that Bowser use her position on the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission to lobby the federal government to \"remove, relocate or contextualize\" eight federal properties.\u00a0\nThe report did not specify what it was recommending for each of the properties listed, which included iconic landmarks such as the Jefferson Memorial and Washington Monument, both named for former presidents who enslaved people.\u00a0\nBut the rollout of the report was met with criticism from the White House and the president\u2019s allies, some of whom misrepresented the report\u2019s intentions as calling\u00a0for the removal of the Washington Monument, according to the Washington Post.\u00a0\nTo address the confusion, Bowser had\u00a0the report shortened by a page, removing the page related to federal properties. LaToya Foster, a spokesperson for Bowser\u2019s office, told the Washington Post the commission\u2019s proposal for the federal properties was \"contextualizing, not removing.\"\n\"Mayor Bowser has asked the (committee) to clarify and refine their recommendations to focus on local D.C.,\" Foster said, according to the Washington Post.\n\nWashington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser speaks during a news conference on Sept. 4, 2020, in Washington. (AP/Brandon)\n\"My expectation of the report was that it would not include any recommendations on federal buildings,\" Bowser said in a Sept. 3 press conference. \"When I saw the final report, and I could see immediately how its recommendations could be easily misconstrued or purposely misconstrued, so we removed it.\"\nFactCheck.org, the Associated Press and USA Today previously debunked social media posts that, like Trump, wrongly accused Bowser of calling for the Washington Monument\u2019s removal.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"We have a mayor in D.C. who formed a commission with recommendations. Her recommendation is: Take down the Washington Monument, close up the Lincoln Monument. No, no. These are serious.\"\nBowser has not petitioned for tearing down the Washington Monument or Lincoln Memorial.\u00a0\nA report from a working group she established in July did urge her to encourage the federal government to \"remove, relocate or contextualize\" the Washington Monument, not the Lincoln Memorial. But the mayor had the references to federal monuments deleted from the report, and her office quickly clarified that the commission\u2019s call was for \"contextualizing, not removing.\"\u00a0\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18776"}
