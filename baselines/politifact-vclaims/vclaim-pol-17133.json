The post points down to an image of a Fox News television graphic that reads:\u00a0\n\"Masks should only be used by healthcare workers, caretakers or by people who are sick with symptoms like fever and cough.\"\nThe post, which has been shared more than 10,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThere\u2019s nothing about this post that happened in the last 24 hours, other than people spreading it as misinformation.\nThe quote is from at least as early as March, according to Fox News.\nAnd the image is likely from late May or early June.\nHow to tell the image is out of date\nThe Fox News graphic includes the composite index of the Nasdaq Stock Market in the bottom right corner. The index measured 9,415.23 at the time the photo was taken.\nThe Nasdaq has stayed above 10,000 since July 1, according to Marketwatch. It hasn\u2019t been at 9,415 since mid-June.\n\nThe text on the graphic tracks with a Fox News story published online May 28, which said that the World Health Organization was only recommending healthy people wear masks in cases where they were in contact with someone infected with COVID-19.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story includes the same quote referenced in the image.\u00a0\n\"If you do not have any respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough or runny nose, you do not need to wear a mask,\" Dr. April Baller, a public health specialist for the WHO, says in a video on the world health body's website posted in March. \"Masks should only be used by health care workers, caretakers or by people who are sick with symptoms of fever and cough.\"\n\nWhat WHO says now\nThe post we\u2019re checking doesn\u2019t claim WHO said not to wear a mask in March or April or May. It made the claim that the guidance happened in the last 24 hours \u2014 meaning the middle of August.\nA search of the World Health Organization website shows that\u2019s not the case.\nIn an FAQ, the international health organization says it recommends that people always consult local authorities on recommended practices in their area.\n\"If there is widespread community transmission, and especially in settings where physical distancing cannot be maintained, governments should encourage the general public to wear a fabric mask. WHO also provides details on the composition of a fabric mask and how to safely wear one,\" WHO writes.\nOur ruling\nA post says, \"As of the last 24 hours this is the protocol regarding masks: Masks should only be used by healthcare workers, caretakers or by people who are sick with symptoms like fever and cough.\"\nThe post was shared Aug. 14, and has more than 10,000 shares on Facebook.
