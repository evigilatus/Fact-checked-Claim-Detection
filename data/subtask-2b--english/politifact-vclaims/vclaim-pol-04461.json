Debbie Wasserman Schultz and challenger Tim Canova. The South Florida district is heavily Jewish, and Israel has been skeptical of the deal.\nIn a mailer, Canova sided with three Jewish members of Congress who voted against the deal.\n\"In challenging times Israel needs true friends in Congress. When called on to protect Israel, some legislators step up,\" states the mailer, showing photos of U.S. Reps.\u00a0Ted Deutch and Lois Frankel of Palm Beach County and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York. \"Others don\u2019t. Debbie Wasserman Schultz waffled back and forth before voting for the Iran nuclear deal, choosing party and personal political ambition over principle.\"\nBut how would Canova have voted on the deal? His answers haven\u2019t been clear. In a debate on CBS4, host Jim DeFede asked Canova to clarify his position.\nWe decided to look at Canova\u2019s statements about the Iran deal and put them on our Flip-O-Meter, which examines a candidate\u2019s record on a topic without casting a value judgment on any changes. We found that Canova hasn\u2019t really changed position, but he hasn\u2019t always provided full answers, either.\n(Canova isn\u2019t Jewish, but his stepfather is Jewish, and Canova said he has spent time in Israel including living on a kibbutz, a communal living area. Wasserman Schultz was the first Jewish woman from Florida elected to Congress.)\nCanova\u2019s statements about Iran nuclear deal\nIn 2015, Iran and five other world powers\u00a0reached a deal. The agreement aims\u00a0to extend the time it would take for Iran to make a nuclear bomb, subjects some of Iran\u2019s major nuclear facilities to constant monitoring and creates conditions for lifting economic sanctions against Iran.\nWasserman Schultz announced she would support the deal, saying that it wasn\u2019t perfect but that it \"promotes the national security interests of the United States and our allies and merits.\"\nOn his website, Canova doesn\u2019t say how he would have voted; however, he says that he would not support scrapping it.\n\"While I have criticized several deficiencies in the Iran nuclear deal (no international agreement is ever perfect), now that it has been entered into, I support its full implementation,\" he wrote.\nCanova has repeatedly outlined his criticisms of the deal, including that Iran \"can simply mothball rather than destroy the centrifuges, thereby allowing them to restart a nuclear program for military use in the future.\" He also criticizes the inspection protocols and the relief of sanctions.\nCanova\u2019s most complete statements about his position on the Iran deal stem came in an interview with the Sun Sentinel editorial board in August 2016.\n\"I expressed reservations and criticism about the Iran agreement,\" Canova said. \"Now that it has been adopted, I am for strict implementation.\"\nWhen interviewed by Sentinel reporter Anthony Man, Canova acknowledged that he had made some conflicting statements.\nMan: \"You earlier this year said that you would have voted for it.\"\nCanova: \"Oh, I\u2019ve been quoted both ways.\"\nMan: \"You told me you would have voted for it. Is that accurate?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichele Bachmann\n\n\nstated on November 22, 2011 in a foreign policy debate in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that \"if he has a nuclear weapon he will use it to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. He will use it against the United States of America.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 November 23, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanova: \"I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s accurate. Look, I\u2019m not going to sort of play that game. I don\u2019t know exactly how I would have voted because I wasn\u2019t sitting in the seat, but I do know I criticized some aspects of it.\"\nMan: \"In January, you said the deal wasn\u2019t perfect, but you would have voted for it under the circumstances. You don\u2019t believe that anymore?\"\nCanova: \"I don\u2019t know if I would have voted for it. ... In a conversation when you called me at home you caught me off guard, I was a candidate for about a week. Did I say that? Maybe. I honestly don\u2019t know how I would have voted for it.\"\nEditorial page editor Rosemary O\u2019Hara asked Canova, if the deal was on the table today, how he would have voted.\nCanova: \"I don\u2019t know. ... I\u2019m not a member of Congress, I didn\u2019t have any kind of briefings the way Debbie Wasserman Schultz did, so I don\u2019t think it's fair for me to say I would have voted for it, (or) I would have voted against it. I don\u2019t know.\"\nIn a debate on CBS4\u2019s Facing South Florida on Aug. 14, host Jim DeFede asked Canova if he would have voted for or against the agreement.\n\"When the question is asked as a hypothetical -- would I have seen classified information -- that\u2019s when I have said who knows,\" Canova said. \"But quite frankly I can say right here that was not a good agreement for a couple reasons. First of all, Iran is the biggest funder of Hezbollah and Hamas, (and) to release $100 billion in assets (to Iran) right away without doing it incrementally is what I found to be dangerous and unsettling. And quite frankly, my position is the same as dozens of other Democrats who voted against the agreement.\"\nWe looked for other statements Canova made about his own position on the Iran deal.\n\"She voted for the Iran deal, and I\u2019m against the agreement,\" he told The Forward in July.\nRichard Bell, Canova\u2019s campaign manager, told PolitiFact Florida that The Forward doesn\u2019t fully explain his position.\nOn Aug. 1, according to the Times of Israel, Canova told the Sunny Isles Beach Democratic Club: \"I was critical of the Iran agreement. How would I have voted? I can\u2019t tell you, I wasn\u2019t a member of Congress.\"\nBell told PolitiFact Florida that Canova\u2019s position on the Iran nuclear agreement has been consistent.\n\"He is critical of specific aspects of the Iran deal,\" Bell said. \"Now that it\u2019s been adopted, he is for its full and strict implementation.\"\nWe agree that Canova has been consistent in his criticisms and in bashing Wasserman Schultz for supporting the deal.\nOur ruling\nCanova has acknowledged that he has \"been quoted both ways\" on how he would have voted the Iran deal.\nHe said in January that he would have voted for it, but later in the campaign said multiple times that he didn\u2019t know how he would have voted. He sent a mailer that didn\u2019t say how he would have voted but sided with opponents.\nHe has been consistent in criticizing the specifics of the deal and in criticizing Wasserman Schultz for her support for it.\nBecause Canova\u2019s position on the Iran deal has been unclear at different times, we give him a Half Flip.\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2064790e-a998-485a-b7a8-3c25ab8b2d22", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04461"}
