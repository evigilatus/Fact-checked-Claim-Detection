That\u2019s going to happen. The other thing, very important: I believe wages will start going up. They haven\u2019t gone up for a long time.\"\nIs Trump correct that wages \"haven\u2019t gone up for a long time?\" Short answer: No. They\u2019re going up now, in fact.\nWhile it\u2019s true that wages were stagnant for several years -- especially after the Great Recession -- they have been on an upward swing since early 2014.\nWe put together the following chart showing median, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings for wage and salaried workers, 16 years of age and older, going back to 1979:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt shows that for much of the time between 2012 and 2014, median weekly earnings were lower than they were in 1979 -- a frustrating disappearance of any wage growth for 35 years.\nBut that began changing in 2014. After hitting a low of $330 a week in early 2014, wages have risen to $354 a week by early 2017. That\u2019s an increase of 7.3 percent over a roughly three-year period.\n\"In this case, you can say the president is flatly wrong,\" said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. \"Real wages have been rising more slowly than anyone wishes, except perhaps employers. Nonetheless, they have been rising.\"\nBurtless noted that the increases for a subset of all workers -- \"production and non-supervisory employees\" -- have been occurring for even longer. They\u2019ve gone up every month but two since late 2012.\nJed Kolko, the chief economist with the jobs site Indeed.com, added that \"not only have wages gone up overall, but wages are now increasing most for people with less education. So, wage gains aren't being driven only by top earners.\" He provided this chart, showing that non-college full-time employees have been growing by 3 percent to 4 percent a year.\n\nThe White House did not respond to an inquiry.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that wages \"haven\u2019t gone up for a long time.\"\nThat was once accurate, but it\u2019s significantly out of date. Wages have been increasing for the past three to five years, depending on the measurement you use.
