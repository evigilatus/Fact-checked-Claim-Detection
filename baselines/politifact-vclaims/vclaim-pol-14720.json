Ted Strickland has long campaigned on being a champion of education, even going so far as to inject himself into the landmark school funding decision in Ohio back when he was a congressman.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that the Democratic governor is peppering \u00a0his campaign speeches with references to increasing school funding.\n\nFor example, in a July 6, 2010, speech in Columbus, Strickland lamented funding cuts done in several other states before saying \"in Ohio, we invested in our children, raising school funding by 5.5 percent in the last budget.\"\n\nThe claim is such a popular theme with Strickland, we decided to look more closely at his assertion.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the total pot of money going to funding primary and secondary schools in Ohio will grow by 5.5 percent during the current two-year state budget that ends in July 2011, it\u2019s not state aid that is responsible for the hike. State aid to schools will actually be lower by about $32 million--from $6.542 billion in 2009 to $6.510 billion in 2011. On a district-by-district level, that means about 60 percent of the more than 600 school districts in Ohio will get less money for operations in the current two-year budget cycle than they did before.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s federal money, including stimulus funding dollars which makes the statewide school funding pie bigger. And a large portion of the federal funding for primary and secondary education must be funneled into very specific programs such as $922 million statewide in combined federal Title I and IDEA funding. Title I money must be spent on things like additional teachers, intervention specialists for low-income students. IDEA funds must be spent on the education of special needs children.\n\nThe natural impression left by the governor\u2019s words \"we invested in our children, increasing school funding\" is that Ohio\u2019s state government took steps to increase the amount it puts toward education. In fact, it was the federal government that has invested more in Ohio\u2019s children. And six out of 10 Ohio schools districts have less money to spend on operations than they did in the previous budget under Strickland.\n\nWe find the governor\u2019s claim to be False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14720"}
