Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is the latest politician to be accused by social media users of doing something ridiculous that never happened.\nA photo shared on Facebook repeats claims from March 2019 that Harris \"introduced a bill to forbid a police officer from drawing his/her gun without permission from their supervisor.\"\nThe post further says that \"a police officer could not return fire without first notifying his/her supervisor and getting permission.\"\nThe post has garnered dozens of shares and angry comments about Harris being a \"moron\" for introducing such a proposal.\nA user called this bill \"bull----\" \u2014 and we must agree. No such bill exists. This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Among all 184 bills introduced by Harris in 2019, there is no bill introduced in 2019 by that name.\nThe story keeps resurfacing\nThe story, originally published by the Blue News Network, has been circulating online without a proper disclaimer since March 12. According to our friends at FactCheck.org, the story has been shared on several blogs and other media, including the \"The Ben Ferguson Show,\" a conservative U.S. radio talk show.\nDespite the fact the story was debunked by several fact-checking organizations, it keeps circulating on social media, as well as on a forum and other sites. Without a satire disclaimer, people believe it's real.\nOur ruling\nThe claim that Harris tried to make officers ask permission to fire their weapons lost all of its satirical markings as it traveled across social media. The claim is ridiculous, so we rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00744"}
