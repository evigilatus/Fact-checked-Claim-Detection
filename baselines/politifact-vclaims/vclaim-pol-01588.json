Since other types of businesses are not included, the data does not encompass all new businesses in the state.\nAnother point to note: The tweet cites business registrations, but not business closings.\n\"The number of businesses that are \u2018born\u2019 and \u2018die\u2019 in a given year (would) provide a more accurate portrayal of business conditions overall,\" said Brian Lego, a research assistant professor of economic forecasting at West Virginia University.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data is compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, though data for both births and deaths is available only through the first quarter of 2017.\nHere\u2019s a chart showing trends on business births and deaths in West Virginia.

This comes off the heels of a 12 percent increase in new business registrations during 2016.\"\nThe data cited in the tweet is solid. However, it looks only at certain types of business births. Looking at data for both business births and deaths shows a less rosy picture for business creation in the state.\nThe statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2018-09-20 17:38:08 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"In 2017, the number of new business registrations in West Virginia grew nearly 11 percent (8,318 new businesses registered for the year).
