Jay Roberts, R-Ocilla, who spearheaded the bill, said about 85 percent of the hotel guests who pay the fee will be from outside Georgia.\n\"This shifts some of the burden to visitors who will have to share the costs to modernize the transportation network in Georgia,\" said Roberts, now a planning director for the state Department of Transportation, during floor debate on the final bill.\nThe state\u2019s hospitality industry, though, was blindsided by the last-minute addition of the fee and has claimed it will hurt business and Georgians.\nThe Georgia Convention and Visitors Bureau points to a survey of hoteliers that shows about a third of leisure guests are in-state tourists. Those people will already be paying an average of 6 cents more a gallon for gas when the law takes effect July 1.\nSo who is right? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check.\nFirst, remember we already checked a claim that the fee will hurt Georgia\u2019s convention business by adding extra costs for large groups coming to the state.\nWe ruled Mostly True with a caveat: There is nothing that says the new fee must be passed along to hotel guests.\nIn fact, looking at data from Savannah-area hotels, those businesses would be better off absorbing the cost \u2013 about $18.7 million a year, based on published occupancy rates \u2013 than passing it along and potentially chasing away 7.5 percent of room nights. That would cost hotels about $22.5 million.\nBut if hotels pass them along to guests, where are those folks from?\nRoberts said he cited his figure based on memory of lawmakers\u2019 debates on funding for the new Falcons stadium.\n\"I remember \u2026 that we were told that approximately 85 percent of the people that stay in the metro Atlanta motels/hotels are from out of state,\" Roberts said.\nIn fact, Roberts underestimated slightly. \u00a0According to a website run by stadium advocates, 86 percent of overnight guests in the state\u2019s largest hotel market are from outside Georgia.\nSo where does the Georgia CVB get its figures?\nFrom the 2013 Georgia Longwood study that looked at both statewide figures as well as Atlanta, which has 94,000 of the state\u2019s 177,000 hotel rooms.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVernon Jones\n\n\nstated on June 3, 2010 in a candidate forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Four years as a congressman, he [U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson] never talked about MARTA.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Stirgus \u2022 June 27, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat report concluded 31 percent of leisure guests \u2013 that is, not including business travelers, conventioneers or people traveling with social groups like a church or school trip \u2013 were in-state travelers. For the Atlanta region, in-state travelers accounted for only 20 percent of the total.\n\"Almost half of the state\u2019s hotel rooms are in the Atlanta metro, so you need to look at the figures in other regions to get a more clear picture of how many Georgians are affected by this fee,\" said Julie Ford Musselman, head of the Georgia CVB.\nThat picture is a bit fuzzy, given that there is no single way that regions reported where their guests were from and what kind of guests they were.\nHotels in the Lake Lanier area, for instance, reported based on the number of leisure and group bookings, with Georgians making up 73 percent and 56 percent, respectively.\n\"We have not done an aggregate study for every category, but looking at what we have, we can say that most definitely the $5 fee impacts Georgians more heavily than anyone realized when they passed this transportation bill,\" Musselman said. \"The ability to book business and keep our existing customer base, in every market, is our concern.\"\nBruce Seaman, an economics professor at Georgia State University who had helped PolitiFact Georgia with the business costs in our previous fact check, agrees.\nMore specifically, he said, the question of how the fee affects every region of the state is a salient economic point.\nAnd, while the hospitality industry cannot provide verifiable answers, neither could state lawmakers before passing the bill that included the fee.\nEven Atlanta, while less susceptible to the fee, could potentially see increased competition from out-of-state tourist or business spots.\nNo one can say for sure, Seaman said, because there was no study.\n\"There has not been enough careful analysis done on this,\" Seaman said. \"There are clearly going to be differential regional effects. The numbers are plausible, but we don\u2019t know what they will mean.\"\nOur ruling\nThe state lawmaker who helped Georgia pass a nearly $900 million bill to tackle the state\u2019s backlog of road and bridge work said a hotel fee in the bill would help shift the burden to out-of-state visitors.\nJay Roberts was correct with his numbers, at least in the largest hotel market in the state.\nBut hoteliers have a point that the fee could hit more Georgians in the state\u2019s smaller cities and regions, even if the numbers vary by the type of visitors staying.\nRoberts implied the 85 percent out-of-state figure was statewide, even if his citation was clearly only for metro Atlanta.\nHe was accurate, but the statistic needs more information to be fully understood.\nWe rate his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06386"}
