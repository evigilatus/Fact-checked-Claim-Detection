The image places daily COVID-19 deaths from those days alongside death tolls from the Galveston Hurricane, the battle of Antietam, Pearl Harbor and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\nThis post, which was forwarded to us by a reader,\u00a0was also\u00a0flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our\u00a0partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nMost of the figures cited are accurate and the general thrust of the claim is valid: The pandemic has produced staggeringly high daily death counts that reached 3,411 on Dec. 9 \u2014 a high that came after the image was created. Families have relayed haunting stories of heartbreak as their loved ones have died in isolation without the comfort of family members close by.\u00a0\nHowever, the post contains some problems: It does not take into account daily deaths not linked to a specific cause, and it omits some historical events that resulted in greater numbers of fatalities.\nImage doesn\u2019t actually show \"deadliest days\"\nAlthough the image purports to be a list of the \"deadliest days in American history,\" it only lists fatalities related to specific mass-fatality events. It leaves out the number of deaths from all causes.\u00a0\nFor example, the list cites Dec. 4, 2020, as having a death toll of 2,861.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s true that 2,861 people were reported on that day to have died of COVID-19, according to the CDC\u2019s Data Tracker. This number doesn\u2019t include any of the people who died from causes besides COVID-19, such as murder, heart attacks or cancer.\u00a0\nIn 2017, an average of 7,708 deaths occurred each day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0\nOther historical events omitted from the chart\nThe list doesn\u2019t provide an accurate list of the top eight deadliest days in American history.\u00a0\nPerhaps the most notable omission from the list is also the most directly analogous to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 1918 flu pandemic savaged the United States between Sept. 1 and Dec. 31, 1918, killing an estimated 381,019 people in those four months alone. That\u2019s an average of around 3,123 people per day.\u00a0\nOther notable mass fatality events left out of the chart include:\n\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg, where an estimated 10,000 soldiers were either mortally wounded or killed over three days of fighting.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which killed 3,400 people according to an official fatality count conducted by archivist Gladys Hansen.\u00a0\n\n\nThe San Ciriaco hurricane, which killed 3,369 people in Puerto Rico on Aug. 8, 1899.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Lake Okeechobee hurricane, which killed an estimated 2,500-3,000 people on Sept. 16, 1928.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd while the chart seems to focus on events that have claimed lives on U.S. soil, it does not explicitly say that. The D-Day invasion during World War II claimed the lives of 2,501 Americans, according to the National D-Day Memorial Foundation.\nLiz Skilton, an associate professor of history at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, who specializes in natural disasters, disapproved of the way the image compared different types of disastrous events by placing them side by side.\n\"Different types of disasters rarely ever can be compared directly as there are different sets of hazards and reactions to these hazards that influence the outcome of events,\" she said. \"This is not to say disasters cannot be compared at all, it just means that making direct comparisons between them in an oversimplified way is damaging to our understanding of their impact and could even harm our ability to react to these incidents appropriately.\"\nThe chart gets some things right\nAll that said, the numbers that the chart does rely on are generally accurate.\u00a0\nThe Battle of Antietam resulted in about 3,600 deaths, and the attack on Pearl Harbor resulted in about 2,400 deaths according to the National Park Service.\u00a0\nThe Galveston Hurricane of 1900 killed an estimated 8,000 to 12,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\u00a0\nThe 9/11 attacks killed an estimated 3,000 people according to the 9/11 Commission Report.\nThe COVID-19 deaths in the chart are taken directly from the CDC\u2019s Data Tracker.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA viral image claims that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused 4 of the 8 \"deadliest days in American history.\"\nThe image omits some historical events and only lists fatalities linked to specific causes.\u00a0\nHowever, the broad claim of the image is accurate: the COVID-19 pandemic has seen daily death totals that have surpassed those of events memorialized as national tragedies, including Pearl Harbor and 9/11.\u00a0\nWe rate this image Half True.\u00a0\u200b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17271"}
