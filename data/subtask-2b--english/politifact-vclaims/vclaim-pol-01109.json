He tended bar in Austin, Texas, during the South by Southwest music festival in 2010. He crashed an engagement photo shoot in 2014. Now, he\u2019s seemingly offering tax advice\u2014at least according to an old viral image that\u2019s appearing on Facebook again.\n\"The best way to teach your kids about taxes is by eating 30% of their ice cream,\" reads the text next to a picture of a young, blonde boy wailing. It\u2019s attributed to Bill Murray, and in the corner is the logo for Turning Point USA, a conservative group that advocates for limited government and free markets.\nBut the quote has appeared elsewhere, on Pinterest, Goodreads and The Federalist Papers among other websites. Turning Point USA, responding to a message from PolitiFact seeking more information about the quote, noted that it is \"all over the internet and has been for a long time\" before directing us to CBS News\u2019s website. There, the quote is featured in an undated photo slideshow called \"Comedians\u2019 best lines of financial wisdom.\"\nStill, this photo was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

When the quote appeared on Reddit about a year ago, users were also suspicious.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don\u2019t think Bill Murray said this,\" one comment says. \"It doesn\u2019t even sound like a joke he would make,\" another user pointed out. Someone else tagged the post, simply: \"Not Bill Murray.\"\nWe couldn\u2019t find credible evidence that the actor opined about the IRS. Murray himself is notoriously hard-to-reach. But we did find the ice cream quote in one more place: on Twitter, where in March 2014 a Bill Murray parody account with the handle @billmurray tweeted it.\n\"I AM NOT BILL MURRAY,\" the account\u2019s bio says. \"This account is not in any way affiliated with the actor Bill Murray.\"\nWe rate this claim False.\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2019-01-22 18:23:24 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Bill Murray said \"The best way to teach your kids about taxes is by eating 30% of their ice cream.\"    Viral image On the internet     Tuesday, January 8, 2019 2019-01-08    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01109"}
