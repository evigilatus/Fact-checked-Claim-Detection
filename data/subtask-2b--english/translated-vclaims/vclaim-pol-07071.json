Although it has never been proven, the story says that a few days before the polls were opened, a democratic activist in New York presented men from the mission to save Milwaukee in exchange for their votes. Governor Tucker Carlson referred to this episode during the Fox News prank at noon. \"I don't think as a general matter you should encourage people who don't know anything about what they're voting for,\" said Carlson. \"This is what Democrats do, giving Newport to the homeless to get them to the polls. That's literally true. Republicans shouldn't follow suit. \"You don't have to shop for people.\" One of the readers asked us to check whether there was any substance to Carlson's drilling in Democrats. The main events in Milwaukee on Saturday before the elections in November 7, 2000 were Connie Millstein, an old democratic donor from New York, in Milwaukee. Melstein and some colleagues went to the mission and offered to take anyone interested to the city hall to take the absentee ballot. About 20 men accepted the show, and at some point, 10 of them received a pack of cigarettes each. However, we do not know whether cigarettes were pre-produced or were subsequently ordered to smoke and were treated with a full pack. We don't know if the promise of cigarettes is in exchange for a vote. In Wisconsin, it is illegal to give a person anything worth more than one dollar to urge him to vote. The cost of cigarettes is about $3.25 for the package. The Republicans shouted a mistake and pressured local prosecutors to press charges against Millstein. The Public Prosecutor's Office of Milwaukee District was reluctant, even if it could have cost thousands of dollars to bring the case to trial. After months, after an investigation, Assistant Attorney General Kurt Pinkley said that he did not believe that the evidence established that anyone was guilty. In May 2001, Melstein agreed to pay $5,000 in civil forfeiture, a statutory period that does not confess guilt and closes the case. Milstein's lawyer, Stephen Glenn Bondett Fuckett, reported that there was no evidence of a corresponding (smoking to vote). \"No one said, \"If I go to vote, I will receive cigarettes,\" said Glenn. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. However, Al Gore's campaign removed itself from Milstein and issued a statement immediately after the event that its efforts were not \"the kind of help we ask and are the kind of help we refuse.\" We e-mailed Carlson and asked for any background information he could provide for his statement. We didn't hear a reply. We didn't find another example of offering cigarettes to voters. Why Newports? The weirdest feature of Carlson's statement is that he specifically named Newport cigarettes. The assistant D.A. said he didn't know where this came from because the cigarette brand had nothing to do with the case. \"These facts were not to interfere in the public domain,\" said Binkley. He added: \"I don't remember the brand.\" To sum up: Newport brand seems to be inventing. The governor Carlson said that Democrats give Newport to the homeless to take them to the polls. On the basis of the evidence, Carlson cites an isolated case where the authorities could not prove that the votes were traded with cigarettes, or that the cigarettes were a temptation. On one occasion in Milwaukee, three Democrats delivered displaced men to the city hall to vote for absentees. At some point, they gave some guys cigarettes. There is no evidence that the cigarettes were from Newport, and the investigators did not find that the cigarettes were offered as an incentive to vote. Calson confirmed that his novel was \"perfectly correct,\" but by that standard, it's inaccurate at several points. We value the claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07071"}
