I don\u2019t want to go down the path to Spain.\"\n\nWe looked into the scale of government in a previous item, which we\u2019ll update here with the most recent figures.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget produces a table every year that tracks total government expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product. Here are the statistics for the past few fiscal years in question:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFiscal year 2007: 30.9 percent\nFiscal year 2008: 32.6 percent\nFiscal year 2009: 37.1 percent\nFiscal year 2010: 35.4 percent\nFiscal year 2011: 35.4 percent\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo by this measurement, Romney\u2019s 42 percent figure is a little high.\n\nHowever, there is another measurement that backs up Romney\u2019s claim. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development -- a group that includes most of the world\u2019s advanced industrialized countries -- found that government expenditures accounted for 42 percent of the U.S. economy in 2009 (compared to 45.8 percent for Spain).\n\nSince the OMB data showed that government spending as a share of the economy peaked in 2009 before declining, likely because it was the first year of the recession, it seems reasonable to assume that the percentage will drop for subsequent years once the next OECD calculations are released. Still, it\u2019s likely that Romney\u2019s 42 percent figure is pretty close to accurate.\n\nHowever, using only the big-picture numbers tells only part of the story. Here\u2019s the breakdown of spending for 2011, according to OMB:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFederal expenditures for defense and international accounts: 5.0 percent\nFederal net interest expenditures: 1.8 percent\nFederal Social Security and Medicare expenditures: 8.6 percent\nFederal payments to individuals exclusive of Social Security and Medicare: 7.1 percent\nFederal spending in all other categories: 1.9 percent\nState and local government: 11.0 percent\n\nTotal: 35.4 percent\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo payments to individuals accounted for almost half of federal expenditures. Why is this important? It\u2019s a question of control, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution told us when we originally looked at this question.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThese transfer payments, as they are known, \"can be more or less freely spent by private individuals,\" Burtless said. \"Your mom can spend her Social Security check any way she wants -- on food, shelter, vacations at Disney World or deposits in her bank account or her favorite mutual fund. Even cash public assistance recipients have pretty wide freedom over how they spend their welfare checks.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSome transfer payments are more restrictive, such as food stamps or Medicare and Medicaid benefits, but these still allow some degree of consumer choice.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"This distinction is important for a simple reason,\" Burtless said. While lawmakers and government officials have direct say over many types of government expenditures, \"their say over government transfers is a lot more restricted.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn addition, he said, many government transfer payments \"are paid for with earmarked taxes \u2013 FICA and unemployment insurance taxes. When we get transfers from the government under Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance, we\u2019re getting back the money that we or our employers contributed when we were working.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile these are undoubtedly government expenditures, one could argue that they are actually pass-throughs of payments from the American public to itself. And it\u2019s worth noting that Social Security and Medicare -- the drivers of government growth -- are among the most popular of all government programs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n(PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama\u2019s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)\n\nOur ruling\n\nDepending on which data set you use, Romney\u2019s numbers are either correct or close. But they don\u2019t tell the whole story. A large share of the spending has come not from the cost of government employees, buildings and equipment but from transfer payments that individual Americans ultimately control (and, in many cases, under programs which they had paid into to begin with). On balance, we rate Romney\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
