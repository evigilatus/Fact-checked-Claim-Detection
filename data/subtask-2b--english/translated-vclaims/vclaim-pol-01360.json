In the second congressional district of North Carolina, which includes parts of the provinces of Franklin, Johnston Wick, Nash and Harnett, democracy has taken Linda Coleman as a recurring target in the current President Georges Holding's repeated attempts to dismantle the affordable care law, also known as Obama. :: During a municipal hall in Wick Friday, Coleman introduced many changes that would have come into force had the 2017 American Health Care Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives before it failed in the Senate, become a law in fact. One change I mentioned made our ears flutter. Coleman said: \"The elderly can be charged five times as much as anyone else is required to receive health care because of the conditions that exist before.\" The Coleman campaign referred to an article from AARP in support of its claim. \"George Holding voted in favour of the American Health Care Act which, if approved, would have made older persons download 5 to 1 in their instalments,\" said campaign manager Mimi Wilson in the e-mail. Coleman, a former representative of the State, is not the first democratic candidate to present this claim. In September, American representative Kirsten Cinema, D-Ariz, said that she had voted against such a provision when she said no to the American Self-Defense Association - a claim of political Fact that ranked half as true. Before that, Polyte Fact gave another real half of the health advocacy group to invite many Republican representatives who had voted to allow insurance companies to \"charge five times more than people over 50.\" As reported by Poletti Fact at the time, the Australian Health Insurance Act contained a provision that would have allowed insurers to charge older adults five times more than younger ones, as Coleman said. However, Coleman's statement omitted several warnings that gave a somewhat different impression. While previously verified polyte fruit data focused on persons over 50 years of age, Coleman's allegation referred to \"old people\" more generally, making it more comprehensive. There is no age limit for older persons, but Miriam Webster knows him as an elderly person. Prior to the promulgation of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, older persons paid approximately four or five times the premium on young people for the same coverage, according to an analysis carried out by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading health-care authority. The Affordable Care Act changed the game by setting a ceiling on the amount that insurance companies can raise insurance premiums for older adults. Under the new rules, insurance companies may not charge older persons more than three times the amount paid by younger adults. However, article 135 of the Health Insurance Act may increase the maximum so that insurance companies can impose up to five times as much on some persons over 50 years of age as younger adults. The same provision would have allowed States to set their own standards. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" If Coleman has a point that Republicans have tried to allow insurance companies to accuse older Americans five times as much as they have imposed on young people. However, what she did not say was that the Affordable Care Act allows insurance companies to load older persons three times more. By ignoring this warning, it may have led listeners to believe that the ratio of 5 to 1 was more radical than it really was. It should also be noted that the Global Programme of Action proposal would have affected only older persons who purchased insurance on the individual exchange under the Affordable Care Act - another fact that Coleman did not mention. Coleman also goes too far by saying \"old people\" will be affected by change. In fact, a ratio of 5 to 1 would not have been applied to the majority of older persons receiving medical care coverage or older persons receiving coverage through their employers. However, the Republic &apos; s Health Insurance Agency would otherwise increase health care costs for older adults by replacing income-based tax exemptions with age-based credit. The tax exemptions proposed for adults over 60 years of age are twice the amount that adults under 30 would have received. This would have meant providing less credit to older persons than in the current situation. According to the United States Association of Retired Persons, older persons who received $25,000 annually would have received tax exemptions 50 to 80 per cent lower on average than those provided for in the current law. Our ruling (Culman) said that under the Public Order Abolition Bill, \"the elderly may be charged five times as much as anyone else for health care because of pre-existing conditions.\" It has the point that AHCA could have allowed insurance companies to charge adults aged 50 to 64 up to five times as much as others for the same coverage. However, Coleman's use of the word \"old people\" is too broad and can be misleading, and her statements omitted at least three key points: under the current situation, insurance companies can actually impose three times as much on older persons as they do on older persons. The provision in the bill would not have applied to older persons who received medical care insurance or older persons covered by employers, which is how most older persons received coverage. The provision in the bill would have allowed states to implement their own ratios separately from the ratio of underdevelopment of 5 to 1. In general, Coleman's claim contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong.
