In those years, according to the city\u2019s online database summarizing City Council election results, five second-place finishers in general elections won their runoffs: Beverly Griffith (1996); Bill Spelman and Willie Lewis (1997); Raul Alvarez (2000); and Jennifer Kim (2005).\n\nHowever, only two closed a first-round gap of more than 4,000 votes. Spelman bested Manuel Zuniga after trailing by 8,813 votes in their initial race. Kim overtook Margot Clarke after Clarke ran 7,771 votes ahead in the general election. The other runoff victors earlier ran behind by about 1,100 to nearly 2,100 votes.\n\nAustin consultant Mark Littlefield, a Shade supporter, agreed that just the two candidates rebounded after lagging by more than 4,000 votes. He said Spelman is the sole council hopeful in the period who bounced back from a greater percentage deficit than the nearly 13.5 points separating Shade and Tovo in this year\u2019s general election, though Kim was behind about 13 points in her first round.\n\nShade spokeswoman Lynda Rife told us: \"The meaty part (of Shade\u2019s statement) is there\u2019s precedent for coming back.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittlefield also noted that three of the comeback candidates drew a greater number of votes in the second round than they got facing crowded fields in their general elections--though turnout was diminished. Kim\u2019s vote haul increased 21 percent, Spelman\u2019s runoff total bumped up 41 percent and Griffith enjoyed a 71 percent improvement.\n\nAnything could happen in the Tovo-Shade runoff; we\u2019re not making predictions.\n\nPer recent history, though, Shade\u2019s claim is off. Two comparable comebacks do not amount to \"several.\" And by percentage of votes cast, only one candidate in the last 15 years made up a deficit as large as Shade\u2019s.\n\nWe rate her statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13040"}
