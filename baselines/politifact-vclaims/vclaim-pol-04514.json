He accused Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, of \"trash talking\" about U.S. allies, foreign leaders, people with disabilities, women and other Republicans.\n\"The thing that amazes me is the depth of his trash talking with Latinos, saying all Mexicans are rapists and going after Latino immigrants,\" Kaine said.\nNo doubt, Trump has made controversial statements about the groups Kaine cited. But did Trump go as far as saying \"all Mexicans are rapists?\"\nWe asked the Clinton-Kaine campaign for evidence. It cited 16 instances since June 2015 when Trump said that some of the unauthorized immigrants crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. are hardened criminals and rapists.\nTopping the list was a Trump statement that made international headlines when he announced his candidacy for president on June 16, 2015.\n\"When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best,\" Trump said. \"They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"\nTrump\u2019s statements about Mexican immigration have been discredited in fact checks. PolitiFact National has twice given Pants on Fire ratings to his claim that the Mexican government is sending violent criminals to the U.S.\nTrump hasn\u2019t provided proof for his repeated claims and a number immigration say there\u2019s no evidence to support them. Experts say unauthorized Latino immigrants usually come to the U.S. looking for jobs and to reunite with families that already are here.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no knowing the number or percentage of U.S violent crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants, because the U.S. doesn\u2019t keep such statistics. There\u2019s is strong evidence, however, that the border-crossers haven\u2019t made the U.S. more dangerous.\nThe number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. grew from 3.5 million in 1990 to 11.2 million in 2012, according to estimates by the Pew Research Center. That\u2019s a 220 percent increase. During the same years, the violent crime rate in the U.S. declined by 47 percent, according to FBI data.\nNow, let\u2019s get back to Kaine. His campaign, as we\u2019ve noted, cited 16 times \u00a0when Trump said \"rapists\" and other violent sorts are coming into the U.S. from Mexico. But Trump, in none of the quotes, made the charge that \"all Mexicans are rapists,\" as Kaine said. There\u2019s nothing that even approached such a contention.\n\"Sen. Kaine was clearly referencing Trump's attacks on Latino immigrants -- as he said in his comments -- from Mexico,\" Amy Dudley, a national spokesprson for Kaine, wrote us in an email.\nOur ruling\nTrump has roiled emotions with his debunked claims that the Mexican government is sending \"rapists\" and other violent criminals into the U.S. as unauthorized immigrants.\"\nKaine has embellished the controversy by saying Trump has said \"all Mexicans are rapists.\" The Democrat doesn\u2019t come close to proving his claim; all of the Trump quotes Kaine\u2019s campaign sent us pertain to unauthorized immigrants crossing the Mexican border into the U.S.\nNo doubt, many Latinos have taken umbrage with what Trump actually has said. But Kaine put an insult into the mouth of Trump that never was uttered.\nSo we rate Kaine\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04514"}
