There have been only two shootings in schools in 44 years, and teachers have killed both shooters. Have we learned anything yet, America?\" This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article is wrong about arming teachers, and wrong about how to kill shooters. Let's analyze Facebook allegations. In 1974, more than 20 students were killed when Palestinian gangs held the students hostage in a school in Ma &apos; alot, Israel. The Palestinians were killed \"in a bloody battle with firearms\" after Israeli soldiers raided the school building. However, as Associated Press reported in 2012, Israel did not charge armed guards at the entrances to all schools until 1995, more than two decades after a loud attack and two years after a Palestinian student struggling was injured and a school principal was injured in an attack on a school with knives. That same article, which challenges a statement made by the President of the National Republican Army, Wayne Lapier, similar to the one on Facebook, indicates that in 2012 the Israeli authorities were able to remember only two shootings in two schools in the past four decades. In 2008, eight people, mostly teenagers, were killed when they were attacked by a Palestinian aggressor in a night school session at a Jewish religious school in Jerusalem. However, that aggressor was killed by an out-of-service soldier who happened to be in the area, according to the Official Gazette - not a teacher. The search for this list, maintained by the Israeli Foreign Affairs Journal since September 2000, of \"Palestinian terrorism and incitement\" took place in 2002 when three students of the Yasheva High School in their Orthodox school were killed by a Palestinian gunman before being killed by a security guard - not a teacher. Because, by policy, teachers are not armed in Israeli schools, the Washington Post reported in February 2018. The post says: \"Professors deal with security,\" as Amos Chavet, spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Education, says. \"Not teachers.\" The newspaper notes that although incidents of school shooting are almost unheard of in Israeli schools, this is largely due to the country &apos; s efforts to combat terrorism, but not to the school shooters with whom the United States has become aware. According to the Post and in the major cities, law enforcement patrols around educational institutions are conducted by law enforcement forces during the school day. Israeli security experts also say that firearms violence is rare there because special weapons are very rare, as the mail story says. She quotes Simon Perry, a criminal scientist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, saying that there is no great opportunity for someone to carry out an armed attack within a school. Although most people in Israel go to the army and get some weapons training, he said, \"It's very difficult to get a weapon in Israel.\" We're assessing this wrong Facebook post.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00099"}
