Ted Cruz said a string of rival Sen.

Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense,\" Rubio said.\nCruz shook his head and said Rubio knowingly made an inaccurate claim.\n\"The attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget. Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion,\" Cruz said. \"What he said, and he said it in the last debate, is simply not true.\"\nRubio has criticized Cruz\u2019s record on military spending before, as Cruz voted for a proposed Paul budget that would have resulted in lower defense spending than current projections.\nBut on his specific point about voting for Rubio\u2019s amendment, Cruz is right.

If passed, the amendment would have raised projected defense spending outlays through 2022 in Congress\u2019 proposed budget.\nCruz voted for the amendment. The measure failed 32-68.\nCruz mentioned $697 billion, specifically, but it\u2019s a little unclear exactly how much Rubio\u2019s amendment would increase spending. On the Senate floor, Rubio said defense funds should reflect the Department of Defense\u2019s 2012 fiscal year request, which projected $611 billion in spending in 2016. But Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who backed the amendment, said it would increase military spending to $697 billion.\nThe very same day, the Senate voted on a Paul amendment that would have increased military spending to a similar level as the Rubio amendment, but it offset those costs with cuts to education, research and more. Cruz and Rubio both voted against the amendment, and it failed 4-96.\nOur ruling\nCruz said Rubio \"knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.\"\nCruz did indeed vote for a failed Rubio amendment that would have increased military spending after years of spending cuts. \u00a0While the amendment didn\u2019t specifically say spending would be increased to $697 billion, that figure was part of the discussion among the bill\u2019s proponents.\nCruz\u2019s point is right on, so we rate his statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05547"}
