Once, with headlines such as \"Sorros provides migrants with prepaid discount cards to finance illegal flights,\" it was published in News Kickman Nov 5. But the story isn't about Honduran immigrants. Instead, she states that Soros is assisting immigrants from Syria and other countries from Europe. \"The crisis of European migrants is fuelled by free cash donations from the United Nations, the European Union and the institutions of open society George Soros, according to bluffing information from Europe indicating that the United Nations, the European Union and Soros are luring illegal migrants to the continent with money.\" The story was highlighted as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The \"Missile Information\" link sends readers to a Slovenian site called Nova24tv.si and the October 30 story is disturbing about Muslim immigrants coming to Europe. He wondered where migrants received their money and focused on the prepaid MasterCard drawing cards that had been given to migrants. The story of Nova24TV says that it is driven by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). But there's no mention of Soros as a source of cards. Instead, Nova24TV asks, \"Does the European Union, directly with taxpayers' money, finance the violence that the Islamic invasion brings to European countries?\" The blue card bears the logo of the United Nations Agency for Refugees (UNHCR) and the case study of the quality assessment of the card in assisting refugees, found on ReliefWeb.int, does not mention Soros or Soros. So why is Soros tied up with these cards? Facebook, mentioned on January 11, 2021 in Nancy Pelosi's Facebook article, is no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. Nearly January 12, 2021, Soros and MasterCard announced \"plans to explore the establishment of a social institution to apply business strategies to make a positive impact on society. The project called Humanitarian Projects can stimulate and accelerate the economic and social development of vulnerable communities throughout the world, especially refugees and migrants.\" The January 19, 2017 news bulletin is not specific about the programs that Soros' Humanity Ventures will try, but bloggers communicate without providing any evidence. In fact, it is clear from the source of the \"bomb\" News Bunking that at the time of the announcement of the Soros-Mastcard Convention, the United Nations Refugee Agency had already paid discount cards for at least four years. According to the Nova24TV story, the MasterCard website reported 300,000 people in places such as Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt receiving cards by the end of 2013 and Maskhardt \"wanted to distribute 2.5 million such cards for use in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey\" by the end of 2014. The \"Inside Charity\" website reported shortly after the announcement that \"humanitarian projects,\" a profit-making organization, \"plans to combine existing global health and development solutions to expand access to health care and education, as well as to improve local economic development and entrepreneurship. The additional objective of the organization is to improve the delivery of humanitarian aid.\" Did the Soros initiative include the addition of funds to some of those prepaid cards for migrants in Europe? Soros' spokesman, Michael Fachson, said in an e-mail that the allegation was wrong. Master Card and Jerry said, \"We were in discussions about opportunities for joint investment.\" \"No one has yet come to fruition.\" Without this link, this claim for the discount card is covered by the withdrawal. We assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01267"}
