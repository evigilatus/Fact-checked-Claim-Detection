The ad ran from Oct. 9 to Oct. 15.\nAfter criticizing Barr for allegedly giving tax breaks to corporations, the ad says Barr was \"even dismissing\u00a0the importance of military service\" while onscreen text displays a quote from him that reads: \"We both served our country. I\u2019ve served in a position where ideas matter.\"\nSo did Barr actually dismiss military service when compared\u00a0with serving in political office? Not exactly.\nWhat Barr said in context\nThe DCCC\u2019s ad cites an article from the Louisville Courier Journal, which references an interview Barr gave to the New York Times.\nAt one point, Barr seems to compare his political experience in government with McGrath\u2019s military service.\nThe DCCC ad ends his quote with Barr saying that he\u2019s \"served in a position where ideas matter.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
