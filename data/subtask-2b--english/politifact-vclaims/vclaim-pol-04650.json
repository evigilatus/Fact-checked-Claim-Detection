Howard Dean, a Democratic presidential candidate in 2004 and a former party chairman.\n\"A million Democrats deserted Howard\u2019s party and joined my party because of Donald Trump in Ohio this year,\" Hewitt said.\nThe 2016 Republican primary was remarkable, given the 17-candidate field. Is Hewitt\u2019s \"million\" figure right? And is Trump the reason behind a massive party switch in the Buckeye State?\nIn Ohio, party affiliation is determined by what ballot a voter requests in a primary election. The voter will continue to be affiliated with that party, unless he or she requests a different party\u2019s ballot in another primary election.\nThe Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that 5 percent of voters in Ohio who cast ballots in the March 2016 primary switched from the party they were affiliated with in 2012. But many more former Democrats requested Republican ballots than vice-versa.\nOhio Secretary of State Jon Husted released the stats that showed that in total, 1.8 million Ohio voters joined or changed parties by voting last March.\nThe GOP picked up almost a million new voters to its rolls in that primary, but 910,131 of those were previously unaffiliated. According to Husted\u2019s data, 115,762 former Democratic voters swapped for Republican ballots.\nThat\u2019s not a million.\nWe asked some political scientists for their opinions.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's an old saying in the social sciences: don't mistake correlation with causality,\" said L. Marvin Overby, a political science professor at the University of Missouri. \"I would be very surprised if the voter changes were motivated by a desire among Democrats to vote for Trump. \u00a0It seems more plausible that they opted to identify as Republicans to vote in the GOP primary for (Ohio Gov. John) Kasich and against Trump, especially given that the Democratic presidential primary wasn't very competitive.\"\nOhio\u2019s donkeys-turned-elephants might have been reacting to Trump\u2019s candidacy, agreed Michael C. Munger of Duke University, but it\u2019s impossible to know for certain.\n\"Trump did not even win Ohio. Kasich hammered him by 10 percentage points. It would be odd to think of them as Trump voters, then,\" Munger said. He concurred that it makes more sense that former Democrats crossed the aisle to cast votes against Trump.\nIn that case, the phenomenon was due to Trump -- but not to his advantage.\nWe reached out to Hewitt but did not receive a response by the time of this publication.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nAs part of an MSNBC panel, Hewitt said, \"A million Democrats deserted (Howard Dean\u2019s) party and joined my party because of Donald Trump in Ohio this year.\"\nWithout polling the Dems-turned-GOP, it\u2019s not possible to know exactly why they switched parties. But data from the secretary of state showed that 115,762 Republican ballots were cast by former Democrats.\nAn impressive number -- but not a million.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/27d58c44-005c-4df3-abaa-9f0a0534306d", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04650"}
