We\u2019re about to cut the military by 40,000 people, which is another subject. We went from 500,000 down to 400,000.\n\"We don\u2019t have a reserve force if something happens.\"\nThe retired quarterback who later had a long career as a sports broadcaster\u00a0threw out a slew of facts, but the last one sounded the most alarming. Are U.S. leaders really sacrificing the military reserve as they whip the country into top fiscal shape?\nNo \u2014 a fact Theismann acknowledged during a phone call with PunditFact.\nTheismann said he was trying to highlight cuts to the military that are, in fact, happening due to automatic federal spending cuts known as sequestration. But he took it too far.\n\"With all the things that are happening in the world, especially in the Middle East right now, if we ever felt like we needed to get our ground forces involved, what position would we be in to deal with any difficult situation that could come up anywhere in the world?\" Theismann told us.\u00a0\"Because I still believe that we should be the world power and by continuing to cut the military, I think we diminish the ability to be the biggest stick in the valley.\"\n\"That was what I was trying to say in a short period,\" Theismann said.\nAmerica\u2019s reserve military forces include both the reserves and the National Guard. People may use the terms interchangeably, but they are different. National Guard units are jointly controlled by both state governors and the president and often respond to state-level emergencies, including riots, hurricanes and other disasters. Full reserves fall under the control of the president and the branch of the military in which they serve.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheismann clarified that he was talking about the Army Reserve, not the Army National Guard or other components of the National Guard.\nWhile it\u2019s important to have your vocabulary correct, it doesn\u2019t really affect the accuracy of Theismann\u2019s claim either way.\nBoth the National Guard and reserves expect cuts. But both will most definitely continue.\nThe Army National Guard is scheduled to shed 15,000 soldiers by Sept. 30, 2017, as part of sequestration. This will bring the Army National Guard to 335,000 soldiers \u2014 down from its current size of 350,000. The Air National Guard will not lose positions due to sequestration, said National Guard spokesman Kurt M. Rauschenberg.\nThe Army Reserve also expects to lose positions. On July 9, coincidentally the same day as this episode of\u00a0Outnumbered,\u00a0the\u00a0U.S. Army announced\u00a0how it would go about budget cuts that would affect active and reserve military.\nThe Army Reserve said its force would drop to 185,000 if sequestration continues through the 2017 fiscal year, part of an overall cut of 60,000 soldiers. The active military could fall to 450,000 soldiers by the end of fiscal year 2018, down from 570,000 in 2012 after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under the current plan for cuts, the overall Army would drop\u00a0from 1,042,200 soldiers\u00a0to 980,000, a total that includes active-duty Army (full-time), Army National Guard (part-time, can be activated to respond to state emergencies) and Army Reserve (part-time branch of the Army). Army Reserve employees would fall from\u00a0202,000 soldiers to 195,000\u00a0by the end of the 2017 fiscal year.\n\"I believe that where we are now is about as low as we can go,\" Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno\u00a0told reporters in a May conference call,\u00a0according to\u00a0Army Times. \"If we continue to go lower, we're going to have to say we cannot do all the things we're doing today.\"\nOur ruling\nWarning of a shorthanded military amid a border crisis, Theismann said, \"We don\u2019t have a reserve force if something happens.\"\nTheismann later admitted he didn\u2019t choose his words very carefully.\nAutomatic federal cuts as part of sequestration are shrinking the military. Leaders have warned that cuts could reduce the Army\u2019s ability to respond to crises. But the Army Reserve, which Theismann says he was talking about, very much remains in existence. The Reserve would be available, along with the National Guard, to assist the border patrol or active military in emergencies.\nWe rate his claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06201"}
