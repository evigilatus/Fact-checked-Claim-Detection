He said the birther sideshow -- which was discredited a few days later when Obama released his long-form U.S. birth certificate -- was hurting Republicans by scaring away undecided voters, and distracting people from important issues. \u00a0\n\n\"This is so offensive to independents and to people in this country today ... who worry that China now owns $1.1 trillion of our debt, our trade deficit last year with them was a quarter of a trillion dollars. They\u2019re worried about their job. They\u2019re worried about their children\u2019s job. And this gibberish that they talk about on television is doing nothing and other countries are moving at warp speed ahead of us on renewable energy, wind, electric cars...\"\n\u00a0\nOK, before McAuliffe starts plugging his electric car company, as he is wont, let\u2019s take a look at those digits and dollar signs he\u2019s throwing around. \u00a0\n\nThe $1.1 trillion sounded familiar, so we\u2019ll examine that one first.\n\nFor a source, McAuliffe provided a March 1 article from Reuters. The second paragraph of that story supports his claim:\n\n\"Treasury Department data released on Monday showed that China held $1.16 trillion in U.S. government debt in December, the most recent month for which figures are available, up from prior estimates of $892 billion,\" the story says.\n\nWell, that\u2019s true. The latest figures from the U.S. Treasury Department show China held $1.154 trillion in U.S. debt in February -- down $600 million from January. Japan was the second-largest holder, at $890.3 billion, with Great Britain third at $295.5 billion.\n\nHere\u2019s a little background: The total federal debt, as of May 2, was $14.29 trillion. Of that amount, about $9.65 trillion is called public debt, which refers to all federal securities held by institutions and individuals outside the U.S. government. That includes China and other foreign nations.\n\nThe remaining debt -- about $4.64 trillion -- is held by the Federal Financing Bank, U.S. government trust funds, and other federal funds and accounts. The largest trust fund is the one that endows Social Security.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMcAuliffe, for his second claim, \u00a0used a report from the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution that reports: \"In 2010, the U.S.-China trade deficit increased to over $273 billion, the highest bilateral trade deficit on record. It represents almost 55 percent of the total U.S. trade deficit.\"\n\nWe checked it out, and that\u2019s true, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If you\u2019re curious, this year\u2019s trade deficit through February was $42.1 billion. That\u2019s almost 36 percent of the United States\u2019 $117.8 billion trade deficit for the first two months of the year.\n\nLooking back, this is an open-and-shut case.\n\nWe cannot confirm McAuliffe\u2019s claim that independent voters are offended by The Donald. But he\u2019s right on his numbers: China owns $1.1 trillion in U.S. debt; our trade deficit with China was about $275 billion last year.\n\nBoth scary, both True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13159"}
