The State requires that vehicles over 5 years of age receive an inspection to renew their licence every two years. With the introduction of the Chamber of Deputies Bill 451, all this can change. The bill seeks to remove the requirement that all vehicles over the age of 5 must be inspected before obtaining a licence to the vehicle. The bill requires inspections of vehicles aged at least 10 years or over with an area of 150,000 miles. Dave Montzel, R-Bonville, spoke against the bill on Missouri House floor. Montzel said that \"the fourth vehicle on our highways (Misuri) is damaged.\" He went on to say: \"We now want to remove vehicle inspections and put them on the road. \"I don't want any of them coming down my way.\" After contacting Montzel, he told us that the number he claims came from a report from the Missouri Highway Patrol. This report came from data collected from all the inspection stations in Missouri. The report of the Highway Patrol showing the number of vehicles that have succeeded or failed to inspect can be found in the financial notes on the invoice. The figures were confirmed by Lieutenant Colin M. Stousberg, Director of the Information and Education Division, at the Missouri Highway Patrol. \"When you look at vehicles from 10 to 20, the rejection rate is about 25%,\" he said. On August 20, 2015, in comments at the Missouri State Fair, \"Almost nine out of ten pence that will be spent,\" he turned 200 miles from Highway 70 into a toll road \"will be from people outside Missouri.\" By Alison Graves, 29 September 2015, \"also, 51% of all vehicles registered in Missouri are over 10 years old,\" added Strosberg. According to him, the rate of refusal of Missouri to all vehicles searched throughout the state is 19 per cent (which means that she is at least five years old). The bill was passed by the Missouri House of Representatives in March. It was referred to the Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Public Safety after its second reading in the Senate. As at 4 April, no progress had been made. One of the reasons for this bill was to assist the rural population of Missouri. At present, it is difficult for the rural population to try to meet this requirement on a regular basis to the point where supporters of the bill often consider it a motive for 45 minutes or more. Our governor's house said that a quarter of the vehicles on Missouri highways are defective. This ignores the important context. Make it look like this number applies to all the vehicles on the highway. In fact, this figure applies to vehicles between 10 and 20 years of age, which have a 25 per cent refusal rate. Under the current law, only vehicles over five years of age need to be searched. For vehicles over five years of age requiring inspection, 19 per cent fail. Moreover, Montzel &apos; s claim that one quarter of the vehicles were defective would not be much different under the new bill. This is because the claim refers to vehicles between the ages of 10 and 20. Vehicles of 10 years or more still require the same degree of inspection as they currently carry out, every two years, under the Chamber of Deputies Bill 451. The Montzel statement needs further context that the vehicles in this number are over 10 years old. A quarter of all vehicles on Missouri highways are not defective. We're assessing this claim half right. You can find the nearest inspection site at Mishp.dps.missouri.gov.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00679"}
