This is not just about Tampa\u2019s success. It\u2019s about the bay area\u2019s success. \u2026 It\u2019s a \u2018we\u2019 proposition, not a \u2018me\u2019 proposition.\"\nBuckhorn has worked to streamline development regulation at City Hall, and tries to build confidence about the bay area, extolling its virtues and setting an upbeat tone. But any mayor has a limited ability to influence job growth. Economic trends beyond the control of city executives alone tend to dictate whether jobs are created or lost. And the Tampa Bay area\u2019s experience in the last year demonstrates that those trends can change direction.\nThis time last year, the Tampa Bay area led all Florida\u00a0metros in adding jobs over the previous year, with 35,400 new jobs in the 12 months that ended in December 2013.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat changed in 2014, according to labor statistics from the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity. \u00a0\nThrough November, the most recent month for which figures are available, the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metro area had created 12,900 jobs over a 12-month period. That put it in a tie for fifth place among Florida metro areas with West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Boynton Beach, which also created 12,900 jobs in a local workforce that is less than half the size of the Tampa Bay area\u2019s.\nIn 2014, the top four metro areas for job creation were Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford (46,300 new jobs in the 12 months ending in November), Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall (39,500 jobs), Ft. Lauderdale-Pompano Beach-Deerfield Beach (28,400 jobs) and Jacksonville (17,000 jobs).\nTaking a longer view, the picture looks better for the Tampa Bay area. From April 2010 to April 2014, the bay area added 134,346 jobs, more than in the Orlando, Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Jacksonville and West Palm Beach metro areas. From April 2011, the month that Buckhorn took office as mayor, through April 2014, Orlando produced more jobs, with the Tampa Bay area close behind.\nBuckhorn\u2019s commercial says \"we\u2019re leading the state in jobs creation.\" That was true for several years, but over last year the trends changed. Tampa is no longer leading the state in job creation. We rate his statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06839"}
