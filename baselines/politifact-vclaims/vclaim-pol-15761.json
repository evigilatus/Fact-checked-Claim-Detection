LaPierre said Sunstein is \"a man who wants to give legal standing to animals so they can sue you for eating meat.\"\n\n\nLaPierre isn't alone in making similar claims. Go to the self-explanatory Web site StopSunstein.com, sponsored by the American Conservative Union, and you'll find this quote from one of Sunstein's books: \"Animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives \u2026\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quote comes from Sunstein's 2004 book\n\nAnimal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions\n\n. We call your attention to Chapter 11, titled \"Can Animals Sue?\" Sunstein argues that there are already plenty of animal cruelty laws on the books that just aren't enforced.\n\n\n\"My simplest suggestion is that private citizens should be given the right to bring suits to prevent animals from being treated in a way that violates current law. I offer a recommendation that is theoretically modest but that should do a lot of practical good: laws designed to protect animals against cruelty and abuse should be amended and interpreted to give a private cause of action against those who violate them, so as to allow private people to supplement the efforts of public prosecutors. Somewhat more broadly, I will suggest that animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives, to prevent violations of current law.\"\n\n\nIn a speech at Harvard in 2007, Sunstein argued there is \"a real gap\" in the laws governing animal cruelty laws, essentially that prosecutors have a monopoly in making sure those laws are followed. \"The law should be changed to give affected persons, interested persons, those who have some sort of connection with the animal, a right to sue either for damages or for an injunction to get that violation of what is standard already in law to stop.\"\n\n\nThat Sunstein is an animal rights activist is undisputed. For a CNN interview in the late 1990s, he once insisted on being joined on-air by his dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Perry. And LaPierre is correct when he says that Sunstein has talked about allowing animals to sue \u2014 albeit through a human representative. But we think LaPierre has twisted Sunstein's words. Sunstein wasn't saying you \u2014 the meat eater \u2014 could be sued by Porky Pig for eating bacon. But he was saying that if the pig that winds up on your breakfast plate was raised or killed in a way that violates existing animal cruelty laws, then someone ought to be able to sue the processor on the pig's behalf. That's all, folks.\n\n\nWe rate LaPierre's statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15761"}
