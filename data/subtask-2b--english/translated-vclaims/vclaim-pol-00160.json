Just a moment later, Trump declared: \"We are very independent of energy.\" While it was inaccurate to say that the United States had already begun to rely on foreign energy sources, the country was moving in that direction. Production for consumption at the White House did not define energy independence when asked. Therefore, we will be in line with the generally agreed definition: energy production as much as it is consumed domestically. Several months have recently witnessed that energy production in the United States exceeds consumption, which supports Trump's claim. In general, however, the data diminishes the idea that the United States is \"very independent in energy.\" In the first five months of 2019, the United States used more energy than it produced. Specifically, the country produced 41.5 million British thermal units of energy, but consumed 42.1 million thermal units, according to the latest data from the Department of Energy Information. Some individual months saw the United States achieve \"energy independence,\" meaning more energy production than Americans consume. It did so two months in autumn 2018, and the United States produced more than it consumed in April and May this year. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, the United States was a net importer of energy since 1953. However, according to the Department of Energy Information, this is likely to change soon. The environmental impact assessment predicts that with the continued growth of United States oil and natural gas exports, in addition to the slow growth in energy consumption in the United States, the country is on track to become a net energy exporter by next year. Data from the past decade indicate the country &apos; s trend in this direction as well. The gap between energy production and consumption in the United States has been narrowing for some time, achieving greater parity during the term of the Trump presidency. However, some experts argue that it is not in the interest of the United States to be completely separated from the foreign energy market - for example, when hurricanes in the Gulf threaten local sources. \"Without energy imports, we cannot optimize our system,\" said Frank Verastro, the energy and national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. However, given that the Trump campaign promises energy independence, he is eager to demand a victory and may demand a more firmly established land as election day approaches 2020. But let's say that the United States is now \"very independent in energy\" is a goal celebration before reaching the end zone. The Governor Trump said that the United States is \"very independent in the field of energy.\" It is somewhat premature to call American energy independent because Americans consume more energy than the producer country for most of the last year that we have data. However, the gap between energy production and consumption in the United States has been narrowing for some time, especially during the Trump presidency, and data show several months recently when production has exceeded energy use in the United States.
