So did the Supreme Court ruling mean that many people lost their chance to legally remain in the country?\nDAPA and DACA\nChecking the accuracy of the mayor\u2019s assertion requires accounting for the number of people affected by three actions by the Obama administration.\nFirst, the administration started the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, in 2012. DACA allows people who came to the United States before their 16th birthday to legally remain in the country for at least two years. After the two years, they can apply for renewal. To qualify for the program, immigrants could not be older than 31 in 2012. Immigrants also had to have a relatively clean criminal record and be on track to finish high school or already graduated. The Migration Policy Institute estimated 53,000 people in New York City eligible to legally remain in the country under the 2012 DACA program, slightly more than an estimate of \u00a048,935 by the Center for Migration Studies\nSecond, in 2014, Obama expanded the DACA program. The age limit was lifted under the expansion. Some 15,701 people were eligible for the 2014 DACA extension, according to the Center for Migration Studies.\nThird, Obama also created the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, or DAPA, in 2014. The new program allowed parents of U.S. citizens to legally stay in the country for at least three years, after which they would be eligible for renewal. The center said its research shows an estimated 143,064 immigrants eligible for DAPA in New York City.\nAccording to the Migration Policy Institute, there are 627,000 unauthorized immigrants living in the five counties that make up New York City. Of those, 230,000 would have been eligible to legally remain in the country under either DAPA or DACA following the president\u2019s 2014 actions, according to the institute.\nIn 2014, many Republicans criticized DACA but weren\u2019t able to reverse Obama\u2019s action. But the expansion of DACA and creation of DAPA led to a legal storm between the state of Texas and the Obama administration. Texas argued that the president\u2019s 2014 actions violated the Constitution. The Supreme Court sided with Texas.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision struck down DAPA and the 2014 DACA expansion but left the original DACA program in place.\nSo how many would be affected in New York City?\nWhen counting the number of people affected by the Supreme Court ruling, those eligible to legally remain in the country only because of the DAPA program or the 2014 expansion of DACA should be counted. That comes to just under 160,000 affected people, according to the Center for Migration Studies.\nThe Migration Policy Institute pegs it slightly higher at 180,000 immigrants. Those who were eligible for the original 2012 DACA program are still eligible to apply and be granted deferred action despite the court ruling.\nA few groups track the number of people who were eligible under the 2014 actions, including the Migration Policy Institute. It is one of the few that have data available specifically for counties with high populations of unauthorized immigrants. That\u2019s important because Mayor de Blasio was only referring to numbers in New York City.\nIts data is the latest from the U.S. Census Bureau. The mayor\u2019s office says it also used data from the bureau to come up with its number. The bureau does not directly ask people if they are authorized to live in the U.S. legally. Michelle Mittelstadt from the Migration Policy Institute says the institute considers the population and demographics of an area to come up with a final number, and it\u2019s among the few that does so on a local level.\n\"The Census Bureau does not ask people their legal status with respect to being unauthorized,\" Mittelstadt said. \"That leaves it to a small number of organizations who have developed methodology to essentially try to look at who among the foreign-born population is unauthorized.\"\nOur ruling\nAt a press conference on June 23, Mayor de Blasio said, \"Two hundred twenty thousand New Yorkers would have immediately benefitted had President Obama\u2019s executive action been affirmed. So almost a quarter million of our fellow New Yorkers who are hurting right now whose rights and opportunities were taken away by the Supreme Court.\"\nBased on the latest data, released in 2014, the mayor overestimated the number of unauthorized immigrants the Supreme Court ruling affected.\nHis office says the city\u2019s Center for Economic Opportunity used its own methodology in conjunction with data from the Census Bureau to develop its estimate, but a 40,000-person difference reaches beyond a margin of error.\nWe rate this claim as Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/403adb52-46d0-44b0-ae81-863fe6318ba4", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04703"}
