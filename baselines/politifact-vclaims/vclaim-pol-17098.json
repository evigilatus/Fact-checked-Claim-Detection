Congressional Democrats have proposed and supported legislation to temporarily ban evictions and help residents pay rent.\nThe CARES Act, a bipartisan coronavirus relief law passed in March, banned evictions for certain renters, including those in federal housing assistance programs.\nIn May, the House passed the HEROES Act, a $3.4 trillion coronavirus relief package introduced by Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, which would extend the ban on evictions for renters and provide people with rent assistance.\u00a0\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews told PolitiFact in an email that the bill was \"unserious,\" in part because it includes a portion that would provide cannabis businesses with banking access.\n\"If Democrats were serious about providing relief for the American people, then they shouldn\u2019t have rejected the multiple clean bills put forward by Republicans,\" Matthews said.\nMeanwhile, Democrats are critical of the HEALS Act, a $1.1 trillion Republican-backed coronavirus relief package that doesn\u2019t include an eviction moratorium.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCARES Act\nIn addition to protecting renters in federal housing assistance programs from evictions, the over $2 trillion CARES Act also protects those in properties with federally backed mortgages.\nThe economic stimulus law was introduced by Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., in January and passed in the House and Senate with widespread bipartisan support.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates that the CARES Act\u2019s eviction provisions covered between 28% and 46% of rental units in the country. That\u2019s up to 20 million units, but the law\u2019s four-month eviction ban expired in late July, and Trump\u2019s executive order did not extend it.\u00a0\nHEROES Act\u00a0\nOver 200 congressional Democrats voted to support the HEROES Act, which would extend the eviction moratorium for up to a year and expand it to protect homeowners. The bill would also allocate $100 billion to provide residents with emergency rental assistance.\u00a0\n\"Being able to give money to people to pay their rent then also helps landlords be able to afford the mortgage on the property, the utilities, taxes, all of the things that it takes to maintain a property,\" said Peggy Bailey, vice president for housing policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.\nThe HEROES Act, which has not been voted on in the Senate, passed in the House along party lines, with 184 Republicans opposing the bill.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"The Democrats don\u2019t want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction.\"\nCongressional Democrats passed and supported bills that set out to protect people from evictions, including through an eviction moratorium and rental assistance.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17098"}
