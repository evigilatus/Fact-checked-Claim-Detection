This is every state legislator who was qualified to recall - four times the number of people who were forced into such elections in the 85 years when Wisconsin state officers could be called. These summonses followed the bill for the reform of the budget - the collective bargaining bill submitted by the Government of the Republic. Scott Walker in February 2011. The official return campaigns targeted eight of the 14 members of the Democratic Senate who fled to Illinois for three weeks in an attempt to prevent voting on the Walker Bill; and eight senators from the General Democratic Party, all of whom voted in favour of the Bill, which became law but was restricted in court. To date, campaigns against three Democrats have failed to collect enough signatures; efforts targeting the other 13 legislators are still pending. On April 22, 2011, Chris Larson, a Democrat from the Milwaukee, moved the vessel on the Internet with a comment about the re-entry campaign that is still active against Kenosha Democratic Robert Werch, a 19-year state legislator. \"In case you missed it, Larson tweeted, \"The Republicans offered the free shots to sign summonses against Dems.\" These shots, like in the liquor footage, and \"Demis\" as in Democrats. Let's go up to the bar and see if that's what happened. The Larson tweet, which is linked to an article published on Alternet.org on the same day, is a website that says it aims to \"inspired action and advocacy on the environment, human rights and civil liberties, social justice, the media, health-care issues, and more.\" ......................................................................................................................... Therefore, the article itself does not fully support Larson's claim. The article refers readers to the last night's edition of Rachel Madhu's Liberal Program on MSNBC. Mado said how earlier that day, Liberal Huffington Post.com posted a conversation that she trusted a Democrat claim. The vote was accompanied by an article from the reporter of the Hovington Post Amanda Turkel, who said \"democratic source\" of the voice, as well as a draft complaint by the Wisconsin Democratic Party to the State Government Accountability Council, which oversees the elections. According to this article, the draft complaint was signed by a woman who was with friends on February 27, 2011, at John &apos; s main event in Borlington, a small city in South-East Wisconsin. The article said that the woman heard that someone at the restaurant was offering free shots to people who signed a subpoena against Werch. The article went on to say that a waiter offered her the summons and told her that if she signed it, she and her friends would get free footage. Here's some of what's in about a minute of sound: a woman says, \"Well, so you'll get us one, two, three, four, five shots if we sign this.\" A man answers, \"That's right. \"I'll buy them.\" There was little talk among a group of women about calling, and then the woman who spoke to the man to her friends, in the midst of some other chatter, said: \"Because it's bull shit, what he did. Because it was bull bullshit that came out of the state,\" she said, apparently referring to Werch and the rest of the Democrats who fled to Illinois. \"This is bullshit. No, to remind him, to get him out of there for the bull shit he did.\" So, an article and audio recording indicate that an unknown party member offered to buy shots as liquor to a group of women, and perhaps to other bar sponsors, if they signed a subpoena against a Democrat. :: Asked whether Larson had any evidence other than the article he had tied to his tweet, and cited his staff with the Haventon Post report as well as a report of the Wisconsin radio network. However, the radio report referred only to this allegation. When we spoke to Larson, he admitted that he had no evidence other than media reports; he knew only one case where the alleged shooting had taken place; and he assumed the offer he had written on Twitter could have been made by the Republicans, since Werch was a democracy. We also called Dan Hunt, head of the taxpayers, to remind Robert Versh, who gave this novel: Tony said, \"We put $330 million in public school aids - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021, on the day Huffington Post was published, Hunt received a Facebook message from a man who identified himself as a bartender. Hunt confirmed that the man was one of the volunteers who collected signatures to retrieve Werch. The bartender said that the conversation that took place in the sound had already taken place and that the five women had signed the petition, but he didn't buy them drinks at the end of the day. The five bartenders removed the names before submitting the petition to the summoning committee, which submitted all of its petitions to the State Accountability Board. Hunt said that at least four signatures were not valid because they were listed with addresses not in Werch County. Hunt added that the Fish Memorial campaign did not condone the offering of alcohol in exchange for the signing of petitions, but noted that the Government Accountability Council had said that the practice was not illegal. Council spokesman Reid Magney confirmed that a shot at a signature was not illegal. But he said, \"We strongly discourage anyone from offering anything of value in exchange for signing a petition because it distorts the process.\" Hunt refused to give us the name of the bartender, saying that the bartender did not want to be questioned. Hunt said he moved our interview request to the bartender. But the man didn't answer that, or a phone message we left with an employee at John's main event. Neither did he call us back, and a spokesman for the State Democratic Party refused to comment. Well, somebody get us the check. Larson claimed that the Republicans offered free shots of alcohol to get people to sign subpoenas against Democrats, Larson's right that several free shots were fired. But the record so far shows that they were presented by one person, whose party affiliation, if any, is unknown. And the photos were shown for signatures against only one democracy. The Larson statement contains some elements of truth, but it wrongly suggests that the shots in exchange for the signature were more than an isolated incident. We're assessing his claim barely right. :: Editor &apos; s note: This statement was estimated to be barely correct when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name of the evaluation to most of the error.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13170"}
