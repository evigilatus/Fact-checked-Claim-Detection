Rick Perry\u2019s Feb. 8 call on higher education to devise a way that students could earn bachelor\u2019s degrees at a cost of $10,000, including textbooks.\n\n\"As for the governor\u2019s preposterous scheme to serve up $10,000 college degrees, nobody in higher education believes that is even possible,\" Andy Brown writes. \"Tuition and books for a single year easily add up to that amount, and tuition likely will increase in the face of state funding cuts.\"\n\nGranted, four years in college costs a bundle. But no one believes a $10K degree is even possible?\n\nWe reached Brown, who said by e-mail that there is \"probably someone out there who thinks it is possible at most Texas institutions, so the word \u2018credible\u2019 probably should have been included as a modifier\" after nobody. \"Regardless, it's not a realistic option for most higher ed institutions in Texas,\" Brown said, \"and for Perry to imply otherwise is ridiculous.\"\n\nNext, we read news accounts following Perry\u2019s State of the State address. Skepticism and uncertainty abound, the reports suggest. \u00a0On Feb. 10, the Dallas Morning News quoted state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, who chairs the Senate Higher Education Committee, saying that it\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nAmong officials in higher education, Mike McKinney, chancellor of the Texas A&M University System, was quoted in the Feb. 12 Austin American-Statesman as telling state senators he has no idea how to meet Perry\u2019s goal. The newspaper said McKinney also testified: \"I'm not going to say that it can't be done.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Houston Chronicle news article, likewise published Feb. 12, says some education leaders say a $10,000 degree could be achieved at community colleges. The article quotes Bruce Leslie, chancellor of the San Antonio-based Alamo Colleges, saying: \"\"We already have the facilities, the infrastructure, the doctorate faculty. You could take community colleges and do that without building a whole new infrastructure, or forcing existing four-year universities to downsize.\"\n\nThe story quotes Shirley Reed, president of South Texas College in McAllen, saying: \"It is an idea that is long overdue.\" At the college, resident tuition for 120 credit-hours--which colleges typically require to earn a degree--is currently about $7,600, according to its website. According to a Feb. 10 Texas Tribune news article, South Texas College and two other community colleges are already authorized to offer a bachelor\u2019s degree in Applied Technology, costing in the range of $10,000.\n\nNext, we asked the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board if anyone in higher education has rated the $10,000 degree possible. Spokesman Dominic Chavez replied by e-mail: \"We interpret the $10,000 degree challenge by the governor as just that\u2014a challenge...The question from the board\u2019s perspective is not \u2018is $10,000 the right target or a reasonable target?\u2019 but rather \u2018what can we do to get as close to it as possible?\u2019\"\n\nFor national perspective, we contacted Beth Hagan, executive director of the Florida-based Community College Baccalaureate Association, which seeks to improve access to bachelor\u2019s degrees. Hagan told us bachelor\u2019s degrees costing $10,000 are now available through community colleges in 17 states. However, she said, they generally aren\u2019t in the academic studies available through four-year universities. Besides, she cautioned, very few community college students get the four-year \"niche\" degrees, which tend to involve technologies or special skills such as nursing or teaching.\n\nHagan said of Perry\u2019s proposal: \"If you asked a group of (community) college administrators and presidents if this could be done, they would laugh at you. Of course, it\u2019s possible.\" But Perry\u2019s call, she said, was akin to challenging a chain steakhouse to offer $1 hamburgers. \"Can they do it? Sure. But they don\u2019t want to.\"\n\nPerry\u2019s communications director, Mark Miner, called Brown\u2019s statement unfortunate, adding that it\u2019s \"just like the establishment to say it can\u2019t be done, without trying.\" Catherine Frazier, Perry\u2019s deputy press secretary, pointed out a Feb. 10 news article in the Midland Reporter-Telegram describing Midland College\u2019s applied technology bachelor\u2019s degree, which the article says can be earned for about $10,000. The article also says the program might not be funded in the next state budget.\n\nNo doubt, there\u2019s skepticism in higher education about Perry\u2019s call. But it\u2019s a stretch to say nobody believes $10,000 degrees possible. Four-year technology degrees at around that price point are already an option for some Texas students.\n\nWe rate Brown\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13465"}
