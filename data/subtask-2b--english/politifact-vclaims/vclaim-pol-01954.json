Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018\n\n\nWe looked at whether crime in Germany is on the rise. We contacted the White House press office and did not hear back.\nAccording to the latest government numbers that came out in May, crime in the European Union\u2019s largest economy is down by about 9.6 percent from 2016 to 2017.\nIt is also down nearly 4 percent compared to 2012. This chart shows the percentage drop in all crime, violent crime, and the three most common crimes of street crime (a catchall category that spans offenses from sexual harassment to extortion to gang violence), theft and property damage.\n\nIn a May press release, German minister for Interior, Development and Community Horst Seehofer crowed about the latest figures.\n\"The number of criminal offenses committed in Germany is the lowest since 1992,\" Seehofer said May 8. \"This drop in crime is even more apparent in relation to the total population: fewer than 7,000 offenses per 100,000 residents. That is the lowest rate in more than 30 years!\"\nNot every type of crime went down. Those involving drugs went up about 9 percent in the past year, and weapons violations rose by 10 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole of immigrants\nSince Trump tied crime to immigration, we looked at the numbers of German and non-German suspects. The number of people arrested (the statistics count arrests, not convictions) who were not German rose between 2012 and 2017, starting at 502,000 and reaching 736,000. There are two ways to read that.\nOver the six years, more immigrants have been suspected of crimes.\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s also true that as the number of non-German suspects rose, the number of crimes fell.\nAnd it\u2019s not as though native Germans stopped committing crimes in droves, leaving all the violations to immigrants. The number of Germans arrested dropped, but at roughly the same rate as the number of crimes.\n\n\nA\u00a0study in one German state linked immigrants to a rise in violent crimes in 2016, with\u00a0a third of those committed against other immigrants.\nThese numbers back up what experts have said before: Cause and effect are complicated, and rising numbers of immigrants does not translate into an broader increase in crime.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that crime in Germany is \"way up.\"\nThe opposite is true.\nCrime in Germany is down from 2016 by over 9 percent, and since 2012 by about 4 percent. The numbers don\u2019t link a rise in the number of immigrants to a rise in criminality nationwide.\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-06-18 23:00:09 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Crime in Germany is way up.\"    Donald Trump President of the United States https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1008696508697513985   In a tweet Monday, June 18, 2018 2018-06-18    Read More  info    \nUpdate: A previous version did not include the reference to the 2016 study in a German state.
