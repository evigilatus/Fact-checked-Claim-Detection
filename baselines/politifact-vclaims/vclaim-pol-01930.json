That\u2019s not true.\n\"Mexico\u2019s next president calls for an invasion of the U.S.,\" said a headline by WeSupportDonaldTrump.com. The website, which lacks original reporting, has a hodgepodge of articles about politics with a pro-President Donald Trump slant.\nFacebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed.

What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise\u2026 Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention,\" the story reads.\nThe story used a quote of L\u00f3pez Obrador for which they cited the Daily Caller to back up their point:\n\" \u2018And soon, very soon \u2014 after the victory of our movement \u2014 we will defend all the migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world,\u2019 L\u00f3pez Obrador said, adding that immigrants \u2018must leave their towns and find a life in the United States.\u2019 He then declared it as \u2018a human right we will defend.\u2019 \"\nWe found the original quote in the Mexican newspaper, El Universal.\u00a0 It has\u00a0been taken out of context.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Y ya pronto, muy pronto, al triunfo de nuestro movimiento vamos a defender a los migrantes de todo el continente Americano y todos los migrantes del mundo que, por necesidad, tienen que abandonar sus pueblos para buscar la vida en Estados Unidos, es un derecho humano que vamos a defender,\" El Universal quotes L\u00f3pez Obrador saying in a speech on June 19.\nThat translates to: \"Soon, very soon, after the victory of our movement, we will defend migrants all over the American continent and the migrants of the world who, by necessity, must abandon their towns to find life in the United States; it\u2019s a human right we will defend.\"\nL\u00f3pez Obrador is not telling anyone to flood the border, but saying that he will defend those who find themselves with no other option but to relocate to the United States. The quote was delivered in the wake of news of the Trump administration\u2019s rampant separation of families at the border. Over 2,300 children were separated from their parents between May 5 and June 9, according to the Homeland Security Department.\nWe found no indications that L\u00f3pez Obrador was encouraging people to abandon their towns in favor of the United States. Instead, he urged current Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to complete the following three actions:\n\n\nSend a diplomatic note in protest of the Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s policies to the United States;\n\n\nSolicit the urgent intervention of the United Nations commissioner for human rights; and,\n\n\nSend a team of lawyers, psychologists and social workers to aid kids and their parents at the border.\n\n\nBloggers have distorted L\u00f3pez Obrador's quote to stoke fears.
