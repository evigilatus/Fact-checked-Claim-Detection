In it, the conservative American radio talk show host decided to discuss the racist comments allegedly made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling.\nAt one point, Limbaugh described Sterling as \"a typical Hollywood Democrat.\" That\u2019s incorrect (Sterling is a registered Republican\u00a0-- to the extent it matters).\n\"The only reason (Sterling\u2019s) in trouble right now is he did not give enough money to Obama,\" Limbaugh proclaimed. That\u2019s highly speculative, so we can\u2019t fact-check Limbaugh on this point.\nAt another point in his Sterling talk, Limbaugh discussed how things generally are going for African-Americans in the United States. Limbaugh\u2019s diagnosis: pretty darn good.\n\"You've got a black president. You've got a black attorney general. You've got the wealthiest TV performer in American history is a African-American woman. That would be\u00a0The Oprah,\" Limbaugh said. \"Some of the wealthiest Americans are African-American now.\"\nThat last line is quite incorrect.\nThe go-to source to learn about the wealthiest Americans is\u00a0Forbes, which tracks the fortunes of the world\u2019s elite. It publishes an annual list of the\u00a0400 wealthiest Americans\u00a0and a list of the world\u2019s\u00a0billionaires. The most recent\u00a0Forbes\u00a0list was released in March 2014. (Bloomberg\u00a0also publishes a less expansive list of the world\u2019s billionaires.)\nFor some perspective, the folks at the bottom of\u00a0Forbes\u2019\u00a0wealthiest Americans list are worth an estimated $1.3 billion. At the top is Bill Gates, who is worth an estimated $72 billion.\nHow many African-Americans make up the American Top 400?\nOne, according to\u00a0Forbes.\nOprah Winfrey is worth an estimated $2.9 billion -- ranking her 184th on the list.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the record, it isn\u2019t only rare for African-Americans to be billionaires in the United States. According to\u00a0Forbes,\u00a0there are only\u00a0nine black\u00a0billionaires in the world.\nSo who are the wealthiest African-Americans besides Winfrey? We found\u00a0two\u00a0other\u00a0lists\u00a0using\u00a0Forbes\u00a0data that are a few years old. Here\u2019s a list, with the date of the last update:\n\n\nEntertainer Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, $550 million (April 2012)\n\n\nBET founder Robert Johnson, $550 million (May 2009)\n\n\nGolfer Tiger Woods, $500 million (September 2010)\n\n\nFormer basketball player Michael Jordan, $500 million (September 2010)\n\n\nFormer basketball player Magic Johnson, $500 million (May 2009)\n\n\nThat means no African-American other than Oprah Winfrey is even close to cracking the Top 400 list.\nOur ruling\nLimbaugh said, \"Some of the wealthiest Americans are African-American now.\"\nWe reached out to Limbaugh with our finding but have not heard back.\nOf the top 400 wealthiest Americans, exactly one is African-American -- that\u2019s .25 percent. Also, no other African-American is really all that close to breaking into the Top 400.\nLimbaugh\u2019s claim severely distorts reality. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07925"}
