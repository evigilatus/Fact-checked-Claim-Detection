President Donald Trump of the Middle East and from all over the world said that people were coming across the southern border and that a barrier was needed to prevent them from entering. He also said that there had never been a number of concerns, as was currently the case. This is a verifiable error. \"Whether it's steel or concrete, you don't care. We need a barrier, and they did a great job, \"Trap said January 10. \"There isn't much fear in our history\" His comment was an effort to put pressure on public and legal support to finance a border wall on the southern border. The federal government is in a partial state of closure because Trump and Congressional Democrats disagree on the taxpayers' funds for the Wall Project. The United States Customs and Border Protection website has South-West Border Control data dating back to FY 1960. In fiscal year 2000, the Border Patrol recorded more than 1.6 million arrests at the south-west border. How many in 2017? Approximately 304,000. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2012, in 2018? Less than $400,000 Trump made his remarks in McClane, Texas. Macallen is part of the Rio Grande Valley sector of the Border Patrol. Was the sector &apos; s concerns in 2017 and 2018 the highest ever? No, they weren't. In 2017, the Rio Grande Valley sector experienced 137,562 cases of fear; in 2018, 162,262 cases of fear were recorded. In 2014, 256,393 people were arrested by border patrol personnel in the Rio Grande Valley. The latest monthly data available on arrests at the south-west border is for the month of November (part of fiscal year 2019). Last November, the Border Patrol recorded 51,856 arrests. Is that the highest number of fear in November? No. In November 2000, the Border Patrol recorded 76,196 arrests. The Rio Grande Valley sector registered more concerns in November of fiscal year 2017 than in November of fiscal year 2019. On multiple scales, Trump's claim does not match. Trump's statement is inaccurate. We assess it wrong.
