In a meeting with the press in December 4, Vice President-elect Mike Pines said the deal with the carrier, which makes heating, air conditioning and refrigerator parts, means \"more than a thousand hosers have certainty in their jobs and their future going to this Christmas season because of Donald Trump's leadership.\" Later in the presentation, intellectuals from the left and right raised concerns that drew the deal in light of less hint. The editor-in-chief of National Rich Laurie said that the government incentives in question were not ideal, and he did not like Trump to threaten revenge for business with tariffs on movements that he did not agree to. Heather McGee, head of the left-wing think tank (Dimos), said that the number of jobs provided was excessive. \"Did you actually read the carrier's message?\" McGee asked the Committee. \"She started saying, \"We're happy to tell you,\" and he ended up talking about all the jobs that are still being shipped abroad. The numbers I'm looking at say that less than half of them will actually stay.\" With these many numbers in the mix, we decided to see whether McGee's claim was of value. McGee was talking about a letter regarding 1,400 transport jobs in Indianapolis. Most jobs, but away from every job, at the Indianapolis factory ended up being saved thanks to a deal with the Trump team. Expectations get worse when it causes that plant to lose its jobs with another Indiana factory to be shut down and owned by Carrier's parent company. In February, United Technologies, the parent company of transport companies, announced that it would close down a plant for Indianapolis Carriers and transfer 1,400 jobs to Monterrey, Mexico. Trump spoke of the news throughout his campaign, using the carrier as an example of how to destroy trade transactions such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) for manufacturing. Trump said in Indiana, which Pines is the governor, in April. 'Cause say what you want, Indiana. I've been talking about Carrier for four months, right? After almost three weeks of general elections, Carrier confirmed its conversations with Tramp and Bennis but did not elaborate on them. The carrier has had discussions with the next administration and we look forward to working together. There's nothing to declare at this time.--The transporter (@Carrier) November 24, 2016 after five days, Trump tweeted that a deal had been reached, jobs saved, and his promise to the Americans was fulfilled. On the big Thursday of Indiana and the great workers in that wonderful state, we will keep our companies and jobs in the United States. Thanks to Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 30 November 2016, we are pleased to have reached an agreement with President-elect Trump and Vice-President-elect Benes to maintain approximately 1,000 jobs in Andy. - The tanker (@Carrier) 30 November 2016, Indiana State undertook to give the company $7 million in tax incentives over a decade, and the company agreed to invest $16 million to keep the company in the state. While many workers celebrated the rescue of their jobs, the capitalists rejected the free market, including the Trump ally and the Republic of Sara Palin, which described the deal as \"prime capitalism.\" It was lost in joy that hundreds of jobs in the tanker plant would not be exempted from export. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2021, in addition, the Mother Carrier Company, United Technology, said that it would continue with previously announced plans to close a factory in Huntington, Ind, and transfer its functions to Mexico. How should we be represented in the holy high places? The best figures available can reasonably be examined in two ways. We were unable to reach a spokesman for \"United Technologies\" for comments on Sunday, so we will review the estimates reported in the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and others. The first way to add the number - which does not support McGee &apos; s point of view - is by looking at the functions of carriers. Once again, more than 1,400 jobs were transferred to Mexico before the intervention of the new administration. Numerous reports indicate that 800 trade union workers, most of them in construction furnaces, have been provided from that station. This means that more than half, or 57 percent, of the estimated 1,400 jobs that were to be lost from the Indianapolis factory. This is slightly less than the point of \"over 1,000 jobs\" that we heard from Benes, Trump and Carrier. According to CNNMoneu, this total is enlarged by taking into account 300 managerial and engineering functions primarily occupied by the parent company United Technologies, which was not at risk of moving to Mexico. The letter McGee talked about in the show was sent to the employees on December 1st. The transport company stated that it would proceed with its previous plan to move the manufacturing lines of the fan rolls out of the country. Break: In a letter to workers, the carrier confirms that fan jobs will be transferred to Mexico by the end of 2017. @rtv6 @Inditiwick pic.twitter.com/pcH5ZPuh4 - Rafael Sanchez (@RafaelOnTV) December 2, 2016 \"while this announcement is good news for many, we realize that it is not good news for all,\" read the message. \"We are moving forward with previously announced plans to move the manufacturing lines of the fan rolls, with the expectation that they will be completed by the end of 2017.\" While the message does not use specific numbers, news reports suggest that moving the fan file would cost 600 jobs in the United States. There's more to it than that in the story. The incoming administration was unable to reach an agreement to prevent the closure of the Huntington Technologies Plant. So 700 of these jobs will be contracted from abroad to Mexico. So between the loss of jobs in Carrier and Huntington, about 1,300 jobs will be transferred to Mexico under the umbrella of \"United Technologies.\" In view of the broader view, McGee is right that less than half (or 38 per cent) of the 2,100 jobs are at risk of export and end up staying. Our referee McGee said that less than half of the jobs than the carrier's deal actually stayed in the United States. If you only calculate the number of jobs in the tanker plant, which Trump promised to save and what McGee referred to in the offer, the claim is not accurate. In fact, more than half of the jobs will remain in the United States because the deal keeps about 800 of the 1,400 jobs in the tanker factory. However, its statement is correct when it is applied more broadly to include jobs that will be lost from the closure of the United Technology Plant in Huntington, as well as hundreds of jobs that have not been provided in the carrier &apos; s transaction. McGee's statement is partially accurate but needs to be clarified, so we assess the claim half correct. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/228c9a4-bea8-420d-b946-d81fe8327f9", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03896"}
