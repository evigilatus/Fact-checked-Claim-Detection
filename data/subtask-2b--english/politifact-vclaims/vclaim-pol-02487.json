Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., went head-to-head with an audience member after he criticized the United Nations\u2019 treatment of Israel\u00a0in the final year of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\"I don't know really what they do other than attack Israel,\" DeSantis said during a Jan. 11 event at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative organization. \"In that year, they did 24 resolutions, and 20 of them were against Israel.\"\nAn unnamed person in the audience objected to that point after the speech, saying it \"was very disgraceful and sad that you said something as an elected official that's blatantly not true.\" The man offered another statistic for anti-Israel resolutions and told DeSantis to \"double-check your facts.\"\n\"I will. This stuff been widely reported,\" DeSantis said. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much up for dispute.\"\nPolitiFact Florida wanted to see about that.\u00a0\nDeSantis was referring to a more narrow count of resolutions from the U.N. General Assembly, and not the U.N. system. That\u2019s important to know, because the United Nations adopted hundreds of resolutions in 2016 \u2014 not just 24.\nA closer look at resolutions against Israel\nAny United Nations body can issue a resolution, which is a formal text or statement. But the most resolutions are issued by the Security Council or the General Assembly.\nThe 15-member Security Council is the only body of the U.N. that can pass binding resolutions, which member states are required to\u00a0implement under the U.N. Charter.\u00a0The council can pass economic sanctions and launch investigations and peacekeeping missions.\u00a0\nFor example, the Security Council adopted resolution 2397 in December 2017 in response to Pyongyang's Nov. 29 ballistic missile test. It established sanctions against North Korea that restricted fuel imports\u00a0as well as the ability of its citizens to work abroad.\nThen there\u2019s the U.N. General Assembly,\u00a0comprised of all 193 member states. Unlike the Security Council, General Assembly resolutions are non-binding and do not carry any legal force on member states.\u00a0\nSome resolutions take public policy stances on serious issues and conflicts, while others are less significant.\u00a0Resolution 71/124 desiginated May 2 as World Tuna Day. Resolution 71/4 appointed Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres as U.N. secretary-general.\nParsing Desantis\u2019 evidence: A partial look of 2016\nDeSantis spokeswoman Elizabeth Fusick said he was referring to resolutions passed during the 71st session of the U.N. General Assembly\u00a0from September 2016 to September 2017.\nBut the Assembly adopted about 330\u00a0resolutions during that time. So where is DeSantis getting his information?\nFusick pointed to an analysis by UN Watch, a pro-Israel watchdog group that monitors criticism by the United Nations of the Jewish state.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Harrington\n\n\nstated on November 12, 2011 in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz \"has blamed the Republicans for the creation of Hamas.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 December 5, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUN Watch\u2019s analysis does not pertain to all of 2016, however. It only looks at resolutions passed in the last two months of\u00a02016. In that timeframe, the UN Watch analysis showed the General Assembly adopted 20 resolutions that \"singled out\" Israel.\nIn contrast, only four other resolutions were adopted condemning other nations: one each against Ukraine and Iran, and two about Syria.\u00a0In a subsequent December 2016 story, UN Watch added two more resolutions against Syria and North Korea.\nThe General Assembly resolutions against Israel are largely symbolic.\u00a0Elliott Abrams, senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted that a 2017 General Assembly vote against Israel was followed by no concrete steps in an issue brief.\nSo why adopt them at all? Michael Koplow, Israel Policy Forum's policy director, said the resolutions are an easy way for Arab and Muslim states to indicate their opposition to Israel\u00a0and also single out the United States.\nWhether the specific resolutions that are critical of Israel are justified is not something we will evaluate in this fact-check However, we will note that there are conflicting opinions on whether some of those resolutions should count as \"anti-Israel.\"\nKoplow pointed to UN Watch's inclusion of\u00a0resolution 71/126, which he said\u00a0does not \"single-out\" Israel. Instead it welcomes humanitarian assistance and economic aid for Gaza, and reiterates multiple times the need for the Palestinian Authority to be in charge of implementing development projects rather than Hamas.\nSecurity Council measures against Israel are rare\nThe situation is reversed for resolutions passed by the powerful Security Council.\nMainstream news reports in December 2016 did mention the Security Council\u2019s resolution 2334, which condemned Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories as \"constituting a flagrant violation under international law.\"\nThe vote was significant, because the United States abstained from the vote. For this reason, the U.N. Security Council was able to adopt the resolution \u2014 which usually doesn't happen.\n\"Israel is shielded from critical resolutions for the most part, because of the United States,\" said Louis Charbonneau, the director of the United Nations program at Human Rights Watch.\nA single vote from one permanent member on the Security Council can veto a resolution. Charbonneau said the United States has a history of vetoing resolutions that are critical of Israel, especially under the Trump administration.\nFor example, in December 2017 the United States blocked a Security Council vote on a resolution that directed all states to stop building diplomatic missions in Jerusalem.\nThis point explains the audience member\u2019s issue with DeSantis. After calling DeSantis out for lying, the audience member said that the U.N. adopted 76 resolutions, and only one was related to Israel in 2016. He was referring to the number of resolutions passed by the Security Council in 2016.\nOur ruling\nDeSantis said the United Nations spent one year doing \"24 resolutions, and 20 of them were against Israel.\"\nThese numbers are wrong. The\u00a0United Nations' General Assembly passed hundreds of resolutions in the year-long 2016-17 session \u2014 not two dozen.\nDeSantis was apparently trying to repeat a watchdog group's findings that 20 of 24 (and then 26) General Assembly resolutions against other countries, over a few months\u00a0in 2016, were against Israel. But his sweeping public comment contained no trace of those clarifications, and he doubled down on his statement at the event.\nHis effort to boil\u00a0down a complex\u00a0system into a sound bite doesn't check out.
