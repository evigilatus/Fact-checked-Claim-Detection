However, he has praised a proposal that would make those cuts, saying he is most influenced on Social Security by the proposal\u2019s author.\nOn Sept. 12, 2016, it was Gallagher\u2019s turn. He released a TV ad accusing Nelson of having \"backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million.\"\nLet\u2019s see how this one rates.\n2005 votes\nGallagher points to a vote that Nelson, then a member of the Wisconsin Assembly, took on the 2005-\u201907 state budget -- a 394-page document with thousands of figures and provisions.\nOne provision in the budget, which was adopted by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, eliminated state income taxes on Social Security benefits.\nSo, despite Gallagher\u2019s claim, there was not a proposal for higher taxes on Social Security.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut eliminating the tax did save Wisconsin Social Security recipients an estimated $99.7 million per year, roughly what Gallagher claimed, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\nNelson voted against the budget. But does that mean he voted against the Social Security provision it contained?\nWhen voting on something as huge as a state budget, a lawmaker could vote no for any number of reasons having to do with spending, policies or other factors. In other words, a no vote on the overall budget doesn\u2019t mean a lawmaker opposed every single provision, or even any particular provision.\nNelson has said he voted no because the budget reduced funding for education.\nThe budget didn\u2019t actually reduce funding for public schools. It added $458 million over the two-year period. But the amount was less than half of the $938 million increase advocated by Doyle, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported at the time.\nThere\u2019s one more point -- a significant one.\nNelson voted for an amendment that added the repeal of the tax on Social Security benefits to the budget. \u00a0So, he was for the repeal, even though he voted against the overall state budget that ultimately accomplished the repeal.\nGallagher\u2019s campaign called it a \"show\" vote. \u00a0But unlike the budget, it was an up-or-down vote on a single provision and, as such, gives a clearer idea of his position.\nOur rating\nGallagher says Nelson \"backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million.\"\nNelson voted against the 2005-\u201907 state budget, which ended the state income tax on Social Security benefits, saving seniors more than $95 million per year.\nBut that\u2019s not the same as backing higher taxes on Social Security, something that was not even on the table. And a vote against the overall state budget doesn\u2019t mean Nelson opposed eliminating the tax on Social Security benefits. Indeed, he voted for the amendment that added that provision to the budget.\nWe rate Gallagher\u2019s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/35810e3c-d936-4666-b6dc-4fb66acd6d61", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04229"}
