The amount he refers to is what has been requested by the administration for the upcoming fiscal year, subject to adjustments by Congress.\n\nThe claim that the United States has spent $500 billion in Iraq is not entirely accurate, but it, too, is pretty darn close. Estimates vary on the precise amount spent since the 2003 invasion, but two of the most credible sources, the Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Budget Office, give the total as approximately $450 billion and $413 billion, respectively.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, Dodd's assertion that U.S. spending in Iraq has already passed the half trillion dollar mark is slightly exaggerated, but that's a quibble.\n\n\nHis overall point that spending on aid to Latin America is only a small fraction of Iraq spending is very much on target.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16618"}
