Why do you think that would be? \u00a0I think that's exactly right: Me. There's just no other explanation\"\nWhether Limbaugh is giving praise where praise is due, we can\u2019t know for sure. But we did want to check out his claim that America leads in climate change skepticism.\nGlobal lukewarming\nWe\u2019ll start with Limbaugh\u2019s source.\nIn its first-ever Global Trends Survey, Ipsos MORI used an online poll to survey roughly 32,000 adults in 20 countries (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Great Britain, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United States.)\nRespondents were asked about their attitudes on climate change. The countries were then\u00a0ranked by the percentage who agreed with the statement.

The United States ranked near the middle of the nations when asked if there is too much of a fuss made about the environment. And Americans recycle at average rates -- though Duffy noted recycling could be motivated by other concerns such as use of resources and socialization.\nHockey stick gaffes\nThe survey itself is somewhat limited. While more than 1,000 people were surveyed in some countries including the United States, other countries such as Argentina, Belgium, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Sweden and Turkey included around 500 individuals. Duffy explained that this was due to client interest in the those markets, as Ipsos MORI is a market researcher.\nWho was surveyed is also important. Ipsos MORI said the survey was representative of the general adult population in \"developed\" (shorthand for greater Internet access) nations such as the United States. But in developing nations, Ispos said it surveyed a \"more affluent and \u2018connected\u2019 population\" to represent an emerging middle class, according to Duffy.\nTo some pollsters, this method of surveying is problematic. It doesn\u2019t make sense to compare the elites of one country to the general population of another, said University of Maryland public policy researcher Steven Kull.\n\"If you\u2019re looking at public opinion in a country, look at the country. If you want to look at a subset, look at a subset. Otherwise it\u2019s apples to oranges,\" he said. \u00a0\nStill, Ipsos\u2019 findings are fairly consistent with the most recent Pew Research Center survey -- where 67 percent of Americans said that there is solid evidence of global warming, and 44 percent say it\u2019s mostly due to human activity. A separate Pew Global poll found that when stacked up against 22 other countries, the United States was one of the least concerned about global warming, right under China and Britain and outranking only Poland and Pakistan. (Interestingly, Ipsos found that 91 percent of people in China said the world was heading for an environmental disaster unless we change our habits. Duffy said this can be explained again by the sampling approach and mode of interview.)\nOne of the most comprehensive polls we found was Gallup\u2019s 2010 survey of 111 countries. Though nearly all Americans were aware of global warming, 47 percent -- the largest percentage in the world -- said it was due to solely natural causes. About half said global warming was at least partly anthropogenic, a 12-percentage-point drop since the last Gallup poll in 2008.\nThat\u2019s slightly below the world\u2019s average but far below the rates in developed countries.\n\nLower percentages of belief in human-caused climate change in developing nations make sense, given correspondingly lower rates of awareness, education and literacy, said Riley Dunlap, an environmental sociologist at Oklahoma State University. But in the United States, it\u2019s politics\u00a0that is causing the skepticism.\nThe ruling\nLimbaugh said that the United States is \"the leading nation with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change.\"\nWhile he cites an exact figure reported by Ipsos MORI, the study itself doesn\u2019t capture the belief of general populations, only those with an Internet connection. Other polls we looked at indicate that a good proportion of developing countries have higher rates of doubt. But among peers, the United States is one of the most -- if not, the most -- skeptical when it comes to believing climate change has human factors.\nWe rate Limbaugh\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07528"}
