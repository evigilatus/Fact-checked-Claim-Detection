The man did his time and constantly gives back. But you want us to forget about this,\" said text above a photo that shows a black man with a bloody face being grabbed up by a white man who appears to be looking at the photographer and either smiling or grimacing. Another white man in a U.S. Army sweatshirt is also in the photo, standing next to the black man and looking at the camera.\nVick served time in prison after pleading guilty to charges related to a dogfighting ring run in a property he owned.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

That\u2019s not an accurate account.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press photo is from June 21, 1943. News organizations that have used the photo say the image shows two young white men helping a black man to his feet after he was badly beaten in street fighting during race riots in Detroit. The captions don\u2019t explain why one of the men appears to be smiling, or if he\u2019s actually grimacing. The photo posted to Facebook is also cropped and doesn\u2019t show that the man in the U.S. Army sweatshirt in one hand has a rag, seemingly with blood from the black man. The cropping also doesn\u2019t fully show that the black man is hardly able to stand on his own.\nTime magazine in 2014 published a slideshow of photos from the 1943 race riots. One of the photos features the three men but in a different setting, walking huddled; in this shot, the man that appeared to be smiling in the other photo has a worried look. The caption says that the white men are helping the black man to safety, and that black people reported many instances of aid from white people during the rioting.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims to show a photo of a white man smiling while holding a black man with a bloody face.\nThe implication is that the black man was beaten and that the white man smiled about it. It\u2019s difficult to tell whether the white man is smiling or grimacing, but the context of the photo isn\u2019t what is implied by the Facebook post. (There are two white men in the photo, one has a stern look on his face.)\n\nThe two white men in the photo were actually helping the black man during 1943 race riots in Detroit, according to the caption used by news organizations.\nWe rate the Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16719"}
