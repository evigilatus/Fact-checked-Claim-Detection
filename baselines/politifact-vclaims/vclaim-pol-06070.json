Which is something I found out a week ago. I couldn't believe it. If the deal gets rejected, they still get all of this money. Iran is going to be unbelievably powerful and unbelievably rich.\"\nDoes Iran actually get $150 billion from this deal? And if Congress rejects the deal, does Iran still get the money? Let\u2019s take one question at a time.\nThe $150 billion\nIt\u2019s true that Iran will reap significant economic benefits from the deal because many sanctions levied against Iran will be lifted as long as Iran complies with restrictions on its nuclear program. But it\u2019s not like Iran will automatically receive a check or, as some critics have called it, a signing bonus.\n\"Will some considerable portion get transferred to Iran? Sure. But not all of it will automatically. That\u2019s not how this works,\" said Michael Malloy, a law professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law and an expert on economic sanctions.\nFirst, the money already belongs to Iran; Iran just hasn\u2019t been able to access it. The $150 billion figure, primarily thrown around by critics, typically refers to the dollar amounts of Iran\u2019s foreign assets that could be unfrozen when sanctions are lifted. An example is money Iran has earned from selling oil but is held by a foreign bank.\nThere\u2019s also the many billions of dollars Iran has lost in revenues and opportunity costs because the country has not been able to fully participate in the global marketplace, Malloy said.\nBut $150 billion is on the high end of estimates of the value of Iran\u2019s foreign assets, which start as low as $25 billion, said Garbis Iradian, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. Most experts we interviewed, including Iradian, peg the amount of unfrozen assets at about $100 billion, but no one is 100 percent sure of the amount.\nYou can probably get to $150 billion if you count up every possible type of money that sanctions have made difficult for Iran to access and use, said Richard Nephew, an expert on economic sanctions at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.\nIran has financial obligations other than the sanctions, so even if all the sanctions are lifted, they won\u2019t suddenly have all of these assets at their disposal. For example, Iran owes billions to China for infrastructure projects. Lower estimates take into account restrictions on the money other than the sanctions, Nephew said.\nSo even if the total assets are $150 billion, it\u2019s unlikely that that much will actually be available to Iran when sanctions are lifted.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

As a result, Iran would be able to access at least some of its assets that have been frozen under international sanctions. However, experts said it\u2019s highly unlikely that this would amount to $150 billion, the maximum estimate of how much Iran could benefit by the lifting of all international sanctions without regard to Iran\u2019s outstanding financial obligations. Without United States participation, the best estimate we could find was $40 billion.\nTrump\u2019s claim is partially accurate but cherry-picks the high end of estimates for the unfrozen assets.
