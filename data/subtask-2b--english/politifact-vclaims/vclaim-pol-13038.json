The GOP swept to power, taking from Democrats the governor\u2019s office as well as control of the Senate and Assembly.\n\n\"That election needed to happen. Our country is facing challenges we simply can\u2019t ignore,\" Fitzgerald told hundreds of convention-goers at a Wisconsin Dells resort.\n\n\"Our government is growing too fast, too big; it\u2019s becoming too expensive. One out of every five people in Wisconsin are on Medicaid or Medicare. One out of every two are on some kind of government handout.\"\n\nOne out of every two people in Wisconsin -- half the state\u2019s residents -- receive a \"government handout?\"\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of Wisconsinites.\n\nWe asked Fitzgerald\u2019s spokesman, Andrew Welhouse, for evidence to back up the statement. Welhouse initially said his boss\u2019 claim \"looks wrong, but the larger conversation about entitlements and government spending is long overdue.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not much of a defense.\n\nWelhouse did cite this passage from an April 2011 analysis of federal data done by USA Today:\n\n\"A record 18.3 percent of the nation's total personal income was a payment from the government for Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, unemployment benefits and other programs in 2010. Wages accounted for the lowest share of income \u2014 51 percent \u2014 since the government began keeping track in 1929.\"\n\nThat all may be true. But it\u2019s off point. \u00a0\n\nThe article indicates what percentage of Americans\u2019 overall income comes from the government. But it says nothing about what percentage of individual Wisconsinites -- or Americans, for that matter -- receive government assistance.\n\nWe told Welhouse we still wanted to know what Fitzgerald defined as government handouts. When he called back, he said Fitzgerald told him he had meant to say that one in six Wisconsin residents -- not one in two -- get government handouts.\n\nWelhouse didn\u2019t say what Fitzgerald considered as handouts, but he provided another USA Today article, from August 2010. Analyzing state data, the newspaper found that government anti-poverty programs such as welfare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance served a record one in six Americans.\n\nThe article makes no mention of Wisconsin, however.\n\nWe contacted state agencies to see how many Wisconsinites receive government assistance from the four major programs cited in the second article that Welhouse provided. Here\u2019s what we found:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicaid: 1,174,874 people, including more than 465,000 children, receive Medicaid, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Medicaid, including the state\u2019s BadgerCare programs, pays for health care for low-income people.\n\n\n\nFood stamps: 802,979 people, including 353,310 children, were in the FoodShare program as of March 2011, according to the same department.\n\n\n\nUnemployment insurance: 140,055 people are on unemployment, according to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development.\n\n\n\nWisconsin Works (W-2), which replaced traditional welfare: 43,093 people, including 27,614 children, were receiving W-2 cash assistance as of April 2011, according to the Wisconsin Department of Children & Families.\n\n\n\nSince Wisconsin has about 5.65 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, that means roughly one in five state residents is on Medicaid alone.\n\nIf you added the recipients in all four programs, the total would represent 2.16 million people, or more than one in three Wisconsinites. That would still be far short of the one in two that Fitzgerald claimed at the convention.\n\nBut the true figure is lower than 2.16 million because some people receive assistance from more than one of the programs. Based on the available information, we could not determine an exact number \u2013 nor could Fitzgerald.\n\n\nWe also contacted experts at four private organizations in Wisconsin that track government programs. None said they were aware of any study that attempted to determine what percentage of Wisconsin residents receives government assistance or a \"government handout.\"\n\nAll of this is setting aside the question of what constitutes a handout, which is a subjective term.\n\nThe article cited by Fitzgerald\u2019s aide to support the 1-in-2 claim included Social Security and Medicare, both of which workers pay into through payroll taxes. Many people would not consider those programs handouts.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line:\n\nFitzgerald made a bold statement at the state GOP convention -- that one out of every two Wisconsin residents \"is on some kind of government handout.\" He was able to provide no evidence to back the claim, and even one of his aides essentially acknowledged it was wrong. The Senate leader later provided a different number, but the data he relied on is not specific to Wisconsin.\n\nWe rate Fitzgerald\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13038"}
