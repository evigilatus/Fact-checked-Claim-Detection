They all die at the hospital,\" the post says. \"Let that sink in.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThe majority of COVID-19 deaths in the United States occur in an in-patient health care setting or at a nursing home or long-term care facility, according to a provisional death count kept by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But as of Sept. 17, nearly 10,000 people had died at home, too.\u00a0\nA July ProPublica article about home deaths from COVID-19 in Houston describes a woman who died at home while her daughter was calling 911. An autopsy revealed the primary cause of death was COVID-19. They hadn\u2019t realized that she had the disease, but as cases then surged in the Houston area, a rapidly growing number of residents died of COVID-19 at home, according to a review of Houston Fire Department data by ProPublica and NBC News. While many people who die at home aren\u2019t tested for COVID-19, an \"increasing number\" of at-home deaths have been confirmed to show they were caused by the disease, the story says.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
