Cuddlier, even. And maybe you\u2019ve seen it: a dog that looks like it could be a yellow lab curled on top of a grave.\u00a0\n\"It has been 7 years,\" begins a June 19 post of the image. \"The cemetery does not close the gates until he arrives every night. His name is Captain. He sleeps by his master\u2019s grave every night. Semper Fi!\"\nThe post has an American flag emoji and the words, \"I hope I get just one share.\"\u00a0\nIt got more than 25,000 times that, and it was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThat\u2019s because not everything is as it seems in the post. There was a dog named Capit\u00e1n who slept at his owner\u2019s graveside, according to Argentinian newspaper La Voz del Interior, but it wasn\u2019t the dog pictured.\nIn 2012, the paper reported that in Villa Carlos Paz, a mutt called Capit\u00e1n, described as having some German Shepherd in him, disappeared after his owner, Miguel Guzm\u00e1n, died in March 2006. They thought the dog had died until Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s widow and son went to the cemetery about 15 blocks away and found Capit\u00e1n there. The dog wouldn\u2019t follow them and instead stayed in the cemetery, according to La Voz. The following Sunday, the dog walked home with them \"but then returned to the cemetery,\" La Voz quotes Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s widow as saying.\u00a0\nCapit\u00e1n would sometimes visit the house but \"he returns to the cemetery,\" La Voz quotes Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s son as saying.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe newspaper reported that it confirmed the story with H\u00e9ctor Baccega, the director of the Municipal Cemetery of Villa Carlos Paz. Cemetery employees saw Capit\u00e1n enter the cemetery for the first time in January 2007. A video with the news story shows Capit\u00e1n to be black with tan markings.\n\"Every day, at six in the afternoon, he goes and lies down in front of that grave,\" Baccega is quoted as saying. \"Capit\u00e1n walked the cemetery with me every day. But when that time comes he goes to the bottom, where his master\u2019s grave is.\"\nIn February 2018, more than a decade after Miguel Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s death, Capit\u00e1n also died, according to La Paz. He had lived in the cemetery among other stray dogs but he spent nights at his master\u2019s grave, the paper says.\nIn August, Carlos Paz debuted a monument to the dog in the cemetery.\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t know the origins of the image featured in the Facebook post, but it\u2019s appeared on websites like Reddit, where it was shared in 2017 under the title: \"Must have been a good human. Dogs are something else.\" After it was posted on imgur.com a few days later, one user commented:\u00a0 \"FYI, this is from a Facebook post that clarified the dog moved from spot to spot, not keeping any specific headstone company.\"\nThis Facebook post appears to blend fact with fiction. A dog named Capit\u00e1n \u2014 Spanish for captain \u2014\u00a0reportedly slept by his deceased owner\u2019s grave every night. But he was a black German Shepherd mix \u2014 not at all similar to the yellow lab depicted in the photo \u2014 and he apparently spent most of his time at the cemetery, not, not arriving at its cemetery gates every night. And this all happened in Argentina, not the United States. So while the U.S. Marine Corps motto of Semper Fi, or \"always faithful,\" might apply, the American flag emoji does not.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00125"}
