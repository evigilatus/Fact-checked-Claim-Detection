Marsha Blackburn has repeatedly tied Democrat Phil Bredesen, former Tennessee governor, to loose immigration policies.\nA recent Blackburn campaign ad told voters that Bredesen \"won\u2019t stop illegal immigration, because he lured it.\"\nThe ad flashes black and white images of Bredesen\u2019s face against a backdrop of a highway packed with cars.\n\"It was Phil Bredesen who, quote, lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee,\" a man\u2019s voice says in the Oct. 11 ad. \"Bredesen lured illegal immigrants hundreds of miles by offering them driver certificates.\n\"Now, Bredesen opposes President Trump\u2019s immigration ban. And Bredesen admits, \u2018I don\u2019t believe the wall is the right answer.\u2019\n\"Phil Bredesen. He won\u2019t stop illegal immigration, because he lured it.\"\nThe voiceover closes with shadowy images of young men ascending a ladder or a wall, presumably an illegal border crossing.\nWe took a closer look at whether Bredesen \"lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee.\"\nKey takeaways\n\u2022 Between 2001 and 2006, Tennessee went from giving\u00a0immigrants in the country illegally full driver's licenses,\u00a0to giving them driver's certificates, to giving them nothing.\n\u2022\u00a0 Under a 2004 law, illegal immigrants came from as far away as New Jersey to get certificates \u2014 before returning to their home states.\n\u2022 \u00a0In the face of abuses, Bredesen ended the certificate program in 2006.\nDriver\u2019s licenses in Tennessee: A bipartisan history\nThe arc of the state's laws on driving privileges for the undocumented goes from granting them regular driver's licenses to granting them nothing. Blackburn's issue with Bredesen deals with a policy adjustment in the middle.\nIn 2001, Tennessee passed a law that allowed\u00a0a person without a Social Security number to get a typical driver\u2019s license. The bill had\u00a0support from most Democratic lawmakers and a bit under half of the Republican ones. Republican Gov. Don Sundquist signed it. Blackburn was a state senator and voted against it.\nBredesen took office in 2003.\u00a0In 2004, in the middle of a growing demand for tighter identification standards in the wake of the 9-11 terrorist attacks, Bredesen proposed creating a driver\u2019s certificate. Anyone without a Social Security number who met the ordinary requirements for a license, such as passing a driver's test and proof of Tennessee residence, could get one.\nIt was billed as a compromise between traffic safety and national security needs.\n\"Its purpose is to make sure people understand the law and the rules of the road,\" said Melissa McDonald, the spokeswoman for the Department of Safety in a 2005 New York Times article. \"You can't buy beer with it. You shouldn't be able to board a plane with it.\"\nThe driver\u2019s certificate card bore the words, \"For driving purposes only \u2014 not valid for identification.\"\u00a0Unlike a regular driver\u2019s license, a certificate expired after one year.\nThe 2004 bill passed muster overwhelmingly with both Republicans and Democrats. The vote in the state Senate was 32-0, including 15 Republican senators, and in the House, with 45 Republicans, the vote was 96-2. (By then, Blackburn was in the U.S. Congress.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbuses uncovered\nThe law took effect in June 2004. By October, people began gaming the system.\nIn one case, according to court papers, a woman in Tennessee \"transported illegal aliens from New Jersey to Tennessee in order to procure certificates for driving.\"\nShe provided them with \"hotel rooms while in Tennessee, and documents purporting to show that the aliens had addresses in the state.\" The judge in the case wrote that the aliens said \"they wanted the licenses so that they could drive to their jobs in New Jersey.\"\nWhere the immigrants went after they had their certificates has some bearing here. Watching Blackburn\u2019s ad, you might think that the program attracted them to Tennessee to live. That doesn\u2019t seem to be what happened.\nAttorney Mike Whalen represented the women who brought in immigrants from New Jersey.\n\"To the best of my understanding, none of these folks stayed in Tennessee,\" Whalen said. \"I speak Spanish, so I represent lots of folks who are undocumented. Never saw it.\"\nA larger scam operated out of a private driving school in Winchester, Tenn. Investigators discovered a scheme where people at the driving school bribed state workers to provide both licenses and certificates for undocumented immigrants. Officials said hundreds of illegal immigrants were directed to the school.\nThe word \"lure\" comes from an Associated Press headline about the investigation.\nCertificate program ends\nAs federal and state law enforcement began arresting and charging people in late 2005 and early 2006, Bredesen shut down the certificate program.\n\"It\u2019s clear from talks with law enforcement authorities that there are issues with this program that need to be addressed,\" Bredesen said in March 2006. \"The only responsible course of action is to suspend the program while we determine the next steps.\"\nStephen Fotopulos was policy director with the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition in 2006. Fotopulos said his advocacy group tried to preserve the program by making it more rigorous.\n\"For months we worked with Department of Safety to change the process of getting a driver's certificate to make sure that only people in Tennessee would get it,\" Fotopulos told us.\nBut in 2007, the Legislature passed and Bredesen signed the full termination of the program. With about 10 Democrats dissenting, the measure passed by wide majorities in both the House and Senate.\nOur ruling\nBlackburn said that Bredesen \"lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee\" by offering a driver\u2019s certificate for the undocumented. The one accurate part of the claim is that people came from out of state and fraudulently applied for both certificates and full driver's licenses.\nAfter that, the claim begins to break down.\nBredesen swapped a more lenient licensing law signed by his Republican predecessor for a less useful certificate that could not serve as official identification and lasted for only a year.\nTo pin the law to Bredesen ignores that nearly every Republican lawmaker approved that change.\nWhen problems surfaced, Bredesen preempted the Legislature and ended the program by executive action. The next year, Republicans and most Democrats voted to affirm that move.\nLastly, the ad strongly implies that Bredesent sought to have illegal immigrants stay in Tennessee. There is no evidence for that.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-10-25 21:36:11 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Says Phil Bredesen \"lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee.\"     Marsha Blackburn Republican nominee for U.S. Senate for Tennessee https://youtu.be/iGtlJqdKXb0   In an attack ad.
