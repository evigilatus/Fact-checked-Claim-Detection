It was flagged by Facebook as part of the social media giant\u2019s attempts to stamp out fake news on its site.\nThe post opens by saying Pence, who was governor of Indiana at the time, had signed a restrictive abortion bill. It then goes on to quote Pence as saying the bill didn\u2019t have an exception for victims of rape because \"we\u2019d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion.\"\nTo be clear, Pence never said these things. The story originated on a family of websites known for creating stories based on real events, but with made-up details in what it describes as an attempt to be funny.\nPoliticot.com is part of the Newslo network of sites, which we\u2019ve written about before, including one fake story about Pence calling Michelle Obama \"the most vulgar first lady we\u2019ve ever had.\" We rated that Pants On Fire!\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe site describes itself as a \"hybrid News/Satire platform\" that focuses on \"entertainment.\" The only indication that the stories might be fake is a \"Show Facts\" button that highlight what is true, leaving the reader to surmise that the rest of the story is contrived.\nIn this case, what Politicot.com deems as \"facts\" is limited to the opening paragraph, which noted Pence had \"recently\" signed a bill restricting abortions.\nPence did sign an abortion bill in March 2016 that prevented women from getting an abortion due to the race, gender, or disability of the fetus. Indiana already was one of the most restrictive states in the country for women seeking abortions.\nThe Politicot.com story seems to have been timed to react to Pence being picked as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate on July 15. The site did not respond to our request for clarification.\nWe\u2019ve acknowledged in the past that Politicot.com\u2019s related sites don\u2019t do a good enough job of pointing out their stories are fake, and exacerbate problems by building contrived details upon real news events. This story is no different, and plenty of other sites posted it as truth.\nWe rate this claim Pants On Fire!\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/99addd99-9735-4cbb-9db7-4c23c53cd885", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03725"}
