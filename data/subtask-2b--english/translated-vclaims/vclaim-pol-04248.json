The Waipak Baldwin machine has been targeting Trump since he became JOP candidate. In August 2016, we assessed half of her claim that Trump \"has a long history of exporting jobs abroad.\" Trump's brand products like his clothes were made abroad, but those jobs were always abroad, not American jobs that were transferred. In support of its current claim, Baldwin's campaign cited editorial articles from The New York Times and the Washington Post, both of which said that Trump would be the party's first major candidate since 1976 - 40 years ago - for not releasing his tax returns. As mentioned in an editorial by Boston Globe, it has been over 40 years. But there is an exception. We checked a archive of presidential tax returns maintained by tax analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy. It appears that the return to 1976, except for one candidate from the main parties, has released at least one return. Only Republican Gerald Ford, who lost to the Democratic Party Jimmy Carter in 1976, did not release the proceeds (issued summary tax statements), showing the archives. Factecheck.org also found that Ford is the only exception. On January 10, 2021, in a television interview, \"It takes a long time on election day to download those cards, which is why we have 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. to throw the ballot papers at Milwaukee.\" \u2022 On January 15, 2012, Joe Thorndik, the director of the Tax History Project in Tax Analysts, told us that Ford's summaries are clearly not the same as tax returns. For example, they did not provide detailed information on such matters as sources of income and charitable donations. Moreover, it is impossible to know what may be in return unless you see return. It should also be noted that while some candidates have launched many years of return - in 1996 Bob Dowell presented 30 years worth - others have not. In 1980, the Republican Ronald Reagan issued only one return, and in 2012, the Republican Mitt Romney issued two. In the 2016 race, Hillary Clinton, a democratic candidate, released returnees from 2000 to 2015. Trump said that he had not released his taxes because he was under review. When he claimed that he \"released the biggest financial review of anyone in the history of politics. You don't learn much in the tax report. Polly Fuckett National Classification was wrong. Trump issued a comprehensive document (and required by law) detailing his personal financial assets. However, experts say that tax returns will provide valuable details of his effective tax rate, the types of taxes he has paid, the amount he has provided for charity, as well as a more detailed picture of his assets. Our assessment of Baldwin says that, with the exception of Trump, \"every other major party candidate\" over the past 40 years has issued their tax returns. She's almost right. During that period, the only presidential party candidate not released was Ford, the Republican candidate in 1976. It should also be noted that many candidates have been released for many years of return, but some have been released only one or two. We appreciate that Baldwin's statement is mostly true. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3b799eb7-8454-41ff-a343-3c13c44e9c78", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04248"}
