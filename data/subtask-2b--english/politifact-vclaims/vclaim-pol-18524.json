Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) November 12, 2020 \nWe reached out to Giuliani\u2019s communications director to ask where he got his number\u00a0 and did not hear back.\nThe Pennsylvania Department of State, which oversees elections, says the former New York mayor\u2019s claim is unfounded. We found no rationale or explanation for how so many votes could have been fraudulently cast.\n\"There is no factual basis for this claim,\" said agency communications director Wanda Murren. \"Allegations of fraud and illegal activity have been repeatedly debunked and dismissed by the courts.\"\nA U.S. District Court judge rebuffed a GOP suit that claimed Republican observers had been unfairly barred from certain areas of the Philadelphia Convention Center where mailed ballots were counted. Pressed by the judge, Republicans acknowledged that they did have representatives on the scene.\nDemocrats and Republicans then established more detailed ground rules for how many party representatives would observe the count.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Guiliani\u2019s statement suggests that over 40% of them were illegal. His 600,000 figure is roughly equal to the entire number of mail-in ballots that were cast for Biden in the two cities.\nThe state Republican Party is challenging a state Supreme Court ruling that allowed for counting mailed ballots that arrive within three days after polls closed on Election Day. State election officials said about 10,000 mail ballots were received during those three days. The state has kept those ballots separate, pending a resolution of the GOP challenge. The state did not include them in tallies that led the state to be called for Biden.\nSome have suggested that many ballots were counted without legally required oversight. We recently rated False a claim along those lines from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and debunked a claim from Trump that Republican observers were barred. We found no evidence that ballots were inappropriately cast or that observers were barred from watching.\nThe Pennsylvania law that established mail-in voting and allows observers to be present when mail ballots are opened and recorded was passed by a Republican Legislature.\n\"Any laws around poll watchers apply equally to both major parties and any third parties,\" said Suzanne Almeida, interim executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania. \"I have seen no evidence that one party\u2019s poll watchers have been treated any differently than the other.\"\nOur ruling\nGiuliani said over 600,000 votes were unlawful in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. There is no evidence to back that up.\nPennsylvania law allows representatives from both parties to observe the count, and Republicans in the state told a judge that they did have monitors in the room.\nPennsylvania\u2019s Department of State denied that any votes were improperly counted.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18524"}
