The final one, Amendment 27, is about congressional pay.\nSome politicians have proposed amendments similar to the one in the post, but all have failed.\nIn 2013, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky submitted a joint resolution that proposed an amendment to the Constitution with wording that was almost identical to the post. It read: \"Congress shall make no law applicable to a citizen of the United States that is not equally applicable to Congress.\"\nThe bill never made it out of committee and failed again when it was reintroduced in the Senate the following year. Similar proposals introduced in the House around the same time also failed.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16676"}
