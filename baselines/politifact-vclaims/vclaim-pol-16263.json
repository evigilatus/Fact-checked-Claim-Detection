She replied that since she was young, she had felt the presence of God many times.\n\n\nShe added, \"You know, I am someone who has talked a lot about my life. You know more about my life than you know about nearly anybody else's, about 60 books' worth, some of which are, you know, frankly, a little bit off-base.\"\n\n\nShe has mentioned the 60-book figure several times before. We wondered if she was right.\n\n\nWe don't normally rely on Wikipedia as a primary source for PolitiFact because it's open-to-all-editors approach raises questions about its accuracy, but we found it has the most complete list of Clinton books. It conveniently separates them into volumes by Clinton herself, as well as those that take an anti-Clinton and pro-Clinton approach.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
