Greg Abbott recently celebrated the 2015 Texas legislative session, which ended last June, as the \"most conservative ever.\"\nAbbott, rousing delegates to the Republican Party of Texas convention in Dallas, said in his May 2016 address: \"As just one example, we passed the fewest laws in 20 years, proving that better government doesn\u2019t have to be more government.\"\nSetting aside what this proves or not, we wondered if indeed the 2015 Legislature approved the fewest pieces of legislation since 1995, 10 regular biennial sessions before.\nThis didn\u2019t take long to confirm; the Texas Legislative Reference Library presents relevant bill statistics for every regular and special session since 1879. And according to the library\u2019s compilation, the 1,280 Texas House and Senate bills that made it into law in 2015 were the fewest since 1,063 measures made it into law in 1995, the first year of Republican George W. Bush\u2019s tenure.\nOver the two decades, the next-lowest count of bills passed into law was 1,334 in 2003, followed by 1,354 in 2011 and 1,369 in 2005, according to the library.\nA few earlier sessions had low law counts (though, of course, Abbott\u2019s claim didn\u2019t reach to these years). Those 140-day sessions occurred in 1983 (1,092 bills-into-law); 1985 (979 bills-into-law); 1989 (1,264 bills-into-law); 1991 (924 bills-into-law); and 1993 (1,050 bills-into-law), according to the library.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this check, we didn\u2019t count other indicators of legislative activity such as proposed constitutional amendments, which lawmakers place before voters (without a governor\u2019s say).\nOur ruling\nAbbott said the 2015 Legislature \"passed the fewest laws in 20 years.\"\nSo it did, making this statement True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.
