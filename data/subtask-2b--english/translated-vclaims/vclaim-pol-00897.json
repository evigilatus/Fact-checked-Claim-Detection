However, critics often object that economic gains were at least as good, if not better, as they were under his predecessor, Barack Obama. Matthew David, a former Republican adviser who now considers himself an independent person and a critic of Trump, recently tweeted a statistical comparison in this way, a comparison that was later picked up on Facebook. \"So the growth of jobs and stock growth in the first two years of Trump declined from where they were (in the last two years) from Obama,\" David tweeted on 8 March. \"Budget deficit, trade deficit and hate crimes are rising dramatically today in terms of where they were when Obama left office.\" So job growth and stock growth in the first two years of Trump declined in terms of the last two years of Obama. The budget deficit, the trade deficit and hate crimes have today risen significantly from when Obama left office. Matthew Dodd (@matthewjdowd) 8 March 2019 Dowd is true about increases in the Trump budget deficit, trade deficit, and hate crimes. But what about David's assertion that \"the growth of jobs and stock growth in the first two years of Trump declined in terms of where they were (in the past two years) from Obama\"? And over there, more Christians are exhausted. (Daud did not respond to queries.) :: We examined the data of the Labour Statistics Office on monthly increases in employment for a period of two years: from 20 January 2015 to 20 January 2017 (last two years of Obama) and from 20 January 2017 to 20 January 2019 (first two years of Trump). It is true that the average monthly increase for Obama was higher, albeit not so much - an increase of 210,291 posts per month for Obama during that period, compared with an increase of 205,720 posts per month for Trump. This represents approximately 2 per cent for Obama. The senior job economist, Ged Kolko, who is a little deeper in figures, observed that the average monthly increase in employment declined from 2015 to 2016 to 2017. The surprise came in 2018, when average monthly gains in employment exceeded the levels of 2016 and 2017. Kolko said that \"tax cuts may have temporarily helped, along with a strong global economy,\" referring to the reform that Trump signed at the end of 2017. \"All under Obama and under Trump, job growth far exceeds what is required to keep pace with the growth of the labour force and the population of working age.\" After all, however, the \"best description\" of functional data between the end of Obama and the early years of Trump is \"more than the same,\" said Steve Vasari, economist at the University of Washington, St. Louis. In this part of David's tweet, we looked at two common stock market measures: the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 500 from Standard and Bor. (As the graphs below indicate, the general patterns were markedly similar). In stock measurement, we found that Trump had the statistical edge during the same time we looked for job growth. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 On January 20, 2012, Dow rose by 24.6 percent under Trump, compared to 13.2 percent for Obama. For S&P 500, Trump rose by 17.6 per cent, compared with 12.3 per cent for Obama. If I continue to calculate market performance to date, the record under Trump only grows stronger - 28.9 per cent for Dao since his inauguration, and an increase of 22.9 per cent for S&P 500. So on this meter, David is wrong. As we have noted, most of the Presidents have recently seen significant increases in the stock market compared to their terms. For example, Presidents Obama, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan all oversaw an increase of three percentage numbers over their eight terms. The only President who lost his land was President George W. Bush, whose last year in office coincided with the beginning of the Great Depression. Fazari said he wasn't surprised by the flow of shares under Trump. \"One obvious benefit of stock prices in the Trump period is a substantial reduction in corporate tax,\" he said. \"It is not surprising at all that if taxes on corporate profits are reduced, equity prices will rise. The biggest question is whether the corporate tax reduction has been more successful in the economy. The results have been largely disappointing so far with the repurchase of shares rather than the boom of investment and what now seems to be just a temporary and small shock to growth in the middle of last year.\" Some warnings are always important to note that the President does not deserve full recognition of the gains in posts while monitoring (or full blame for the loss of employment). There are many other factors, from the state of the world economy to changes in technology, that can have an impact. It should also be noted that not every American is an investor in the stock market, so it is likely to be a less important economic measure than employment or GDP growth. Our Twitter judgment was quoted, \"The growth of labor and stock growth in the first two years of Trump are down from where they were (in the past two years) from Obama.\" David's right about job growth under the bosses, although the difference between them is very small. But he was wrong about the stock market, which increased even more during the first two years of Trump than in the last two years of Obama. We evaluate the statement half right.
