But by the end of March 2017, Sen. Larry Taylor\u2019s Senate Bill 3 cleared the Education Committee, which he chairs, and the Senate.\nStill, prospects for his proposal to launch state-funded educational savings accounts for students remained uncertain. Texas House members voted 103-44 during action on the 2018-19 state budget to bar state aid from paying for students to attend nonpublic schools.\nIn her letter, Stevenson said that after signing up to testify, she went to work and then returned to the hearing at 2 p.m. \"My name had still not been called,\" she wrote. \"I waited six more hours until my name was finally called after 8 p.m.\n\"Because the order is random,\" Stevenson wrote, \"signing up to speak becomes a game of chicken or stakeout. Who can outlast whom? A random roll call suits lobbyists just fine but not your average citizen.\"\nSo, did Taylor\u2019s committee summon witnesses at random?\nAsked to elaborate, Stevenson said that when she returned to the hearing, others in the audience told her she had to wait to hear her name, no telling when, which led her to conclude the order was random. \"There\u2019s got to be a better way\" of organizing testimony, Stevenson said by phone, \"even if I\u2019m wrong.\"\nOther witnesses comment\nWe turned first to Patsy Spaw, the Senate secretary, who said by phone that committee chairs control how hearings proceed. She said too that people seeking to speak at the March 21 hearing submitted paper witness registration cards to committee staff; there was no option to sign up on an electronic kiosk.\nOur subsequent review of more than 120 \"witness registration\" cards submitted for the hearing enabled us to phone a few witnesses to elicit their experiences.\nArif Panju, an Austin lawyer who testified for SB 3, told us he attended the full hearing. To him, the order of witnesses called to testify seemed fair. Similarly, Robin Lennon, a Kingwood supporter of the measure, said she didn\u2019t see anything random in the witness order. She spoke late, Lennon said, after turning in her witness card after midday.\nOthers echoed Stevenson\u2019s claim.\nAn SB 3 opponent, Ginger Russell of Magnolia, told us she was the first person to turn in a witness card that morning yet ended up speaking about 2:30 p.m. \"There seemed to be no rhyme or reason\" about the order of witnesses, Russell said, adding that she\u2019s sure people who signed up to speak after she\u2019d submitted her card were called before she had her turn.\nSummer Wise, an Austin mother in favor of the legislation, told us she asked a committee aide if there was a particular order to the speakers and was told not. \"It appeared to be kind of random,\" Wise said.\nProponent Russ Duerstine of San Angelo said he was called to testify after 4 p.m. after submitting his witness card before 9 a.m., which felt randomized. \"I do remember feeling like I had no clue who was going to be called next,\" Duerstine said.\nFelicia Miyakawa of Round Rock told us she left the committee her written testimony against SB 3 before leaving to pick up her son that afternoon. Miyakawa said before that, the first witnesses were mostly proponents and that when she asked a committee aide if there was a way for her name to be moved up, she was told that Taylor was setting the order.\nGary Bingham of Mesquite, an SB 3 opponent, told us he submitted his request to speak shortly after 8 a.m. yet didn\u2019t get called up before having to leave for a mid-afternoon flight. \"My suspicion is they stacked the deck the way the chairman wants it,\" Bingham said. \"I can\u2019t prove that.\"\nSenator unavailable for interview\nWe reviewed those witness cards. Each card had a space for staff to record the time it was submitted. But no times were inked in.\nSo we were unable to independently confirm what time Stevenson submitted her postcard-sized witness card where she wrote that she wished to testify against SB 3 on behalf of herself plus \"all 5 million TX public school children.\" \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe asked Taylor, R-Friendswood, to speak to us about how he organized the witnesses, but didn\u2019t win the opportunity. Instead, Matt Welch, an Austin consultant to Taylor, responded partly by pointing out Senate rules demonstrating there isn\u2019t a mandate that any committee hear from witnesses in order.\nIn the Senate\u2019s adopted rules for the 2017 legislative session, Rule 11.18 states that a committee or subcommittee \"chair shall afford reasonable opportunity to interested parties to appear and testify at the hearing.\"\nAnother part says: \"By majority vote, a committee may fix the order of appearance and time allotted for each witness at a public hearing.\" However, Welch said by email that on Taylor\u2019s watch, the committee hasn\u2019t voted to \"fix\" any order of appearance.\nWelch noted, too, that the panel\u2019s rules, which he shared, \"do not stipulate an order of witnesses nor is there a requirement that witnesses testify in the order of their witness card submission.\" The rules are indeed silent on when witnesses should be called to speak; a rule says only that the chairman may limit testimony and discussion.\nOut of curiosity, we also inquired into how House committees handle witnesses. By email, Jason Embry, spokesman for House Speaker Joe Straus, said: \"The chairs of House committees have the discretion to decide the order of witnesses. Many House chairmen choose to call upon witnesses in the order in which they sign up.\"\nThe SB 3 hearing, Welch told us, was largely overseen by the panel\u2019s vice chair, Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville, because Taylor was the author of the proposal under review.\nWelch said a few invited experts led off the hearing. They were followed, he said, by witnesses called in the order they\u2019d signed up in panels of four consisting of pairs supporting or opposing SB 3.\nWelch said: \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s correct to say the whole hearing was randomized,\" in that the experts were not. \"Part of it was randomized, part of it was not.\"\nWatching the hearing\nSeeking clues, we watched much of the Senate-posted hearing video, which showed up front Taylor announcing that each witness would have two minutes.\nThe lead witnesses, we found, included advocates such as a former Wisconsin gubernatorial aide and delegates from the conservative Heritage Foundation and Charles Koch and Goldwater institutes. Also, all but one of eight initial witnesses backed SB 3; Donna Corbin of Lubbock, president of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association, expressed opposition.\nAnd how did Corbin land that spotlight? By phone, the association\u2019s Lonnie Hollingsworth said Corbin wasn\u2019t an invited expert. Rather, he said, the association had alerted a committee clerk that Corbin had to catch a flight.\nBack to the video: In eight-plus hours of testimony after senators returned from a midday recess, people were called to testify mostly in groups of four.\nAnd by our count, before Stevenson was called to speak, followed by 25-plus others, the people who testified included 45 individuals speaking in support of Taylor\u2019s measure, 29 opposed and a few speaking \"on\" his proposal.\nAll told, according to the committee\u2019s alphabetized list of individuals who testified, 67 witnesses ended up speaking in favor of SB 3, 40 expressed opposition and 12 testified without registering a position. In contrast, among 154 people listed as registering a position--most of whom didn't\u00a0seek to testify--38 were in favor, 110 were against and six took no position, the list indicates.\nA little after 8 p.m., Lucio called Stevenson\u2019s name.\n\"She won,\" Taylor then said from the committee dais.\nLucio: \"You\u2019ve been here all day.\"\nStevenson: \"I\u2019ve been patient.\"\nOur ruling\nStevenson wrote that witnesses who signed up to testify before a Senate panel were called randomly regardless of when each person had submitted a card requesting to speak.\nShe has a point. We confirmed witnesses were not called in the order they signed up and whatever method was used wasn\u2019t made clear. From the standpoint of someone spending all day expecting to testify, \"random\" is a fair description.\nWe rate the claim True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.
