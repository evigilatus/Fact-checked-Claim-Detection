That plan's architect? Tommy Thompson.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true Baldwin voted against the Medicare Part D drug program in 2003. And, while we haven\u2019t fact-checked the \"architect\" claim, it\u2019s well-established that Thompson played a key role in winning passage of the drug legislation as Health and Human Services chief for President George W. Bush.\n\nBut what about Thompson\u2019s new claim that Baldwin voted to \"gut\" the Medicare program?\n\nThe vote cited in the ad is Obama\u2019s signature health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Baldwin, a congresswoman since 1999, did join with a strong majority of House Democrats in approving the measure, 219-212, with Republicans unanimously in opposition.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, Medicare spending would be slowed, and money saved would help pay for coverage of the uninsured and other initiatives. Originally, it was estimated that the savings would be more than $500 billion; more recently, that has been revised to $716 billion.\n\nPolitiFact has examined multiple claims across the country that Democrats, through their vote for the \"Obamacare\" law, cut money from Medicare.\n\nThe \"cut Medicare\" Thompson ad closely mirrors a statement by Mitt Romney, who said on Aug. 15: \"Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for \u2018Obamacare.\u2019 \"\n\nPolitiFact Florida rated that Half True, because Romney gave the impression \"Obamacare\" takes money already allocated to Medicare. The savings come from spending reductions over the next 10 years that would slow the rate of growth in Medicare\u2019s budget.\n\nBut here we are rating Thompson\u2019s other Baldwin ad, which uses a word -- \"gut\" -- that ramps up the claim considerably.\n\nAs a frame of reference, in the 2010 Senate race in Wisconsin we reviewed Republican candidate (and now Senator) Ron Johnson\u2019s claim that then-Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat, \"cut Medicare by $523 billion.\" (Again, that was the earlier estimate of Obamacare\u2019s spending-reduction plan.)\n\nWe rated that Mostly False, noting that Medicare spending would still increase, and that Johnson\u2019s additional claim that Feingold was the deciding vote could be made against every incumbent senator who voted for the health care law.\n\nThompson\u2019s claim, by contrast, is \"gut.\"\n\nWe approached the Thompson campaign to back up the ad\u2019s claim.\n\nThey pointed us to Congressional Budget Office memos, and a report by Medicare\u2019s actuary, to refute claims by the Obama campaign that his health care law strengthened the delicate financial position of Medicare. The documentation does confirm that if Obamacare was repealed, more money would be available to spend on Medicare.\n\nBut we also asked two federal budget experts from nonpartisan groups to assess the ad\u2019s use of \"gut.\" Both said it was solidly off the mark.\n\n\"Medicare will continue to grow in nominal dollars and faster than the overall economy,\" said Jason Peuquet, research director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The cost savings in the health law, in Peuquet\u2019s view, actually don\u2019t go far enough to tackle Medicare\u2019s long-term fiscal stability.\n\nOne way to look at it, he said, is that over 10 years, Medicare under Obamacare is projected to grow about 10 percent less than it would have. Even with the slower growth, net Medicare spending is still projected to rise from $504 billion to $877 billion over that period, CBO estimates show. Total projected Medicare spending goes from $598 billion to $1.04 trillion.\n\nSteve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us that \"regardless of whether you think these are good or bad reforms, \u2018gutting\u2019 a program would require far deeper cuts than Obamacare/ACA included.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve tackled a claim of \"gutting\" a government program before.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin accused Gov. Scott Walker of \"gutting\" two tax credits for the poor or elderly. In rating that False in May 2012, we said that while the percentage cut was deep in one of the credits, Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature left them largely intact. Even advocates for the credits said \"gutting\" went too far.\n\nImpact on Medicare\n\nTo be sure, serious health-care experts have raised concerns that health-care access for seniors could be reduced if Obamacare\u2019s cut in the growth of Medicare payments to providers discourages them from accepting Medicare patients. Prediction is difficult, as the Office of the Actuary for Medicare and Medicaid Services said while raising the concern in April 2010.\n\nIn addition, the law tries to save costs on Medicare Advantage, an optional Medicare program run by private insurers. As federal subsidies to Advantage are reduced, recipients could see higher premiums, or lose of some extras like free eyeglasses and gym memberships, we have noted in the past.\n\nSo it\u2019s likely that some reduction in services will result from the health care law.\n\nOn the other hand, the Thompson campaign did not mention that the health care law actually adds new services: It gradually closes the gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage known as the \"doughnut hole,\" funds illness prevention benefits, and seeks to boost access to primary care doctors and other providers.\n\nFinally, we should also note an important bit of context left out of the ad.\n\nVice presidential nominee Ryan\u2019s budget plan -- backed by Thompson -- included the same amount of reductions in future Medicare spending that were part of\u00a0 \"Obamacare, \"PolitiFact National has noted. Ryan said he would keep the savings for future Medicare expenses, not to support the new federal health-care law.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThompson\u2019s new ad says the truth is that \"Baldwin voted to gut Medicare for seniors\" when she backed the health reform law\u2019s cost-containment measures in the Medicare program.\n\nThis is off base or misleading on several fronts.\n\nThe health care law slows Medicare\u2019s growth but spending would still rise significantly, and some new services are added.\n\nThe changes do not promise to hold seniors harmless, but Medicare is not being gutted.\n\nWe rate the claim False.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10123"}
