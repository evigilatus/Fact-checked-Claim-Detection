Scott Walker hired convicted Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen to oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system to help balance the state budget.", "truth_label": "pants-fire", "date": "stated on January 20, 2011 in a chain email and -- briefly -- a union web site:", "title": "A chain e-mail claims Gov. Scott Walker hired convicted Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen to raid the state employee retirement system to balance the state budget", "text": "In some circles in Wisconsin, especially government workers, an e-mail has been ricocheting from in-box to in-box making an eye-popping claim.\n\nIn short: Gov. Scott Walker hired convicted Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen to oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system to help balance the state budget.\n\nThe claim is presented in what appears to be a news article by Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Lee Bergquist. it is meant to mimic an online story, complete with a Jan. 13, 2011 date and a tally of reader comments.\n\nAt one point, it jumped from e-mails to the Internet, briefly appearing on a Little Chute teachers union website.\n\nThe story is a fake. And the statement is false, ridiculously so.\n\nBut the episode gives us a chance to explore, as best we can, how the piece -- apparently an attempt at satire -- made it into the public sphere.\n\nIn some ways, this is a political version of e-mails we see -- and pass along -- all the time.\n\nYou know, jokes about why the Chicago Bears still suck, or silly pictures taken of customers at Walmart. \u00a0\n\nThis one left some people taking the claim seriously -- calling the governor\u2019s office, state union leaders and the Journal Sentinel newsroom. The item reached other teachers union locals and workers in other professions, including the state Department of Corrections.\n\nAnd it has become a flash point between Walker and union leaders, who already have a rocky relationship.\n\nHere\u2019s the gist of the non-news.\n\nThe fake story claims Walker has hired former Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen (not true). And that Jensen plans to use the state retirement system to help Walker balance the state budget (again, not true). It also includes this over-the-top (yet again, not true) statement:\n\nJensen assured police and fire officials that their pensions are safe under Governor Walker but that public employees and teachers who never put their lives on the line nor contributed to the fund ought to be worried. \"Those folks need to take a long hard look in the mirror and reflect on what they have taken away from the people of Wisconsin.\"\n\nThe fake story goes on to \"quote\" Jensen comments from a (never occurred) appearance on Charlie Sykes\u2019 radio talk show on WTMJ-AM (620).\n\nWe don\u2019t know for certain where the fake story came from, though there have been accusations, which we will explore below.\n\nWe do know when it jumped to the Internet.\n\nHow did the item get on the Little Chute Education Association site? Union president and Little Chute High School science teacher Chris Choudoir took the blame.\n\nHe said the fake story came to him in an e-mail on Jan. 14, 2011.\n\nHe posted it on the site, which was launched in November and aimed at the union\u2019s 130 members. In less than an hour he learned he had been punked.\n\n\"It\u2019s not a legitimate article, so I removed it from the blog,\" Choudoir said. \"My intention was not to propagate a false article.\" He sent an e-mail apologizing to his members for the posting. The item was on the site 50 minutes, he said.\n\nHe added: \"That\u2019s the problem with things in type - you don\u2019t pick up on the sarcasm.\"\n\nChoudoir said traffic for the site was high that day -- some 499 hits when he took the article down. Some of those hits came from Walker\u2019s office, which said it received three phone calls and five or six e-mails about the matter.\n\nWalker\u2019s office blames the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the statewide teachers union, for spreading the false e-mail. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie noted that some copies of it bear the name of an employee who appears to work for the union and sent it to \"all,\" including district chapters of the union.\n\nIn one response to a teacher who contacted Walker\u2019s office, Werwie wrote: \"Scott Jensen has no role in the Walker Administration and Governor Walker is not going to raid the pension fund.\"\n\nWerwie concluded: \"It is unfortunate that instead of working to be part of the solution the union who represents you, which claims to have your best interests in mind, spends its time spreading lies and making up fake news stories.\"\n\nWEAC denied responsibility for the e-mail.\n\n\"We can\u2019t confirm where the e-mail came from,\" said spokeswoman Christina Brey. \"We didn\u2019t generate it.\"\n\nBrey said union \u00a0leadership told its regional directors about the item and told them \"no, this is not right. It\u2019s a hoax.\" She added: \"We\u2019ve taken internal action to make sure that news articles are authenticated.\"\n\nLet\u2019s take a deep breath.\n\nSomeone -- it\u2019s unclear who -- tried to give the \u00a0\"Weekend Update\" fake news treatment to a topic that clearly has public employees concerned. Walker has promised that cuts will be made in public employee benefits and suggested the state could reduce union bargaining rights. It may have been a bit of satirical venting, but not everyone got the joke.\n\nPolitiFact\u2019s national site has evaluated 90 chain e-mails, and found many of them to contain simply ridiculous claims. This fake news story joins the heap.\n\nFeel free to forward these words: Pants on Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13746"}
