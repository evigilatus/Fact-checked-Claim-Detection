That's too much.", "text": "Democratic presidential candidate Bittu O'Rourke said that he would launch a 10-year plan, $5 trillion, to combat climate change, which he considered to be the country's greatest threat. Aurourke said that he would invest in infrastructure, because old systems and climate change affected the quality of water that Americans were drinking. \"Six million Americans live in a place where the water they drink is unsafe,\" said O'Rourke, April 29th. In the 2016 presidential election, when the city wrestled with water contaminated by bullets. (We examined the progress of water quality in the city a year ago) Did O'Rourke, former Congressman from Texas, right about 60 million Americans without safe drinking water? Aurroc based his claim on an investigation conducted by News21 in August 2017. We found that his frame was more decisive than the investigation and needed context. News21 is a national initiative to investigate students at the Walter Cronket School of Press and Mass Communications at Arizona State University. Her correspondents analysed 680,000 violations recorded over 10 years (from 1 January 2007) in the US EPA Safe Drinking Water Information System. News 21 examined violations committed by active community water systems, a type of public water system that provides the same population with water throughout the year. This does not include, for example, schools, factories, hospitals or camps where people do not live for a long time. The review took into account health-related violations, monitoring and reporting. The Panel documented violations by EPA throughout the country, from rural communities in California to New York City neighbourhoods. They found that many local water treatment plants - particularly in poor, minority and small communities - did not have the money to purchase equipment to filter pollutants. These include arsenic naturally found in rocks, chemicals in factories, and faeces derived from agriculture. The most relevant results are fact-checking: more than 63 million people have been exposed to potentially unsafe water over the 10-year period analysed. The Aurourke statement reflects the assessment of the 21st century news, but it fails to be accurate - the story did not clearly state that 63 million people were actively affected and noted that some places had solved their water problems. (In addition, EPA has acknowledged that the database may not cover all violations and that some information may be incorrect. The Director of Urban Water Policy for the West Water Initiative at Stanford University, Niosha Agami, said that the majority of the population in the affected areas may have been exposed to unsafe drinking water only for a very short period of time. Manny Teodoro, Assistant Professor at the Department of Political Science of the University of Texas A&M, said that Orok's number was \"very reasonable.\" However, he stressed that he needed to be warned that he was \"probably unsafe.\" Although many systems had improved, regulations had also become stricter over time, and new pollutants were always detected. In an interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry said that Hurricane Harvey \"dropped water in Houston in five days more than Niagara Falls in one year.\" At the national level, nearly 21 million people in 2015 relied on community water systems that violate health standards, according to a study conducted by the University of California, Irvine and Colombia in 2018. It was not clear how many customers had contaminated water in their tap, as one author of the newspaper, Maura Alier, an assistant professor of economics and water policy at the University of California, Irvine, said. While drinking water pollutants over a long period of time can be harmful, many pollutants do not pose direct health risks, many of which last only a few weeks or less. The Aler study did not include the monitoring and reporting of violations, unlike News21, because it said that it was unclear how such violations were to be interpreted - some of them arising from administrative errors or delays that did not directly affect water quality. Data from the Environmental Protection Agency for fiscal year 2017 provide a similar estimate for community water systems involving health-based violations. However, the EPA data, among other restrictions, do not indicate how many people have already received water that does not meet the standards. According to the EPA site, \"there's no way to know.\" According to EPA, community water systems provided services to approximately 30.6 million people with violations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 (October 2018 through December 2018). In most cases, American water systems are safe and reliable, as experts have said. Short-term violations are different from failed systems that cannot provide safe drinking water over long periods of time. These failed systems are often found in rural and low-income communities. There is a need for better tracking of data. The water quality monitoring system currently relies on self-reporting. For smaller systems, because of a lack of personnel, technology and finance, the issue is said by Agami, the water policy expert. There is also no data on water quality in private wells. Our government said, \"60 million Americans live in a place where the water they drink is unsafe.\" In general, it is difficult to determine how many people have unsafe drinking water in the United States. According to EPA, some 22 million people received services from community water networks with reported health violations in FY2017. However, EPA was unable to determine how many people had actually received water in violation. The Agency also stated that some violations could be one hour short. The O'Rourke allegation is an inaccurate explanation for a complex report published by News21. News 21 said that as many as 63 million people were exposed to potentially unsafe water more than once during a 10-year period beginning in 2007. This does not necessarily mean that everyone has unsafe water at present, as Aurourke concluded. Furthermore, experts said that monitoring and reporting violations were important, but did not directly refer to water safety. Aurourke &apos; s statement is more decisive than the data available and the report on which it is based. We assess his claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00663"}
