St. Lucie County had a ballot with two pages, meaning voters who completed both pages cast two cards.\nAccording to St. Lucie County\u2019s 2012 general election results, the number of cards cast in the 2012 general election was 247,383.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGertrude Walker, the county\u2019s supervisor of elections, told us whoever made the image overlooked a disclaimer on the website at the time that explained how a two-page ballot differs from a vote. (It isn\u2019t there anymore, but we can confirm it using the Wayback Machine.)\nThe disclaimer said: \"Turnout percentages will show over 100% due to a two-page ballot. The tabulation system (GEMS) provides voter turnout as equal to the total cards cast in the election divided by the number of registered voters. Also note that some voters chose not to return by mail the second card containing the amendments.\"\nThe same page where the person took the\u00a0number of cards cast also contains the number of votes cast. It\u00a0shows that 123,301 votes were cast in the presidential election out of 175,554 registered voters. So\u00a0the voter turnout for the presidential election was about 70 percent.\nPalm Beach County\nThe post moves farther down the state to Palm Beach County, where there was a \"141% voter turnout\" in 2012.\nThis claim is baseless, and there is no support for the 141 percent.\nCounty data for the 2012 general election shows there were 605,268 votes cast out of 870,182 registered voters. So, Palm Beach County had almost 70 percent voter turnout.\nOur ruling\nThe post makes two claims about voting in Florida counties during the 2012 presidential election.\nBoth are wrong.\nThe figures cited about St. Lucie County mix up the number of votes cast with the number of cards cast. The Palm Beach County claim uses an erroneous percentage, with no real source.\nThe post\u2019s digs at Florida rate Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8d8e1cc4-149a-4c31-956c-c0d2654ef1d7", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04509"}
