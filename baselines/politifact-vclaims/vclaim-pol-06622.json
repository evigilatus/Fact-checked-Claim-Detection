Bush's email controversy", "text": "Why is everyone picking on Hillary Clinton -- they didn\u2019t mind when President George W. Bush\u2019s White House also used private email, pundit Juan Williams asked on Fox News Sunday.\nThe show\u2019s March 15, 2015, pundit panel debated the importance of the ongoing controversy regarding Clinton\u2019s decision to exclusively use a private email account, rather than a .gov account, during her time as secretary of state. In doing so, experts say she was able to circumvent transparency and records preservation standards.\nWilliams turned to his fellow commentator, Republican strategist and former Bush adviser Karl Rove, arguing that the email scandal during the Bush administration didn\u2019t garner the same level of media criticism. Thus, the attention on Clinton is unwarranted.\n\"When Karl was in trouble back in \u201807, (there was) no press coverage, just about zero press coverage of this issue,\" Williams said, noting that he found just one Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use.\n\"Juan, you are in a different reality, and I wish that I was there with you,\" Rove said.\nWe decided to look back and see what press coverage of the Bush administration email controversy looked like at the time\u00a0and how it compares to coverage of Clinton.\nThe Bush email story\nFirst, a quick refresher about what happened in the Bush administration. In March 2007, eyes were on then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales after the administration unexpectedly fired eight U.S.\u00a0attorneys. Congress (recently taken over by Democrats) investigated the firings, alleging that the administration had dropped the prosecutors for political reasons.\nOver the course of the investigation, it came out that some White House officials had conducted White House business over private email accounts\u00a0set up on a server through the Republican National Committee. The White House later admitted that some internal White House emails conducted on the RNC server might have been lost.\nDemocrats in Congress accused the administration of purposefully circumventing recordkeeping processes, while the White House said staffers were supposed to use the RNC emails solely for political affairs, not official business. Comparing the Bush and Clinton email scandals is not exactly apples to apples, but there are some similarities.\nWe looked back at media coverage at the time, and Williams has a point that it didn\u2019t cause the same level of hubbub as the Clinton email scandal. Though to say there was \"zero press coverage\" is an exaggeration -- even allowing for a bit of hyperbole.\nComparing the coverage\nWe did a search through Lexis-Nexis, a research service that tracks news articles and transcripts, between March and May 2007. We found more than 125 transcripts from the major cable networks and National Public Radio that include \"Republican National Committee\" and \"email\" within 10 words of each other.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lexis-Nexis search also yielded more than 200 related newspaper articles across the country within the same time frame.\nLet\u2019s compare that to coverage of the Clinton controversy.\nSince the story broke March 3, 2015 -- two weeks ago -- we found 204 cable and public radio transcripts that include \"Clinton\" and \"email.\" We also found 1,700 newspaper articles across the country.\nThat\u2019s several times as many articles and transcripts about Clinton than there were about the Bush email controversy in a quarter of the time. It\u2019s a rough measurement, but clearly there has been more media attention on Clinton\u2019s use of private email than that of the White House staffers.\nWhat about Williams\u2019 reference to the singular Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use among White House staffers? We found the one editorial, as well as a couple opinion columns. In comparison, the Washington Post has so far written two editorials regarding Clinton\u2019s private email use.\nNot the same\nWilliams\u2019 argument is that Republicans are stoking the media fire of the Clinton email scandal because they\u2019re worried about Clinton\u2019s 2016 potential, compared to Republican candidates. There\u2019s some nuances and contextual factors that might explain the difference in media coverage.\nFirst of all, there\u2019s the difference in who\u2019s at the receiving end of the criticisms. In 2007, it was a group of higher-up White House staffers and advisers (notably Rove) who occasionally used private email accounts for official business. As far as we can tell, though, Bush himself was not suspected as being part of this group. Today, the target is a former secretary of state, who only used private email when conducting official government business.\nWhat\u2019s more is that Clinton is in all likelihood running for president in 2016, so she has a lot of media attention on her to begin with. At the time of their email controversy, the Bush administration was past their 2004 second-term election and the 2006 midterms.\nAdditionally, the White House email controversy was on the periphery of a much larger scandal -- the firings of the eight U.S. attorneys. We searched Lexis-Nexis for articles about Attorney General Gonzales in the same time frame that we used to explore coverage of the White House email controversy. The search came up with more than 6,000 combined newspaper articles and transcripts. (Compared to the more than 325 about the emails).\nAs one\u00a0Washington Post article put it: \"The controversy over the outside e-mail accounts is a byproduct of the ongoing showdown over the prosecutor firings.\"\nOur ruling\nWilliams said there was \"just about zero press coverage\" of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy. We emailed Williams and did not hear back.\nSaying there was \"zero press coverage\" is an exaggeration --\u00a0even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. We found hundreds of articles and television transcripts referencing the issue. Still, Williams has something of a point that compared to the extensive recent coverage of Clinton\u2019s use of private email, media coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy was thin.\nWilliams\u2019 statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    4 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly False  There was \"just about zero press coverage\" of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy.
