John Cassich spoke of reducing the cost of the college, prompting Bush's pocket to chat about the low cost of education in Florida. \"We don't need the federal government to be involved in this, because when you do, we create a debt of $1.2 trillion,\" said the former Governor of Florida during the October 28 debate in Boulder, Colo. \"In Florida, we have the lowest education in the states in any state, because there is accountability, just as John (Cassice) said. You will create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you will not owe the next generation compensatory debts on their backs.\" We wanted to know if Florida was holding on to \"no\"? One spot for the lowest university education in the state? A comparison of State education by the spokesman for Bush Matt Gorman said that when Bush left office in 2007, Florida had the lowest education in the states for public universities for four of the 50 states. Data from the College Board indicate this: it was $3,881 for a four-year public university in 2006-2007. But during the discussion, Bush did not say that he was referring to when he ended his tenure as governor - he made it seem like he was speaking under the current tension, so we also looked at those statements. The College Council publishes an annual comparison of State education and fees at public universities of four years throughout the country, consisting of survey data from some 4,000 post-secondary institutions. The comparison indicates the average price paid by a full-time student for one year of university enrolment. For 2014-2015, the lowest amount was Wyoming at $4,646 followed by Arkansas at $6,138; Utah at $6,177; New Mexico at $6,190; Montana at $6,279; and Florida at $6,351. So Florida was the lowest sixth, although only four states were between $72 and $213 cheaper than Florida. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \"Florida is one of the most expensive states for general university education,\" said Ralph Ayelo, who supervises university counsellors for public schools in Broward County, Florida. The College Board issues a similar report comparing the tuition fees for two-year certificates, which shows that Florida was again at the lower end but was not in the cheaper place in 2014-15. \"There are a number of reasons for the wide disparity in published tuition fees by State - the philosophy of government education, aid policy, economic conditions, and financing of higher education,\" said Jennifer Ma, Policy Research scientist at the Faculty Council. \"For example, New Hampshire, which has the highest fee published for the public sector for four years in 2014-15, does not have a government grant assistance programme and has the lowest government allocation on a student basis.\" Bush specifically mentioned \"study,\" but we will note that there are many factors affecting the final price of students, including fees, scholarships, financial aid, housing and food. Our Governor Bush said, \"In Florida, we have the lowest education in the state in any state.\" This is not accurate if we look at the 2014-15 school fees for public universities for four years collected by the College Board. This data shows that Wyoming had the lowest level of education, followed by Arkansas, Utah, New Mexico, Montana and Florida. Florida was the sixth in the threshold. The Bush campaign stated that it referred to Florida as the lowest arrangement in 2006-2007 when it left office, but did not specify that time frame during the discussion. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05795"}
