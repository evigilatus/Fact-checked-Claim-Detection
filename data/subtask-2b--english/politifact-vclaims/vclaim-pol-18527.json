Kelly Loeffler, a white Georgia Republican, called for putting the brakes on efforts to register more Black and Democratic voters.\n\"Wondering what\u2019s up with Parler? Here\u2019s Sen. Kelly Loeffler saying black people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to vote,\" said a Nov. 13 Facebook post.\nThe accompanying screenshot purports to show a post by Loeffler on Parler, a social media platform popular with conservatives. It stated: \"Here are the #FACTS: Under the watch of Secretary Raffensperger, Stacey Abrams registered hundreds of thousands of black and Democrat voters. We can't let that happen again.\"\u00a0\nLoeffler didn\u2019t write that.\nBrad Raffensperger is Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state. Abrams is a voting-rights activist and former state lawmaker who narrowly lost a bid for governor in 2018.\nLoeffler faces the Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, in one of two Jan. 5 runoffs for Georgia\u2019s U.S. Senate seats. In the other race, first-term GOP Sen. David Perdue faces Democrat Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker.\u00a0\nThe screenshot appeared on Facebook, where it was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Multiple people shared screenshots of the Parler post on Twitter as well.\nThe screenshot depicts a post written under the account @SenatorKellyLoeffler. But that\u2019s a fake account, said Loeffler spokesperson Stephen Lawson. On Parler, the account is listed as private and was formed eight days ago, shortly after the Nov. 3 election. We couldn\u2019t determine whether such a message was actually posted under this account.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParler\u2019s community guidelines ban \"any use of another\u2019s name or likeness in a confusing or deceptive manner.\" We asked Parler whether it plans to remove the fake Loeffler account and did not get an immediate response.\nLoeffler\u2019s actual Parler account, @KLoeffler, showed no posts in which she commented about registering Black voters or any work by Abrams.\nAbrams created the New Georgia Project about six years ago to register people to vote. That organization and other groups as well as the Motor Voter law are credited with helping register hundreds of thousands of new voters, including voters of color.\u00a0\nBlack voters were pivotal to Joe Biden\u2019s narrow victory in Georgia in the Nov. 3 presidential election, and Democratic activists are counting on them to play a significant role in the Jan. 5 runoffs.\nThe voter registration deadline for the runoff is Dec. 7.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said Loeffler said on Parler that \"Black people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to vote.\"\u00a0\nThe screenshot depicts a Parler post that is from a fake account.
