In 2017, Polyte Fact reviewed a similar claim for Waters that was circulating online. Then the bloggers said, \"Democracy in California, Maxine Waters, was charged with three counts.\" That was often miscalculated because it distorted the facts. Here's how this allegation intersects and this article is on Facebook. In 2009, there were reports that Waters had allegedly helped the CEO of a bank called Unwind United to secure a meeting to request $50 million in bailout funds from the troubled asset relief programme - or the assistance programme to recover from the major recession. The Bank eventually received $12 million to help offset losses from investments in Fanny May and Freddy Mac, according to an article in the Los Angeles Times. However, these reports led to an inquiry into the ethics of the House of Representatives, and in 2010 the House of Representatives Ethics Committee accused Waters of violating three rules by trying to help Onyund, a bank in which her husband has a large share of the shares. Michael Moore, Chief of Staff of Waters, was also charged. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021 in 2012, moral charges against Waters were dropped. A lawyer hired by the Committee to review the case found that Waters believed that she was working for all minority-owned banks, not just for Onyund. She called for a meeting to assist those banks and ended their participation when she learned that On Yound was part of the group. Moore received a rewording letter because the committee ruled \"should have known\" about his boss's relations with Onywind and stopped helping the bank. Our Facebook article says that in 2010 Maxine Waters directed $12 million of TARP money to her husband &apos; s private bank account. According to the article, she was charged but did not spend any time. This is not true on several points. First, Eun-Yovnds received $12 million in rescuing money, not Waters' husband, although he had a financial stake in the bank. This conflict of interest led to congressional realization after then Treasury Minister Henry Paulson called in 2008 (not 2012, as Facebook article says) on behalf of minority-owned banks.
