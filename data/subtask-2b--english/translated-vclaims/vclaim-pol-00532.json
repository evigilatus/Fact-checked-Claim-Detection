One male refers to China's theft of American technology. \"In Obama-Baiden administration,\" Paden said, \"We got China to cut off Internet theft -- it's getting significantly worse under this administration.\" There is evidence that the Chinese Government reduced its technological thefts from American companies after an agreement signed by the Obama administration in 2015. Other factors have also led to this decline, and it is not clear why thefts have increased under Trump. Over the years, the Chinese Government has broken into the computer systems of American companies, military contractors and government agencies for design, technology and corporate secrets, usually on behalf of China's State-owned companies. For example, we have often estimated the validity of the claim that the Chinese stole an estimated $360 billion in intellectual property from the United States in 2015 alone. The agreement announced by Obama and Chinese President Shi Jin Ping in September 2015 included an undertaking not to steal confidential business information via the Internet or knowingly support it in order to assist companies or industries. His campaign referred to a report and news stories. (A spokesman for the National Security Council responded to our inquiry, but did not provide any information to assist in the evaluation of the Paiden allegation.) An annual 2019 report by FireAye, the California Cybersecurity Corporation, states that \"China's cyberspy activity began to decline significantly in late 2015 and 2016, especially against the United States.\" The report referred to the agreement, but also to the fact that the China People's Liberation Army, which had carried out some piracy, had strengthened its cyber-related functions, and that the Chinese government \"changed its national priorities.\" However, according to two news accounts in November 2018, this decline was eventually reversed. The New York Times stated that \"for 18 months or so\" after the deal, \"the number of Chinese attacks has fallen,\" but shortly after Trump took office, \"the Chinese cyberspy picked up again, and according to intelligence officials and analysts, it accelerated last year with the onset of commercial conflicts and other tensions in poisoning relations between the world's two largest economies.\" On January 17, 2021, in an interview with Fox News, the Wall Street Journal stated that President Donald Trump \"cannot say anything (about riots in the American Capitol Building) because the platforms removed it.\" The newspaper also reported that several private-sector cybersecurity companies had concluded that China had violated that transaction since almost Trump took office, but some security experts said that independent factors, including the reorganization of the People &apos; s Liberation Army, might be more relevant to the temporary decline in Internet theft. So, there was a reduction after the agreement, something even one of the Trump officials admitted, but even the evidence cited by Paiden suggests that the decline was probably due to other factors, too. There are other views that many private cyber security experts we have contacted have agreed that the Obama deal was a major, albeit not the only, factor leading to the temporary reduction of Internet theft in China. These experts are the Internal Cybersecurity Editor and co-founder Charlie Mitchell; James Andrew Lewis of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies; Christopher Pinter, member of the World Commission on Cyberstabilization, who, while in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under Obama, assisted in negotiating the deal with China; and Sean Kanook, Executive Director of Exedec International and a former United States National Intelligence Officer for Cyberspace. The transaction may have saved US companies $15 billion annually, according to a 2017 report by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. However, we did not reach consensus on the role of the Trump administration in increasing the theft of the Chinese Internet. The electronic theft escalated \"because the Chinese decided to increase, not because of anything Trump did,\" and James Andrew Lewis said the Center, which was the leading United States Department of Commerce for National Security and spying concerns about trade in advanced technology with China. Lewis said that China &apos; s economy was stronger when the agreement was concluded and that China underestimated the importance of electronic theft in supporting the country &apos; s economy. But Mitchell and Pinter said that as American relations with China have deteriorated since Trump took office, China has less incentive to comply with the agreement. Mitchell said \"At least one motive the Chinese had to comply went away as Trump started slapping on tariffs.\" Last note: Experts agreed that when it comes to electronic theft, there is no way to know exactly what is happening. Our assessment said, \"In Obama-Baiden administration, we had China cut off Internet theft -- it got much worse under this administration.\" China reduced its electronic theft from American companies following a lead deal with the Obama administration in 2015, but other factors may have also led to such a reduction. The consensus among experts is that cyber thefts in China have begun to rise since Trump took office, but other factors, such as the decline of the Chinese economy, may have played a role as well. We appreciate that Paiden's statement is mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00532"}
