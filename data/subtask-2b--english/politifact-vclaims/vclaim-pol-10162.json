A 19 percent cut to a $2.64 billion line item works out to just over $500 million -- even more than the number Biden cited.\n\nLeaving aside whether this percentage is accurate, using it in this context is problematic. First, it\u2019s not an immediate cut -- according to OMB, the 19 percent cut would happen in the second year of Ryan\u2019s budget, with the first year representing a 5 percent cut.\n\nMore importantly, as the Romney-Ryan campaign noted in an interview -- and as we have written in the past -- all of this is a speculative proposition. Ryan\u2019s budget did not reduce federal expenditures across the board, and assuming that every item under Ryan\u2019s budget would be cut equally isn\u2019t the most accurate way to look at it. (That said, the lack of detail in Ryan\u2019s plan has left the Romney-Ryan ticket open to such attacks.)\n\nCuts in spending already passed by Congress\n\nUsing the second justification -- comparing Obama\u2019s request to what the GOP-controlled House voted to spend for fiscal year 2012 -- has the advantage of not being speculative. Here\u2019s the amount passed by the House for fiscal 2012 (figures also rounded):\n\nWorldwide Security Protection (ongoing operations): $1.31 billion\nWorldwide Security Protection (overseas contigency operations): $247 million\nEmbassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance -- Worldwide Security Upgrades: $755 million\n\nTotal: $2.31 billion\n\nThe difference between these two amounts is nearly $327 million -- a bit above the $300 million Biden cited.\n\nUltimately, a final bill with slightly higher amounts than the House\u2019s initial bill -- about $60 million more -- was passed by both chambers and signed by the president.\n\nBut this approach has problems as well. For starters, Biden glosses over the fact that the president did ultimately sign the bill with the new lower funding amount, meaning he shares some responsibility for the lower level. (All presidential budget requests are opening offers that inevitably become subject to negotiation.)\n\nThe main problem with Biden\u2019s claim, however, is that it\u2019s not really what he was referring to in his claim from the debate. Biden said Ryan \"cut embassy security in his budget by $300 million below what we asked for,\" but what passed the House wasn\u2019t Ryan\u2019s budget blueprint -- it was an actual spending bill that emerged from the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThis may be a distinction of interest only to budget wonks, but by muddying the difference, Biden is able to hold up Ryan\u2019s budget -- a long-standing target of Democratic attacks for its approach to Medicare and other federal programs -- as the perpetrator of the cuts, rather than the more obscure appropriations bill.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBoth ways of defending the claim of a $300 million cut have some justification, but also come with problems. Extrapolating from Ryan\u2019s budget is a speculative exercise, while the enacted appropriations figures were not directly shaped by Ryan's budget. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10162"}
