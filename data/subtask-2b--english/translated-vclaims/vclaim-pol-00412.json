The Paso. Okay. On a mission. Okasio Cortez said she wouldn't forget that day. \"The moment I saw with my own eyes that the America I loved was turning into a nation that stole refugee children from their parents, and locked them up,\" she said, retweeting pictures of her standing in front of a chain fence with a painful look on her face. Critics broke down, posted on social media that the congresswoman was crying for something more than a parking lot. Of the stories that echo that feeling, two were shared on Facebook. One was from RT, the Russian government-supported news organization, and another from the PJ conservative news channel the media, which published a story with this main address: \"AOC cries on the empty parking lot.\" Both Facebook publishers were referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We contacted Aguirre about allegations that Okasio Cortez was crying on a parking lot. And Aguirre didn't know who the candidate who was then a member of Congress when he took the photos, so he told Poletti Fact. Among others, she protested outside the tent town set up near El Paso to house undocumented immigrant children. Aguirre said, \"It's not a parking lot.\" \"It's the road to the camp.\" In an attempt to confirm that claim, we looked at other images and coverage from that day. The photographer of Jetty Joe Riedel took a picture of the future congresswoman on 24 July 2018, indicating the following in his explanation: \"Alexandria Okasio Cortez is being adopted at the port of Tornello-Guadalupe from the entry gate on 24 June 2018 in Tornello, Texas. It's part of a group protesting the separation of children from their parents after they've been arrested as they enter the United States under the management policy of zero tolerance.\" \u2219 Ann Flanagan, Senior Director and Head of External Communications for Getty Images, confirmed that, as noted in the comment, \"Joe Riedel, photos of Alexandria-Occio Cortez at the entrance gate to Torneo-Guadalupe.\" The picture is part of a set of images from that day documenting the protest. Rydell's description of the fence near the port of entry corresponds to that of other photographers, reporters and various photographs of the tent facility. Facebook was published on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook video showing the man upset because he was added to the no-fly list to break into the Capitol. \u2022 On 11 January 2021, protesters - including Okasio-Cortez - entered Torneo-Guadalupe Square, where they entered on 24 June 2018, and then ventured on a curved road to the left, leading to a chain fence near the bushes and a wall marked with customs and border protection in the United States. One can more easily view the design of that part of the Turin site in this top picture of Getty taken three days before the protest of 24 June: Embedd from the pictures of Getty Crants in Okasio-Curtis and the other protesters who stood at the fence gathered at the wall photographed on the right side of the scene, where the crowd is on 21 June above. They were in the area that was seen on the top right of this picture, just behind where the three dark cars appear to be parked. If you zoom in to June 21, Getty, you'll see the wall and what appears to be a sign of customs and border protection. On June 24, the demonstrators were not allowed to cross the fence. \"I was there, and it wasn't an empty parking lot,\" said Crantz. \"It was the place where the Tornello camp was held. There was a big demonstration outside that fence and that camp. Members of Congress have entered for a tour. Crants also captured Okasio Cortez, who controls the fence on June 24, 2018, and noted in her explanation that Okasio Cortez \"holds onto a fence outside the tent town.\" In an interview with Polyte Fact, Crantz confirmed that Okasio Cortez was facing the facility in the photo, not a parking lot. Krantz said that she and Okasio-Cortez and others passed through the yard before reaching the fence. Krantz also confirmed that the fence in front of Ocacio-Cortez was stationed on a road leading to the facility, and that the stone wall was on both sides of the road. When looking at the images of Aguire Okasio Cortez, we see what appears to be a wall on the right side of the frame, and the barbed wire is visible at the top of each other. Crantz reviewed her own photographs from that day and said that the part of the wall to the right of the frame (which peeks from the shoulder of Ocacio Cortez in this picture) had a customs and border protection mark in the United States. We also see that the duel, the markings and the wall are detailed in a picture of the Holocaust survivor Margaret Hoviller, taken by the photographer Kisha Barry of Cosmopolitan magazine, as well as in this picture of Getty. (Crantz also took a picture of Hovilar in front of the same wall.) But was there a parking lot around here? Krantz said that she remembered a small parking lot near the parking lot where she wasn't fenced, but many people who were standing under the Plaza shelter for the shadow or by the road leading to the Plaza - which was photographed in a picture of Cosmopolitan magazine. Daniel Borunda, reporter of the El Paso Times, who was at the rally the same day, told Poletti Fuckett that the tent complex was \"seen several hundred yards away\" from the fence. We ruled a viral image of Okasio Cortez at a demonstration in 2018 in Texas on the United States-Mexico border. The photographers at the crime scene who took pictures of Okasio Cortez say she wasn't facing a parking lot. Instead, it was too far from the Torneo facility ceiling, and it was parked on a road leading to the Torneo tent complex, which was in its sight line, while standing at the fence. Photos taken by other outlets confirm the site. We value this allegation wrong. Clarification: Several references to the \"entry site\" in the original version of this story have been revised to refer more specifically to the \"loss location.\" Changes do not affect the provision.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00412"}
