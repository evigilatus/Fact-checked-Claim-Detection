Roy Cooper has repeatedly said the state isn\u2019t doing enough to provide teachers with the supplies they need.\nClassroom equipment and supply funding has\u00a0fallen by tens of millions of dollars\u00a0over\u00a0the past decade\u00a0and, in response, Cooper has pushed legislative leaders for more funding and even held his own\u00a0school supply drive.\nRepublicans hold a supermajority in the North Carolina legislature and recently passed their budget plan mostly without the help of Democrats.\nSince then, Democrats have criticized Republicans for what they see as \"pork\" in the budget. Cooper made one such attack on May 30, when he tweeted a graphic that reads:\n\"One legislative Republican\u2019s district gets almost all the school supply funding.\"\n\nBase vs. new funding\nSadie Weiner, Cooper\u2019s communications director, highlighted in an email a key distinction that\u2019s not included in the tweet: It\u2019s referring to new, additional funding \u2014 not the base budget for all school districts in the state.\n\"That tweet is talking about new school supply funding in the 2018-19 budget. Republicans will argue that their budget has $47 million for school supplies and instructional equipment. That is routine funding in the base budget, it is not new funding, and the Governor\u2019s recommended budget includes the same $47 million,\" she wrote.\n\"The Governor included $15 million in new funding that would go directly to teachers in the form of a school supply stipend,\" Weiner continued. \"That money would go to all state-funded teachers, not just those in a single district as the Republican budget has done.\"\nShe referred to Senate District 41, represented by Cornelius Republican Jeff Tarte, who faces a\u00a0competitive re-election race\u00a0in November. The budget includes $200,000 for\u00a0DonorsChoose.org, a New York-based nonprofit. The bill instructed the group to use the money on supplies for teachers in certain schools within Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools \u2014 all within Tarte\u2019s district.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonors Choose\u00a0declined the money, saying the grant didn\u2019t provide \"equitable\" funding across the state. The Charlotte Observer posted a story about the group\u2019s decision less than an hour after Cooper posted the tweet.\nWhile Cooper's tweet doesn't differentiate between base and new school supply funding, Weiner noted that Cooper was more specific in his press conference on Wednesday.\nThe budget, he said, \"falls short on textbooks and digital learning, offers new schools supply money only to a few in-tech schools.\"\nOther supply funding\nJonathan Sink, an aide to House Speaker Tim Moore, said in an email that the budget provides five new grants for classroom supplies, materials and equipment. In addition to DonorsChoose, the following groups get money:\n\u00b7 Franklin County Education Foundation: $60,000 to support grants for supplies to teachers in Franklin County Schools\n\u00b7 Town of Holly Springs: $50,000 to support four programs, one of which is the Teacher Classroom Supply Program\n\u00b7 Cary Chamber of Commerce: $25,000 to support a Cary Teacher Classroom Supply Program\n\u00b7 Robeson County Career Center: $7,500 for purchase of classroom equipment at the Robeson County Career Center in the Public Schools of Robeson County.\nOur ruling\nCooper tweeted: \"One legislative Republican\u2019s district gets almost all the school supply funding.\" Cooper has a point that budget writers designated a large portion of new school supply funding to schools in one Republican legislator\u2019s district.\nBut his tweet lacks important context, giving the impression that school districts might go without new school supplies this year \u2014 which isn\u2019t true.
