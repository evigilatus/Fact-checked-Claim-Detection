(Eric Trump, another of the president's sons, posted the same thing on Facebook, saying, \"Looks like fraud!\")\nIt fed into the false narrative swirling among conservatives that Wisconsin and other key states went to Democratic candidate Joe Biden as a result of voter fraud.\nThe turnout claim \u2014 retweeted based on Trump Jr.\u2019s share more than 13,000 times \u2014 is absurd and based on a misunderstanding of basic election math. Twitter has since suppressed the original tweet, noting it \"might be misleading about an election.\" It is misleading.\nThe real turnout numbers\nWisconsin had more than 3.6 million registered voters heading into Election Day, and more than 3.2 million Wisconsinites voted in the presidential race.\nBut those aren\u2019t the numbers used to calculate turnout here.\nFor starters, Wisconsin allows same-day voter registration, so that number of registered voters goes up throughout the day. In 2016, for example, 12.7% of voters registered on Election Day, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.\nEven more important, registered voters is the wrong figure entirely for calculating turnout. Voter turnout in a same-day registration state is based on the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot.\nSo when you divide the number of votes cast in Wisconsin \u2014 3,278,963 as of Nov. 5 \u2014 by the voting-age population in Wisconsin (4,536,293 as of 2019, according to the elections commission), you get a turnout rate of 72.3%.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the highest rate ever behind the 2004 election, but solidly in the range of past presidential contests here.\nRecent presidential election turnouts in Wisconsin:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 \u2014 72.3%\n\n\n2016 \u2014 67.3%\n\n\n2012 \u2014 70.4%\n\n\n2008 \u2014 69.2%\n\n\n2004 \u2014 72.9%\n\n\n2000 \u2014 67%\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that while Biden received about 250,000 more votes than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton did in 2016, Trump exceeded his own 2016 totals by 14.6% percent, or about 200,000 votes.\u00a0\nSo, a good chunk of the increased turnout was due to his supporters.\nOur ruling\nTrump Jr. shared a claim that Wisconsin\u2019s turnout jumped from 67% in 2016 to 89% in 2020, and intimated it is due to fraud or something nefarious.\nBut it\u2019s due to bad math.\nTurnout is measured as a percentage of eligible voters, not registered voters. Trump Jr.\u2019s figures use eligible voters for the 2016 figure but registered voters for 2020.\nUsing the proper denominator for 2020 shows a turnout around 72%, firmly in the range of past presidential elections.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18458"}
