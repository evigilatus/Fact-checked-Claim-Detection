1	George Stephanopoulos	Welcome to our town hall with President Trump.
2	George Stephanopoulos	Mr. President, thank you for joining us.
3	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
4	George Stephanopoulos	We’re here with a group of Pennsylvania voters.
5	George Stephanopoulos	As you can see, we’re socially distanced in this COVID era.
6	Donald Trump	I can see, definitely.
7	Donald Trump	There’s no doubt about it.
8	George Stephanopoulos	Everyone’s been tested.
9	George Stephanopoulos	You should know that some of these people voted for you last time around, some voted for Hillary Clinton, some voted for third party candidates or no one at all.
10	George Stephanopoulos	All have written their own questions.
11	George Stephanopoulos	The first one comes from Paul Tubiana.
12	George Stephanopoulos	Paul, take it away.
13	Donald Trump	Hi, Paul.
14	Paul Tubiana	Mr. President, I voted for you in 2016.
15	Paul Tubiana	I’m conservative pro-life and diabetic.
16	Paul Tubiana	I’ve had to dodge people who don’t care about social distancing and wearing face masks.
17	Paul Tubiana	I thought you were doing a good job with a pandemic response until about May 1st.
18	Paul Tubiana	Then you took your foot off the gas pedal.
19	Paul Tubiana	Why did you throw vulnerable people like me under the bus?
20	Donald Trump	Well, we really didn’t, Paul.
21	Donald Trump	We’ve worked very hard on the pandemic.
22	Donald Trump	We’ve worked very hard.
23	Donald Trump	It came off from China.
24	Donald Trump	They should have never let it happen.
25	Donald Trump	If you look at what we’ve done with ventilators and now, frankly, with vaccines, we’re very close to having a good vaccine.
26	Donald Trump	If you want to know the truth, the previous administration would have taken perhaps years to have a vaccine because of the FDA and all the approvals.
27	Donald Trump	And we’re within weeks of getting it, could be three weeks, four weeks, but we think we have a Johnson & Johnson Pfizer.
28	Donald Trump	We have great companies and they’re very, very close.
29	Donald Trump	It’s a terrible thing.
30	Donald Trump	But if you look at as an example, are you from New York?
31	Donald Trump	Where are you from?
32	Paul Tubiana	Originally, I’m from New York.
33	Paul Tubiana	I’ve lived in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania for 18 and a half years.
34	Paul Tubiana	It’s the longest place I’ve ever lived.
35	Donald Trump	Well, that’s very good.
36	Donald Trump	It’s a good place.
37	Donald Trump	But actually, if you look at what we’ve done for various things, we built hospitals.
38	Donald Trump	New York, we took the Convention Center, converted it to 2,800 rooms.
39	Donald Trump	We brought in the ships.
40	Donald Trump	I wish they would have used it because frankly they would have saved a lot of people had they used it, but we really are.
41	Donald Trump	We’re starting to get very good marks.
42	Donald Trump	If you look at what we’ve done compared to other countries with the excess mortality, the excess mortality rate, we’ve done very, very well.
43	Donald Trump	When you see our testing, we’re going to be at 84 million tests, 84 million.
44	Donald Trump	Think of that.
45	Donald Trump	And next would be India with about 50 million less.
46	Donald Trump	Our testing program’s far greater.
47	Donald Trump	I brought this along today because I think it’s something that’s really very special.
48	Donald Trump	We have a new test that came out literally today, that’s just showing you a numbers of how well we’re doing relative to other countries.
49	Donald Trump	But this is actually a new test just came out from Abbott, highly sophisticated.
50	Donald Trump	You wouldn’t think it’s a piece of a really little light cardboard.
51	Donald Trump	This came out and this is a very accurate test and people will be able to have this and they’ll be able to test or ideally go through a doctor.
52	Donald Trump	But it’s very simple and very accurate.
53	Donald Trump	We supplied governors including this state with equipment like nobody’s ever gotten.
54	Donald Trump	We were short on ventilators because the cupboards were bare when we took it over.
55	Donald Trump	We’re now making thousands of ventilators a month, many thousands that we’re sending, and we don’t need them in our country anymore.
56	Donald Trump	Not one person that needed a ventilator, didn’t get a ventilator.
57	Donald Trump	Everybody got a ventilator and, Paul, they’re very complex.
58	Donald Trump	They’re very hard to make, but we’re making out tens of thousands a month and sending them to other countries who are in dire need of them.
59	Donald Trump	I feel that we’ve done a tremendous job, actually and it’s something that I don’t think it’s been recognized like it should.
60	Donald Trump	But when you look at our testing, when you look at our swabs, when you look at our ventilators, when you look at what we’ve done with hospitals, and we’ve made a lot of governors look very good and now some are in a shutdown and some aren’t, we’d like to see it open up and open up as soon as possible.
61	Donald Trump	But we’re very proud of the job we’ve done, and we’ve saved a lot of lives, a tremendous number of lives.
62	George Stephanopoulos	Mr. President, you mentioned a number of things.
63	George Stephanopoulos	Let’s talk about the mortality first, because you said we’re doing better in mortality than other countries.
64	George Stephanopoulos	But here’s this chart right here.
65	George Stephanopoulos	It shows the United States is right here.
66	George Stephanopoulos	This is number of deaths per million residents.
67	George Stephanopoulos	Here’s Western Europe here, Canada way down there.
68	George Stephanopoulos	We’re not at the top of the list.
69	Donald Trump	The excess mortality rate is among the best in the whole world.
70	Donald Trump	I mean, I can show you there’s a chart that just came out a little while ago.
71	Donald Trump	Excess mortality rate is compared to Europe, compared to other places, it’s about 25% better.
72	Donald Trump	In one case, it’s over 60% better.
73	Donald Trump	And we also have a very big country here.
74	Donald Trump	This is, we’re talking about a lot bigger than most countries.
75	Donald Trump	When you look at testing, just as an example, when India does 40 million less tests than us, they have 1.5 billion people.
76	Donald Trump	China, you don’t get the accurate numbers out of China, but China, they lost a lot of people.
77	Donald Trump	They just don’t say what-
78	George Stephanopoulos	Actually, we have 4% of the world’s population, more than 20% of the cases, more than 20% of the deaths.
79	Donald Trump	Well, we have 20% of the cases because of the fact that we do much more testing.
80	Donald Trump	If we wouldn’t do testing, you wouldn’t have cases.
81	Donald Trump	You would have very few cases.
82	George Stephanopoulos	As you know, Dr. Fauci, says most of these are actual cases.
83	Donald Trump	Well, Dr. Fauci, said we’ve done a fantastic job.
84	Donald Trump	He just said it yesterday.
85	Donald Trump	Actually, he said we’ve done a fantastic job that we didn’t mislead anybody.
86	Donald Trump	Now.
87	Donald Trump	I’m not going to make people feel like I want to… Look, with a leader of a great country, we want to keep it that way.
88	Donald Trump	I don’t want to scare people.
89	Donald Trump	I don’t want to make people panic and you’re not going to go out and say, “Oh, this is going to be.
90	Donald Trump	This is death, death, death.” You have to run a country.
91	Donald Trump	We’re in a country.
92	Donald Trump	We got hit by something very unfairly.
93	Donald Trump	What I noticed yesterday Dr. Fauci, said that we’ve done a really good job and we didn’t mislead anybody.
94	Donald Trump	He came out with that statement, which I appreciate.
95	Donald Trump	But whether it’s Dr. Fauci, or anybody else, a lot of people got it wrong.
96	Donald Trump	They talked about, don’t wear masks, and now they say wear masks, although some people say don’t wear masks.
97	Donald Trump	I mean, you have a lot of different ideas.
98	Donald Trump	Some people say, “Just leave it the way it is and don’t do any shutdowns.” Other people say, “Do shutdowns.” I have my own views on that.
99	George Stephanopoulos	What did you get wrong?
100	George Stephanopoulos	You say a lot of people got things wrong.
101	George Stephanopoulos	I mean, you mentioned China at the top right there.
102	George Stephanopoulos	All through January and February, you were down playing by your own admission, the severity of the crisis that you didn’t want to panic people.
103	Donald Trump	Not down playing-
104	George Stephanopoulos	Let me just finish the question first.
105	Donald Trump	Not downplaying.
106	George Stephanopoulos	But you said, those are your words.
107	Donald Trump	I don’t want to drive our nation into a panic.
108	Donald Trump	I’m a cheerleader for this nation.
109	Donald Trump	I’m the one that closed up our country.
110	Donald Trump	I closed it up long before any of the experts thought I should and saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
111	Donald Trump	But when I closed it, I put a ban on our country.
112	Donald Trump	And the ban was a very important ban because China [crosstalk 00:07:12].
113	Donald Trump	China was heavily infected.
114	Donald Trump	By the way, I read where other people said, “Do it.” No people that I saw said do it, and I know they said security advisers and others.
115	Donald Trump	I put a ban on when it wasn’t at all popular.
116	Donald Trump	Joe Biden said I was xenophobic because I put the ban on, and I thought that was a very unfair.
117	Donald Trump	By the way, he’s totally taken that back.
118	Donald Trump	But I’m not sure he knows what it means, anyway.
119	George Stephanopoulos	I want to ask you about China though, because at that time you were actually praising President Xi.
120	George Stephanopoulos	You were saying he was transparent.
121	George Stephanopoulos	You were saying he was strong.
122	George Stephanopoulos	You were saying he was doing a good job.
123	George Stephanopoulos	Did you get that wrong?
124	George Stephanopoulos	Did you misjudge President Xi?
125	Donald Trump	I don’t think I did.
126	Donald Trump	We just finished a trade deal.
127	Donald Trump	We just had the largest order of corn in the history of our country last week, the largest order of soybeans, largest order of beef, because they know I’m very unhappy.
128	Donald Trump	They know I’m very, very-
129	George Stephanopoulos	But you said he was doing a good job and now you’re blaming China.
130	Donald Trump	No, I didn’t say one way or the other.
131	Donald Trump	I’m not saying one way or the other.
132	Donald Trump	At the beginning before anybody knew what it was, I spoke with President Xi and he said, “We are doing it well.
133	Donald Trump	We are having it under control.” And I was very open with that.
134	Donald Trump	He told me that it was under control, that everything was, and it turned out to be not true, because it wasn’t under control.
135	Donald Trump	It went all over the world, 188 countries.
136	Donald Trump	I didn’t say anything bad about President Xi initially, because nobody knew much about the disease.
137	Donald Trump	Nobody knew the seniors are susceptible.
138	Donald Trump	They thought people would be susceptible, but not… The seniors are really a very, very endangered group of people, especially if they have problems with hearts or diabetes or any of that.
139	George Stephanopoulos	You mentioned masks.
140	George Stephanopoulos	We had Julie Bard, who’s from Gibsonia, Pennsylvania.
141	George Stephanopoulos	She’s right here.
142	George Stephanopoulos	She has a question about that.
143	George Stephanopoulos	You voted for Hillary Clinton last time, I believe.
144	Julie Bard	Yes, I did.
145	Julie Bard	The wearing of mask has proven to lessen the spread of COVID.
146	Julie Bard	Why don’t you support a mandate for national mass wearing, and why don’t you wear a mask more often?
147	Donald Trump	Well, I do wear them when I have to, and when I’m in hospitals and other locations.
148	Donald Trump	But I will say this, they said at the Democrat Convention, they’re going to do a national mandate.
149	Donald Trump	They never did it, because they’ve checked out and they didn’t do it.
150	Donald Trump	A good question, as you ask, like Joe Biden, they said, “We’re going to do a national mandate unrest-”
151	George Stephanopoulos	He’s called on all governors to have them.
152	George Stephanopoulos	It is the state responsibility.
153	Donald Trump	No, but he didn’t do it.
154	Donald Trump	I mean, he never did it.
155	Donald Trump	By the way, a lot of people don’t want to wear masks.
156	Donald Trump	There are a lot of people think that masks are not good.
157	Donald Trump	And there are a lot of people that, as an example, you have-
158	George Stephanopoulos	Who are those people?
159	Donald Trump	I’ll tell you who those people are, waiters.
160	Donald Trump	They come over and they serve you, and they have a mask.
161	Donald Trump	I saw it the other day where they were serving me and they’re playing with a mask.
162	Donald Trump	I’m not blaming them.
163	Donald Trump	I’m just saying what happens.
164	Donald Trump	They’re playing with a mask, and so the mask is over and they’re touching it.
165	Donald Trump	And then they’re touching the plate.
166	Donald Trump	That can’t be good.
167	Donald Trump	There are a lot of people, if you look at Dr. Fauci’s original statement, you look at a lot of people, CDC, you look at a lot of people’s original statement, they said very strongly George, “Don’t wear masks.” Then all of a sudden they want to wear masks.
168	Donald Trump	The concept of a mask is good, but it also does, you’re constantly touching it, you’re touching your face, you’re touching plates.
169	Donald Trump	There are people that don’t think masks are good.
170	George Stephanopoulos	Let’s get one final question on COVID.
171	George Stephanopoulos	We’ve got Johnny Powell right here.
172	George Stephanopoulos	She’s from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and you actually haven’t voted before.
173	George Stephanopoulos	How are you?
174	Johnny Powell	Hello.
175	Johnny Powell	Hi.
176	Johnny Powell	My question is, if you believe it’s the president’s responsibility to protect America, why would you downplay a pandemic that is known to disproportionately harm low income families and minority communities?
177	Donald Trump	Yeah.
178	Donald Trump	Well, I didn’t downplay it.
179	Donald Trump	I actually, in many ways I applied it in terms of action.
180	Donald Trump	[crosstalk 00:10:54].
181	Donald Trump	My action was very strong because what I did was with China, I put a ban on, with Europe, I put a ban on, and we would have lost thousands of more people had I not put the ban on.
182	Donald Trump	So that was called action.
183	Donald Trump	Not with the mouth, but in actual fact, we did a very, very good job when we put that ban on, whether you call it talent or luck, it was very important.
184	Donald Trump	So we saved a lot of lives when we did that.
185	George Stephanopoulos	There were holes in the ban and the European ban didn’t come for another month.
186	Donald Trump	Well, they were Americans.
187	Donald Trump	I mean, the holes in were if you have somebody in China, that’s an American citizen, we had to let them in.
188	Donald Trump	I mean, there were actually some people that said, well, once it got going, they said, “Wait a minute.
189	Donald Trump	That is really a heavily infected place.” We had a case where we had a lot of Americans, they probably had COVID and we’re saying, “Do we let them into our country?” We let them in very carefully.
190	Donald Trump	We quarantined them, but we let them in.
191	Donald Trump	But yeah, they say that we allowed certain people and it’s true, but they were American citizens.
192	George Stephanopoulos	I want to move on to some other subjects, but we’re still [inaudible 00:11:56] with 195,000 deaths in the United States right now.
193	George Stephanopoulos	When you see that, when you think about that, does that give you any pause?
194	George Stephanopoulos	Does it make you think, “Is there anything I could have done differently?” Anything-
195	Donald Trump	I think we could have had 2 million deaths if we didn’t close out the country.
196	George Stephanopoulos	So you regret nothing?
197	Donald Trump	No, I think we did a great job.
198	Donald Trump	If we didn’t close the country, look, we created, I created, we all created it together.
199	Donald Trump	You helped everybody.
200	Donald Trump	The fact is, we created the greatest economy in the history of the world, best employment numbers for African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, women, everything, the best employment, high school, no high school, college.
201	Donald Trump	We had the best economy we’ve ever had.
202	Donald Trump	160 million people almost, just short of 160 million people.
203	Donald Trump	We were never closed.
204	Donald Trump	And then somebody comes in and then somebody else, doctors, and they start talking about the pandemic and about closing, they want to close up our country.
205	Donald Trump	I said, “Wait a minute.
206	Donald Trump	We have the greatest country, the greatest economy.” And it was coming together, even in terms of unity, because it was so successful that people that weren’t getting along were starting to get along, George.
207	Donald Trump	That’s the way we solved that problem.
208	Donald Trump	But we had the greatest economy ever, and we have to close it.
209	Donald Trump	If I didn’t close it, I think you’d have 2 million deaths instead of having the 185, 190.
210	Donald Trump	It’s a terrible.
211	Donald Trump	[crosstalk 00:13:15].
212	George Stephanopoulos	… more mitigation earlier on, there would have been fewer deaths.
213	Donald Trump	George, I was so far ahead of my closing.
214	Donald Trump	I’ll give you an example.
215	Donald Trump	When I closed at the end of January, Joe Biden was talking about in March about it’s totally over-exaggerated.
216	Donald Trump	Nancy Pelosi was standing in the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco, late a month, more than a month after that saying, “This thing’s totally exaggerated, come to try and build up tourism.” And all of these people-
217	George Stephanopoulos	You were saying it was going to disappear.
218	Donald Trump	What?
219	George Stephanopoulos	You’re saying it was going to disappear.
220	Donald Trump	It is going to disappear.
221	Donald Trump	It’s going to disappear.
222	Donald Trump	I still say that.
223	George Stephanopoulos	But not if you don’t take action.
224	George Stephanopoulos	Correct?
225	Donald Trump	No, I still say it.
226	Donald Trump	It’s going to disappear, George.
227	Donald Trump	We’re going to get back.
228	Donald Trump	We aren’t going to have studios like this.
229	Donald Trump	We have all of this empty space in between.
230	Donald Trump	I want to see people and you want to see people.
231	Donald Trump	I want to see football games.
232	Donald Trump	I’m pushing very hard for Big Ten.
233	Donald Trump	I want to see Big Ten open, lift the football games, let them play sports.
234	Donald Trump	But no, it’s going to disappear, George.
235	Donald Trump	And I say this-
236	George Stephanopoulos	But Dr. Fauci, say we have to hunker down.
237	George Stephanopoulos	We have to be prepared for a possible second wave.
238	George Stephanopoulos	I understand that you don’t want to panic people.
239	George Stephanopoulos	You said you want people to be calm.
240	George Stephanopoulos	You’ve often talked about Winston Churchill, and FDR, and they did reassure people.
241	George Stephanopoulos	They were strong.
242	George Stephanopoulos	They did keep people calm, but they also were straight.
243	George Stephanopoulos	They said, “This war is going to be tough.
244	George Stephanopoulos	It’s going to be a real fight.
245	George Stephanopoulos	We have to persevere.”
246	Donald Trump	When Churchill was on the top of a building, and he said, “Everything’s going to be good.
247	Donald Trump	Everything’s going to be.
248	Donald Trump	Be calm.” And you have the Nazis dropping bombs all over London, he was very brave because he was at the top of a building.
249	Donald Trump	It was very well known that he was standing on buildings and they were bombing.
250	Donald Trump	And he says, “Everyone’s going to be safe.” I don’t think that’s being necessarily honest, and yet I think it’s being a great leader.
251	Donald Trump	But he said, “You’re going to be safe.
252	Donald Trump	Be calm.
253	Donald Trump	Don’t panic.” And you had bombers dropping bombs all over London.
254	Donald Trump	So I guess you could say, that’s not so honest, but it’s still great leadership.
255	George Stephanopoulos	Do you think it’s okay to be dishonest?
256	Donald Trump	I’m not looking to be dishonest.
257	Donald Trump	I don’t want people to panic, and we are going to be okay.
258	Donald Trump	We’re going to be okay, and it is going away.
259	Donald Trump	It’s probably going to go away now a lot faster because of the vaccine.
260	Donald Trump	It would go away without the vaccine, George, but it’s going to go away a lot faster-
261	George Stephanopoulos	It will go away without the vaccine?
262	Donald Trump	Sure.
263	Donald Trump	Over a period of time.
264	Donald Trump	Sure, with time, it goes away.
265	George Stephanopoulos	And many deaths.
266	Donald Trump	You’ll develope like a hard mentality, it’s going to be hard developed, and that’s going to happen.
267	Donald Trump	That will all happen.
268	Donald Trump	But with the vaccine, I think it will go away very quickly.
269	George Stephanopoulos	We’ve got to take a quick break.
270	Donald Trump	But I really believe we’re rounding the corner, and I believe that strongly.
271	George Stephanopoulos	As you know, Dr, Fauci, disagrees with that.
272	Donald Trump	Well, I mean, but a lot of people do agree with me.
273	Donald Trump	You look at Scott Atlas, you look at some of the other doctors that are highlighted from Stanford, look at some of the other doctors, they think maybe we could have done that from the beginning.
274	Donald Trump	I think we did it exactly right.
275	Donald Trump	We closed it up.
276	Donald Trump	Now, we’re opening and we’re opening up to a super-vee because the numbers are fantastic.
277	Donald Trump	The employment numbers, you look at, we hired 10.4 million jobs in four months.
278	Donald Trump	That’s a record by far.
279	Donald Trump	We have every record.
280	Donald Trump	Retail sales are through the roof.
281	Donald Trump	We have every record.
282	Donald Trump	We did the right thing.
283	Donald Trump	If we didn’t close it up, I believe we’d have two million, two and a half, maybe three million deaths.
284	George Stephanopoulos	We’re going to have take more about [inaudible 00:16:35] when we come back.
285	George Stephanopoulos	But also race, policing, and protests.
286	George Stephanopoulos	We’ll be right back.Welcome back to our town hall with President Trump.
287	George Stephanopoulos	The next question comes from Laura Galvis.
288	George Stephanopoulos	She’s from Glen Shaw, Pennsylvania.
289	George Stephanopoulos	Registered nurse, who’s always voted Republican for president.
290	George Stephanopoulos	Laura, go ahead.
291	Laura Galvis	Hello, Mr. President.
292	Laura Galvis	Martin Luther King Jr, once famously wrote, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” In the light of the ongoing protests surrounding the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and the recent shooting of Jacob Blake, do you feel racial injustices are occurring in this nation?
293	Laura Galvis	And if so, what can be done to address them?
294	Donald Trump	Well, I think they were tragic events, and I do feel that we have to also take into consideration that if you look at our police, they do a phenomenal job.
295	Donald Trump	You’ll have people joke, make mistakes, and they happen.
296	Donald Trump	It happens where they have to make a fast decision and some bad things happen.
297	Donald Trump	And you also have bad apples, but you have 99% great people.
298	Donald Trump	I know the police forces very well.
299	Donald Trump	I think almost every one of them.
300	Donald Trump	If you look, I’ve been endorsed by so many of them, and these are great people.
301	Donald Trump	I will say this, if you’re going to stop crime, we have to give the respect back to the police that they deserve.
302	Donald Trump	They’ve done a fantastic job in many locations, but then bad things happen.
303	Donald Trump	Look at New York, New York was a very safe city.
304	Donald Trump	Rudy Giuliani did a fantastic job.
305	Donald Trump	The city was safe, and then all of a sudden we have a mayor.
306	Donald Trump	He starts cutting the police force and crime is up a hundred percent, 150%.
307	Donald Trump	I saw one form of crime up 300%.
308	Donald Trump	So I think it’s very important, whether you talk Seattle, where they have very good police, but they’re not allowed to do their job.
309	Donald Trump	You have to allow the police to do their job.
310	Donald Trump	I agree with you, those events are terrible, but we have to allow the police to do their job.
311	Donald Trump	Otherwise, crime is going to soar.
312	Donald Trump	Now, the problem is that in Democrat, usually liberal Democrat run cities, we have tremendous problems.
313	Donald Trump	The top 10 most unsafe cities are run by Democrats.
314	Donald Trump	You go into the top 25 and top 35, almost every one of them is run by Democrats.
315	Donald Trump	No cash bail, just weak policies on crime.
316	Donald Trump	We have to give the police the respect that they deserve and we have to give them their mojo.
317	Donald Trump	We have to let them protect us.
318	Donald Trump	How about that horrible crime that took place two days ago, where this terrible human being walks up to a police car with two people sitting in the car and he starts shooting bullets right through the glass right in their face and just has destroyed?
319	Donald Trump	I hear they’re going to make it, but they’re going to have a hard time ever being the same-
320	George Stephanopoulos	Mr. President-
321	Donald Trump	It’s just a terrible thing.
322	George Stephanopoulos	That was monstrous.
323	George Stephanopoulos	There’s no question about that.
324	George Stephanopoulos	But a lot of people look at the-
325	Donald Trump	But that’s a lack of respect.
326	Donald Trump	When somebody can do that, that’s a lack of respect.
327	Donald Trump	There’s no retribution.
328	Donald Trump	The field, there’s no retribution.
329	Donald Trump	This guy walks up to a police car and he starts shooting point blank range at two innocent people.
330	Donald Trump	You can’t let that happen.
331	Donald Trump	You have to be very tough on crime when it comes to that.
332	George Stephanopoulos	Tough on crime, but also obey the rules and regulations for policing.
333	George Stephanopoulos	You talk about police choking, you talk about bad apples, but a lot of people look at the statistics, Black Americans, more than three times more likely than White Americans to be killed by police.
334	George Stephanopoulos	That indicates that this just isn’t bad apples.
335	George Stephanopoulos	This just isn’t choking.
336	George Stephanopoulos	This is a real systemic endemic problem.
337	George Stephanopoulos	Do you believe that?
338	George Stephanopoulos	What will you do to address it?
339	Donald Trump	So, just do a poll where…
340	George Stephanopoulos	Do you believe that?
341	George Stephanopoulos	What will you do to address it?
342	Donald Trump	I just saw a poll where African-Americans in this country, black communities are 81% in favor of having more police.
343	Donald Trump	They want more police.
344	Donald Trump	They want protection.
345	Donald Trump	They suffer more than anybody else by bad police protection.
346	Donald Trump	All minorities, whether it’s Hispanic or black or Asian, they suffer more than anybody else, George.
347	Donald Trump	We have to give the police back the authority to stop crime.
348	Donald Trump	When you have something like in Portland, where it’s just night after night, I could stop that with the people we have in a half an hour if they’d let me do that, but they don’t-
349	George Stephanopoulos	What would you do?
350	Donald Trump	Bring in the National Guard.
351	Donald Trump	We’d bring it in, and we would stop that within… Well, we did it in Minneapolis.
352	Donald Trump	Take a look at Minneapolis-
353	George Stephanopoulos	How do you stop police killing blacks at three times the rate of killing whites?
354	Donald Trump	I can only say this, that the police in this country have done generally a great job.
355	Donald Trump	There are crimes, there are problems, and there are chokers.
356	Donald Trump	They choke under pressure.
357	Donald Trump	They have one quarter of a second to make a decision, and sometimes they make a wrong decision.
358	Donald Trump	That’s a terrible thing.
359	Donald Trump	The problem is that’ll be on the news for two weeks or three weeks in a row, and the hundreds of thousands and thousands of good acts, nobody talks about it.
360	George Stephanopoulos	You didn’t think that’s a sign of systemic racism?
361	Donald Trump	No, I think there’s problems, but I also think there’s some very big problems where if you don’t give the police back their authority… Right now, police are afraid they’re going to lose their pension, they’re going to lose their job if they talk to somebody in the wrong way.
362	Donald Trump	When I watch New York… The New York City Police endorse me, and I love them.
363	Donald Trump	[crosstalk 00:24:42] but I watched six months ago, policemen walking down the street, and people were dumping water on their head.
364	Donald Trump	They had absolutely no fear.
365	Donald Trump	They had absolutely… There was no retribution.
366	Donald Trump	I thought it was a low point.
367	Donald Trump	I thought it was a low point for New York City’s finest.
368	Donald Trump	Frankly, those people should’ve turned… Those cops should’ve turned around and really done something.
369	George Stephanopoulos	We have another question on the subject from Pastor Carl Day.
370	George Stephanopoulos	He’s from Philadelphia, voted for Jill Stein last time.
371	Pastor Carl Day	How you doing, Mr. President?
372	Donald Trump	Good.
373	Pastor Carl Day	You’ve coined the phrase, “Make America great again.” When has America been great for African-Americans in the ghetto of America?
374	Pastor Carl Day	Are you aware of how tone deaf that comes off to the African-American community?
375	Donald Trump	Well, I can say this.
376	Donald Trump	We have tremendous African-American support.
377	Donald Trump	You’ve probably seen it in the polls.
378	Donald Trump	We’re doing extremely well with African-American, Hispanic-American at levels that you’ve rarely seen a republican have.
379	Donald Trump	If you talk about make America great, if you look at just prior to, and I’m talking about for the black community, you look just prior to this horrible situation coming in from China, when the virus came in, that was probably the highest point.
380	Donald Trump	Home ownership for the black community, home ownership, lower crime, the best jobs they’ve ever had, highest income, the best employment numbers they’ve ever had.
381	Donald Trump	If you go back and you want to look over many years, you could just go back six or seven months from now, that was the best single moment in the history of the African-American people in this country, I think, I would say.
382	Pastor Carl Day	Well, I mean, your statement is, “Make it great again.” Historically, the African-American experience, especially in these ghettos that have been redlined historically, these ghettos that have systemically been treated the way that they have been, the conditions of the drugs, the guns, and everything else that actually created the symptoms for what we see that you profess to be just the democratic cities themselves, these things have been historically been happening for African-Americans in these ghettos, and we have not been seeing a change.
383	Pastor Carl Day	Quite frankly, under your administration, under Obama’s administration, under the Bush, under the Clinton, the very same things happen, and the very same systems and cycles continue to ensue, and we need to see, because you say again, we need to see when was that great, because that pushes us back to a time in which we cannot identify with such greatness.
384	Pastor Carl Day	I mean, you’ve said everything else about choking and everything else, but you have yet to address and acknowledge that there’s been a race problem in America.
385	Donald Trump	If you go… Well, I hope there’s not a race problem.
386	Donald Trump	I can tell you, there’s none with me, because I have great respect for all races, for everybody.
387	Donald Trump	This country is great because of it, but when you go back six months and you take a look at what was happening, you can’t even compare that with past administrations.
388	Donald Trump	When you look at income levels, and a lot of things, because of the job situation, where they had the lowest income, the best unemployment numbers they’ve ever had, the black community, by far, and that was solving a lot of problems.
389	Donald Trump	You know what else?
390	Donald Trump	It was bringing people together.
391	Donald Trump	I was starting to get, just before… We were having a long run of success.
392	Donald Trump	I was starting to get calls from democrats that, “Hey, it’s starting to work.
393	Donald Trump	Let’s get together.” People that you would never have thought this would’ve happened with, there was going to be unity, but unfortunately, that was hurt because we got set back.
394	Donald Trump	Now, I think next year’s going to be one of our best years economically, but [crosstalk 00:28:18]
395	Pastor Carl Day	Income equality is higher.
396	Pastor Carl Day	I mean, jobs can be produced, but at the same time, in a lot of these big major cities where African-Americans are underserved, under-resourced, that’s an $8 an hour job, does not meant that they can necessarily afford to live where they have to live or where they’ve been living at for the last 20 years.
397	Donald Trump	Well, the income inequality, which I agree with you is a problem, I always agreed with that, but if you looked under President Obama and Biden, the income inequality was phenomenal.
398	Donald Trump	It was record setting.
399	Donald Trump	It was-
400	George Stephanopoulos	It’s getting worse now.
401	Donald Trump	Well, we’re talking about a plague coming in.
402	Donald Trump	Before the plague, we were doing very well.
403	Donald Trump	Now, we will soon be doing well again, because we’re going to have a fantastic third quarter.
404	Donald Trump	You’re seeing the numbers come in.
405	Donald Trump	I think you’re going to have a GDP that’s mid 20s and may be much higher.
406	Donald Trump	Somebody said 35.
407	Donald Trump	I don’t know.
408	Donald Trump	These are all records we’re talking about.
409	Donald Trump	You’re going to have a very good… Economically, you’re going to have a very good year next year, but I agree with a lot of the things you say, but you have to look back, because we really had it going well.
410	Donald Trump	Had we not been hit by this horrible disease that came into our land and all over the world, by the way, came all over the world, we would be in a position where I think income inequality would be different.
411	Donald Trump	It was really getting there.
412	Donald Trump	We were really driving it down.
413	George Stephanopoulos	Mr. President, we have to move on, but even before the pandemic, the average black family was earning half of what the average white family was earning.
414	George Stephanopoulos	Even if you hold education constant-
415	Donald Trump	I can only compare it to the past.
416	Donald Trump	The African-American, the black community was doing better than it had ever done by far, both in terms of unemployment, home ownership, so many different statistics, even in terms of crime-
417	George Stephanopoulos	There’s still a gap between blacks and whites.
418	Donald Trump	I mean, there was a gap, but we were doing a good job.
419	Donald Trump	It was getting better.
420	Donald Trump	Then, it was artificially shut down by this disease that came onto our land.
421	George Stephanopoulos	Got to take another break.
422	George Stephanopoulos	We’ll be right back.
423	George Stephanopoulos	Welcome back to our town hall.
424	George Stephanopoulos	We’re taking questions from voters in Pennsylvania who’ve not yet made up their minds for a final decision in this election.
425	George Stephanopoulos	The next question comes from Leah Schwotzer of Pittsburgh.
426	Leah Schwotzer	Hello.
427	Donald Trump	Hi.
428	Leah Schwotzer	I worry about a second or third wave of unemployment.
429	Leah Schwotzer	Employers that weathered the first six months of COVID-19 are now seeing their businesses dramatically impacted due to the effect of this virus on our economy.
430	Leah Schwotzer	What, as a president, is your plan to aid these workers who may not lose their jobs today, but in the months to come?
431	Donald Trump	Well, as you know, we did pay check, but we’re doing a lot of other things.
432	Donald Trump	But, what I want to do is see some additional stimulus.
433	Donald Trump	We’re trying to get it, and we may.
434	Donald Trump	I mean, just before I came here, we had some pretty good talks with the democrats.
435	Donald Trump	We’ll see, but they’ve been very difficult-
436	George Stephanopoulos	Why not call the Speaker down to your office, hammer it out [crosstalk 00:35:17]
437	Donald Trump	Because, they know exactly where I stand.
438	Donald Trump	At the right time, I’ll do that, but they know exactly where I stand.
439	Donald Trump	What they want is a bail out of democrat run states that are doing poorly.
440	Donald Trump	I don’t think this is the right way-
441	George Stephanopoulos	Why do you keep talking about democrat states?
442	Donald Trump	They are.
443	George Stephanopoulos	They’re American states and American cities.
444	Donald Trump	No, the democrat run states are the ones that are doing badly, George.
445	Donald Trump	If you look at New York, if you look at Illinois, if you look at a lot of different places, they’re doing poorly, and cities in particular.
446	Donald Trump	Cities, I mean, these cities are being run so poorly-
447	George Stephanopoulos	Don’t you have a responsibility for those states and cities as well?
448	Donald Trump	… but largely because of the crime.
449	Donald Trump	They don’t want to do anything about crime.
450	Donald Trump	Sanctuary cities.
451	Donald Trump	They have sanctuary cities where they’re protecting criminals.
452	Donald Trump	They have things that the republicans don’t have.
453	Donald Trump	So, they are.
454	Donald Trump	I don’t want to say… Look, I’m the president of everybody, but I don’t want to say it, but they’re democrat run cities.
455	Donald Trump	It is what it is.
456	George Stephanopoulos	Will you be calling the Speaker in?
457	George Stephanopoulos	Can you hammer out a deal?
458	Donald Trump	At the right time, yes, I would like to see additional stimulus for people that really, it wasn’t their fault.
459	Donald Trump	It wasn’t your fault, wasn’t anybody’s fault.
460	Donald Trump	It was China’s fault.
461	Donald Trump	I don’t care how you want to define it.
462	Donald Trump	This was China’s fault, and our people shouldn’t be hurt.
463	Donald Trump	We should do stimulus.
464	Donald Trump	We did a lot of it initially, and now they stopped, because they think it’s going to be better for the election.
465	George Stephanopoulos	They say if you’ll come up, they said they’ll meet you halfway on the money.
466	Donald Trump	Well, we can do something maybe, but I’m just hearing for the first time about an hour ago that maybe there is a chance to get something, and I’d like to do it.
467	Donald Trump	I would like to see it happen, George.
468	George Stephanopoulos	Next question’s on healthcare.
469	George Stephanopoulos	It comes from Ellesia Blaque.
470	George Stephanopoulos	She’s from Philadelphia, an assistant professor who voted for Hillary Clinton last time.
471	Ellesia Blaque	Hi.
472	Donald Trump	Hi.
473	Ellesia Blaque	Mr. President, I was born with a disease called sarcoidosis.
474	Ellesia Blaque	From the day I was born, I was considered uninsurable.
475	Ellesia Blaque	That disease started in my skin, moved to my eyes, into my optic nerves, and when I went to graduate school, into my brain.
476	Ellesia Blaque	When it hit my brain, I was automatically eligible for disability for the rest of my life.
477	Ellesia Blaque	I chose instead to get a bachelor’s degree, a master’s degree, a PhD, and become a professor.
478	Donald Trump	That’s great.
479	Ellesia Blaque	It is great, except I still have similar healthcare problems.
480	Ellesia Blaque	It costs me, with copays, I’m still paying almost $7,000 a year in addition to the copay, and should preexisting conditions, which Obamacare brought to fruition be removed-
481	Donald Trump	No.
482	Ellesia Blaque	Please stop and let me finish my question, sir.
483	Ellesia Blaque	Should that be removed?
484	Ellesia Blaque	Within a 36 to 72 hour period without my medication, I will be dead.
485	Ellesia Blaque	I want to know what it is that you’re going to do to ensure that people like me who work hard, we do everything we’re supposed to do, can stay insured.
486	Ellesia Blaque	It’s not my fault that I was born with this disease.
487	Ellesia Blaque	It’s not my fault that I’m a black woman, and in the medical community, I’m minimized and not taken seriously.
488	Ellesia Blaque	I want to know what you are going to do about that.
489	Donald Trump	First of all, I hope you are taken seriously.
490	Donald Trump	I hope you are.
491	Donald Trump	We are not going to hurt anything having to do with preexisting conditions.
492	Donald Trump	We’re not going to hurt preexisting conditions, and in fact, just the opposite.
493	Donald Trump	If you look at what they want to do, where they have socialized medicine, they will get rid of preexisting conditions.
494	Donald Trump	If they go into Medicare for all, which is socialized medicine, and you can forget about your doctors and your plans, just like you can forget under President Obama.
495	Donald Trump	He said you can have your doctor, you can have your plan, and that turned out to be a lie.
496	Donald Trump	He said it 28 different times, at least.
497	Donald Trump	We have 28 different times.
498	Donald Trump	You can have your doctor, you can have your plan.
499	Donald Trump	Well, it’s not true.
500	Donald Trump	But, what we’re doing is we’re going to be doing a healthcare plan, preexisting, protecting people with preexisting conditions.
501	Donald Trump	As an example, yourself.
502	Donald Trump	It sounds like that’s exactly perfect.
503	Donald Trump	That’s exactly what we’re talking about.
504	Donald Trump	We’re going to be doing a healthcare plan very strongly, and protect people with preexisting conditions.
505	Donald Trump	I will say this, they will not do that, because they have socialized-
506	George Stephanopoulos	I have to stop you there.
507	George Stephanopoulos	I just have to stop you there, because just on a couple points.
508	George Stephanopoulos	Number one, Joe Biden has ran against Medicare for all in the primaries, but much more importantly, Obamacare guaranteed people with preexisting conditions could buy insurance, guaranteed they could buy it at the same price as everyone else, guaranteed a package of essential benefits, guaranteed that insurance companies couldn’t put a lifetime limit on those benefits.
509	George Stephanopoulos	You fought to repeal Obamacare.
510	George Stephanopoulos	You are arguing in the Supreme Court right now to strike it down.
511	George Stephanopoulos	That would do away with preexisting conditions.
512	Donald Trump	No, so we can do new healthcare.
513	George Stephanopoulos	You’ve been promising a new healthcare plan.
514	George Stephanopoulos	I interviewed you in June of last year.
515	George Stephanopoulos	You said the healthcare plan would come in two weeks.
516	George Stephanopoulos	You told Chris Wallace this summer, it would come in three weeks.
517	George Stephanopoulos	You promised an executive order on preexisting-
518	Donald Trump	I have it already.
519	Donald Trump	I have it already.
520	George Stephanopoulos	But, you’ve been trying to strike down preexisting conditions.
521	Donald Trump	It doesn’t matter.
522	Donald Trump	I have it already, and it’s a much better plan for you, and it’s a much better plan.
523	George Stephanopoulos	What is it?
524	Donald Trump	When you say Obamacare, I got rid of the individual mandate, which is the worst part of Obamacare.
525	George Stephanopoulos	You’re striking down the whole law.
526	Donald Trump	Wouldn’t pertain to you, but it’d pertain to a lot of people where they were going literally bust because they didn’t want to have health insurance, and they were paying for it anyway, and it was no good.
527	Donald Trump	Obamacare was a disaster.
528	Donald Trump	Obamacare is too expensive.
529	Donald Trump	The premiums are too high.
530	Donald Trump	It’s a total disaster.
531	Donald Trump	You’re going to have new healthcare, and the preexisting condition aspect of it will always be in my plan, and I’ve said that loud and clear-
532	George Stephanopoulos	But, you haven’t come up with it.
533	Donald Trump	And, we got rid of the individual mandate, which essentially ended Obamacare-
534	George Stephanopoulos	Only because you’re arguing for it.
535	Donald Trump	George, I had a decision to make.
536	Donald Trump	Do I run… We gutted out the worst parts of Obamacare.
537	Donald Trump	Now, I have to make this decision.
538	Donald Trump	This is three years ago.
539	Donald Trump	Do we run Obamacare well and do a good job, and do the best, even though it’s never going to be very good, or do we let it run badly?
540	Donald Trump	Probably letting it run badly would’ve been a better political decision, but I couldn’t do that.
541	Donald Trump	We have run it so much better than Obama ran it.
542	Donald Trump	Now, it’s not the same because I got rid of the most unpopular thing and a very unfair thing, which was the individual mandate.
543	George Stephanopoulos	You’re trying to strike down the whole law.
544	Donald Trump	George, we have run it really well, but we also have now other… If you go to Department of Labor, our great secretary as you know, and you know him well, we have other alternatives to Obamacare that are 50% less expensive, and they’re actually better.
545	George Stephanopoulos	It’s been three and a half years.
546	Donald Trump	George, it’s been 40 years since you had good healthcare.
547	Donald Trump	You never really had good healthcare in this country.
548	Donald Trump	This country has never had it.
549	Donald Trump	But, when you say that Biden doesn’t want to do it, everybody else does.
550	Donald Trump	Bernie does.
551	Donald Trump	He agreed to the manifesto as I call it.
552	Donald Trump	The agreement with Bernie is that you’re going to go to socialized medicine.
553	George Stephanopoulos	He ran against Medicare for all.
554	Donald Trump	If you go to socialized medicine… Well, he agreed.
555	Donald Trump	Harris, who he today, said, Harris-Biden, because you think she’s president, Harris… Someday, you’ll have to explain that one to me, but Harris is all for doing that.
556	Donald Trump	She wants to go to socialized medicine.
557	Donald Trump	You no longer have your doctor really, and you no longer have your plan.
558	Donald Trump	And, Joe can say all he wants, he’s only doing it because he sees his poll numbers going down so substantially.
559	Donald Trump	But, Joe can say all he wants about healthcare.
560	Donald Trump	Obamacare has been a failure from day one.
561	Donald Trump	It’s too expensive, whether it’s the premium or whether it’s the cost generally, and they don’t have their doctors, and they don’t have their plans.
562	Donald Trump	We’re going to have a very good healthcare.
563	Donald Trump	I think maybe a great healthcare for less money.
564	George Stephanopoulos	Got to take another break.
565	George Stephanopoulos	We’ll be right back.
566	George Stephanopoulos	Welcome back to our Town Hall with President Trump.
567	George Stephanopoulos	Mr President thank you for being here.
568	Donald Trump	Thank you.
569	George Stephanopoulos	The next question comes from Jim Roudeski, he’s from Irwin, Pennsylvania, that’s around Pittsburgh.
570	George Stephanopoulos	And you voted for President Trump last time around.
571	Donald Trump	Hi Jim.
572	Jim Roudeski	Hi.
573	Jim Roudeski	At times, some have called your behavior not presidential.
574	Jim Roudeski	What, if anything, would you do differently if reelected to create a more unified message where all sides can take responsibilities for their actions and come together to make positive change?
575	Donald Trump	Good Jim.
576	Donald Trump	So I’m fighting a battle, it’s a big battlefield and I have a lot of forces against me.
577	Donald Trump	I have the media, which I call the fake news, because a lot of it is fake.
578	Donald Trump	And I mean a big pop, as you understand, a lot of is fake.
579	Donald Trump	I’m fighting a lot of forces.
580	Donald Trump	Sometimes you don’t have time to be totally, as you would say, presidential.
581	Donald Trump	You have to get things done.
582	Donald Trump	I think I’ve done more than any other president in the first three and a half years.
583	Donald Trump	When you look at what we’ve done for tax cuts and regulation cuts and the vets, all of the things that we’ve done for the West, we have a 91% approval factor now for the vets, we rebuilt our military, we created Space Force.
584	Donald Trump	I mean, we did so many things, Right-to-try, which is so incredible and so successful.
585	Donald Trump	You know what Right-to-try is?
586	Donald Trump	We did more, I really believe it, more than any other president in the first three and a half years.
587	Donald Trump	By the way, at the end of my first term, we’re going to have close to 300, maybe over 300 new federal judges, including Court of Appeal, two Supreme Court justices.
588	Donald Trump	And honestly, we move very fast and I have to get rid of people fast because they’re not doing their job.
589	Donald Trump	I could tell you people that weren’t doing their job.
590	Donald Trump	And when I do that to get somebody else that is good, and if they don’t do it, we get rid of that person.
591	Donald Trump	We do a lot of things and we have to get them done.
592	Donald Trump	I could be so pres… I always used to sort of kid on the campaign trail that I could be more presidential, would be very easy, more presidential than any other candidate, except for possibly Abraham Lincoln when he’s wearing the hat, right?
593	Donald Trump	The high hat.
594	Donald Trump	But the fact is, being presidential is easier than what I have to do, but I get things done.
595	Donald Trump	I get things done like nobody’s ever gotten, including environmental things.
596	Donald Trump	When you look at what’s going on in the country and all that we’ve done, we unfortunately got hit by this plague, but it’s going to be back very soon, we opened it up and we have…you talk Jim about the V. We have a super V, looks like it’s going to be a super V.
597	Donald Trump	We’re going to have a great economy next year.
598	Donald Trump	And I think we’re going to have a great economy in the third quarter.
599	Donald Trump	And thank you for voting for me in 2016.
600	Donald Trump	I hope you’re going to do it again.
601	Jim Roudeski	Thanks sir.
602	Donald Trump	Thank you.
603	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
604	George Stephanopoulos	You talk about a super V Mr. President.
605	George Stephanopoulos	A lot of people look at this and say, it’s more like a K-shaped recovery, that people at the top who have a lot of stocks are doing pretty well.
606	George Stephanopoulos	[crosstalk 00:51:06]
607	George Stephanopoulos	But now you’ve only gotten half the jobs back.
608	Donald Trump	George, stocks are owned by everybody.
609	Donald Trump	I mean, they talk about the stock market is so good, that’s 401(k)s. I’m meeting people with as long as they didn’t sell when the market went down, when we first realized the extent of this horrible thing from China.
610	Donald Trump	I mean, these people are doing, some of them are doing better than they were doing before the pandemic came.
611	George Stephanopoulos	So that 33.6 [inaudible 00:00:51:30].
612	Donald Trump	If people held onto their stocks, and remember this, because I noticed you said wealthy, sure, wealthy, but you have people that aren’t wealthy, but have done well because of the stock market.
613	Donald Trump	I’ve set records on the stock market even during the pandemic.
614	Donald Trump	And that doesn’t happen by accident.
615	Donald Trump	I will tell you this, if Joe Biden ever got this position and that’s a headwind on the stock market, our stock market would be much higher if it weren’t for that.
616	Donald Trump	If Joe Biden ever got in, I think you’d have a depression, the likes of which we’ve never seen in this country.
617	Donald Trump	If you look at his policies, where he wants to raise everybody’s taxes, you look at what he wants to do in terms of regulation, where he wants to put all of the regulations back on that I took off, and then some, and in many cases, double it up, you will have a depression, the likes of which we haven’t seen in this country, and that doesn’t affect big people.
618	Donald Trump	It affects everybody.
619	Donald Trump	It affects a person that owns $10,000 worth of stock in IBM or whatever company it may be.
620	Donald Trump	Look, we’re having a tremendous thing in the stock market and that’s good for everybody, but people that aren’t rich own stock and they have 401(k)s. You take a look at the 401(k)s. They’re in many cases better than they were before the pandemic came.
621	George Stephanopoulos	Next question comes from Alexandra Stehman from Pittsburgh, sat out the last presidential election, I believe.
622	Alexandra	Unfortunately so, I did.
623	Donald Trump	Thank you.
624	Alexandra	Good evening Mr. President.
625	Alexandra	So I’d like to ask regarding your recent comments about our United States soldiers and referring to them as suckers.
626	Donald Trump	Could you say that again?
627	Alexandra	Our United States soldiers referring to them as suckers and particularly the late John McCain, our prisoners as war losers.
628	Donald Trump	Oh, oh, I see.
629	Donald Trump	Okay.
630	Donald Trump	It was a fake statement.
631	Donald Trump	Go ahead
632	Alexandra	And recently requesting to ban amputee veterans from a military parade.
633	Alexandra	How do you expect to win back the support of our military, their families, their friends, and military supporters?
634	Donald Trump	It’s easy, because they never made those statements.
635	Donald Trump	They were never made by me.
636	Donald Trump	They said, I stood over the grave of soldiers killed many years ago, and I said they were suckers.
637	Donald Trump	I never made that.
638	Donald Trump	We had 26 people as of today, come out to say it never happened, and many people were there.
639	Donald Trump	Then they said about the rain didn’t happen and that wasn’t the reason.
640	Donald Trump	The secret service said, we have a statement from them.
641	Donald Trump	They said that we could not travel because the helicopter couldn’t be used, we would not be able to travel.
642	Donald Trump	Because when you do that through a major city, it takes them days to get it prepared.
643	Donald Trump	I wanted to go anyway.
644	Donald Trump	I said, “Let me just go separately in a car in disguise.
645	Donald Trump	I don’t care.” I wanted to be there so badly, but the statements never happened.
646	Donald Trump	They were lies.
647	Donald Trump	As far as John McCain, I was never a fan of John McCain.
648	Donald Trump	I never thought he treated our vets well, he didn’t do the job.
649	Donald Trump	I was never a fan of his, and I think that’s fine and everybody knows that, and I said it to his face.
650	Donald Trump	I was very much up in that.
651	George Stephanopoulos	You said he’s not a war hero.
652	Donald Trump	But as far as [inaudible 00:54:30], I have done so much for our vets and for our military, I rebuilt our military.
653	Donald Trump	When I came into this great office, our military was depleted, it was in the worst shape it was in probably ever.
654	Donald Trump	It was depleted.
655	Donald Trump	The planes were old and broken, the ships, everything.
656	Donald Trump	You see what I’ve done.
657	Donald Trump	I’ve rebuilt $2.5 trillion, and you think that was easy, getting that money from Democrats?
658	Donald Trump	Because they don’t like the military.
659	Donald Trump	This magazine came up, they made up this quote.
660	Donald Trump	It was a made up quote.
661	Donald Trump	And the gloves are off with Biden who I’ve never respected greatly.
662	Donald Trump	I’ve never respected him greatly.
663	Donald Trump	But when they took this made up quote that was now knocked out by over 25 people and they made an ad out of it, I thought it was a disgrace.
664	Donald Trump	Do you know what disinformation is?
665	Donald Trump	That’s what it was.
666	Donald Trump	They made up a phony quote and then they went with it.
667	Donald Trump	It was a phony deal.
668	Donald Trump	And the one who started it was a big friend of President Obama and Clinton.
669	Donald Trump	And it was a phony deal from a very not very successful [inaudible 00:55:34].
670	George Stephanopoulos	Mr. President you have used language like that in the past.
671	George Stephanopoulos	You did say that John McCain wasn’t a war hero.
672	George Stephanopoulos	And notably silent in the wake of this article were General John Kelly, who was your chief of staff at the time.
673	George Stephanopoulos	General James Mattis, who served as defense secretary for you has said-
674	Donald Trump	They didn’t hear me say that.
675	George Stephanopoulos	Has said, well, I’m getting to a broader point with the generals.
676	Donald Trump	Because I never said it.
677	George Stephanopoulos	General Mattis said, you’re dividing, you’re not trying to unite the country.
678	George Stephanopoulos	General Kelly said he agreed with that.
679	George Stephanopoulos	John Bolton, who was your National Security Advisor said you are a danger to the country.
680	George Stephanopoulos	The people in these top military positions who served most closely with you have said you’re unfit for office.
681	George Stephanopoulos	How do you respond to that?
682	Donald Trump	These are people that I let go.
683	Donald Trump	These are disgruntled former employees to put it in a nice way with a term people would understand.
684	Donald Trump	Mattis was a highly overrated general, didn’t do the job, didn’t do good on ISIS.
685	Donald Trump	I took over a hundred percent of the ISIS caliphate.
686	Donald Trump	I had the people that I wanted and Mattis was fired as you know by President Obama.
687	Donald Trump	And I fired him also.
688	George Stephanopoulos	He says he resigned.
689	Donald Trump	He didn’t resign.
690	Donald Trump	I said, “Give me a letter.” No more.
691	Donald Trump	Give me a letter.
692	Donald Trump	I was being nice.
693	Donald Trump	One of the problems when you’re nice, oftentimes it comes back to hit you.
694	Donald Trump	I said, “Jim, give me a letter.
695	Donald Trump	It’s time for you to move on.” He gave me a letter, but I fired him, [inaudible 00:56:50], I fired him.
696	Donald Trump	Now, General Mattis Didn’t do the job.
697	Donald Trump	I wasn’t happy with him.
698	Donald Trump	If you look at John Bolton, John Bolton, all he wanted to do is blow people up.
699	Donald Trump	He wanted to go to war with everybody.
700	Donald Trump	And frankly, I used him very nicely.
701	Donald Trump	I bring him into a room in a negotiation, when people saw them, they said, “Oh wow, he’s going to go to war.” I’m bringing our troops back from Afghanistan.
702	Donald Trump	I’m bringing our troops back from Iraq.
703	Donald Trump	We’re almost out of almost every place.
704	Donald Trump	Everybody said because of my personality, they said, “He’ll be in a war immediately.” Look at North Korea, how that’s worked out.
705	Donald Trump	The sanctions are on, everything’s the same, we haven’t spent anything.
706	Donald Trump	We’re getting along with him, I get along with Kim Jong-un.
707	Donald Trump	That was supposed to be a war.
708	Donald Trump	If President Obama were president, if Hillary Clinton ever got in, that would be a war.
709	Donald Trump	We would have a war, probably a nuclear war with North Korea.
710	Donald Trump	In the meantime, I’m getting calls all the time from friends of mine in South Korea.
711	Donald Trump	“Thank you.
712	Donald Trump	We love you.
713	Donald Trump	Thank you.” It’s really been rather amazing.
714	Donald Trump	So instead of wars, everybody said, look at what we had today with the United Arab Emirates, UAE, and just take a look at what happened with Israel today with that.
715	Donald Trump	Take a look at what’s going on.
716	Donald Trump	That was going to be a problem.
717	Donald Trump	We’re actually creating peace in the Middle East without blood staining our sand.
718	Donald Trump	Look at what happened with Bahrain-
719	George Stephanopoulos	You’ve criticized Jim Mattis.
720	Donald Trump	George, look at what happened with Bahrain.
721	Donald Trump	Well, a guy like Jim Mattis would have disagreed with the way I went about it, and I’ve turned out to be correct.
722	Donald Trump	Tom Friedman of the New York Times wrote incredible glowing articles last week about this incredible thing that I’ve been able to do in the Middle East.
723	Donald Trump	A guy like Jim Mattis could have never done it because they were all doing it the old fashioned way.
724	Donald Trump	They were going in the wrong outlets and the wrong doors.
725	Donald Trump	And what happened today with the UAE, and with Bahrain, and with Israel, people don’t even believe it.
726	Donald Trump	And George, as sure as you’re sitting there, I have numerous other countries in that region that are going to be signing very soon also.
727	Donald Trump	You’ll have peace in the Middle East, and this is without war and without losing, and I’m talking about on both sides, but without losing our great young soldiers.
728	Donald Trump	I go to Dover and I greet oftentimes soldiers coming in, and they’re dead.
729	Donald Trump	And there’s no sadder thing than to sit with a widow or a mother and watch these big, massive cargo planes, and that back opens up and these incredible Marines are walking off a casket and they were killed in the Middle East.
730	Donald Trump	And in many ways, nobody even knows why.
731	Donald Trump	Going there was the worst decision in the history of our country.
732	Donald Trump	We’ve spent $8 trillion and we’ve lost thousands of lives, but really millions of lives because I view both sides.
733	Donald Trump	Okay?
734	Donald Trump	If that’s okay.
735	Donald Trump	Millions of lives, this was the worst decision.
736	Donald Trump	And by the way, Iraq did not… Saddam Hussein did not knock down the World Trade Center in case you don’t know, and I’m sure you do know that.
737	Donald Trump	They said they had weapons of mass destruction, they made a mistake.
738	Donald Trump	So we’re now $8 trillion.
739	Donald Trump	We’ve been in there for 20 years, almost 20 years in Afghanistan.
740	Donald Trump	I guess it’s getting very close to that, it’s over 19 and we’re bringing our soldiers back home.
741	Donald Trump	Nobody expected that from me and people are so happy about it.
742	Donald Trump	And you know who’s the happiest?
743	Donald Trump	The soldiers.
744	Donald Trump	I see them all the time.
745	Donald Trump	“What do you think?
746	Donald Trump	Should we be here?” “No, sir.
747	Donald Trump	You shouldn’t be here.” “Why?” “They don’t like us, sir.” And I’ll tell you what, I’ve rarely met a soldier that’s over there.
748	Donald Trump	They’re better than anybody because they can tell you better than anybody what’s happening.
749	Donald Trump	Rarely do I meet a soldier that says we should be there.
750	Donald Trump	It was the worst mistake, the most costly mistake in the history of our country, going into the Middle East.
751	George Stephanopoulos	Going to be right back.
752	Commercial	The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.
753	Commercial	2020, The President and The People will return in a moment.
754	Commercial	The President and The People, a special edition of 2020.
755	Commercial	Here again, George Stephanopoulos.
756	George Stephanopoulos	Welcome back to our Town meeting with President Trump.
757	George Stephanopoulos	The next question comes from Alexander J. Floyd of Dallas, Pennsylvania.
758	George Stephanopoulos	He voted for President Trump last time around.
759	Alexander	Hello Mr. Trump.
760	Alexander	My question is actually about police reform.
761	Alexander	And how can we balance common sense police reform without sacrificing public safety in a time when part of the country is calling to defund the police and actively cheering when they’re gunned down in the street, and another part is tired of seeing the lawlessness?
762	Donald Trump	So we have a great Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina, and he had a plan that was very much of a compromise plan, but it was a plan that everybody pretty much agreed to.
763	Donald Trump	A lot of Democrats agreed to it, but they wouldn’t vote for it.
764	Donald Trump	And it was a really good, it was a compromise of a lot of different factors, and it didn’t get done, and it should have gotten done and it could still be out there, it could still be resurrected very easily, but they just didn’t want to do it.
765	Donald Trump	Because I think the Democrats are viewing this as a political issue, and I probably agree with them.
766	Donald Trump	I think it’s very bad for them because we’re about law and order, we have to be about law and order.
767	Donald Trump	Otherwise you’re going to see your cities burn and that’s the way it is.
768	Donald Trump	If we can do a plan like Tim Scott’s plan, which is really, it goes far enough, but it doesn’t take the dignity away from our police.
769	Donald Trump	We have incredible people.
770	Donald Trump	They’ve been protecting us for a long time.
771	Donald Trump	I mean, we are here, and I feel very safe being in this room.
772	Donald Trump	These are great people.
773	Donald Trump	We can’t take their dignity away.
774	Donald Trump	We have to let them be able to do what they do better than anybody else.
775	Donald Trump	So I think we have to look at it that way.
776	Donald Trump	We have to be very, very careful.
777	Donald Trump	Police are so afraid today, that they do something slightly wrong, slightly wrong, and their pension’s gone, their job’s gone, who knows what happens?
778	Donald Trump	Their life is ruined, their wife or their husband will leave, the whole thing, it’s a very scary thing to do.
779	Donald Trump	And then you look at safety.
780	Donald Trump	I mean, you look at that horrible human being that shot these two police, [inaudible 01:07:59] right next, just a disgusting and then ran off.
781	Donald Trump	You look at that.
782	Donald Trump	This is a very tough job and it’s a very unsafe job.
783	Donald Trump	It’s a very dangerous job.
784	Donald Trump	We have to give them back their dignity and we have to give them back respect.
785	Donald Trump	These are great people, for the most part.
786	Donald Trump	There’s always going to be a bad apple in your business, in my business, no matter what.
787	Donald Trump	I mean, there’s going to be bad apples so we have to weed out the bad apples, but we have to give the police back that strength that they had a short while ago and that they have in Republican cities, frankly, and states.
788	Donald Trump	But you take a look, this is a Democrat problem.
789	Donald Trump	George, I know you’re a Democrat, but this is largely a Democrat problem.
790	Donald Trump	If you just take a look at the list, every Democrat city, almost, not all, but a lot of them certainly in the top 25, even if you go to the top 50, almost every city is run by the Democrats.
791	Donald Trump	People don’t respect our police and they have to respect them-
792	George Stephanopoulos	Mr.President, you promised four years ago-
793	Donald Trump	Respect our police.
794	George Stephanopoulos	Mr. President.
795	Donald Trump	And they have to respect them.
796	George Stephanopoulos	You promised four years ago at the Republican Convention, “I’m going to restore law and order in this country-”
797	Donald Trump	And I have, except in Democrat-run cities.
798	Donald Trump	Look, we have laws.
799	Donald Trump	We have to go by the laws.
800	Donald Trump	We can’t move in the National Guard.
801	Donald Trump	I can call insurrection, but there’s no reason to ever do that.
802	Donald Trump	Even in a Portland case.
803	Donald Trump	We can’t call in the National Guard unless we’re requested by a governor.
804	Donald Trump	If a governor or a mayor is a Democrat, like in Portland, we call them constantly.
805	Donald Trump	I just spoke to the governor yesterday, because we’re giving them relief from the fires.
806	Donald Trump	We’re giving them an emergency declaration.
807	Donald Trump	I said, “Governor, let us go in and we’ll clean up Portland so fast.
808	Donald Trump	In a half an hour, it’ll be all right.” And she’s just torn by it.
809	Donald Trump	I don’t understand the thinking, but they are torn by it.
810	Donald Trump	I have a lot of respect for the governor, frankly, and what happened in Minneapolis was pretty amazing.
811	Donald Trump	Unfortunately, it just went on for a week or a week and a half before he allowed us to bring in the National Guard.
812	Donald Trump	When we brought in the National Guard, everything stopped, the crime was gone, meaning the whole thing.
813	Donald Trump	But by that time, a big portion of the city was burned down.
814	Donald Trump	We’re talking about Minneapolis.
815	Donald Trump	In Seattle, we let them know we’re coming in.
816	Donald Trump	They took over a big chunk of the city, 20% of the city.
817	Donald Trump	We said, “We’re coming in.” As soon as we said that the police department went in and these other people were exhausted, but had we not said we’re going in, we were ready to go in, we were going in the following morning, wherever you have a Democrat city, not in all cases, but if you look at the really troubled cities in our country, they’re Democrat-run and that’s Biden.
818	Donald Trump	They’re weak, they’re ineffective.
819	George Stephanopoulos	Mr. President, you’re president for those cities right now.
820	Donald Trump	I’m president, but I can only do what I’m allowed to do.
821	Donald Trump	George.
822	Donald Trump	I don’t need insurrection.
823	Donald Trump	I don’t need an insurrection act to take care of 250 anarchists.
824	Donald Trump	We can do that very easily with the National Guard.
825	Donald Trump	We proved that in Minneapolis.
826	Donald Trump	They came in after the city was burning.
827	Donald Trump	And the thing I don’t really get is that the news media is saying, “No, these are peaceful.
828	Donald Trump	These are peaceful.” And right over the reporter, it was a CNN reporter, right over his shoulder, and you saw that, right over his shoulder, the city is burning.
829	Donald Trump	It looked like it was Berlin during the war.
830	Donald Trump	It was the craziest thing I’ve ever seen, and he’s trying to say, I don’t know why the news media tries to make so light of it.
831	Donald Trump	These are not protests.
832	Donald Trump	These are far greater than protests.
833	George Stephanopoulos	Got to take another quick break.

836	Commercial	From the Constitution Center in Philadelphia, here again, George Stephanopoulos.
837	George Stephanopoulos	Welcome back to our Town meeting with President Trump.
838	George Stephanopoulos	We’re taking questions.
839	George Stephanopoulos	Pennsylvania voters have not made up their minds this election.
840	George Stephanopoulos	Next one comes from Flor Cruceta.
841	George Stephanopoulos	She’s from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
842	George Stephanopoulos	She has not voted before because she just became a citizen.
843	Donald Trump	Oh, very good.
844	Flor Cruceta	Thank you so much.
845	Flor Cruceta	Hi, Mr. President.
846	Donald Trump	Thank you.
847	Flor Cruceta	Mr. George.
848	Flor Cruceta	Hi everyone.
849	Flor Cruceta	My name is Flor Cruceta.
850	Flor Cruceta	Sorry if I can’t hold my tears.
851	Flor Cruceta	[crosstalk 01:17:02] I came in 2006 with my mom from Dominican Republic.
852	Flor Cruceta	Sorry.
853	Donald Trump	That’s all right.
854	Donald Trump	And just take your time.
855	Donald Trump	That’s fine.
856	Donald Trump	George has plenty of time.
857	Donald Trump	I hope, right?
858	George Stephanopoulos	Absolutely.
859	Donald Trump	Thank you.
860	Donald Trump	Did you say your mom got COVID?
861	Flor Cruceta	We come from Dominican Republic in 2006 to live our American dream.
862	Flor Cruceta	But she forget how to take care of herself, and she died last month.
863	Flor Cruceta	Sorry.
864	Donald Trump	Terrible.
865	Donald Trump	And that’s okay.
866	Donald Trump	It’s okay.
867	Flor Cruceta	She have breast cancer, but it made metastasized on her brain, bone, and lungs.
868	Flor Cruceta	And she passed on the 19.
869	Flor Cruceta	One of her biggest dream was to become a citizen to vote and she did.
870	Flor Cruceta	She did it 10 days before she died and I did it too.
871	Flor Cruceta	She pushed me so hard to do it and I did it this past 28.
872	Flor Cruceta	I’m here because of her.
873	Flor Cruceta	She was supposed to be here and ask you and thank you for the [inaudible 01:18:29] you take during this epidemic.
874	Flor Cruceta	You made people closer.
875	Flor Cruceta	We lost our job but we learn how to love our family.
876	Flor Cruceta	So I’m saying that from her.
877	Donald Trump	Very nice.
878	Flor Cruceta	Here’s a question for you both because she write this question.
879	Flor Cruceta	What will you do for our immigration system?
880	Flor Cruceta	What would you change to make more people like me and like her to become citizen and vote?
881	Donald Trump	So, we are doing something with immigration that I think is going to be very strong because we want people to come into our country, people like you and like your mother, and that just shows how vicious the COVID is, especially when you have another problem, you have a heart problem or another type of a problem.
882	Donald Trump	And it’s a very sad story, but we want people to come into our country.
883	Donald Trump	We want them to come in, a lot of people, but we want them to come in through a legal system, through a system that they love our country, they work to come into our country, a merit system, and we’re working on something very hard right now and in a very short time, we’re going to be announcing it.
884	Donald Trump	And I think it’s going to have quite an impact.
885	Donald Trump	I think it’s going to be something that actually will be popular for all.
886	Donald Trump	I mean, as far as your situation with your mother, that is just devastating.
887	Donald Trump	Because I can imagine how you feel and sounds like a great woman, and I’ll tell you, I’m pretty good with people.
888	Donald Trump	She gave us a great daughter, a great child.
889	Donald Trump	What she’s done with you, the way you are, the love that you have for your mother, I can see that.
890	Donald Trump	It’s hard, and so many people, and they die alone.
891	Donald Trump	They die alone because this is such a vicious thing.
892	Donald Trump	You can’t go there and hold their hand.
893	Donald Trump	You can’t give them a kiss goodnight.
894	Donald Trump	It’s a terrible, terrible thing.
895	Donald Trump	And hopefully the vaccines are going to be very soon.
896	Donald Trump	Hopefully.
897	Donald Trump	Did you have COVID?
898	Donald Trump	You didn’t have it, right?
899	Flor Cruceta	No.
900	Donald Trump	You didn’t have it, mother.
901	Donald Trump	We’ll have it taken care of.
902	Donald Trump	It’s going to get taken care of.
903	Donald Trump	The vaccines are going to make a big difference.
904	Donald Trump	What has made a big difference is Remdesevir.
905	Donald Trump	We have many things now and things are going to be announced soon, which frankly, if you take a look at some of the things we’re doing in terms of the word wouldn’t be cure, but the word would be therapeutically or therapeutics, we have some incredible things which is so important.
906	Donald Trump	And I view that actually in a certain way is more important than the vaccine where you can go into a hospital and get your mother and give her a transfusion or a shot and they can get better, get better much faster.
907	Donald Trump	So we have some of those things and they’ve been very, very successful, but we have others coming out and in order to get them, we had to get the FDA to approve these products, these very sophisticated medicines, I guess you could call them medicine, but we had to get them approved very quickly and they did it.
908	Donald Trump	Dr. Hahn, the head of the FDA, Alex Azar, they’ve really done a fantastic job.
909	Donald Trump	I believe George that none of this would have happened in another administration.
910	Donald Trump	And I think you know that.
911	Donald Trump	The FDA is approving things at a level that they’ve never done and at speed with which they’ve never acted before.
912	George Stephanopoulos	Big question is, is it being done safely?
913	George Stephanopoulos	We’ve got to take a another break.
914	George Stephanopoulos	We’re going to be right back [crosstalk 01:21:47].

918	Commercial	Here again, George Stephanopoulos.
919	George Stephanopoulos	Welcome back to our town meeting.
920	George Stephanopoulos	We have time for one final question that comes from Ashley West of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.
921	Ashley West	Hi Mr. Trump.
922	Donald Trump	Hi Ashley.
923	Ashley West	Sorry.
924	Ashley West	My question is, what has been the most difficult part of your presidency and what have you learned from it?
925	Donald Trump	So I think without question, I would say, because things were going so well, I think I’d have to say the whole COVID, the China virus as I call it because it comes from China so I think it’s a much more accurate term.
926	Donald Trump	But it’s been very difficult, it’s been so sad.
927	Donald Trump	As an example, talking to you about your mother, it’s just such a sad situation.
928	Donald Trump	Yeah, we’re getting there, we will get there, we’re going to, it’s going to happen, but it’s been very difficult, nobody’s seen anything like this probably since 1970 [inaudible 01:28:03].
929	George Stephanopoulos	What did you learn from it?
930	Donald Trump	I learned that life is very fragile.
931	Donald Trump	I knew people that were powerful people, strong people, good people, and they got knocked out by this and died.
932	Donald Trump	Six people.
933	Donald Trump	It was five until about two weeks ago, now it’s six.
934	Donald Trump	But I’ve learned that life is very fragile because these were strong people and all of a sudden they were dead, they were gone, and it wasn’t their fault.
935	Donald Trump	It was the fault of a country that could have stopped it.
936	Donald Trump	And I made a great trade deal with China,
937	George Stephanopoulos	Any of it was your fault?
938	Donald Trump	I feel so differently about that deal now.
939	Donald Trump	It’s a great deal.
940	Donald Trump	It was good for the farmers, good for the manufacturers, but I don’t view it the same way.
941	Donald Trump	It was good for us, but I don’t view it the same way because of the horror of this disease that really could have been stopped at the border.
942	George Stephanopoulos	Could you have done more to stop it?
943	Donald Trump	I don’t think so.
944	Donald Trump	I think what I did by closing up the country, I think I saved two, maybe two and a half, maybe more than that lives.
945	Donald Trump	I really don’t think so.
946	Donald Trump	I think we did a very good job.
947	Donald Trump	I don’t know if that’s been recognized.
948	Donald Trump	We’ve made a lot of governors feel good.
949	Donald Trump	We’ve made some, reputationally.
950	Donald Trump	We’ve enhanced their reputation.
951	Donald Trump	They didn’t have anything, we got them the supplies, we got them the ventilators.
952	Donald Trump	We’ve made a lot of people look good that shouldn’t look good to be honest with you.
953	George Stephanopoulos	We’re out of time, Mr. President.
954	George Stephanopoulos	Thank you for your time.
955	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
956	George Stephanopoulos	Thanks to all the questions here and thanks to all of you at home for watching.
957	George Stephanopoulos	Have a good night.
