Tim Kane announced his campaign to the United States Senate, and spoke about Virginia's arrival over the past half century. Kayin, a democracy, said in an interview on April 21 with Wavi TV in Portsmouth: \"I'm excited about Virginia's economic story.\" \"We were close to the bottom of the country 50 years ago in per capita income. We're the top ten now. We were very low in the higher collection rate 50 years ago. We're bigger than the national average now.\" We wondered if Ken was right. Let us begin with his statement on per capita income. It is true that the State is now ranked top ten on this scale. In a report issued on 23 March 2011, the Federal Office for Economic Analysis found per capita income in Virginia in 2010 to be $44,762 - the seventh highest income in the United States. Where did the state rank five decades ago? Figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis show that Virginia had a per capita income of $1,906 in 1960, making it 34 of the 50 states. In 1961, Virginia had a per capita income of $1,975 - the lowest income at 17. Thus, 50 years ago, Virginia was the supreme nation in the lowest third of the country in terms of per capita income. One can argue that having 15 points or so far away from the latter place does not place the State \"near the bottom,\" as Ken has said. Let's move on to Cain's comments on how Virginia's level of higher education has risen in the last half century. The United States Census Bureau estimates from 2005 to 2009 that 33.4 per cent of the population of the Virgin Islands aged 25 years and over received a bachelor &apos; s degree or higher. This was higher than the national average of 27.5 per cent in the age group with at least a bachelor &apos; s degree. So Kane's right that Virginia beats the nation over this procedure. The oldest Dominicans were the sixth highest percentage of the population with a bachelor &apos; s degree or higher than 25 years and older. Now from a historical perspective: A report from the United States Census Bureau researching higher education found that 8.4 per cent of the population of Virginia, aged 25 or over, had obtained at least a Bachelor's degree in 1960. This may seem to be a small number, but in fact it was higher than the national average of 7.7 per cent in that year. Among the states, Virginia had the highest 16 per cent of residents with a bachelor &apos; s degree or later. In short, Virginia &apos; s educational level 50 years ago was not as terrible as Cain &apos; s. In fact, it was very good compared to the rest of the country. To sum up: Ken was quite right in assessing how Virginia is ranked today in per capita income and higher educational attainment. But his allegations about the whereabouts of the old Dominicans 50 years ago have problems. The per capita income in Virginia was already lower than most of its peers five decades ago, but there were about 15 states with lower income levels than in Virginia. It's hard for Ken to say that Virginia was \"near the bottom.\" Virginia was closer to the middle of the bottom. In the area of higher educational attainment, 50 years ago, Virginia was above the national average and most other states in the percentage of its population with a bachelor &apos; s degree or higher. So Kane's statement that the state has a \"very low\" rate of higher educational attainment for 50 years is not working. Cain was right about the present, wrong about the past. Put the parts together, we value his claim half right. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech.
