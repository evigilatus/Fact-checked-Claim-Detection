The Trump speech came almost a week before the anniversary of the shooting on 14 February at the Mariory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, killing 17 people. The legislators invited three parents of the children who died to watch Trump speak. :: Hastings, from the nearby Bointon Beach, called Trump to support arms control, citing a statistical account of the shooting of schools throughout the country. \"In 2018, we endured shooting at school almost once a week,\" Hastings said in a statement to the media. The spokesman for Hastings told us that he had reached the shooting count once a week by citing a database on shooting in schools collected by the Education Week, a national educational publication. Hastings divided a 180-day school year by 24 shootings to one shooting every 7.5 days. It is not clear from Hastings' statement that the basic data combine different types of shooting at school property - everything from random mass shooting to accidental shooting. There is no consensus on how to define shooting at school. Some figures include the shooting in which a person was killed or injured, for example, while others may include only K-12 schools rather than colleges and universities. \"No shooting in two similar schools, and therefore the circumstances of each must be assessed and considered,\" cited in a 2018 report by the Centre for Marine Higher Studies for Defence and Internal Security, which examined more than 20 shooting databases. \"The desire to include or exclude any of these criteria comes with a level of risk by directly influencing the statistical narrative of school shooting.\" According to the school week, the number includes 24 school shootings on the property of the K-12 school that resulted in gunshot injuries or deaths. Shots fired on the school floor during the school or during a school event are also counted. Suicide and self-inflicted injuries are not. Other groups reach higher totals given each time a weapon is fired on the school property. Each country &apos; s weapons safety database, a firearms advocacy group, found at least 102 shooting incidents on school grounds, including K-12 and colleges, in 2018. The Marine Graduate School database found 97 incidents of violence with school pistols in 2018, the largest in any year. In 2018, none of these incidents were just cases where a gun was waved; the gun exploded each time. The Hastings permit on the lower end of these numbers, but that doesn't make it more accurate. The databases combine different types of shooting incidents against school property, and experts provided some key warnings about the Hastings statement and databases on shooting incidents in schools. In a news release on February 1, 2010, Charlie Christ stated that spokesman Rubio supported arms restrictions, which included background checks and waiting periods. \u2022 On 26 February 2010, Jacqueline Schildkrat, Assistant Professor at the Department of Public Justice of the State University of New York in Oswego, said that the Hastings statement had overlooked the context he had been referring to in an academic year. If he shot 24 times in a calendar year, it would have worked in a shooting every two weeks. However, Skelcrot and other experts warned that this was confusing when the mass shootings were associated with other types of shooting in school property - for example, two people got into a fight after a school sports event. Most shootings are not random group shootings like Parkland or Santi Fe. Schildraut said she'd consider about six on list 24 as shooting at school. The database includes incidents such as shooting two people in a fight outside a high school football game, shooting one of the parents when he accidentally fired a weapon in the pocket of one of the parents, and three students were injured when a teacher accidentally shot in a classroom while studying a weapons safety lesson. These different types of shooting require different responses, as Shildraut said. \"We won't assess the threat to everyone going to the football game, but we were on a troubled student,\" she said. While every loss of life through a firearm is too many, \"the way we respond to events must take into account the whole situation and not only was there a gun in school.\" The Education Week recognizes the difficulty of arriving at a methodology. \"A simple definition - and adherence to it - was more difficult than we expected.\" Nine shooting incidents in the 24 schools identified by the Education Week resulted in deaths - or about one incident per month in the academic year. \"In sum, one statement a week can easily be understood without such a clarification,\" said James Alan Fox, a crime scientist at the University of the North-East. While large-scale shootings in schools draw maximum attention, the majority of children and adolescents killed by a rifle are shot elsewhere than in school, as in the home or in the streets. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that school-related homicides consistently account for less than 2 per cent of all youth homicides in the United States when checking data from 1994-2018. Our reign (Histings) said, \"In 2018, we endured shootings at school almost once a week.\" This figure has been reached in view of the shootings in 24 schools documented by the school week and divided into a 180-day school year. (If we apply the same mathematics to a calendar year, it will work for half of that amount.) An account of the number of shooting incidents in schools calls for an explanation of the types of shooting incidents that have been included. The Education Week database contains any K-12 shooting of school property during the school or a school event that resulted in injury or death. This means that it encompasses both random mass shootings as well as other types of incidents such as parking in a parking lot after a football game or accidental shooting. Hastings &apos; s statements are partially accurate, but it omits important details of the database he mentioned. We're assessing this statement half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dc5d9ed9-de94-47fc-a45f-f2af97f71a3", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01036"}
