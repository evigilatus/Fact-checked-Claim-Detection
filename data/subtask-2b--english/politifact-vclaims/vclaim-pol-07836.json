Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat in her first term, is a vocal supporter of raising the national minimum wage to $10.10 over a three- year period and then indexing it to inflation.\nThe issue was on her mind May 8, 2014 during an appearance on the Devil\u2019s Advocates radio show (92.1 FM in Madison).\nBaldwin was discussing the importance of a college education for earning better wages and gaining upward mobility.\n\"I just had to smile during some of these debates we had on the minimum wage and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have again,\" Baldwin said. \"A lot of people pointed to and brushed it aside and said, \u2018These are teenagers.\u2019 \"\nShe added: \u00a0\"First of all, they\u2019re not. The average person who gets the minimum wage in America is 35 years old. That said, even if it involves a lot of people who are young, when we look at the cost of college, don\u2019t we want them to be able to join their parents in helping save some money for that opportunity?\"\nLet\u2019s examine whether Baldwin\u2019s correct that \"the average person who gets the minimum wage in America is 35 years old.\"\nHer press office pointed us to a December 2013 briefing paper by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that has studied the $10.10 proposal.\n\"The workers who would receive a raise do not fit the stereotypes of low-wage workers: Among affected workers, the average age is 35 years old, nearly 88 percent are at least 20 years old, and more than a third (34.5 percent) are at least 40 years old,\" the \u00a0institute\u2019s paper concluded.\nPresident Barack Obama, who is pushing for $10.10, used the same lines -- and evidence -- less than two weeks before Baldwin.\nIn his April 26, 2014 weekly radio address, Obama said:\n\"Right now, there\u2019s a bill that would boost America\u2019s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. That would lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across the country. 28 million. And we\u2019re not just talking about young people on their first job. The average minimum wage worker is 35 years old. They work hard, often in physically demanding jobs.\"\nPolitiFact National rated Obama\u2019s comment about the average age Mostly False.\nBoth Baldwin and Obama were trying to counter wage-hike critics who have said that it\u2019s primarily teenagers who work in minimum-wage positions.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April, we rated Mostly False a claim by the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce that \"typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families.\"\nWe found that by one definition of minimum-wage workers, teenagers make up the largest sub-group compared with other age groupings. But teenagers are less than a third of all minimum wage workers, and hard data is scarce on how many live in middle-class families.\nBaldwin, too, tripped up here.\nShe framed her claim around people currently making the minimum wage.\nBut the EPI study that put the average age at 35 looked at the larger universe of all workers who would receive a raise from the boost to $10.10. Many are making more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, but less than $10.10.\nIn fact, the EPI research also factored in people currently earning up to $11.10, on the theory that those workers would probably also be given raises if the minimum were set at $10.10.\nSo what is the average age of the pool of workers currently at the minimum wage, the group Baldwin mentioned?\nDavid Cooper, who authored the EPI study, put the figure at 30 among those right at the federal minimum, based on his research.\nIt\u2019s not that simple, though, because more than half the U.S. workforce toils in states that have raised the minimum wage above the current federally mandated $7.25, according to Cooper.\nTo address that, Cooper studied the demographics of workers \"at or near their effective state minimum wage,\" defining that as within 3 percent of the minimum-wage level, Cooper told PolitiFact National in April 2014.\nThe average age is 31 in that group, Cooper found.\nOur rating\nBaldwin\u2019s remarks contained an element of truth about the demographics of minimum-wage workers. But the average age of 35 holds for those who would benefit from a change to $10.10, not the group Baldwin spoke of -- current minimum-wage workers.\nWe rate her claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07836"}
