This post\u00a0was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about\u00a0our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe post included\u00a0a popular meme\u00a0that is derived from stills of Drake\u2019s 2015 music video for \"Hotline Bling.\" The meme traditionally features two images of the singer and corresponding text generated by the poster. The idea is to make it appear as though Drake is shunning the first phrase, but welcoming the second.\nIn the post in question, the first phrase is: \"Beto O\u2019Rourke wants to confiscate the guns because he\u2019s a liberal.\"\nThe second, which Drake seems to signal his approval of, reads: \"Beto O\u2019Rourke wants to confiscate guns because he can\u2019t buy one himself due to his criminal record.\"\nThe text of the post says: \"That burglary and DWI will get you every time.\"\nWe\u2019ve looked at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s arrest record in the past, but is he ineligible to purchase a gun, as the post suggests?\nBoth DWI, burglary arrests were dismissed\nO\u2019Rourke was arrested twice in the 1990s \u2014 for, what he describes as, jumping a fence on the campus at the University of Texas at El Paso and for driving while intoxicated.\nHe was first arrested in May 1995 on the UTEP campus for attempted forcible entry, according to\u00a0a copy of the police report\u00a0provided by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign in 2018. The charge fell under the burglary portion of the state penal code,\u00a0section 30.02.\nO\u2019Rourke told the El Paso Times in 2005 that UTEP \"decided not to press charges\" and a LexisNexis background check of O\u2019Rourke shows that the Class B misdemeanor was dismissed.\nIn September 1998, O\u2019Rourke was\u00a0arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated\u00a0in Anthony, a small town outside El Paso.\nA witness told police officers that they observed O\u2019Rourke driving at a high speed before losing control of his car and striking a truck, according to\u00a0a police report of the incident. O\u2019Rourke then attempted to drive away, but the witness stopped him, according to the report.\nLaw enforcement arrived and arrested O\u2019Rourke, recording that he scored a 0.136 and 0.134 on a breathalyzer test, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time.\nO\u2019Rourke was charged with a misdemeanor DWI, but the charge was dismissed after he completed\u00a0a misdemeanor diversion program\u00a0in 1999.\nIn summary: O\u2019Rourke was arrested for two separate misdemeanors in the 1990s, including one for a DWI. Both cases were dismissed.\nO\u2019Rourke could purchase a gun\nThere is no requirement for a person to have a permit or license to purchase rifles and shotguns or handguns in Texas, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s home state. As long as a purchaser is older than 18 and, in certain cases, passes a background check, the person can legally purchase a firearm without a permit. (A permit is required to carry a handgun in public.)\nLicensed-gun dealers are required by federal law to conduct a background check for an individual seeking to purchase a gun if that person does not have a license to carry. But private sellers do not have the same requirement.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal and state laws\u00a0in Texas prevent a person from purchasing and possessing a gun if they have previously been convicted of a felony or convicted of certain misdemeanors related to domestic assault.\nCertain people with a history of mental illness are also barred from purchasing a gun.\nO\u2019Rourke would be able to purchase a gun, since he was not convicted of burglary or of driving while intoxicated \u2014 both charges were dismissed.\nEven if he had been convicted, neither charge would prevent him from legally purchasing and possessing a firearm today, since they were both misdemeanor offenses unrelated to domestic violence and were resolved more than five years ago.\nO\u2019Rourke could also obtain a gun license\nMisdemeanor DWI offenses play a more significant role when it comes to obtaining a license to carry in Texas.\nState law allows for people, not including those in the prohibited categories outlined above, to possess a handgun in their home or in their car without a license to carry. People can also carry rifles and shotguns in public without a permit.\nIn order to purchase a gun without a background check and to carry a handgun in public, a person must obtain a license to carry from the state.\nRequirements for obtaining such a license\u00a0are more stringent than those for simply purchasing a gun.\nMost important in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s case is a requirement that a person is not currently facing charges for \"a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense\" and a requirement that an individual \"has not, in the five years preceding the date of application, been convicted of a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense.\"\nThe law also states that a person is not eligible to receive a license to carry if the person has been \"convicted two times within the 10-year period preceding the date on which the person applies for a license of an offense of the grade of Class B misdemeanor or greater that involves the use of alcohol or a controlled substance as a statutory element of the offense.\"\nO\u2019Rourke was arrested on a burglary charge in 1995, a misdemeanor offense that was dismissed. He was arrested for DWI in 1998, a misdemeanor offense that also was dismissed after he completed a diversion\u00a0program.\nNeither arrest, taken separately or together, would prevent him from obtaining a license to carry a gun under Texas law.\n\"He has no convictions on his record, so there is zero collateral consequence, vis-\u00e0-vis his ability to get a gun license,\" said Steve Toland, an Austin-based defense attorney who handles DWI cases.\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety, which administers the licensing program, lists answers to frequently asked questions on its website, including one about how dismissed charges affect eligibility.\n\"If charges were dismissed without prosecution, then they are not disqualifying,\" the post reads.\nIf O\u2019Rourke\u2019s misdemeanor DWI had not been dismissed and he had been convicted, he would still be eligible to apply for a gun license today, since more than five years have passed.\nHad O\u2019Rourke applied for a license after his arrests, when the charges were still pending, he would not have been eligible for a gun license. But since he was not convicted of either charge, he would have been eligible for a license once his cases had been dismissed.\nOur Ruling\nA Facebook post circulating after the Democratic debate said that O\u2019Rourke can\u2019t buy a gun \"due to his criminal record.\"\nO\u2019Rourke was arrested for two misdemeanors in the 1990s \u2014 for burglary and DWI. Both cases were dismissed and he was not convicted of either charge.\nO'Rourke could have passed a gun-purchase background check and obtained a license to carry once the charges were dismissed. Even if he had been convicted of these charges, he still could purchase a gun today.\nWe rate this claim False.\n\nFALSE: The statement is not accurate", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00150"}
