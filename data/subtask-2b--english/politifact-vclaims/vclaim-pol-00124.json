Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 .\"\nWe decided to fact-check whether the Ukrainian prosecutor enjoyed the positive reputation Trump claimed. The notion that Shokin was widely seen as a \"very good\" and \"very fair prosecutor\" is inconsistent with our findings.\nShokin\u2019s reputation\nTrump\u2019s claim requires some additional context. In his phone call with Zelenksy, Trump never referred to Shokin by name. But the context of the call, including his remarks about Biden, seems to make clear that Shokin is who Trump had in mind. In fact, by the time he resigned, he was widely considered corrupt and ineffective.\nThe White House did not respond to our request for comment and for information that would support this positive view of Shokin\u2019s tenure. We also independently looked for affirmative reviews of Shokin\u2019s work and weren\u2019t able to find anything substantive or specific.\u00a0\nTrump and Zelensky discussed the possibility of reviving a dormant Ukrainian government investigation into a Ukrainian energy company that Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, served as a board member on while his father was vice president. (See our related fact-check.)\nTrump\u2019s reference to the Ukrainian prosecutor being \"shut down\" is an apparent reference to Shokin\u2019s ouster in 2016, which then-Vice President Joe Biden helped orchestrate.\u00a0\nBiden had assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine amid a popular revolution that in early 2014 led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Shokin became top prosecutor\u00a0after Yanukovych went into exile. A frustrated Biden in Dec. 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin\u00a0was fired. According to Biden, it worked.\u00a0\nDuring an event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018, the former vice president made the following remarks, which at points were accompanied by laughter from the audience:\n\"I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team \u2026 that we should be providing for loan guarantees \u2026 And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro) Poroshenko and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn\u2019t. ...\n\"They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, ... we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, \u2018You have no authority. You\u2019re not the president.\u2019 \u2026 I said, call him. I said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. ... I looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\"\n(We\u2019ll note that this transcript shows that Trump mischaracterized Biden\u2019s remarks when he told Zelensky in their call that \"Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution\" into the company his son was involved in. Biden bragged about getting rid of an ineffective prosecutor, not stopping an investigation.)\nTrump\u2019s boasts about Shokin \u2014 that he was widely seen as a \"very good\" and \"very fair prosecutor\" \u2014\u00a0 clash with the view of many Western leaders and institutions. Largely, they were united in seeking Shokin\u2019s removal.\u00a0\nWhen Shokin was sacked on March 26, 2016, press reports explicitly linked his ouster to corruption. Here\u2019s how the New York Times described it:\nMOSCOW \u2014 Bowing to pressure from international donors, the Ukrainian Parliament voted on Tuesday to remove a prosecutor general who had clung to power for months despite visible signs of corruption.\u00a0\nIn fairness, the Times\u2019 also said experts on Ukrainian politics said Shokin \"had played an important role in balancing competing political interests, helping maintain stability during a treacherous era in the divided country\u2019s history.\"\nBut strong Western opposition to Shokin was well established prior to his ouster.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, in early 2016, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said that \"it\u2019s hard to see how the I.M.F.-supported program can continue\" unless corruption prosecutions accelerate.\nSteven Pifer is a career foreign service officer who was ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton and deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs under President George W. Bush. Pifer told PolitiFact that \"virtually everyone\" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine \"felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired. As far as I can recall, they all concurred with the vice president telling Poroshenko that the U.S. government would not extend the $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine until Shokin was removed from office.\"\nThis view is reflected in a Sept. 2015 speech that then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, delivered in Odessa, Ukraine (emphasis ours):\n\"There is one glaring problem that threatens all of the good work that regional leaders here in Odessa, in Kharkiv, in Lviv, and elsewhere are doing to improve the business climate and build a new model of government that serves the people,\" Pyatt said, later adding, \"That obstacle is the failure of the institution of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine to successfully fight internal corruption. Rather than supporting Ukraine\u2019s reforms and working to root out corruption, corrupt actors within the Prosecutor General\u2019s office are making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform.\"\u00a0\nAnders \u00c5slund, a resident senior fellow at Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, agreed that criticism of Shokin was widespread.\n\"Shokin was perceived as utterly corrupt and very close to President Poroshenko,\" \u00c5slund said. \"His corruption was exposed by his two young and obviously honest deputies\" who were forced out.\nThe case that attracted the most negative attention to Shokin involved the arrest of a Kyiv city prosecutor, \u00c5slund said. During the arrest, authorities seized several million dollars worth of diamonds at the prosecutor\u2019s home. Not only did Shokin release the prosecutor, but he also returned his diamonds.\n\"The steady complaint was that Shokin blocked all attempts to have the Yanukovych crooks arrested or any of the billions they had stolen recovered,\" \u00c5slund said. \"Shokin successfully blocked any asset recovery, and he did so in a very blatant fashion.\"\nDomestically, Shokin\u2019s corruption was the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of repeated street protests organized by anti-corruption activists.\nAs news of Trump\u2019s interaction with Zelenksy made headlines in recent weeks, Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a leading anti-corruption voice in Ukraine, began to tweet images and videos of 2015 protests against Shokin.\u00a0\nOne photograph she posted, from July 2015, showed a protest before the prosecutor general's office to demand Shokin resign \"because of his corruption, attacks on reformers and failure to investigate corruption of Yanukivych associates.\" (The photograph is similar to photographs in the Associated Press database of the same event on the same date.)\u00a0\nThis is July 24, 2015.

Far from it. Many Western leaders and institutions were largely united in seeking Shokin\u2019s removal. Domestically, he was \"likely one of the most unpopular figures in Ukraine\" over his reputation for corruption, the subject of popular street protests.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate this claim False.\nRELATED STORY:\u00a0Donald Trump said European nations have not put money into Ukraine.
