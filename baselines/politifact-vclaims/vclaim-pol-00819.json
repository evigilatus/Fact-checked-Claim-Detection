Today is no different. A new post we first\u00a0saw on April 1 has people questioning whether special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation was leaked.\n\"CBS, CNN report that full Mueller report has been leaked,\" reads the text of the post accompanying an image of what looks like the first page of an official federal document, complete with a Department of Justice seal, and the title: \"Report from the Special Counsel Investigation into Russian Interference During and Before the 2016 Presidential Election.\"\nThe post, which was published on the Facebook page San Diego Rostra on April 1, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe couldn\u2019t find any coverage of a report leak on CBS or CNN\u2019s websites. But following a link from the Facebook post leads to a story on the website San Diego Rostra, where the site\u2019s authors and outside contributors publish their opinions.\nThe story, written by the a website administrator under the name \"Thor\u2019s Assistant,\" provides a link to the report that it says \"an anonymous source uploaded.\" \u00a0\nAnyone hoping for details about Mueller\u2019s thoughts on allegations that President Donald Trump obstructed justice will be disappointed. The \"report\" makes no mention of the obstruction, Russia or even Trump. Instead, you\u2019ll find the lyrics to \"All Star,\" a 1999 song by the band Smash Mouth.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll let lead vocalist Steve Harwell sing us out.\n\n\"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me\nI ain\u2019t the sharpest tool in the shed\nShe was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb\nIn the shape of an \"L\" on her forehead\"\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire!\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2019-04-02 15:06:48 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  The Mueller report was leaked.
