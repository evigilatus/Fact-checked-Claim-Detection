They weren\u2019t confident at all they weren\u2019t being provocative to Moscow.\nAnd secondly I noticed the Russians didn\u2019t wear uniforms when they came in (to Ukraine).\nBoth sides seem to be aware that this is going to go on for a while and they\u2019re hedging their bets a bit. It\u2019s fascinating. The insiders seem to know that this isn\u2019t going to be over for a while.\nWe were interested in Matthews' claim that \"The Russians didn\u2019t wear uniforms when they came in\" to Ukraine.\nOver the weekend, reporters for the New York Times, Reuters and Guardian wrote of Russia unloading troops in the Crimea region of Ukraine, a peninsula that includes many people who identify themselves as Russian. Crimea was part of the Soviet Union until 1954, when Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave the territory to Ukraine (more history in this fact-check). Russia maintains a military base in the Sevastopol under a post-Soviet breakup treaty between Russia and Ukraine.\nNews outlets wrote of Russian-speaking, armed soldiers unloaded from armored vehicles whose service uniforms \"bore no insignia\" though their vehicles featured Russian military plates of the country\u2019s Black Sea force. The troops \"swarmed the major thoroughfares of Crimea,\" wrote the New York Times, shutting down the area\u2019s main airport and surrounding government buildings.\nDespite their lack of traditional military ID, \"there was no doubt among residents they were deployed from the nearby Russian base to take up position outside a Ukrainian border guard base,\" Reuters wrote. The Guardian estimates 16,000 \"pro-Russian troops\" are controlling Crimea and blockading Ukrainian bases.\nIn a March 4 news conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin denied Russian troops were occupying Crimea as he said that Russia would only resort to military action \"for the protection of the Ukrainian people.\" Putin chastised the U.S. government for interfering in Ukraine\u2019s affairs like a scientist with rats.\n\"There are many military uniforms. Go into any local shop and you can find one,\" Putin said of the so-called pro-Russia \"local defense forces,\" according to a translation in the Times.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign journalists have challenged Putin\u2019s claims, often just by asking talkative, possibly bored soldiers if they are Russian military. Guardian Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker tweeted the soldiers were \"forced to keep up \u2018volunteer\u2019 charade,\" though one \"chatty chap\" admitted he was from Russia \"to defend against \u2018terror\u2019 \" in a video.\nExperts we consulted said there\u2019s no doubting the troops are Russian.\n\"It\u2019s clear these are Russian special forces in terms of their performance and in terms of their bearing,\" said Ariel Cohen, a senior research fellow in Russian and Eurasian studies at the Heritage Foundation.\nCohen said he was born in Crimea and has friends there who have told him the military men have identified themselves as Russian elite troops.\nSo why wouldn\u2019t Putin say so? Or why won\u2019t Russian soldiers wear patches identifying them as Russian? Plausible deniability, Cohen said.\n\"Russians can still deny these are forces that are working under their direction, so it may facilitate walking this back,\" Cohen said.\nThere would be nothing new for Russian special forces to be out of uniform in Crimea in an effort to blend in with the locals, said Lance Janda, chairman of Cameron University's Department of History and Government, adding the U.S. military does that to operate secretly as well. But since it\u2019s cold over there, he is also seeing pictures of Russian soldiers bundled up in winter clothes, which are less likely to have unit insignias than combat uniforms, he said.\n\"It's also possible that they were ordered to take off unit insignias in order to either confuse the Ukrainians initially or to try and appear a bit less threatening,\" Janda said. \"In any case, I think it's an overstatement to stay the Russians were not wearing military uniforms. The safer, more accurate statement would be that some Russian soldiers appear to have not been wearing uniforms.\"\nJanda said the size of the Russian military presence in Crimea \"has surely been augmented\" since the original reports of 16,000. From a distance, it\u2019s hard to tell.\nJanda agrees with Matthews\u2019 overall assertion that neither side wants a war, and the Russians \"are going in as \u2018light\u2019 as they can. ... They just aren't going to risk losing access to the Crimea.\"\nOur ruling\nMatthews said, \"the Russians didn\u2019t wear uniforms when they came in\" to Ukraine. To be certain, they are wearing uniforms. But we think a reasonable person would infer Matthews\u00a0 was talking about uniforms that identified them as Russians.\nThat does require a bit of clarification.
