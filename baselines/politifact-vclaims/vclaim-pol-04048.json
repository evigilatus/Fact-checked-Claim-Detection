He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them.\"\nHas Trump said he would first check who\u2019s making payments before defending them?\nIn media interviews, he has said there\u2019s no obligation to defend them if they don\u2019t pay up. Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\nNATO and unfulfilled \u2018obligations\u2019\nClinton is talking about Trump\u2019s comments about NATO during the campaign.\nNATO, founded after World War II by the United States and 11 other members, now has 28 members, all agreeing to use political and military means to safeguard members\u2019 freedom and security.\nArticle 5 of the Washington Treaty -- NATO\u2019s founding treaty -- says parties agree that an attack against one shall be considered an attack against all, and agree to assist members who are attacked. NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time after the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States.\nTo back Clinton\u2019s claim, her campaign directed us to a July 2016 New York Times interview with Trump on foreign policy. Trump was asked about defending small Baltic States that have recently joined NATO against Russia, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\"Mr. Trump said that if Russia attacked them, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing if those nations have 'fulfilled their obligations to us,'\u00a0\" the New York Times reported.\nAccording to a transcript of the interview with the New York Times, Trump also said many NATO members \"aren\u2019t paying their bills.\"\nReporter David E. Sanger: \"That\u2019s true, but we are treaty-obligated under NATO, forget the bills part.\"\nTrump: \"You can\u2019t forget the bills. They have an obligation to make payments. Many NATO nations are not making payments, are not making what they\u2019re supposed to make. That\u2019s a big thing. You can\u2019t say forget that.\"\nSanger: \"My point here is, can the members of NATO, including the new members in the Baltics, count on the United States to come to their military aid if they were attacked by Russia? And count on us fulfilling our obligations \u2014\"\nTrump: \"Have they fulfilled their obligations to us? If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporter Maggie Haberman: \"And if not?\"\nTrump: \"Well, I\u2019m not saying if not. I\u2019m saying, right now there are many countries that have not fulfilled their obligations to us.\"\nSo in that interview, Trump argued other NATO countries had to \"fulfill their obligations\" to receive the United States\u2019 military aid. Asked to clarify what would happen to countries who hadn\u2019t paid, he demurred.\nIn May 2016, Trump also told the Wall Street Journal that when other NATO nations \"don\u2019t pay up, they\u2019ve backed out of their obligations, then we no longer have an obligation to defend them.\"\nTrump said he did not want to get out of NATO, but wanted \"the countries of NATO to pay us.\"\nThere\u2019s a problem with the way Trump has talked about NATO country payments.\n\"No one in NATO actually \u2018pays us\u2019 to defend them, as Trump repeatedly claims, nor is there any obligation to do so,\" said Ivo H. Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who previously served as ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama.\n\"Our commitment to come to our allies' defense -- and theirs to ours -- isn't in return for any payment,\" Daalder said. \"It is an unconditional treaty obligation every ally entered into freely when they signed the North Atlantic Treaty.\"\nNATO allies pay into military and civilian budgets on the basis of agreed cost shares, said Jeff Rathke, senior fellow and deputy director of the Europe Program at Center for Strategic and International Studies. And to be clear, funds are paid to NATO, not to the United States.\nBeyond the common funding of certain capabilities, each NATO ally is also responsible for spending on its own defense, said Rathke, who served on NATO\u2019s International Staff from 2009 to 2011. Allies are to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, though many are not meeting the guideline.\nJorge Benitez, director of NATOSource at the Atlantic Council, says if Trump were elected president and decided not to help defend a NATO ally under attack, \"it would be the end of NATO.\"\n\"This would be a very damaging blow to U.S. national security and would also hurt our alliances in other parts of the world,\" Benitez said.\nOur ruling\nClinton said when Trump was asked if he would defend our allies, \"He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them.\"\nTrump has raised questions about other NATO nations not paying their fair share for defense. In a New York Times interview, Trump was asked if he would defend NATO members against an attack by Russia, and he said \"if they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes.\"\nTrump also told the Wall Street Journal that if allies \"don\u2019t pay up, they\u2019ve backed out of their obligations, then we no longer have an obligation to defend them.\"\nWe rate Clinton\u2019s statement True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc782919-03c6-40c7-b854-2f9c766e1198", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04048"}
