Red bumps appear to cover his flank and other sections of his torso.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

That\u2019s because the photo is from 2014 and shows a migrant suffering from scabies.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on January 20, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO admits their testing grossly overstates individuals testing positive for COVID.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we noted in a November fact-check that claimed the photo shows \"diseases coming across the border,\" U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar shared the original image with the Houston Chronicle that year. He also shared other photos that showed cramped and unsanitary conditions in a Customs and Border Protections facility in South Texas.\nThe photo that continues to be shared on Facebook shows a man with scabies, a treatable skin condition that can spread rapidly under crowded conditions. That particular outbreak was largely contained to migrants living in close quarters in detention centers, though a small handful of border patrol agents appeared to have contracted it.\nThere is some evidence that diseases cross the border, but the Centers for Disease Control attributes that spread to legal crossings between the United States and Mexico, not illegal immigration.\nWe rate this Facebook post as Pants on Fire.\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2019-04-10 18:30:31 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  A photograph shows an undocumented immigrant with smallpox.
