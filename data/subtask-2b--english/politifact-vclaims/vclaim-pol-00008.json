But is the restaurant also \"funding\" President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign?\nThat\u2019s what one viral Facebook post claims:\n\"Olive Garden is funding Trump's re-election in 2020. It would be terrible if you shared this and Olive Garden lost business.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nBut it isn\u2019t true. A quick Google search into the rumor turns up several news articles and fact-checks that debunk the claim. We also previously fact-checked an Instagram post that inaccurately included Olive Garden on a list of companies that allegedly donated to President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\nThe rumors started to circulate on social media in late August after that list went viral. Shortly after a #BoycottOliveGarden hashtag began trending on Twitter, the restaurant\u2019s official account stepped in:\n\"We don\u2019t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates.\"\nWe don\u2019t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Olive Garden (@olivegarden) August 26, 2019 \nWhen a user responded to the tweet and asked whether Olive Garden\u2019s parent company, Darden Restaurants, donated to PACs, the restaurant responded that Darden \"does not donate to any federal or presidential candidates.\" Darden owns multiple restaurant chains, including LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, Cheddar\u2019s and The Capital Grille.\nWe went to OpenSecrets.org, a campaign finance database run by the Center for Responsive Politics research group, to examine the numbers.\nThe database shows that Darden Restaurants itself has not donated to Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, nor has it made any contributions during the 2020 election cycle. (The same goes for the 2018 and 2016 election cycles.)\nThat\u2019s because corporations are prohibited from making contributions to candidates and party committees, according to the Federal Election Commission. Open Secrets includes a similar disclaimer that reads: \"Organizations themselves cannot contribute to candidates and party committees. Totals include subsidiaries and affiliates.\"\nBut donations can be made from PACs affiliated with the company, from the organization\u2019s employees, owners or those individuals\u2019 immediate family members. All the money associated with Darden that\u2019s been donated so far in the 2020 cycle has come from individuals, the database shows. Those donations have totaled $17,332, with $11,899 of that going to candidates, all of them Democrats, and $5,000 going to a PAC that says it supports Democratic leadership. Trump is not among the recipients so far, according to the database.\nIn recent election cycles, however, contributions associated with the organization went to both Republican and Democratic candidates and committees, and came from both individuals and PACs. In the 2016 election, individuals affiliated with Darden \u2013 again, not the organization itself \u2013 donated $8,407 to Hillary Clinton and $886 to Donald Trump.\nOur ruling\nA viral Facebook post claims that Olive Garden is \"funding\" Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\nHowever, campaign finance data shows that Olive Garden\u2019s parent company, Darden Restaurants, has not donated to Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. Corporations are prohibited from making contributions to campaigns or party committees. Meanwhile, PAC\u2019s associated with the company, as well as individual employees and their family members, have made contributions to both Democratic and Republican candidates.\u00a0\nThis rumor is wrong.
