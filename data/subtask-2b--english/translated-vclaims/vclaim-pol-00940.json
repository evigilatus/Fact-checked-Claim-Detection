Omar, who took her seat two months ago, was one of two newly elected Muslim women in Congress, and her comments on Israel attracted formal and informal reactions. In one case, she said that support for Israel in Congress was \"everything about Benjamin.\" It had approved a Republican proposal to condemn anti-Semitism, widely regarded as a criticism of its suspension, and had approved resolution 424.0 of the House of Representatives and apologized. After a few weeks, Omar said in a public event, \"I want to talk about political influence in this country, which says it's okay to press for loyalty to a foreign country.\" This led, with the democratic leadership of the House of Representatives, to the pursuit of another vote condemning anti-Semitism. In the midst of the controversy, Omar became a target for maintaining social media. One photo read: \"Obama settled 43,000 Somali refugees in Minnesota. In 2016, there were about 80,000. No wonder Elehan Omar was elected. It was planned.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Minneapolis region is one of the largest, if not largest, centres of Somali Americans in the country, many of whom have come as refugees. She came to the United States as a refugee in 1995. However, the job is wrong on multiple levels. Did Obama settle 43,000 Somali refugees in Minnesota? For refugee resettlement figures in front of Obama, we have moved to an interactive site from the Refugee Processing Centre that provides data dating back to 2002. As indicated, 6,320 refugees from Somalia were resettled in Minnesota between 2009 and 2017, when Obama held the post of President. This is equivalent to about seven times the amount claimed in MIM. This number is lower than the number settled in Minnesota during the last seven years of George W. Bush &apos; s presidency. From 2002 to 2008, the Government resettled 9,858 Somalis in Minnesota. During the years of Obama, 54,514 Somali refugees were resettled nationwide, meaning that Minnesota accounted for 11.5 per cent of the national total. During the years of Bush, the national total was 46.439, making the share of Minnesota under Bush higher than in Obama, at 21.2 per cent. Is there some 80,000 refugees in Minnesota? There are not even 80,000 Somalis living in Minnesota -- well below 80,000 Somali refugees living there, according to the United States Census Bureau. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" \u2022 19 January 2021, according to five-year estimates, between 42,400 and 55,200 Somalis live in Minnesota, between 13,000 and 16,500 households. \"The numbers vary, largely because of a lack of population and secondary migration that may not properly document people,\" said Stephanie Chambers, a political scientist at Trinity College who studied American Somali society in the United States. Did Omar win because of the Somali-American vote? Omar won the democratic nomination with 65,237 votes, which was 24,081 before her closest rival. (In such a strong democratic region, the Republican candidate ended up losing to age, 78 per cent to 22 per cent. So were the Somali-American voters in the region the main reason they won the important first? We don't have exact numbers, but we managed to reverse the engineering of some of the answers. According to the refugee resettlement data, we found that the main jurisdictions of the Fifth District - especially Minneapolis, but also a few - received nearly half of the Somali refugees resettled in the State under Bush and Obama. If we use the high end of the state census office estimates for Somali Americans in Minnesota -- 55200 -- that means that the fifth district was probably home to about 27,600 Somali Americans. So Omar won over 65,000 initial votes in a county that was likely to have about 27,600 Somali Americans. That means she won tens of thousands of votes without Somales. Even this may overestimate the influence of the Somali American electorate. Not all 27,600 Somalis in the province were able to vote, as the Somali population of Minnesota distorts young people. In addition, even those who were eligible to vote may not appear in the ballot boxes. Only 18.8 per cent of the population voted at the primary level in the province as a whole. If the Somali population in the province had become at this rate, there would not have been more than 5,000 Somali voters who had cast their initial votes. And 5,000 votes could have been less than one tenth of the total primary age vote, and only about one fifth of its margin of victory. Was her victory \"planned \"? The idea that Omar's victory was estimated for demography is absurd. No voters of the fifth congressional district of Minnesota were forced to vote for Omar. As we have pointed out, the pattern of the Somali settlement in Minnesota was long before Obama's term in the White House. Therefore, the viral image has no basis for Obama's separation. Our verdict in the viral picture said, \"Obama settled 43,000 Somali refugees in Minnesota. In 2016, there were about 80,000. No wonder Elehan Omar was elected. It was planned.\" The number of Somali refugees settled in the Obama era in Minnesota, the total number of Somali refugees in the state, and the impact that Somali voters could have had on the results of the initial elections, let alone the unbalanced general elections, are greatly overstated by the Miima. In no case can the victory of Omar be \"planed,\" by Obama or anyone else. We value the pants statement on the fire.
