It's happening again in the race in the Fifth Oregon District of Congress. \"My opponent seems to still believe in the same old direction as George Bush, the privatization of social security,\" a flammable claim that some voters may believe that they will be at the mercy of the unpredictable stock market as they retire. Many voters, especially older persons who depend on social security and who vote in large numbers, would not be happy if they thought that the safety net they cherish would be less certain. Schrader is just one of a large number of democratic candidates who talk about social security and suggest that the Republicans will leave the elderly stuck. But is his claim accurate? First, there is a need for a small background. Social security is a pension and disability programme that is fully guaranteed and funded by the United States Government. This means that if you qualify for benefits, the cheque will be delivered without failure every month, as was the case since 1935 when Congress established social security. It is a very popular programme that currently provides benefits to 53.4 million people. But it has a huge budget and it only becomes more expensive as the population grows older, more people qualify for benefits, and fewer workers are left to bear the cost. Here the Association summarizes this dilemma: \"The Budget Bureau of Congress estimates that the reserve fund and salary taxes will cover the full payment of benefits until 2037.\" In 2005, President George W. Bush devoted part of his State of the Union address to a plan that would give workers under 55 the option of converting up to 4 per cent of their salary taxes into personal accounts. Private investment could yield better returns while easing some of the financial pressures on social security. The proposal died because most Democrats opposed it, as some Republicans did. Critics said that unscrupulous financial advisers would charge huge fees and that the unpredictability of the stock market could limit millions of older persons to the pension nest egg on which they depended. That leads us to 2010 and Schrader vs. Brown. Schrader &apos; s claim is based on the comments made by Bron over the years, including a letter dated 22 October 1996 addressed to the editor published in The Origonian. \"We can address this problem through the growth of the economy and slowly converting contributions into private investment, which will gain a much higher rate of return,\" he wrote. Today, it takes a little less than a muscular and more accurate look. In the case section of his campaign website, Brown explicitly states that \"it does not support the full privatization of social security.\" At the same time, workers will be allowed \"the option to invest part\" of their salary taxes in private accounts. This is basically the same idea that was destroyed and burned in 2006. 'I am committed to seeking bilateral solutions to this challenge, and I am eager to consider any proposal that would protect social security benefits for older persons today without increasing taxes. I do not support the full privatization of social security for younger workers, but I believe that the option of investing part of their salary taxes in conservatively managed private equity accounts should be an option for future social security beneficiaries, \"Brown says on his website. What about Schrader's claim that Brown still seems to believe in the same old direction George Bush once had, which is privatization of social security? It appears that Brunn is proposing an approach similar to that of Bush in that it will allow younger workers to start investing part of social security taxes in a series of government funds. But that's a long way from privatizing the entire social security that Brown said he didn't support. If he follows Bush, Bron won't change anything for workers aged 55 and over. They will not be able to choose a personal account. For younger workers (under 55 in the Bush Plan), the possibility of creating a personal retirement account would be entirely optional -- one could choose to remain in the traditional system run by the government and to receive benefits as promised. According to the spokesman for Bron Ali Lokman, Brun did not propose a specific age limit for workers wishing to contribute to private funds. He only says \"younger workers.\" There is no question that if he is elected to Congress, Bron will vote to privatize social security partially. But Schrader is exaggerating, suggesting that Bron wants to privatize the entire system. That's simply not the case, and that's why we're evaluating his claim half right. Rob Cornells mentioned on January 10, 2012, in the Rob Cornells debate, he challenged for two years a news story in which he said that he would interrupt social security and medical care programmes before reducing the defense budget in the United States. \u2022 January 14, 2012, comment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00306"}
