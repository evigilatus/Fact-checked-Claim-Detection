(Doug) Ducey wants to use public, taxpayer dollars to increase the salaries of private prison guards,\" the Democrats wrote in a June 20 blog post. \"Guards employed by a multi-billion dollar company that made nearly $140 million in profits last year.\"\nWhile the state wants to purchase the prison, they want a private company -- GEO Group -- to continue to manage it.\nDoes the sale include a raise for the private corrections workers?\nAcronym soup\nThe history of the Kingman prison is a bit complicated, and filled with companies with strange names, so we\u2019ll take it slow.\nThe prison was opened in August 2004 as part of a plan by Gov. Janet Napolitano to build more inmate beds using the private sector. As part of the original agreement, the state was scheduled to pay off the construction of the facility over 20 years and then take ownership.\nUntil the state\u2019s debt was paid off, a non-profit, Mohave Prison LLC, was created to own the prison.\nManagement and Training Corporation, a Utah-based private prison operator, was originally contracted to manage Kingman. However, after multiple inmate riots in July 2015, the state fired MTC, and GEO Group assumed their contract.\nGEO Group is one of the largest private prison operators in the country. The Florida-based company manages more than 60 correctional facilities nationwide.\nNow Ducey and others in the state want to buy the Kingman prison early as part of what they say is a cost-saving measure. According to the proposal, the state owning the prison would save taxpayers more than $70 million and reduce the per-prisoner cost from $60.10 to $40.37 a day \u2014 a savings of more than 30 percent. Buying the prison nine years early would allow the state to refinance and reduce the amount of interest paid on the facility, the state says.\nThe plan was approved by the state Legislature for fiscal year 2017 and is expected to be implemented sometime in the \"next few months,\" according to Department of Corrections spokesman Andrew Wilder.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan would include raises \nIf the purchase goes through as expected, the state would officially own the prison, but it would still be managed by the GEO Group.\nAs part of the plan, the state would offer $2 million to increase the salaries of the GEO Group workers. Keely Varvel, chief of staff for the Arizona House Democrats, pointed us to page 18 of the proposed purchase plan, which says that $2 million is intended \"to increase starting salaries for correctional officers and improve retention.\"\nBut there\u2019s a big caveat: The $2 million in annual expenses would be offset by the $8 million in annual savings the state would incur for buying the prison.\nPablo Paez, a spokesman for the GEO Group, called the Democrats\u2019 claim an \"unfair characterization.\" He said the proposal allows for \"significant savings for taxpayers overall,\" while providing additional resources for staff wages. In essence, Paez said, Democrats are focusing on one side of the ledger -- money spent increasing salaries -- while ignoring the larger cost savings.\nThe average\u00a0salary for a state correctional officer is $36,800. Under this plan, Kingman correctional officers would see\u00a0a 13 percent raise, from $29,453\u00a0to an average salary\u00a0of $33,300. That\u2019s still less than the state average\u00a0and well under the national average of $45,320, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nDaniel Scarpinato, a spokesman with Ducey\u2019s office, said the overall plan, besides saving money, allows the state to \"invest in ensuring public safety.\"\nOur ruling\nArizona House Democrats said, \"Gov. Ducey wants to use public, taxpayer dollars to increase the salaries of private prison guards.\"\nThat\u2019s literally accurate.\nThe state contracts with GEO Group to manage the Kingman prison in question, but GEO pays its correctional officers. And if the state purchases Kingman, it would use $2 million for raises for the prison staff.\nThe major caveat is those raises\u00a0would be more-than-offset by money the state says it will save with the purchase of the Kingman facility.\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b727fd22-c36b-4f91-ad5f-87aa110b8c1a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04760"}
