Meat plants can\u2019t operate without USDA inspection.\nThe last three slaughterhouses in the United States (two in Texas and one in Illinois) closed in 2007, one year after the ban.\nThe ban was part of the\u00a0annual USDA funding bill and was renewed a year at a time until it expired in 2011.\nIn 2011, Congress lifted the five-year-old ban on funding horse meat inspections in a spending bill that former President Barack Obama signed into law. The bill didn\u2019t allocate any new money for inspections, but activists worried that it might eventually lead to sales of horse meat.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Newstarget story\u2019s origin is likely from an actual 2012 incident when a New Mexico meat plant received federal approval to slaughter horses for meat, which was met with opposition from many animal rights groups.\nThe USDA stated that it was required by law to issue a \"grant of inspection\" to Valley Meat Co. of New Mexico, because it had met all federal requirements.\nWhile Valley Meat Co. planned to process horse meat for human consumption in Europe and other export markets, as well as sell it for animal feed at U.S. zoos, there is no evidence that they sold the meat for consumption in the United States.\nMore recently, a bipartisan ban on slaughtering horses for meat has been included in a spending bill that President Donald Trump signed in March of this year.\nThe renewed ban on will continue at least until Oct. 1 when the funding bill expires.\nOur ruling\nAn article said that the USDA approved slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption.
