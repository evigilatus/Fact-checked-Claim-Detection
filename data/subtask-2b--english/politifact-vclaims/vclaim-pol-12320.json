It showed several sprawling districts winding through multiple counties to create solid GOP majorities. \u00a0\n\nPrepared by Republicans staffers, the congressional map redrew Ohio\u2019s 18 congressional districts into 16 districts \u2014 12 Republican and four Democratic districts. It was attacked by Redfern (and other Democrats) who said the serpentine districts were mapped out purely for GOP partisan advantage.\n\nAs he mocked the lines drawn by Republicans, Redfern highlighted the district that many independent observers found to be the clearest example of gerrymandering \u2014 the 15th Congressional District, which winds through portions of 13 counties and has a circumference of 934 miles.\n\nNow represented by Republican Steve Stivers, the district is shaped like the open jaws of a crocodile or a \"reverse Pac-man,\" in Redfern\u2019s words.\n\n\"To drive from northern Union County to Athens to Hillsboro without leaving Steve\u2019s district you\u2019d find yourself on the road as long as it would take to drive from Columbus to Niagara Falls,\" Redfern told reporters at his news conference.\n\nSure, the district is a sprawling one \u2014 but a greater drive time than to the Canadian border? PolitiFact Ohio gassed up the Ford Factfinder and see where the facts met the road.\n\nDemocratic Party spokesman Seth Bringman shared the Google mapping he did to back up Redfern\u2019s assertion.\n\nHe forwarded a route which began in Essex in northern Union County winding through Madison, Franklin, Fairfield, and Perry Counties as it headed east. Heading due south into Athens County, the route then swung westward traveling though Vinton and Ross counties to end in Hillsboro, the county seat of Highland County.\n\nGoogle maps spit out a total distance of 259 miles and said it would take nearly 6 hours \u2014 5 hours and 58 minutes to traverse it. Meanwhile, Columbus to Niagara Falls, N.Y., is 349 miles -- mostly via freeway -- and a traveling time of six hours and one minute, according to Google Maps.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio scrutinized the Democratic route and it does follow the contours of Stivers\u2019 new district. However, the Democrats did fudge one tiny part of their route \u2014 they took state routes through southern Franklin County that are near, but not actually in Stivers\u2019 district.\n\nBut they had to. Or you\u2019d have to swim.\n\n\"It\u2019s so skinny at the southern edge of Franklin County that no road passes through it,\" The Columbus Dispatch reported Sept. 18, 2011. \"He would have to swim across the Scioto River near the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant to travel from one end of his district to the other.\"\n\nBringman acknowledged that the map was more of \"an interpretation\" of driving through the proposed district than actually doing it.\n\n\"To navigate the Southern end of Franklin County in the proposed 15th District, one would need to drive off-road for about 5 km between Lynnbrook and Lockbourne and ford the Scioto River Oregon Trail-style,\" he wrote in an e-mail. \"Depending on the vehicle being used, this could add some time to the trip. After passing Lockbourne, the driver may need to borrow a runway at Rickenbacker International Airport, assuming FAA approval.\"\n\nAdditionally, it bears pointing out that the Democratic route is an attempt to get around Stivers district by staying wholly in the district at all times \u2014 it\u2019s not how someone would actually travel to get from one point to another.\n\nFor example, Stivers district includes only portions of U.S. 33, so you can\u2019t use it to travel from Columbus to Athens even though it\u2019s a direct link between the two cities.\n\n\"He will be taking direct routes not only traveling within the lines of his district,\" said Courtney Whetstone, a staffer with Stivers\u2019 Columbus congressional office. \"There isn\u2019t any part of his district farther than an hour and a half from his house.\"\n\nRedfern\u2019s statement does include the phrase \"without leaving Stivers\u2019 district\" but the twists and turns of the road embodied in that statement are not made clear.\n\nSo after all this ramblin\u2019 through Ohio, where do we end up?\n\nGoogle maps estimates Redfern\u2019s route plotted through the \"reverse Pac-man\" district would take six hours to drive and that matches the estimated drive time from Columbus to Niagara Falls.\n\nThe claim has to take a detour, though, because it\u2019s not possible to drive through the new Ohio 15th in southern Franklin County. But then again, we can award points for context because the claim supports Redfern\u2019s larger point -- that the boundaries for this sprawling district were drawn to achieve a political purpose.\n\nLastly, it needs to be said that Redfern\u2019s route is not the way that Stivers or anyone would travel from one part of the district to another. Rather, they would choose a direct route that crosses district boundaries and would be a much shorter drive. That\u2019s a point that provides clarification.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Redfern\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12320"}
