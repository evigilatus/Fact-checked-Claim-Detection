He pointed out the party\u2019s policy platform, which calls for a \"personhood\"-style amendment that would define life at the moment of conception.\n\nBondi said \"that issue really has not come up\" during her travels across the country on Romney\u2019s behalf.\n\n\"What women care about are jobs, the economy, the unemployment rate,\" Bondi said on Aug. 27, 2012. \"You know, 401,000 women have lost jobs under President Obama\u2019s reign.\"\n\nLater in the interview, she said, \"Wolf, when I\u2019m around the country, women care about the same issues as men, and that\u2019s getting jobs, keeping jobs.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve heard this retort from Republicans throughout this election cycle as reproductive rights issues have at times dominated the news.\n\nWe wanted to know if Bondi is right about jobs being the priority for women or if it just sounds nice on TV. We put the question to experts in polling, political science and women\u2019s issues (and to Bondi\u2019s press aides, who did not respond).\n\nWomen have trended Democratic since the Ronald Reagan-Jimmy Carter 1980 election, but abortion isn\u2019t the driving issue, said Seth McKee, a University of South Florida political science professor.\n\n\"It\u2019s one of the myths in American politics that people think that\u2019s where the gap comes from,\" he said of abortion. \"There are lots of pro-choice men.\"\n\nInstead, the gender gap is traditionally widened by issues of aggression -- meaning, more aversion from women to war and gun rights -- and government programs. Women are more likely to be in charge of family decisions on education, health and budgets, so they place more value on programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, said Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research.\n\n\"It\u2019s typically the woman who is responsible for all of that,\" she said. \"And in general the Democrats are more supportive of providing those services to women and their families.\"\n\nWhere do reproductive issues rank? Not high, no matter\u00a0the poll.\n\nHere\u2019s how the issue of abortion ranked in May 2012 when Washington University\u2019s American Panel Survey asked people what issue they thought is \"the most important problem facing the country today.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMale\n\nFemale\n\nTotal\n\n\n\nAbortion\n\n.3%\n\n.9%\n\n.6%\n\n\n\nEconomy in general\n\n32.7%\n\n35.6%\n\n34.2%\n\n\n\nUnemployment\n\n13.5%\n\n10.6%\n\n12%\n\n\n\nBudget deficit\n\n12.8%\n\n8.1%\n\n10.4%\n\n\n\nMoral decline\n\n10.6%\n\n7.9%\n\n9.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion didn\u2019t break a percentage point.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Bondi\u2019s statement does not account for a couple factors, said Jeffrey Jones, managing editor of Gallup polls. First, he said, everyone cares most about the economy when it\u2019s bleak. And even in a decent economy, sizing up single issues (abortion, gay marriage, campaign finance) next to as broad a topic as the economy is comparing apples and oranges.\n\nIn a close presidential race like this one, both sides will pounce on social controversies in hopes of moving the needle.\n\nThe Obama campaign, for instance, is using the abortion debate -- inflamed anew by Todd Akin\u2019s \"legitimate rape\" controversy -- to appeal to unmarried women, said Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\"Obama has to be sensitive to women's concerns about the economy and deflecting their concerns to issues such as contraception and abortion could be a good strategy,\" she said.\n\nNARAL Pro-Choice America political director Beth Shipp said polls by the group show abortion rights help Obama among women labeled \"Obama defectors,\" meaning they voted for him in 2008 but are not committed this year.\n\n\"We don\u2019t need to move 5 percent or 10 percent. We don\u2019t need to move 2 percent,\" Shipp said. \"I can move a .5 percent or 1 percent and affect the outcome of this race.\"\n\nOn the other side of the debate, anti-abortion advocates plan to use Obama\u2019s \"extreme abortion record\" with the same end goal, according to an Aug. 29, 2012, Washington Post story.\n\nSome experts argue that reproductive rights and the economy aren\u2019t completely separate issues. If women aren\u2019t worried about issues of contraception and abortion, it\u2019s probably because they think those issues are long settled, says David Johnson, a University of South Florida history professor.\n\n\"Women in the \u201860s and \u201870s were fighting for reproductive freedom so that they could work,\"\nJohnson said in an interview. \"If they could not control when they could have children, they could not work.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that people on both sides of the issue believe debates on abortion rights can help or hurt a candidate on the margins in a tight race.\n\nBut Bondi is right that women, like men, place the most importance on economic issues this election cycle.
