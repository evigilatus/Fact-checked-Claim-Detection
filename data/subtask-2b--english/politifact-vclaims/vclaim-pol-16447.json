He then sought a pardon so he could become a police officer, but was turned down. Circosta did not return a phone call from PolitiFact this week, but Huckabee's description of the case is supported by accounts in the Associated Press and other publications.\n\n\n\"Now, I would have given that kid a pardon,\" Huckabee said about Circosta in a Fox News Channel interview on Dec. 20. \"And everywhere I've gone and asked people for a show of hands, everybody agrees with me.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
