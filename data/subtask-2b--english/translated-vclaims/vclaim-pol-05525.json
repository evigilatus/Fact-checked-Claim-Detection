But in the presidential Republican debate in North Charleston, S.C., on January 14, 2016, Trump also shot China at foreign policy - precisely because it did not do enough to curb its neighbour, North Korea. Trump said: \"China, they don't like to tell us but they have complete control over North Korea. They can solve the North Korean problem if they want to, but they're making fun of us.\" As the underground nation returned to the news to test the alleged hydrogen bomb (but not verified) earlier this month, we wondered whether Trump was right that China had \"full control, just around North Korea.\" When we took a closer look at this question, we found that the experts in the region provided a precise answer. China had a significant impact on North Korea because it provided or was able to transit a large part of North Korea &apos; s supply of goods from the outside world. But that effect, they added, is far less than \"full control.\" \"China does not control North Korea in any real sense of the word, but it has an impact on North Korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than Beijing, Evans J. R. River, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution Centre for Policy Studies in East Asia. Robert Ross, a Chinese expert at Boston College and Harvard University, compared the relationship between China and North Korea with the relationship between a parent and a teenager. \"It's similar to dealing with a rebellious teenager,\" said Ross. \"Do parents have complete control? Perhaps - they provide food and shelter. But the cost to parents of using such influence may be prohibitive - getting the child out of the house and away from the family. China has many risks in its strategic and economic relationship with North Korea. But is there complete control? This is debatable.\" China &apos; s strong influence on North Korea is the strongest argument for China &apos; s great control over North Korea stemming from its role in trade, particularly food and fuel. North Korea has long land borders with China - the longest with any neighbour - and while North Korea also has seaports, the rest of the world can monitor shipments to those ports more easily, making it better for North Korea to transport goods on land. Research by Stefan Haggard of the University of California - San Diego and Marcos Noland of the Peterson Institute of International Economics indicates that China may account for up to 80 per cent of North Korea &apos; s trade and a similar proportion of its investment flows. \"North Korea will face terrible economic problems if China exercises its full influence, for example by cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so.\" However, although China's economic lifeline gives it leverage, this does not mean that it can simply wave a stick and make things happen in Pyongyang - something that one may reasonably assume when one hears Trump's quote. (The Trump campaign did not respond to any query.) First, China has expressed concern - with logic, experts say - that pressure so strongly that the collapse of the current North Korean regime would lead to a humanitarian catastrophe on its borders. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security purposes in her installation, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, Haggard said: \"China is reluctant to exercise its influence, fearing the potential effects of economic collapse on its borders and the influx of refugees.\" It has become painfully clear over the years that North Korea does not exactly listen to strangers. \"Mr. Trump is right that the Chinese have influence, but it's the influence they'll use with the North Korean regime resisting them with all they have,\" said Joseph De Thomas, Professor of International Affairs at Pennsylvania State University. \"This is hardly control.\" North Korea has not only thumbed its nose at the United Nations and global forces, but has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. Indeed, the country &apos; s national ideology - Juche - is based on the concept of self-reliance. \"North Korea is a country proud of not answering anyone and not following any evidence,\" said River. \"This has been a constant element in North Korea's behaviour for decades, and is, of course, the reason why the regime poses a major threat to the United States, South Korea, East Asia and the international community as a whole.\" In fact, despite North Korea's heavy dependence on China for food, fuel and almost all other goods, \"it's not clear that leadership cares,\" as Ross said from Boston and Harvard College. \"For decades the population has lived in extreme poverty, while the elite has been very good.\" At the same time, North Korea &apos; s development of its nuclear programme has granted it some strategic independence from China - further complicating the situation in China. This was on display with the last test of the alleged hydrogen bomb. Scott A. Snyder, Director of the Policy Programme between the United States and Korea at the Council on Foreign Relations, said. \"As a result, relations between China and North Korea are tense. Chinese President Xie Kim Jong On of North Korea did not meet, while he met six times with the leader of South Korea.\" This does not seem to be a country in \"full control\" of another country. River said that Trump's claim \"has suggested a fundamental lack of understanding for both China and North Korea, both today and over decades.\" \"It is almost certain that the Chinese did not receive advance warning of the test, and Chinese anger was quite evident in the public statements made by the government after the test. From the point of view of almost every expert in North Korea and China, the nuclear test was a slap on China, in addition to being a major challenge and threat to the international community.\" The Governor Trump said China has \"full control of North Korea.\" He has the point that China has considerable influence over North Korea if it wishes to do so, as China provides the vast majority of North Korea's international trade, including food and fuel imports. But Trump's assertion, even a little bit, overlooks some of the important limits of that influence, especially the willingness of the North Korean Government to follow its own drums even if it means the suffering of its people. The fact that North Korea recently conducted a nuclear test of China's strong objections indicates that Beijing lacks anything close to \"full control\" of North Korea. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, so it is often wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05525"}
