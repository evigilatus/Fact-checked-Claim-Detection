And I believe any of us on this stage would be a heck of a lot better than Michael Bennet,\" said Frazier, a former Aurora city councilman, referring to Colorado\u2019s incumbent Democratic senator.\n\"You see, Michael Bennet votes for President Obama's agenda 98 percent of the time. Hardly independent, hardly bipartisan,\" Frazier stressed. (Watch debate video clip, courtesy KKTV)\nIt\u2019s a no-brainer for a Republican candidate to portray Bennet as marching in lockstep with a president who\u2019s unpopular with GOP primary voters. Frazier is among five Republicans scrapping to win the June 28 primary and a shot at toppling Bennet in the general election.\nSo let\u2019s look deeper at Frazier\u2019s claim that Bennet votes for Obama's agenda 98 percent of the time, and whether that makes him \"hardly independent, hardly bipartisan.\"\nHere\u2019s Bennet\u2019s presidential support rate since he and Obama took office in 2009, according to CQ:\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nPresidential support rate\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n96.2 percent\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n98.4 percent\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n95.5 percent\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n98.7 percent\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n98.2 percent\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n99.3 percent\n\n\n\n\n2015\n\n\n89.7 percent\n\n\n\n\n\nWe asked the Frazier campaign for evidence supporting the statement. The campaign cited a Jan. 12 online statement by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which cited the annual percentage of Bennet\u2019s votes where he supported the president\u2019s position from 2009 through 2014. The average for those years is 97.5 percent, which rounds up to 98 percent, the figure Frazier cited. The NRSC attributed the data to CQ Roll Call, a nonpartisan news service that tracks congressional data.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto shows Rep. Lauren Boebert with Capitol rioters before she gave them a tour of the building \"one day before the insurrection.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 14, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the NRSC statement misstated the percentage for Bennet\u2019s 2014 votes with Obama as \"100 Percent Of The Time.\" CQ\u2019s Vote Watch database says Bennet voted with Obama 99.3 percent of the time in 2014.\nThe NRSC also left out data for 2015, when Bennet backed the president\u2019s positions 89.7 percent of the time, according to CQ.\nWhen we add\u00a0the 2015 voting data, Bennet\u2019s seven-year average of voting with the president is 96.57 percent \u2014 just a bit lower\u00a0than Frazier\u2019s claim of 98 percent.\nHowever, Bennet\u2019s campaign spokesman Andrew Zucker said it\u2019s easy to use the CQ figures to distort a lawmaker\u2019s overall record in Congress.\nZucker noted that Bennet has opposed Obama\u2019s plans when they conflict with Colorado\u2019s interest. He successfully fought the administration\u2019s 2010 plan to slash funding for a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory in Fort Collins that is working to combat the Zika virus. He also pushed back against the administration\u2019s proposal to cut funding for the Orion aerospace program in Colorado that supported 1,000 jobs in the state.\nBennet has also voted against the president on major issues. He was one of nine Democrats to side\u00a0with Republicans on a bill to approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. Obama vetoed that bill and Bennet voted for\u00a0an unsuccessful\u00a0effort to override the veto.\nInside presidential support ratings\nHere\u2019s some background to keep in mind when sifting through CQ\u2019s presidential support statistics.\nFirst of all, they only deal with a fraction of votes cast by Bennet. CQ only counts those votes where the president takes a \"clear position\" on an issue. For example, according to CQ, Obama only staked out a position on 145 of the 366 votes the Senate took in 2014.\nAnd the vast majority of the presidential support votes in 2014 \u2014 125, or 86 percent \u2014 involved a glut of presidential nominees for federal posts, because the Democrats controlled the Senate then and had lowered the threshold for approving most nominees from 60 votes to a simple majority, CQ reported. In fact, in every year but 2009 (40 percent), a majority of the votes Obama has supported were on his nominees. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBennet called \u2018party loyalist\u2019 and \u2018bipartisan problem solver\u2019\nWhile Frazier calls Bennet \"hardly independent, hardly bipartisan,\" there is evidence the senator works across the aisle.\nLast year, the Washington Post ranked him fifth among Democratic senators who \"vote against their party the most.\" \u00a0\nThe chart below shows how often Bennet has voted with Senate Democrats, compared to how the party majority voted, according to CQ. Bennet voted closest with the Democratic Party in 2014 -- he voted 98.8 percent to the party\u2019s average of 98.6 percent -- but his support for the party\u2019s position dropped down to 82.9 percent in 2015.\n\nOver seven years, Bennet voted with the Democratic Party on average 91.29 percent of the time \u2014 a few points less than the average for all Democratic senators voting with the party (94.51 percent) during that period.\nA CQ profile of the senator said, \"Bennet has played dual roles, as a party loyalist and a bipartisan problem solver.\" \u00a0\nAs a Democratic loyalist, he\u2019s fought to protect Medicare, saying, \"We can\u2019t attempt to balance the nation\u2019s budget on the backs of our seniors,\" CQ reported. Wearing his problem-solver hat, Bennet worked with Republican Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah to win FDA support for \"breakthrough therapies\" legislation in 2012 that sped approval of new drug treatment for cystic fibrosis, lung cancer and leukemia.\nBennet often joins groups seeking compromise\nBennet has been a frequent member of bipartisan groups of lawmakers working to find compromise on major legislation, the CQ profile said. He was one of three Democratic senators to oppose the January 2013 \"fiscal cliff\" deal, which averted income tax increases on earnings under $400,000 but didn\u2019t cut federal spending \u2014 a deal-breaker for Bennet.\nBennet, a\u00a0former Denver Public Schools superintendent, has earned praise from Republicans for reaching across the aisle, including for his work on the overhaul of the No Child Left Behind law.\n\"Michael understands that the Senate is a place where you have extended debate on important subjects and work across party lines until you come to a consensus \u2014 that\u2019s how you get a result, and that\u2019s how you govern a complex country,\" Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate education committee, told the Denver Post in 2015.\nOur ruling\nFrazier said, \"Michael Bennet votes for President Obama's agenda 98 percent of the time. Frazier cited the frequency of Bennet voting with the president as proof he is \"hardly independent, hardly bipartisan.\" \u00a0\nIn this case, Bennet is close on the available numbers, but they don\u2019t indicate a blind allegiance to Obama\u2019s agenda, as Frazier argues.\nCQ data show Bennet voting for the president\u2019s position on legislation an average of 96.57 percent over seven years. That\u2019s just over 1 percentage\u00a0point\u00a0below Frazier\u2019s figure. However, the CQ data distorts the senator\u2019s voting record, because a majority of the time the president expresses his position is when a vote involves someone he\u2019s nominated for a federal post. There is also independent support for the view that Bennet is a \"bipartisan\" lawmaker who works with and votes with Republicans more often than the Senate\u2019s Democratic caucus as a whole.\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate this claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4eba460d-d293-4da3-8c23-fa09fb1c845f", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04802"}
