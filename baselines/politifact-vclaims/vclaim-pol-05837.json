We asked Trump\u2019s campaign for clarification and evidence but didn\u2019t hear back.\nSo we\u2019ll evaluate Trump\u2019s claim within the context of which he was speaking - of tax burdens affecting most people. That leads us to income taxes.\nIncome tax rates\nThe top income tax rate in the United States is 39.6 percent. That ranked 33rd highest on a list of the top rates in 116 nations compiled this year by KPMG, an international tax advisory corporation. Another survey - by tradingeconomics.com, a website that compiles economic data - ranks the U.S. top rate 38th highest among 155 nations and territories.\nChad and Ivory Coast had the highest top tax rates, at 60 percent.\nThe bottom income tax rate in the U.S. is 10 percent. Forty-one countries have higher bottom rates, according to data on 157 nations and territories compiled by Ernst & Young, an international accounting corporation.\nThere\u2019s no precise way to compare middle income tax rates, because most nations don\u2019t have systems as complicated as the seven-bracket tax scale used by the U.S.\nKeep in mind that all of these figures concern statutory tax rates. Effective tax rates - the percentage actually paid on earned income after deductions - are lower. On average, Americans pay an effective income tax rate of 9.5 percent, according to research by the Tax Policy Center in Washington. We were unable to find a chart of the effective rates in other nations, which have their own rules for deductions and allowances.\nTax experts told us that focusing on tax rates - either statutory or effective - is not a meaningful way to compare the tax burdens of nations. The reason is that different countries place different emphasis on certain levies. For example, some nations with high income tax rates may have low payroll taxes and vice versa.\nOther indicators\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experts suggested two different yardsticks for comparing tax burdens in different countries. \u00a0One was tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. The other was tax revenue per capita. Both measures are calculated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 advanced industrialized nations.\nPolitiFact National has found that for both measurements, many of the United States\u2019 industrialized peers had higher levels of taxation in 2013, the most recent year for which data are available.\nTaxes accounted for about 25 percent of the United States\u2019 GDP -- placing the U.S. 27th out of 30 countries studied. The five with the highest percentages were Denmark, France, Belgium, Finland and Sweden, each of them with taxation accounting for more than 42 percent of gross domestic product. Only South Korea, Chile and Mexico had lower levels of taxation per GDP than the United States.\nWhen looking at tax revenue per capita, the United States ranks somewhat higher but still far from the top.\nTaxes per capita in the United States totaled $13,482, according to the OECD data. That ranked 16th out of 29 countries for which data were available for 2013. The five with the highest per-capita amounts were Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, with amounts ranging from $23,000 to $48,000. Eleven countries had per-capita amounts less than $10,000, including Hungary, Chile and Turkey, the bottom three on the list.\nWhile it probably makes the most sense to compare the United States with other advanced, industrialized nations, there is one additional data source that includes the full roster of countries. In the World Bank\u2019s comparison of 115 countries for 2012, the U.S. ranked 12th from the bottom in taxation as a percentage of GDP. Among the countries with lower percentages were two OECD members (Japan and Spain), some wealthy oil-producing nations (Oman and Kuwait), and a handful of very poor countries (including Afghanistan and the Central African Republic).\nA final note: We should note that a more specific statement by Trump might have been largely accurate. PolitiFact has given a Mostly True rating to the claim that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in world, although widespread deductions and exclusions tend to lower the effective corporate rate below the comparative level for some other countries.\nBut Trump didn\u2019t mention corporations when he made his comment. He was lamenting economic problems facing the middle class. \u00a0\nOur ruling\nTrump, while lamenting the condition of the middle class, said the U.S. has \"the highest tax rate anywhere in the world.\"\nAll sets of data we examined for individual and family taxes prove him wrong. Statutory income tax rates in the U.S. fall around the end of the upper quarter of nations.\nMore exhaustive measures - which compute overall tax burden per person and as a percentage of GDP - show the U.S. either is in the middle of the pack or on the lighter end of taxation compared with other advanced industrialized nations.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05837"}
