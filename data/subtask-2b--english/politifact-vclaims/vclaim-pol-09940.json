Scott Walker\u2019s Act 10 collective bargaining law increased state employees\u2019 health care costs. And Milwaukee -- while not under Act 10\u2019s health care mandates -- got its workers to pick up a greater share of such costs in the wake of the law.\n\nBut are county workers paying \"much more\" than state and city employees?\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting question, given the prominence of the health care issue in the 2012 county budget tussle between the County Board and County Executive Chris Abele, who again had sought larger cost-sharing from employees.\n\nFirst, a few words of caution. While there are credible ways to compare health insurance plans, it\u2019s a complicated exercise because costs can vary significantly depending on employees\u2019 health and the intricacies of each plan\u2019s design. For simplicity\u2019s sake, our analysis is based on insurance costs for current employees, not for retirees. The figures discussed here apply to most, but not all, employees of the three governments.\n\nWe examined reports that Dimitrijevic says she relied on in making her claim, and spoke with city, county and state officials about their health plan offerings for 2013.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with two key measures:\n\nPlan design\n\nState employees have no annual deductible, receive 90 percent co-insurance and have comparatively low limits on yearly out-of-pocket costs (ranging from $500 for single coverage to $1,000 for families).\n\nThat gives them a clear advantage over city and county workers.\n\nMost City of Milwaukee workers chose a plan with deductibles of $500 to $1,000 and out-of-pocket caps of $1,000 per person/$2,000 family. The co-insurance picks up 90 percent. The city plan does not charge co-pays for office visits.\n\nCounty workers face the highest deductibles ($800-$1,850) and by far the highest out-of-pocket limits ($2,500 per person to $5,000 per family). Office and prescription co-pays do not count toward that maximum. Their co-insurance pays less than at the city and state -- 80 percent.\n\nBut for 2013, the County Board, over Abele\u2019s objection, funded a county contribution to employees to reimburse them for eligible health care expenditures such as co-pays, deductibles, co-insurance, dental care, or vision care.\n\nThe county contribution to these \"flexible spending accounts\" ranges from $600 for a single employee to $1,800 for a family.\n\nSo that can offset most of an employee\u2019s costs up to the deductible. And county officials say it brings those county employees who use very little health care into rough parity with city employees.\n\nStill, county workers face higher out-of-pocket payments than city workers if their medical costs mount. And the difference could amount to several hundred dollars, or a couple thousand dollars in a bad health year, so it\u2019s significant.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many people fall into the higher-use group, though after 10 months of 2012 about 35 percent had met their deductible. That includes retirees, but the figure for active workers would be comparable, said the county\u2019s benefits administrator, Matthew Hanchek.\n\nMonthly Premiums\n\nCounty workers pay the highest premiums, and they can\u2019t use that county contribution towards them.\n\nCity employees are on the low end with premiums ranging from $54 monthly to $173 in the most popular plan. Most state workers will pay $85 to $211.\n\nBy contrast, county workers will pay $100 to $225 a month, putting another gap between them and the rest.\n\nLet\u2019s try to tally it up:\n\nIt\u2019s clear that state employees have the lowest costs.\n\nThat leaves county vs. city.\n\nWe asked the county\u2019s Hanchek about the city vs. county comparison.\n\nHe said the flexible spending contribution brings the county plan close to parity with the city\u2019s when you consider all active members.\n\nThere\u2019s some support for that by another measure: the collective employee share of their employer\u2019s total health care bill.\n\nAt the county, that figure is a projected 23 percent to 27 percent for 2013, depending on which measure from several county sources you prefer. The city is in the 23 percent to 25 percent range, said Michael Brady, city employee benefits director.\n\nTo the extent those figures are apples-to-apples, they suggest there isn\u2019t much difference between the plans as a whole. Benefits officials caution that these aggregate figures don\u2019t necessarily reflect a typical employee\u2019s experience.\n\nHanchek did note that the city\u2019s premium costs are a bit lower than the county\u2019s, which he attributed mainly to demographic factors.\n\nCounty Comptroller Scott Manske looked at the situation a different way and drew this conclusion: At higher usage levels, county workers likely face much higher out-of-pocket costs, compared with city workers. At average usage levels, it\u2019s a wash or the county worker could pay a little more, he said.\n\nWe\u2019ll give the final word to Richard Abelson, executive director of AFSCME District Council 48, the labor organization that represents many city and county employees. Both employee groups have been asked to pay more for health benefits in recent years, Abelson said.\n\nThe bottom line, in Abelson\u2019s view, is that city workers pay a little bit less than their county counterparts, even when the county\u2019s flexible spending account is considered.\n\nOne final note. We found that city workers earn $50,476 on average, slightly more than state ($49,534) and county workers ($50,188), so at least in a rough sense city employees may have a bit more ability to pay.\n\nOur rating\n\nDimitrijevic said Milwaukee County government employees are paying \"much more\" for health insurance than their counterparts at the City of Milwaukee and in state government.\n\nThere\u2019s mixed evidence, but we think a fair reading of the numbers is that some county employees will pay more. The precise number is hard to judge. And those people could pay out \"much more\" if you think hundreds of dollars a year or more is a big deal.\n\nBut there\u2019s an important detail here that undercuts Dimitrijevic\u2019s claim: the county\u2019s contribution to workers\u2019 flexible spending accounts. Because of that, some city and county employees ultimately may pay similar amounts when you factor in that taxpayer-funded contribution.\n\nWe rate Dimitrijevic\u2019s statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09940"}
