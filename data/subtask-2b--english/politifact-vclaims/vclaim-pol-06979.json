Scott Walker won re-election, but gains in the Assembly meant Republicans would enjoy their largest majority in that chamber since 1957. \u00a0\nIn the interview, Vos laid out a number of his priorities for the next legislative session, which starts in January 2015. One proposal would allow business contributions to the political parties.\n\"Right now, if you are the Democratic Party, you can take unlimited union money, in many ways, but there's a prohibition on business being able to give to a political party,\" Vos claimed. \"I\u2019d like to get rid of that and create a level playing field.\"\nVos presumably was singling out the Democratic Party because it typically gets more support from unions than the GOP does.\nWe\u2019ll check both parts of his claim -- that in Wisconsin, unions can essentially make unlimited contributions to political parties, while businesses can\u2019t make any.\nUnions\nState law allows unions to contribute directly to political parties (and to candidates, for that matter).\nBut since at least 2008, no union has used its \"treasury\" funds to directly make a contribution to a political party, according to the state Government Accountability Board, which oversees state elections.\nThere is a strong disincentive to contribute that way. If they did, unions would have to register with the state as a political committee and would have to disclose all their sources of revenue and all their disbursements.\nInstead, what unions typically do is create political action committees, which in turn make contributions to political parties (and candidates).\nA union can give a PAC the equivalent of $20 per union member per year without having to disclose the names of the union members. Or, the union can give unlimited amounts to PACs, as long as the union members\u2019 names are disclosed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPACs, though, are limited to contributing $6,000 per year to a political party.\nSo, unions are allowed to contribute directly to political parties -- but, in practice, they don\u2019t. They are allowed to give unlimited amounts of money to a political action committee, but a PAC is limited to how much it can give to a party.\nBusiness\nThe second part of Vos\u2019 claim is that \"there's a prohibition on business being able to give to a political party.\"\nIn Wisconsin, campaign contributions must originate from individuals.\nThat means business owners -- those who own sole proprietorships or partnerships -- can make contributions to political parties (as well as to candidates and political action committees).\nThat is, as long as the source is personal funds and not funds from the business -- and as long as they follow the limit for a particular race.\nBut Wisconsin prohibits corporations, including limited liability companies, from making contributions to parties, candidates or PACs.\nLike unions, corporations can form political action committees to solicit campaign contributions from individuals. But as we\u2019ve noted, unlike unions, corporations can\u2019t make contributions to PACs.\nVos told us he\u2019d like to see state law changed so that it treats corporations like unions -- in other words, allowing corporations to make the same kind of political contributions as unions do.\nOur rating\nVos said that in Wisconsin, unions can essentially give \"unlimited\" contributions to political parties, but business can't give any.\nThe law allows unions to make unlimited contributions to the parties, but in practice, they make no such direct contributions at all. Rather, they give to political action committees, which in turn are limited in what they can give to parties.\nBusiness owners using their personal funds can contribute to political parties, within limits, but corporations can't make any such contributions.\nWe rate\u00a0 the claim Mostly True.\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06979"}
