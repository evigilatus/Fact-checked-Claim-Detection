Chris Christie couldn\u2019t pass up an opportunity to knock his predecessor, Jon Corzine.\n\nThe Republican governor appeared Aug. 9 at a campaign event in Bellevue, Wash., for GOP gubernatorial candidate Rob McKenna. Christie told the crowd public-sector union workers should pay their fair share toward pension and health benefits, and then criticized Corzine for giving away raises.\n\n\"My predecessor's first negotiation with the public-sector unions, he gave away 14 percent raises over 4 years and he stood on the front steps of the Capitol at a public-sector union rally and said, 'I will fight to get you a great contract,\u2019\" said Christie, according to a video posted on YouTube.\n\nCorzine, a Democrat, did approve contracts providing 13 percent in raises over a four-year period for state workers. Corzine also spoke at a union rally where he vowed to \"fight\" for public employees, according to several news reports.\n\nBut Christie\u2019s criticism that Corzine \"gave away\" those raises ignores the fact that the contracts included a number of union concessions.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s explain the events leading up to that union rally.\n\nFor the first budget of his tenure, Corzine in 2006 proposed increasing the sales tax to help cover a budget shortfall. The governor also called for increasing the contribution to the state\u2019s pension system.\n\nBut instead of the tax hike, some Democratic legislators called for state worker unions to accept salary or fringe benefit givebacks. Another proposal was scaling back the proposed pension payment.\n\nOn June 19, 2006, thousands of public employees rallied outside the Statehouse to show support for Corzine\u2019s plan. According to several news reports, the governor made comments at the union rally similar to those cited by Christie.\n\nStar-Ledger columnist Paul Mulshine and Gannett New Jersey columnist Bob Ingle both quoted Corzine as saying, \"We're gonna fight for a fair contract.\" The New York Times quoted the governor as saying, \"I will fight for you.\"\n\nThe final budget included the sales tax increase and a smaller pension contribution.\n\nNow, we\u2019ll address the raises mentioned by Christie.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSheila Oliver\n\n\nstated on July 8, 2011 in a press release from Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Numerous studies have shown that these so-called right-to-work laws do not generate jobs and economic growth.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill Wichert \u2022 July 15, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEight months after that union rally, the Corzine administration reached a deal with the largest state workers union for a new four-year agreement. Two other unions later agreed to similar deals. Those contracts, which went into effect in July 2007, provided a total of 13 percent in raises for each union.\n\nHowever, by claiming Corzine \"gave away\" those raises, Christie failed to mention a number of union concessions built into the contracts.\n\nFor example, union workers agreed for the first time to contribute 1.5 percent of their salaries each year toward the cost of health benefits. The contracts also increased employees\u2019 annual pension contributions by 0.5 percent.\n\nIn response to our findings, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in part:\n\n\"For goodness sake, the fix was in for that fight, and Jon Corzine was taking a \u2018fall\u2019 in the first round. Who was representing the taxpayers? Where was the adversarial collective bargaining relationship? And, finally, how many people do any of us know got those kinds of raises in those years? It was a \u2018giveaway\u2019 in the fullest sense, and that\u2019s exactly what Governor Christie was saying.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAt a campaign event in Bellevue, Wash., Christie said Corzine \"gave away 14 percent raises over 4 years and he stood on the front steps of the Capitol at a public-sector union rally and said, 'I will fight to get you a great contract.\u2019\"\n\nCorzine did authorize four-year contracts with a total of 13 percent in raises, and vowed to \"fight\" for public employees at a union rally. But Christie\u2019s criticism ignores how the contracts included certain union concessions.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10556"}
