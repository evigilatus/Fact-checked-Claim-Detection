And it actually makes the current loophole even worse.\n\"It gives hedge-fund managers a special tax rate that\u2019s lower than what many middle-class families pay,\" Clinton continued in the June 21, 2016, speech. \"And I did have to look twice because I didn\u2019t believe it. Under Donald Trump\u2019s plan, these Wall Street millionaires will pay a lower tax rate than many working people.\"\nTrump\u2019s plan does roll back one high-profile advantage for hedge fund partners. Is Clinton right to say they still come out ahead?\nTrump took an aggressive position on tax rates for hedge fund managers during his fight for the Republican nomination. In an interview with CBS in August, Trump called them \"paper pushers\" who \"did not build this country.\" In a Republican debate in September, Trump said his tax plan would make them pay more.\n\"The hedge fund guys won\u2019t like me as much as they like me right now. I know them all, but they\u2019ll pay more,\" Trump said.\nAfter the Republican debate, Trump released the outline of his tax plan.\nTrump\u2019s plan eliminates the so-called carried interest tax loophole, which allows general partners in private investment firms (including most hedge fund managers) to treat some of their income as income from investments, or capital gains, subject to a top tax rate of 23.8 percent, instead of the much higher tax rate for ordinary income (43.4 percent).\nUnder Trump\u2019s plan, income from carried interest would no longer be treated as capital gains. Tax rates for ordinary income tops out at 25 percent under Trump\u2019s plan. This looks like a hike in line with Trump\u2019s promises.\nExcept.\nAlong with private equity and venture capital funds, many hedge funds are structured as partnerships. Under Trump\u2019s plan, income through a business partnership is taxed at a rate of no more than 15 percent, significantly less than the 23.8 percent they previously paid, according to an analysis of Trump\u2019s tax plan from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEliminating the carried interest \"loophole\" actually helps these hedge fund managers under Trump\u2019s plan. If carried interest was still treated as capital gains, it could be taxed at the top rate for capital gains in the plan (20 percent), higher than the fixed 15 percent\u00a0tax for partnership income.\nTrump\u2019s plan presents the discounted rate for partnership income as a way to help \"the small businesses that are the true engine of our economy.\"\nIt also helps large businesses and wealthy financiers who structure their businesses as partnerships, including the hedge funds managers he attacked in his campaign.\nClinton also said that rates for hedge fund managers would be lower than for middle-class families under Trump\u2019s plan. Defining the middle class can be tricky, but in the Pew Research Center\u2019s range of $42,000 to $125,000 for a household of three in 2014, a substantial number of middle-class households would make enough to qualify for a marginal tax rate of more than 15 percent if Trump\u2019s plan were enacted.\nNot all of these people would pay more than 15 percent\u00a0overall, according to Bob Williams at the Tax Policy Center, and it would be difficult to say how many middle-income people would pay more than hedge fund managers once the many different variables involved played out. But some would, Williams wrote in an email.\nIn May, Politico reported that the Trump campaign had engaged two economists to craft a new tax plan. The Trump campaign has not confirmed whether they plan to re-write their tax plan, and did not respond to Politico\u2019s request for comment. The tax plan announced in September remains on Trump's website, and is the basis of this article.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to our request for comment on this article.\nOur ruling\nClinton said Trump\u2019s proposed tax rate for hedge fund managers \"makes the current loophole even worse.\"\nShe has a point. By setting a lower tax rate for income from business partnerships, Trump\u2019s tax plan would benefit many hedge fund managers. Though the plan would cut tax rates for middle-class families as well, the cuts that would apply to most hedge fund managers are steeper and their resulting tax rate is lower.\nTrump promised that his tax plan would roll back advantages for hedge fund managers. Instead, in most cases, it would improve their position.\nWe rate the statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04748"}
