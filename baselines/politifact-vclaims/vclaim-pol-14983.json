Rick Perry wasted government dollars flying to Texas cities to give out money.\n\u201cIn three days last week, Perry flew to five cities at taxpayers\u2019 expense, holding press conferences, delivering $2,325,000 in checks,\u201d White\u2019s 8:43 p.m. post states.\nDid Perry burn tax dollars to hand out checks?\nKaty Bacon, White\u2019s spokeswoman, pointed out news releases issued by the governor\u2019s office reflecting Perry\u2019s stops May 11-13 in Corpus Christi, Dallas, San Antonio, Palacios and San Juan. The releases state that Perry announced spending awards of $150,000, $175,000 and $2 million, respectively, in Dallas, Palacios and San Juan. Perry did not ballyhoo funding awards in the other cities, according to the releases.\nThat\u2019s close to what White said on Facebook: Three days, five cities, $2,325,000 in checks handed over by Perry.\nWe wondered, though, at White\u2019s description of Perry\u2019s flights as costing taxpayers. For years, Perry has funded considerable out-of-town travel, for state business or campaign purposes, from non-state sources including his campaign kitty \u2014 an approach often mentioned in news articles, including a July 26 report in White\u2019s hometown newspaper, the Houston Chronicle.\nThe Chronicle article quotes Perry\u2019s gubernatorial spokeswoman, Allison Castle, noting that \u201cPerry's travel is not paid by taxpayers.\u201d It continues: \u201cTexas One, a corporate-finance foundation, pays for much of Perry's business development travel. Other travel is paid for by his political committee or campaign donors. And some is financed as in-kind contributions from specific wealthy donors or interest groups.\u201d\nAs for the flights Facebooked by White, Bacon told us in an e-mail: \u201cThese were all \u2018official\u2019 trips and events under the Office of the Governor, and this type of travel is typically paid for by taxpayers.\u201d\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot so, said Castle, who informed us the flights under fire, on private planes, were funded by Perry\u2019s campaign. \u201cThe majority of the governor\u2019s travel is paid for by his campaign,\u201d she said. For each of the five stops referenced by White, she said, one state-paid travel aide and a press aide accompanied Perry.\nThere is another cost the public pays for every Perry trip \u2014 his security detail. In a follow-up interview, Bacon took no issue with gubernatorial security expenses.\nBacon also stood by White's characterization of the travel as taxpayer-funded, saying it would take time to confirm, with documents, that Perry's flights were not paid for by the state. Then again, Bacon said, spending campaign funds on the flights also doesn't pass muster.\n\"Either way, this is wrong,\" she said. \"He\u2019s running around handing out taxpayer dollars to get headlines for his political career. He\u2019s using campaign dollars to hand out state checks.\" She showed us that Perry's campaign excerpted two press releases from the latest trips in a campaign e-mail blast.\nBacon's charge shifts the focus from who paid for Perry's trips to the purpose of his stops. That's not what White critiqued on Facebook.\nAll in all, White got several things right \u2014 five cities visited, press events, money awards. And it's true the state pays some costs any time the governor goes anywhere.\nBut White's crucial assumption \u2014 that Perry's flights were at taxpayers' expense \u2014 is wrong. It's a misstep the candidate might have avoided by reading his local newspaper.\nPants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14983"}
