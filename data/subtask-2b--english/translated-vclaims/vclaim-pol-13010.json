Deb. Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. - recently named President of the National Democratic Commission - the proposal of the Republic of Belarus, Paul Ryan, R-Wis, to make important changes in the functioning of medical care. At present, medical care for doctors and hospitals pays specific fees to the beneficiaries of the care they receive. The beneficiaries of medical care pay premiums for certain types of coverage, and workers contribute salary taxes. The Ryan Plan leaves medical care, as is the case for persons aged 55 and over. However, in 2022, new beneficiaries will be insured by private insurance companies instead of the Federal Government, although they will receive \"preliminary support\" - financial assistance from the Government to purchase insurance. People who need more health care will get more money. The plans will be sold on a \"market\" -- a virtual market -- and will comply with the standards set by the United States Office of Personnel Management, which runs the federal employee health benefit programme. The plan gradually raises the age of entitlement to medical care to 67 years and provides less support for high-income people. Medical care payments will increase but not at a rate that is expected to keep pace with the increase in medical costs. The House of Representatives approved Ryan &apos; s plan in a vote close to the party line, but recently pushed some Republicans against it, amid fears that voters would not be comfortable with its approach. Wazerman Schultz hit this point hard in her interview with the nation. \"As I said, the Republicans have a plan to end medical care as we know it. \"She said... They're gonna take people who are 55 years younger today and tell them, \"You know what? You're on your own. Go find private health insurance in the health insurance market. We'll throw you to the wolves and let the insurance companies deny you cover and drop you because of the preexisting circumstances. We'll give you X dollars, and you'll figure it out. \"These are the people who paid for their entire lives in the system, and they rely on that safety net.\" However, critics, including Weekly Standard, a provincial magazine, argued that Ryan's plan did not -- as Wasserman Schultz said -- \"Let insurance companies deny you coverage and drop you because of the circumstances before.\" We decided to take a look. We will begin by pointing out that the budget resolution is a non-binding proposal that has already died in the Senate. Therefore, any such plan can offer promises - such as any of the pre-existing barriers - without ensuring that those promises are fulfilled. However, the language used in Ryan &apos; s plan is clear: within 10 years, when Ryan &apos; s plan begins, anyone eligible for medical care under today &apos; s rules will be eligible to receive coverage under Ryan &apos; s plan. This is the language from the budget that cleared the house: \"Health plans that have chosen to participate in the exchange of medical care will agree to provide insurance to all medical care recipients - to avoid cherry selection and to ensure that the most satisfactory and expensive recipients of medical care have access to coverage.\" The Budget Office of Congress - a non-partisan agency working to break the numbers - took this promise on the face when it analysed the plan. In its description of the plan, the organization wrote that \"the beneficiaries of premium payments will choose between competing private insurance schemes operating on a new medical care exchange. These plans will have to comply with the entitlements standard established by the Office of Personnel Management. The plans will have to provide insurance to all persons eligible for medical care who apply and have to impose the same premiums on all registered persons at the same age. The premium payments will go directly from the government to the plans that people have chosen.\" Therefore, the decision itself and the CSO are in agreement: under Ryan's plan, insurance companies participating in the renewed medical care programme will not be able to deny you insurance of pre-existing circumstances. And when we called the office of Wasserman Schultz, a spokesman named Harry Sevogan said that Wasserman Schultz supported what she said. As supporting evidence, he provided a link to a paper prepared by Paul van de Wotter, a health policy specialist at the Liberal Centre for Budget and Policy Priorities. The paper analyses the medical care proposal developed by Ryan and Alice Rifflin, a democracy headed by the Bureau of Management and Budget and headed by President Bill Clinton. This proposal, which was issued in November 2010, is in many respects similar to the Ryan budget proposal approved by the House of Representatives. Van de Wotter (who did not respond to a query about this story) wrote that, at Ryan Rifflin's suggestion, \"the believers will certainly try to avoid the registered poor health (who cost much more), as the special plans of today do in the Medical Care Benefits Program.\" At the outset, we thought that the provisions of the Ryan-Rivlin plan had changed before the resolution went to the Chamber of Deputies. However, a look at Ryan Rifflin &apos; s own plan (a summary of two pages) shows that protection from pre-existing circumstances also exists - in identical language. \"Health plans that choose to participate in the medical care exchange must agree to provide insurance to all medical care recipients, thereby preventing cherry selection and ensuring that the most satisfactory and expensive medical care recipients have access to coverage,\" said the Rivlin-Ryan plan. So it looks like Ryan was consistent with the preexisting circumstances. Is there still a way to get this protection? Probably. \"There are always ways for believers to get around the ban on pre-existing conditions -- putting your office on the eighth floor of a building without an elevator, and putting it on the back burner. However, the same criticism applied to the Health Care Act approved by the Democraticly Controlled Congress and signed by Obama. \"There's nothing structural about Ryan's proposal that would make him more vulnerable to such evasion,\" Tanner said. In the meantime, just because potential beneficiaries cannot be prevented because of pre-existing circumstances does not mean that Ryan's plan will be a picnic in the park for them. Linda J. Bloomberg, a health policy specialist at the Centre to the Liberal Urban Institute, said that a plan that shifted a larger share of the costs to patients - as the Ryan plan was likely to do - could affect patients with previous chronic conditions. She said: \"A significant increase in cost-sharing effectively shifts more costs of providing care to those who use it most.\" This would increase the pressure on insurance companies to reduce expensive treatments, at least within the limits of federal rules. Asserman Schultz is free to criticize Ryan's plan for any number of reasons, but in its suspension, she went too far. Both the budget plan approved by the House of Representatives and its predecessor, Ryan Rifflin, specifically indicated that coverage could not be prevented by a pre-existing situation. It might be easier to say that you'll bar the patients \"cherry choose\" than it is to put them into practice, but Ryan made his intentions constantly clear. We assess her statement wrong. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: 2 February 2021 Correction: This version of the story corrects that the President cannot object to the budget decision.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13010"}
