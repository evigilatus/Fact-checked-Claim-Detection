Did Planned Parenthood\u2019s chief executive admit that 86 percent of its revenues come from abortions?\nBoth the figure and Loesch\u2019s description of the events surrounding it are flawed. We\u2019ll explain why.\nThe House hearing\nLoesch is describing the Sept. 29 meeting of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which included some tough questioning of Richards.\nAt one point, Rep. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., asked Richards a series of questions about the number of Planned Parenthood\u2019s clinics, whether it conducts mammograms (Planned Parenthood typically refers women to outside clinics for those), and the claim that just 3 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s services are abortion-related.\nLummis asked Roberts about Planned Parenthood\u2019s 2013-14 annual report, which she said included statistics that abortions \"would have been over 86 percent of your non-government revenue.\"\n\"How do you explain this massive disparity between the amount of revenue you collect from abortion, and the fact that you only report 3 percent of your services being abortion?\" Lummis asked.\nWe have to stop and make clear that Lummis asked about non-government revenue, which is not what Loesch tweeted. (Loesch could have made that distinction and kept within her 140-character limit, in case you were wondering.)\nDropping the words \"non-government\" make a major difference, which we will discuss in a moment. But first back to Richards\u2019 answer.\nRichards at first responded by saying those numbers are not connected because federal money doesn\u2019t cover abortions. (That\u2019s correct, except in cases of Medicaid funds in instances of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother). Lummis then pressed for how many Planned Parenthood affiliates receive the majority of their revenue from abortion, and Richards said she didn\u2019t know but would talk to her team about getting the answer.\nThen Richards went back to Lummis\u2019 original question and said, \"But I do think it's important to understand that abortion procedures are probably more expensive than some other procedures that we \u2014 that we provide, which might, you know, might explain what you're trying to get at.\"\nYou can read the complete transcript here. But what\u2019s clear in our reading is that Richards\u00a0conceded nothing other than that abortions are relatively expensive procedures compared to Planned Parenthood\u2019s other works.\nA different line of inquiry came up on this point in the third hour of the hearing. Rep. Steve Russell, R-Okla., tried to ask Richards how much revenue comes from abortion services, but she said she couldn\u2019t give him a ballpark.\nThen Russell walked through an estimate for how he extrapolated the revenue that abortion brings in. He used Planned Parenthood\u2019s own estimates for a surgical abortion (up to $1,500) and the abortion pill (up to $800), and then multiplied each by the number of reported abortions (over 327,000) to get a range of $261 million to $491 million in ballpark revenue from those procedures.\nDepending on the cost used, the ballpark abortion revenues \"would come to 40 percent or 22 percent\" of total revenue reported by Planned Parenthood affiliates of $1.145 billion in 2013-14, Russell said. (This method has been used by anti-abortion groups over the years.)\nNow we\u2019re from 86 percent to 40 or 22 percent. Either way, Richards interrupted, saying that was inaccurate.\n\"What was inaccurate is, I think, what you reported in terms of what the cost of an abortion,\" Richards said. \"Obviously, it varies state to state. So I can't say. But I think your, I think your number was high.\"\nUnpacking the 86 percent\nThe major problem with all the figures and statistics about what Planned Parenthood does and doesn\u2019t do is that Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t provide much detail for fact-checkers and observers to analyze.\nThat gets critics in trouble when they exaggerate the available data, as in this case with Loesch.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how Planned Parenthood Federation of America\u2019s 2013-14 annual report presents its revenues:\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\nAffiliates\n\n\n\n\nNon-Government Health Services Revenue\n\n\n$305.3 million\n\n\n\n\nGovernment Health Services Grants & Reimbursements\n\n\n$528.4 million\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Contributions and Bequests\n\n\n$257.4 million\n\n\n\n\nOther Operating Revenue\n\n\n$54.7 million\n\n\n\n\nTotal Revenue\n\n\n$1.15\u00a0billion\n\n\n\n\nThis doesn\u2019t tell us much, specifically if you\u2019re trying to answer how much revenue is generated by abortion services.\nThe first column of numbers represents money brought in from Planned Parenthood\u2019s network of affiliates around the country.\nThe top line is for non-government health services revenue, $305.3 million (which would include abortions, as well as STD testing, pregnancy tests, etc.). Of course, there are more sources of revenue than that. The lines below describe $528.4 million in federal reimbursements for services from low-income patients on Medicaid, as well as $257.4 million raised in private contributions and bequests.\nThe only possible way to get to 86 percent is to ignore those other sources of revenues, which account for more than 70 percent of everything Planned Parenthood takes in.\nThe figure Lummis quoted is based on the assumption that of the $305 million in non-government health services revenue, $262.1 million comes from abortion procedures (Planned Parenthood\u2019s $800 top-end estimate for an abortion pill multiplied by 327,653 abortions performed).\nThat\u2019s not a precise way of measuring things because abortion costs vary by state and provider. Average costs reported to members of the National Abortion Federation, the professional association of abortion providers which counts some Planned Parenthood affiliates among its members, put the costs of an abortion lower, in some cases, at $500 for pregnancies 12 weeks and earlier (a mix of medication and in-clinic abortions at that stage), $1,000 between 16-18 weeks, and $2,000 after 20 weeks.\nAs we pointed out, Loesch\u2019s dropping of the words \"non-government\" makes some of this analysis academic.\nLoesch significantly overplays any validity to Lummis\u2019 estimate by simply referring to revenue. A Florida legislator in 2011 made the\u00a0same mistake.\nApplying Lummis\u2019 estimate of $262.1 million from abortions to Planned Parenthood\u2019s total $1.3 billion in revenue shows a lower estimated figure for the share of profits from abortions at 20 percent. (Even Russell\u2019s statement in the hearing, which Richards said was wrong without saying why, put the share of abortion services toward revenue at 22-40 percent.)\nWe\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t note that the people who could shed the most light on these figures, Planned Parenthood, haven\u2019t provided any clarifying information. Loesch provided no additional evidence to support her claim.\nOur ruling\nLoesch said Richards was \"forced to concede that 86 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s revenue is from abortion.\"\nAt a U.S. House hearing, Richards said abortions are expensive compared to other health services offered by Planned Parenthood. But we found no evidence of her saying, or conceding, that 86 percent of revenue is from abortion. At one point in the same meeting, she said an even lower estimate for abortion revenues was \"too high.\"\nOn top of that, Loesch describes the reported statistic incorrectly by dropping \"non-government.\" \u00a0That phrase makes all the difference.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05890"}
