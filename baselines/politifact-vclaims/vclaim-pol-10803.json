When you think about the federal government taking $1.2 trillion out of the private sector to fund government operations, you can see what's wrong with our economy.\"\n\nHenck: \"Aren't they taking that from the Chinese? They're borrowing that money, aren't they, Congressman?\"\n\nNeumann: \"They are borrowing that money and that's the point exactly. If they did not borrow that money, that money would be available out here in the private sector for entrepreneurs and business people to put to work creating jobs and building and expanding their businesses.\n\n\"As it is -- and listen, I'm a business owner myself, I've been in business for 35 years here in Wisconsin creating Wisconsin jobs -- and the reality is, I understand that I'm now competing against the federal government to borrow money to expand our businesses. We just expanded into the Madison market to the Dane County area with our business and it was a monumental task to arrange the financing to do that because the federal government is taking $1.2 trillion first, before any of us entrepreneurs get to compete to borrow money.\"\n\nWe called Neumann to ask him to elaborate on the relation between borrowing done by the federal government and borrowing done by an individual or business on Main Street. He repeatedly said that if the U.S. government didn\u2019t run annual deficits of about $1.2 trillion, necessitating the borrowing, that money would be available to businesses and individuals.\n\nOther views\n\nWe asked five experts about Neumann\u2019s argument.\n\n\"This is a fairly straightforward, almost master of the obvious-type statement,\" said J.D. Foster, senior fellow in the economics of fiscal policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C.\n\nMoney is loaned first to the U.S. government because it is considered \"the riskless borrower,\" and the money the U.S. borrows isn\u2019t available to others, he said.\n\nOK, the same dollar can only be loaned one time. But does U.S. borrowing, as Neumann claims, leave less money for businesses?\n\nNot according to the other experts.\n\n\"The U.S. government and American entrepreneurs are not running after the same pool of money,\" said Abdur Chowdhury, chairman of the economics department at Marquette University in Milwaukee. The U.S. borrows largely from overseas -- by selling securities -- while domestic businesses borrow mostly from domestic banks, he said.\n\nThe notion that the amount of federal borrowing limits money available to be loaned to businesses \"is absurd on its face,\" said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.\n\n\"Every single measure of the interest rate (Aaa bonds, Baa bonds, mortgage loans, car loans etc.) is lower today than at any point in the (George W.) Bush administration,\" he said by email. \"If government borrowing were pulling money away from businesses, it would be by pushing up interest rates.\"\n\nBarry Bosworth, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, agreed. Neumann\u2019s statement \"makes little sense right now because the basic problem is the opposite -- no one wants to borrow, and hence interest rates are near zero. \u00a0If we could get more people to borrow and invest, the economy would quickly recover,\" he said.\n\nBosworth, a former adviser to Democratic President Jimmy Carter, said Neumann\u2019s claim might have been true prior to 1970, when \"capital markets were closed at the borders.\" But since the 1990s capital markets are global and U.S. government borrowing doesn\u2019t \"crowd out\" businesses seeking capital, he said.\n\nAndrew Reschovsky, professor of public affairs and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that among other reasons, Neumann is proven wrong by \"basic economics.\"\n\nIncreased federal borrowing should increase demand for money and raise interest rates, which would discourage businesses from borrowing, but interest rates have been at or near historic lows, he said.\n\nOur rating\n\nNeumann said that if the federal government didn't borrow $1.2 trillion every year \"to fund government operations,\" that money would be available \"for entrepreneurs and business people to put to work creating jobs and building and expanding their businesses.\"\n\nWhile it\u2019s true you can only lend the same dollar once, the consensus among experts we consulted is that the level of federal government borrowing does not leave less money available for businesses to borrow -- or as Marquette\u2019s Chowdhury put it: \"It\u2019s not a zero-sum game.\"\n\nWe rate Neumann\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10803"}
