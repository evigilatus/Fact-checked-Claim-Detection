Greg Abbott warned afresh about Soros in a fundraising letter, opening: \"Every weapon in the national Democrat machine\u2019s arsenal is aimed straight at Texas today.\"\nAbbott\u2019s April 2, 2018, letter states next: \"Left-wing BILLIONAIRE George Soros has already unloaded a whopping $1 million to install his liberal puppets in positions of power this fall.\"\nThe letter warns that Democrats are preparing an all-out assault and could seize control of the state at the ballot box. \"I know,\" the letter further says, that \"left-wing special interests and BILLIONAIRE liberals like George Soros are pouring outrageous sums of money into driving up Democrat turnout.\"\nAfter we didn\u2019t hear back from Abbott about his basis for the \"puppets\" claim, we decided to check state, local and federal\u00a0records for indications of Soros unpacking lucre\u00a0to help Texas Democrats win election in 2018.\nSoros helped a Bexar County Democrat\nFrom the top, we knew\u00a0that Soros invested significantly in a group that backed a successful challenger to the Bexar County district attorney. Attorney Joe Gonzales bested first-term incumbent Nicholas \"Nico\" LaHood in Bexar County\u2019s Democratic primary after Soros contributions propelled a pro-Gonzales political committee.\nOf note: Soros boosted the pro-Gonzales committee a couple of years after Soros put more than $1.4 million into electing Democrat Kim Ogg as the district attorney of Harris County. An October 2016 Houston Chronicle news story pointed out that Soros had similarly put his money into district attorney races in Florida, Illinois, Mississippi and New Mexico, each time through state-specific PACs with variations on the name \"Safety and Justice.\" The story also said Soros had supported criminal justice reforms including reduced racial disparities in sentencing and relaxed marijuana restrictions.\nIn San Antonio, LaHood chalked up his loss to Soros\u2019s spending, the San Antonio Express-News reported. \"In my opinion, the voters were unfairly influenced by $1 million worth of lies,\" LaHood said. \"There's no other way to say it.\"\nGonzales has yet to win the DA post; he\u2019s set to face Republican Tylden Shaeffer on this November's\u00a0ballot.\nFor his part, Gonzales said after his primary win that Soros\u2019 contributions came without strings attached. \"There was a clear understanding from the beginning that we would accept their contributions, but we were not going to be told how to run this office,\" Gonzales said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Express-News spreadsheet tallies contributions by Soros to Texas Justice & Public Safety, the political committee supportive of Gonzales. According to the sheet, which was based on Gonzales\u2019 campaign finance reports filed with the county elections department on Jan. 17, Feb. 5 and Feb. 26, 2018, the committee made $964,377 worth of in-kind contributions to Gonzales\u2019 campaign from Dec. 18, 2017, through Feb. 23, 2018, mostly in TV ads and voter mailings but also in polling, research and palm cards.\nGonzales\u2019 campaign directly fielded no Soros contributions, the filings indicate.\nMultiple Democratic beneficiaries?\nAbbott\u2019s fundraising letter warns of Soros spending money to install\u00a0\"puppets.\"\nTo gauge whether Soros chose multiple Texas Democrats to help, we conducted online searches of candidate and political committee finance reports filed with \u00a0the Texas Ethics Commission and Federal Election Commission.\nPreviously, our 2017 search of campaign finance reports filed with the ethics commission from 2000 into 2017 indicated Soros hadn\u2019t personally donated to candidates for state office--not once. Similarly, our fresh search of state records yielded no indication of Soros spending on races besides the Bexar County battle for the Democratic nomination for district attorney. In pre-primary reports, we found, the pro-Gonzales Texas Justice & Public Safety committee reported fielding $1.04 million in Soros contributions.\nAccording to our separate search of campaign reports filed with the FEC, Soros made 49 contributions nationally from February 2017 into March 2018, totaling $4,587,000.\nBut, our search suggests, very little went to Texas Democrats. We identified a single Soros\u00a0contribution to a Texas candidate. Soros\u00a0gave\u00a0$2,700 on Dec. 1, 2017\u00a0to Democratic U.S. Senate hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke, the El Paso congressman.\nOur ruling\nAbbott warned in his letter that Soros has spent $1 million to \"install his liberal puppets in positions of power\" in Texas this fall.\nWe confirmed Soros spending\u00a0in Texas, but he's yet to put a penny toward Democrats seeking\u00a0state office. The New Yorker gave a little more than $1 million to a committee that helped a challenger win the\u00a0Democratic nod for Bexar County district attorney. He\u00a0gave $2,700 to O\u2019Rourke, who went on to win the Democratic Senate nomination.\nAll told, we rate this claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
