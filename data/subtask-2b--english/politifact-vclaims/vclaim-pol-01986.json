(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nLooking past the bluster of the headline, the story largely checks out.\nGovernment officials have credited National Guard troops at the border for contributing to the apprehension of 1,600 people, the capture of about 1,000 pounds of marijuana and 451 \"turn backs\" of individuals seeking to come into the United States illegally, CNN reported May 9, based on a conference call with CBP and National Guard officials.\nThe Viral WDC story cites a Washington Examiner story that said, \"U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers have apprehended an additional 1,600 people attempting to illegally enter the country from Mexico since April 15 as a result of the deployment of National Guard troops to the southwest border.\"\nNeither Viral WDC nor the Washington Examiner say what the 1,600 number is in addition to. The way the Viral WDC story is written suggests that 1,600 would not have been apprehended if the National Guard wasn\u2019t assisting. But there\u2019s no evidence to support that.\nCNN said a CBP official \"did not have comparison numbers available, so it was not possible to determine if those figures were substantially more than if National Guard troops had not been dispatched to the border.\"\nTotal apprehensions were up in April compared to March, but border apprehensions have been increasing since February. There were about 37,400 southwest border apprehensions in March, compared to approximately 38,300 in April, according to CBP.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump on April 4 issued a memorandum so that the National Guard could help immigration officials stop the illegal entry of immigrants and illicit drugs.\nIt\u2019s important to note that the National Guard is not actually apprehending individuals. Instead, they are carrying out non-enforcement roles, serving as pilots, aerial observers, intelligence analysts, communications specialists, camera operators and vehicle mechanics.\nDefense Secretary James N. Mattis authorized the use of Defense Department funds to send up to 4,000 National Guard troops to the southern border to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He authorized the deployment through Sept. 30, the end of fiscal year 2018.\nThe troops are deployed under Title 32 duty status, meaning they are under the command and control of their state governors but paid by the federal government and can undertake \"Homeland Defense activities.\"\nThere are now more than 1,800 National Guard troops who deployed starting in early April, U.S. Customs and Border protection spokesman Daniel Hetlage told PolitiFact on June 6.\nOur ruling\nA Viral WDC story said, \"National Guard storms Mexico border, makes game-changing impact in just 30 days.\"\nOfficials have said that the deployment of the National Guard to the border has contributed to the apprehension of 1,600 people.
