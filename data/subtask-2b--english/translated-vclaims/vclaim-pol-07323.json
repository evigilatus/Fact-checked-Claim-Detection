The account, written by a man named Ted Petrona, describes how 11 passengers \"with complete Islamic clothing\" on Air Tran flight 297 from Atlanta to Houston made the flight cancelled. Petrona claims that one of the men called the host of the \"infidel dog,\" that two of the men were showing \"presenting a porn video they recorded the night before,\" and that all 11 men yelled at the air crew in Arabic. In the end, Petrona says that TSA agents searched men's bags, and when they allowed them to return to the plane, a large number of passengers left the plane so that the flight was cancelled. \"The terrorists wanted to see how the Department of Transport Security dealt with them, Petrona wrote. Only Fox News mentioned that the flight was cancelled, says Petrona, and even covered the real \"threat.\" A corrupting warning: Petrona's report is a bluff, not a new one either. The aircraft in question flew on November 17, 2009. In this fact-checking, we will explain the origin of this conspiracy theory, and then reveal it again for good measurement. Remember the e-mail chain? We contacted Dwayne Chassion, the man who published the Petrona report on Facebook literally as it appeared in 2009, but did not hear his response. After we sent him a letter, Chassion deleted the article from his Facebook account. On the day after flight 297, Fox News published a brief article from Associated Press indicating that flight 297 left for Houston two and a half hours late. According to AP, \"a crew member asked a passenger to turn off his phone,\" the passenger didn't, and then the pilot brought the plane back to the gate and \"the passenger asked to get out of the plane.\" Apparently, the guy didn't speak English -- he and a bunch of other 11 people were traveling with an interpreter -- and he was looking at pictures either on his phone or on a camera. The entire group of 13 men left the plane when the pilot returned to the gate, but after some discussions with airport officials, the men were allowed to return to the plane. The delay of two and a half hours caused the original flight crew to exceed the established working hours. So Air Tran drowned in a new flight crew and left for Houston without incident -- minus 12 original passengers who, apparently, were uncomfortable, chose later flights. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2012, which is somewhat like the story of Petrona, but the journey was not cancelled and there were certainly no Arab curses or homemade porn. Within a few days of flight 297, Petrona &apos; s e-mail started trading. In the end, I reached the websites of Governor Glen Beck and Debbie Schlossel. When Air Tran obtained wind from Petrona &apos; s e-mail, they issued a rebuttal of each point. In short, Petrona was not even on board because his flight was late. Petrona later admitted that he had decorated the details and that he was only going to calculate for \"some friends.\" None of the other passengers supported Petrona &apos; s assertion that the flight had been cancelled. One said the passenger was a Muslim -- but another said he was actually speaking Spanish. According to a priest who arrived late but who boarded the plane after returning to the gate, a passenger said that \"12 men from the Middle East stood up and started dancing and singing with an Arabic accent.\" However, no other passenger confirmed this either. In both cases, flight 297 came out of the ground, and although it might have been a tense journey, Petrona's novel was false at the time, and it is now false. Our judgment on Petrona's 2009 account for \"dry terrorist running\" leading to a canceled flight is a viral spread on Facebook. According to Petrona, 11 Muslim men were so uncooperative with their air hosts that flight 297 from Atlanta to Houston was cancelled. But the airline, the other passengers from the flight, and Associated Press didn't all agree. Petrona, even though he was originally scheduled for the trip, he never came up. In fact, the man who may or may not have been of Muslim origin did not speak English well enough to understand the flight attendant's instructions to turn off his phone. The account of Petrona is outdated and inaccurate. This claim values the pants of fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07323"}
