However, in the presidential debate in Milwaukee, Carly Fiorena made a particularly strong statement on the ineffectiveness of the law. \"Look, I'm a cancer survivor, okay?\" I told Fiorina Director Maria Barteromo of the Fox Business Network. \"I understand that you can't have a cancer killer who just became known as a case before. I understand you can't let families go bankrupt if they really need help. But I also understand that Obamacker isn't helping anyone.\" Our staff did not respond to any query, but during the discussion they mentioned a number of problems they faced in dealing with the law. She said, \"It's mad capitalism in its worst case.\" Who helped write this bill? Drug companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies. Health insurance has always been a comfortable little game between regulators and health insurance companies. Fiorina also said that \"Obamakari is crushing small businesses, and it does not help families that were to be helped. So, let's let the states manage high-risk complexes. Let's try the only thing in health insurance we've never tried, the free market. Let us ensure, as patients, and as customers, that we have information to market wisely for our health care.\" There can be reasonable arguments against the law and its many provisions. But isn't anyone getting any real help from the law? We decided to take a closer look. The following are some of the provisions of the Act and estimates of the number of persons who have benefited from each of them. The estimates are from Charles Gabba, who spent several years grinding figures to use the law in ACAsignups.net. The estimates for Gabba were in progress until November 2015 unless noted: Americans currently have a record of policies purchased on ACA Online: 9.5 million people, of whom about 8 million are receiving benefits under the law. Another 2.5 million people were registered in these policies during 2015, but this number has since declined. \u2022 Net number of Americans added to Medicaid due to the law: 15 million. This includes 10 million people added through the direct expansion of the Medicaid programme under the law, 4 million new beneficiaries, although already qualified, registered in the Medicaid programme after the adoption of the Medical Assistance Act, and about 1 million people transferred to the Medicaid programme from existing State programmes. \u2022 Number of young adults between 19 and 26 years of age who have been able to remain in parental security because of the law: probably from 1 million to 3 million, but the figures often change, and it is difficult to obtain a fixed figure. Of the 25 million plus of these three categories, Gaba estimates that some 17 million are specifically new to the law - about 5 million through exchange, 11 million through Medicaid, and 1 million other diversified insurance. There are several other ways in which people benefit: Americans are no longer at risk of being deprived of coverage because of the conditions that existed before: as previously reported by the Poletti Fact newspaper, between 19 per cent and 50 per cent of Americans are in this category, or between 60 million and 160 million people. \u2022 Americans are no longer at risk of being expelled from policies aimed at creating costly medical conditions: smaller than the previous categories, but unknown. There is some overlap between these categories. But whatever the number is, it's in tens of millions -- and most of these people, Gabba said, \"They won't agree that it's not helping anyone.\" \"On January 10, 2021, recorders mentioned the \"Trap refers to the insurgency law - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\" \u2022 On 11 January 2021, Jonathan Oberlander, a professor at the Department of Health Policy and Management of the University of North Carolina-Chabil Hill, added two additional categories of Americans who benefited from the ACA programme: beneficiaries of part D of the medical care programme, who receive better coverage of prescription drugs: 39 million beneficiaries of the medical care programme are enrolled in the programme. These and other beneficiaries of medical care also receive new benefits, such as free preventive examinations and annual welfare examinations. \u2022 Americans with private insurance who now have access to prophylaxis services free of charge: unknown, but likely in millions. Another way to look at it holistically is to measure the net effect on national rates of non-insurance. This graph of the Kaiser Foundation for the Family shows: \"This statement is absolute bullshit. Simply put, it's a massive exaggeration that amounts to a lie, \"Oberlander said. \"You can certainly discuss overall influence and Obama's desirability of care. But to say that it does not help anyone is to ignore reality and overwhelming evidence on the contrary.\" Policy experts who confuse or openly oppose the law say that some of these benefits were too expensive, or left a number of people more harmful than they helped much. For example, Gail Whelinski, who managed medical care and Medicaid under the supervision of President George H.W. Bush, who provided informal advice to the Bush Pocket Presidential Campaign in 2016, said that the law brought out many of the more limited schemes of catastrophic benefits and coverage that the beneficiaries might have loved, forcing them to pay for more expensive policies. \"This was a problem for people who exceeded 300 per cent of the poverty line and received small subsidies, and a real problem for people who exceeded 400 per cent of the poverty line and who did not receive any support,\" Whelinski said. Michael Tanner, a scientist at the Kato Institute, said that there were both winners and losers, and that he expected \"the losers outnumber the winners.\" However, Welinski and Tanner agreed that Fiorina went away to say that Obamakari wasn't helping anyone. \"People on extended Medicaid or who were previously insecure and heavily supported in the exchange are better off than they were,\" said Whelinski, \"even if they may or may not be as well as they may be.\" Tanner added that despite his defeat with the law, \"You can't honestly say that no one benefited. Even if you think that the former uninsured pay a lot for bad policies under the anti-corruption law, as I do, I don't think you can say that none of them benefited at all. This is a very low bar, of course. If you fly across the country to throw money off a plane, some people will benefit.\" Our verdict, Fiorina, said Obamakari wasn't helping anyone. Even with lower estimates, tens of millions of Americans have benefited from the Anti-Narcotics Act, in large ways (e.g. first-time insurance insurance) or smaller ways (less payment for medicines under part D of the medical care system). One does not have to accept every aspect of the law or feel comfortable with its overall price to recognize that many people have benefited from it. We appreciate Fiorena's statement of fire pants.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05743"}
