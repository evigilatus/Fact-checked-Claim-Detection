It offers four categories of achievement. From lowest to highest, they are \"below basic,\" \"basic,\" \"proficient,\" and \"advanced.\"\nThe two most relevant categories for this fact-check are basic and proficient, and neither level\u2019s definition mentions reading on grade level.\nBasic is defined as \"denoting partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade assessed.\nProficient is defined as \"representing solid academic performance for each grade assessed\" and \"competency over challenging subject matter, including subject-matter knowledge, application of such knowledge to real-world situations, and analytical skills appropriate to the subject matter.\"\nRubio is using the proficient level as his benchmark, and the picture that produces isn\u2019t pretty.\nIn 2015, just 36 percent of American fourth graders were categorized as either proficient or advanced in reading. Here\u2019s the chart:\n\nAnd that same year, just 34 percent of eighth graders rated as either proficient or advanced in reading. Here\u2019s the chart:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing that metric, Rubio supports his point. But education experts advised caution.\nMost important is that it\u2019s a bit of a stretch for Rubio to equate a NAEP rating of \"proficient\" with being \"at grade level.\"\n\"There is no commonly accepted definition for what \u2018grade level\u2019 performance is or should be,\" said Christopher B. Swanson, vice president of Editorial Projects in Education, which publishes Education Week.\nNAEP, he said, is developed independently of the knowledge required by any specific state, district or school.\nDavid Bills, a professor of education at the University of Iowa, agreed. \"As far as I know, no one has ever tested those labels against what kids actually need to know to do well in school,\" Bills said.\nIndeed, after the No Child Left Behind education law was enacted under President George W. Bush, \"each state had to choose a level of \u2018proficiency,\u2019 and on average, this came closer to the NAEP basic level,\" said Eric Hanushek, a senior fellow in education policy at the conservative Hoover Institution.\nIf this is the case, then one could instead use the \"basic\" level under NAEP and find that the success rates are 69 percent and 76 percent for fourth and eighth graders, respectively.\nStill, despite such words of caution, experts said Rubio\u2019s decision to use the \"proficient\" level as his benchmark was defensible. Experts also ratified Rubio\u2019s use of the NAEP tests as his data source.\n\"Sure, there are lots of problems and it\u2019s not a perfect measure, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s meaningless in all contexts,\" said Patricia M. Cooper, an associate professor and program coordinator for early childhood education at Queens College-City University of New York.\nThere aren\u2019t many credible alternatives to the NAEP numbers, she said.\nCooper added that even the best-case scenario isn\u2019t that great. \"Even if Rubio\u2019s off by half, that means one-third of our kids aren\u2019t reading on grade level,\" she said. \"Would that make us feel better?\"\nOur ruling\nRubio said that \"two-thirds of our kids can\u2019t read at grade level.\" The numbers from the NAEP reading test for fourth and eighth graders provide some support for his statement. However, experts said that there is no accepted definition of what being at \"grade level\" means under the NAEP tests. While Rubio's use of NAEP's higher \"proficient\" standard is a reasonable choice, experts said, it's not the only one -- many states have set standards aligned with NAEP's \"basic\" level instead.
