But the meme posted by Occupy Democrats, a progressive advocacy group, was based on false information that fooled social media users and TV talking heads alike.\n\"Fox \u2018News\u2019 just announced that they will not air Mueller\u2019s testimony about his report, which they claim \u2018exonerates\u2019 Trump,\" said the meme, which was posted to Facebook on July 22.\nThat\u2019s demonstrably false, as Fox News anchor Bret Baier pointed out on Twitter.\u00a0\nA Fox News press release issued earlier that day said Baier and fellow Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum will be leading the network\u2019s live coverage of Mueller\u2019s testimony before both the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee on July 24.\nOccupy Democrats eventually updated the meme, setting the record straight with a correction in its caption. But the meme had already been shared almost 5,000 times on Facebook.\nThe rumors claiming Fox News would be snubbing Mueller\u2019s testimony are a textbook example of how misinformation spreads online.\u00a0\nIt began with a now-deleted July 21 tweet from MSNBC contributor Joyce Vance, who said Fox News was not airing the testimony because President Donald Trump \"is afraid of what will happen if his base gets to hear Mueller\u2019s testimony for themselves.\"\nHours later, Vance deleted the tweet, saying it was \"intended ironically\" and apologizing for \"unintentionally misinforming people.\"\nBut the tweet had already left its mark, having racked up thousands of retweets from social media users, including some with large followings such as author Stephen King.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rumors also made their way to the TV screen, with GOP strategist Rick Wilson telling MSNBC\u2019s Nicole Wallace on July 22 that Fox News would be tuning out.\n\"Fox isn\u2019t covering the hearings, which should also tell you how scared they are of what could happen on this morning,\" Wilson said. \"It\u2019s going to be a very interesting and consequential moment. They\u2019re apparently not going to take them live. Everybody else is taking them live.\"\n\"Really?\" Wallace replied. Shortly after he got off air, Wilson corrected himself on Twitter, and Wallace retweeted his correction.\nThe next day,\u00a0former Democratic congresswoman Donna Edwards repeated the claim again on MSNBC, only to have anchor Stephanie Ruhle correct her.\n\"Actually, I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true, I think they are going to air it,\" Ruhle said.\nOccupy Democrats did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\nOur ruling\nA meme from Occupy Democrats said, \"Fox \u2018News\u2019 just announced that they will not air Mueller\u2019s testimony about his report.\"\nFox News announced its plan for airing the testimony live in a July 22 press release.\nWe rate this statement False.\nClarification:\u00a0This fact-check has been updated to clarify that Rick Wilson and Donna Edwards are MSNBC on-air guests, not MSNBC contributors.\u200b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00405"}
