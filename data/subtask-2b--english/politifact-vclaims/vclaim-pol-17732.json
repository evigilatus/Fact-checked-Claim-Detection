We know that,\" he continued. \"But to children and the vast majority of young and middle-aged adults and the vast majority of teachers, it poses virtually zero threat.\"\nThe risk of death from COVID-19 does increase with age and for people with underlying medical conditions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. The CDC\u2019s demographic data shows that older adults account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths.\nBut \"poses virtually zero threat\" is a loaded phrase, experts said. Carlson\u2019s language paints a black-and-white picture between death and full recovery. A lot can happen in between those two outcomes.\n\"COVID is definitely not \u2018zero threat\u2019 in any of these age groups,\" said Cindy Prins, a clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida.\nRELATED: Donald Trump\u2019s false claim that 99% of COVID-19 cases are harmless\nDeath is not the only bad outcome\nFox News pointed to a handful of studies, articles, state statistics and CDC model estimates that identified children and young adults as less likely to fall severely ill or die from the coronavirus. Case fatality rates do rise with age, a recent CDC report on U.S. cases through May 30 shows.\nDeath is the worst \u2014 but least likely \u2014 outcome for COVID-19 patients. Counting deaths and calculating fatality rates can be tricky, since deaths due to COVID-19 may be undercounted and epidemiologists still don\u2019t know the exact number of people who were infected.\nThe CDC provides age-related data as part of its provisional death counts, which lag by a few weeks because they are based on death certificates. The data through July 4 showed the breakdown of cumulative, confirmed COVID-19 deaths to look like this:\n\n\u00a0\n\"Among adults, the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk,\" the CDC says on its website.\u00a0\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s zero threat facing children and the other age groups. Healthy children can still get and spread the virus, although the CDC says children account for a relatively small share of cases. Working-age adults are susceptible to it, too.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED: Some COVID-19 deaths have been children\nIn fact, people between the ages of 18 and 64 represented roughly 75% of all U.S. COVID-19 cases as of July 12, according to CDC data.\nThe average age of teachers in 2017-18, the latest year for which data is available, was about 43 years old, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\u00a0\nAcross all schools, 15.1% of teachers were under age 30; 55.7% were ages 30 to 49; 11.6% were 50 to 54; and 17.6% were 55 or older.\nAndrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, is on a task force advising\u00a0a local school district in Orange County, where roughly 24% of COVID-19 deaths as of July 9 were patients between 25 and 64 years old.\n\"I'm thinking of teachers, teachers aides, school nurses, lunchroom staff, administrators, custodial staff and so on,\" Noymer wrote in an email. \"Twenty-four percent of county-wide mortality in this age group is hard to dismiss!\"\nAnd it\u2019s not just a matter of death versus no consequences. By most standards, for example, anything that results in a hospitalization has done significant damage. The likelihood of hospitalization rises with age, according to the CDC, but patients of all ages are at risk.\nUsing data from the recent CDC report on U.S. cases through May 30, we calculated that roughly 7.8% of U.S. COVID-19 patients under the age of 60 were hospitalized in that time, including about 5.3% of patients under 60 who reported no underlying medical conditions.\nThere\u2019s also plenty left to learn about the long-term effects of infection, experts said. Donald Thea, professor of global health at Boston University, told us that \"mild disease is oftentimes far from mild and can entail profound and prolonged disability.\"\nScientists suspect there could be links between mild cases and blood clots, chronic fatigue, strokes and other ailments in young people, according to reports.\u00a0\nDoctors have also found some cases in which children previously infected with COVID-19 have developed a rare condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\n\"The more and more we learn, we\u2019re seeing things about what this virus can do that we didn\u2019t see from the studies in China or in Europe,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, during a May 12 Senate hearing. \"I think we better be careful (that) we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects.\"\nWe also don\u2019t know how schools could change the spread and impact of the coronavirus, said Prins, the University of Florida epidemiologist. \"If you\u2019re opening up and sending kids back to school, you\u2019re under a whole different set of circumstances.\"\nOur ruling\nCarlson said, \"To children and the vast majority of young and middle-aged adults and the vast majority of teachers, (the coronavirus) poses virtually zero threat.\"\nThe risk of dying from COVID-19 does increase with age. But Carlson\u2019s claim that the virus \"poses virtually zero threat\" to the groups he identified ignores the possibility that people from those groups could still wind up sick, hospitalized or facing long-term health conditions.\nMany teachers are in the particularly vulnerable age groups.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17732"}
