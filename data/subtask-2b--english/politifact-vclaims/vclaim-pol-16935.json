In 1968, Hong Kong flu killed 1 to 4 million people. Swine flu caused 18,000 deaths, bird flu caused 75,000 deaths,\" the April 6, 2020, post says. \"All these viruses killed more people than coronavirus and yet they've never, ever shut anything down. So, what are the government not telling the public? Or, am I the only one confused by this?\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nAs for the number of deaths, the numbers in the Facebook post are correct with respect to one outbreak. All of the other numbers are largely inaccurate.\nMore importantly, it is too early to say what the final death toll will be for COVID-19. The pandemic is still raging and hasn\u2019t run nearly as long as the other four outbreaks.\n\"The coronavirus pandemic has just begun,\" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Health Security. \"The numbers for the influenza pandemics are their complete impact over a full season and therefore not comparable to the numbers that have accrued thus far for the coronavirus pandemic.\"\nWe\u2019ll cite the outbreaks as they are referred to by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0\nH2N2 virus pandemic: 1957-1958\nThis new influenza A, known as the Asian flu, was first reported in Singapore in February 1957, Hong Kong in April 1957 and in coastal cities in the United States in summer 1957, according to the CDC.\u00a0\nTotal estimated deaths: 1.1 million, roughly what the Facebook post claims, including 116,000 in the United States.\n1968 pandemic (H3N2 virus)\u00a0\nWhat the post calls the \"Hong Kong flu\" was an influenza A that is believed to have originated in Hong Kong and was first noted in the United States in September 1968, according to the CDC.\u00a0\nTotal estimated deaths, according to the CDC: 1 million, including 100,000 in the United States.\u00a0\nThe post claimed the figure was 1 million to 4 million, a range Britannica.com also uses. The encyclopedia doesn\u2019t cite a source for that range. Other sources, including GlobalSecurity.org, refer to 1 million deaths or in the range of 750,000 to 1 million deaths (Medscape medical website, Nieman Foundation for Journalism).\u00a0\u00a0\n2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm09 virus)\nThe H1N1 influenza virus was discovered in the United States in the spring of 2009 and spread around the world. The World Health Organization declared an end to the pandemic in August 2010, according to the CDC. It was originally referred to as \"swine flu\" because many genes in the virus were similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America.\nTotal estimated deaths: 151,700 to 575,400, far more than the 18,000 claimed in the post. An estimated 12,469 deaths occurred from April 2009 to April 2010 in the United States.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvian flu\nWhat the post refers to as \"bird flu\" was not a pandemic and is an outlier in this context. Says the CDC: Avian influenza A outbreaks occur in poultry from time to time, and some of those outbreaks have been associated with illness and death in people in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and the Near East. \"While very rare, some avian influenza A viruses have also caused illness in people in North America.\"\u00a0\nThe post claims 75,000 deaths from bird flu. But only 455 human deaths from avian influenza A (H5N1) were reported to the World Health Organization from 2003 to Jan. 20, 2020. None of the deaths were in the United States.\u00a0\nCoronavirus (COVID-19), 2019-2020\nThe coronavirus surfaced in China in late December. According to the World Health Organization, there were 67,594 deaths, including 8,358 in the United States, as of April 6, 2020, the date of the Facebook post.\nThere were 1,210,956 confirmed cases globally as of that date, which creates a case fatality rate of 5.6%.\nThat\u2019s up from a 3.4% rate cited by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization\u2019s director-general, at a news conference on the coronavirus on March 3, 2020.\nSo far, it\u2019s dramatically higher than the case fatality rates for the three pandemics listed in the Facebook post, all of which were in a range of 0.5% or less, according to the New England Journal of Medicine and Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and director of the Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University.\nBut the rate can vary considerably during an outbreak, the World Health Organization told us.\u00a0\nAt this relatively early stage, estimating the case fatality rate is difficult for several reasons, according to an article The Lancet, a British medical journal:\n\n\nThe virus and its clinical course are new, and we still have little information about them.\u00a0\n\n\nHealth care capacity and capability factors, including the availability of health-care workers, resources, facilities, and preparedness, affect outcomes.\n\n\nAn unknown number of COVID-19 cases are uncounted, including people with the virus who don\u2019t have symptoms, or people who are misdiagnosed.\n\n\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post that questions the lethality of COVID-19 cites specific figures in claiming that the Asian, Hong Kong, swine and bird flus each \"killed more people than coronavirus.\"\nThe post is correct on the number of people killed only for the Asian flu.\u00a0\nWhat the post calls the Asian, Hong Kong and swine flus each killed more people worldwide than COVID-19 has so far. But raw-number comparisons are meaningless, given that those pandemics each ran well over a year, and the COVID-19 outbreak is only four months old.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16935"}
