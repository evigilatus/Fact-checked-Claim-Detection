He told in an interview that he was told to make up information as he went along. This is on crucial information as we headed into an election season.\"\nThe report was also cited on Fox News\u2019 The Five and later on Hannity.\nWe decided to see if Buckmon is indeed a smoking gun about the reported 2012 fraud. We also wanted to learn a little bit more about how the unemployment rate is calculated and what impact a Census Bureau employee can have.\nThe 'Post' report\nThe original New York Post report from columnist John Crudele essentially reaches the same conclusion as Hasselbeck, though perhaps not as definitively. Using an unnamed source, Crudele builds a case that Census Bureau workers were told by their supervisors to help drive down the unemployment rate ahead of the 2012 presidential election.\nThe source also handed over a piece of evidence -- the case of Census Bureau worker Julius Buckmon.\nBuckmon was part of a Census Bureau team that helped collect information used to calculate the unemployment rate, which is based on a survey of about 60,000 households. The Census Bureau is in charge of the people who ask the questions. The data is then collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the Labor Department, which in turn creates monthly employment statistics.\nBuckmon said he made up at least some of his results instead of surveying households. Buckmon told the Post about a conversation with his supervisor at the bureau.\n\"It was a phone conversation \u2014 I forget the exact words \u2014 but it was, \u2018Go ahead and fabricate it\u2019 to make it what it was,\" Buckmon said.\nThe problem for Hasselbeck is that Buckmon wasn\u2019t working for the Census Bureau in 2012.\nAccording to the Post, the alleged incident he described took place in 2010. Buckmon left the Census Bureau in August 2011, Census Bureau officials told us.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo Hasselbeck incorrectly overlapped Buckmon\u2019s story with the rest of the Post article, which relies on an anonymous source.\n(Buckmon did not return our calls seeking comment.)\nThe unemployment report\nTo be clear, we cannot say if the Post article is correct in its other points. But experts we spoke with agreed that it would be extremely difficult to alter the nationwide unemployment rate.\nWilliam Shobe, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Studies at the University of Virginia and head of the Virginia chapter of the Association for University and Business Economic Research, said it\u2019s important to remember that there are many measures of unemployment, including privately produced surveys.\n\"And they all agree, within the margins of error,\" Shobe said. \"The immediate conclusion that you can draw from that is that no rogue interviewer or group of rogue interviewers have managed to budge the unemployment far (or at all, mind you) from the value it would have had otherwise.\"\nShobe added that any effort to fudge the national numbers would require the participation of interviewers across the country.\n\"Otherwise you would see only a localized move which would wash out as noise in the national stats,\" Shobe said.\nFormer Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Katharine Abraham backs up Shobe\u2019s point. Abraham, who served as commissioner from 1993-2001 under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said that the typical interviewer handles between 35 and 55 households. That would translate to anywhere between about 1,000 and 1,700 interviewers to cover 60,000 households.\n\"Even if an interviewer made up all of his or her interviews,\" Abraham said, \"each interviewer's share of the full sample is small enough that it would be rather unlikely for the made-up interviews to have affected the topside unemployment numbers at all.\"\nIn addition, Abraham said the Census Bureau doesn\u2019t trust its staff blindly. It has a regular and random process of going back to the same households that were interviewed and interviewing them again.\nAs for the drop in the unemployment rate that led to suspicions of manipulation, Abraham remembers the popular reaction at the time, but says the monthly numbers can jump around.\n\"It's just not that surprising that, in the context of an unemployment rate that was generally trending downwards, there would be months when it took a big drop,\" Abraham said.\nWe should note that the Post story has gained traction beyond the media. Rep, Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chair of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter to the head of the Census Bureau, saying he found the allegations \"shocking.\" Issa told the bureau to deliver many documents, including emails to or from Buckmon and any investigations of alleged falsification of data.\nOur ruling\nHasselbeck said Julius Buckmon was \"on one side of the scale\" and his fabricated interviews helped push the unemployment rate lower in September 2012. Buckmon did not work for the Census Bureau in 2012 and even if he had, people familiar with the workings inside the bureau doubt it would have made a difference. If he had slanted all of his reports to show a brighter employment picture, he would have likely been found out. If he slanted a smaller number, it would have no statistical impact.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08591"}
