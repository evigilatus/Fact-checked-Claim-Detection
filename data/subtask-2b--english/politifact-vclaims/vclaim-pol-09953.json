(In the state Senate, control flipped from the Democrats to the GOP).\n\nIs it possible Assembly Democratic Party candidates ran up a vote advantage while losing more than 60 percent of the races?\n\nPasch\u2019s office said she got the figure from a Nov. 13, 2012 opinion piece authored by State Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate and published in the Journal Sentinel. Tate said when the final vote tallies were confirmed, the margin would be \"close to 200,000\" in favor of Democrats.\n\nLosing the popular vote while winning a big majority would be unusual.\n\nIn the 2010 Assembly races, for example, the GOP took control of the Assembly and Senate before temporarily losing the Senate after recall elections in 2011.\n\nThat year state GOP Assembly candidates ran up a 263,000 vote edge over their Democratic counterparts. Republicans won 57% of the votes, collectively, in the Assembly races across the state.\n\nThe two elections before that, in 2008 and 2006, saw the opposite: Democrats picked up seats. And in doing so, they ran up a huge majority of the collective vote in Assembly races, more than 60 percent in both cases, according to research by Scot Ross, executive director of the liberal political group One Wisconsin Now.\n\nSo what about 2012?\n\nWe crunched district-by-district numbers from the official results reported on the state Government Accountability Board website.\n\nAnd we found the historical trend flipped on its head.\n\nWe counted a 174,000-vote edge for Democrats in the 99 races in the final tally.\n\nStatewide the Democrats won 53 percent of the 2.7 million votes cast in those local Assembly races, compared to 46 percent for Republicans, we found. The rest went to independents and other parties.\n\nDemocrats blame the new redistricting plan, pushed through by Republicans for packing Democratic officeholders into supermajority districts and giving the GOP a majority of redrawn, conservative-leaning areas. Pasch called it a \"gerry-mandate.\"\n\nA Republican political strategist, Mark Graul, owner of Arena Strategy Group, said he thinks redistricting was a factor but that in some districts Republicans simply outperformed their Democratic Party counterparts.\n\nIn this item, we\u2019re not evaluating Pasch\u2019s claim that \"Republicans cannot claim a mandate\" in light of the Democratic vote majority. Her assertion struck us, and experts we consulted, as an opinion statement.\n\nBut here are a few additional facts that help explain the vote totals and put the results in context.\n\nBehind the popular vote figures that Democrats cite are some stark figures that favor the GOP. If you look just at contested Assembly races featuring both a Republican and a Democrat, the GOP won 56 of 74 matchups. That\u2019s 76 percent.\n\nIn the 74 contested races, Republican outpolled Democrats by 155,000 votes. The overall Democratic edge in all races traces to the party\u2019s 329,000 vote edge in races where only one party or another was on the ballot.\n\nAs you might guess from those figures, Democrats dominated the uncontested races, including in Pasch\u2019s district in Milwaukee and suburban Shorewood.\n\nRepublicans wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t field a candidate in a whopping 21 districts (most in vote-rich Milwaukee and Dane Counties), while Democrats fielded a contender in all but four. That\u2019s a big switch from two years earlier, in 2010, when it was Democrats who sat out more races.\n\nIn fielding so many candidates, Democrats might have been hoping to goose turnout in other races, said Mordecai Lee, a University of Wisconsin Milwaukee political scientist elected five times as a Democrat in the state Assembly and Senate in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nOur rating\n\nPasch, citing Democratic Party research based on unofficial and preliminary vote data, claimed that \"Assembly Democratic candidates actually received 200,000 more votes statewide\" despite Republicans winning more than 60 percent of the seats.\n\nThe final, certified election results showed a 174,000 edge for Democrats, despite the fact they won only 39 seats.\n\nWe think that her statement rates a Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09953"}
