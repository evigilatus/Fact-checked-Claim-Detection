Rick Scott's position on out-of-history migration", "text": "An offensive announcement on Facebook shows a family of Hispanics sitting around the dinner table. :: Rick Scott &apos; s immigration policies. \"This is our family, but if Rick Scott is his way he'll encourage racial profiling of immigrant communities here in Florida,\" said the Narrator. He also opposed allowing dreams to stay in the United States. Families belong to each other. Rick Scott turned his back on us.\" Two democratic groups, the American Labour Organization and the majority party in the Senate, paid for the announcement and posted it on the Facebook page, Nuestra Firelanda, translated into Florida. \"Scott, a two-state Republican governor who defies American democracy, Bill Nelson. The main text above the video gives a hint that the reference was to Scott's earlier statements (emphasizing our statements): \"Rick Scott undertook to implement the laws of racial profiling in Florida and wanted to exclude dreams from citizenship.\" But this attack is a cherry choice. Scott has relaxed his attitude towards illegal immigration for years and no longer holds such posts. Did Scott encourage racial profiling of migrants? This attack is misleading. Microprints show that they refer to a position taken by Scott during the Elementary GOP in 2010. The video mentions a series of the 2010 Time magazine article on the 2010 Florida Governor &apos; s Race. He says, \"Scott prefers Arizona's strict law against illegal immigration.\" Scott then promised to bring to Florida a law similar to SB 1070 in Arizona. The Arizona Act 2010 makes undocumented migration a State offence and requires legal migrants to carry papers to confirm their legal status. Critics said that this would lead to racial profiling, prompting State officials to add to the law that the police \"may not be considered race, colour or national origin.\" In 2010, Scott said that the law was not racial profiling and said, \"I clearly do not believe in racial profiling.\" But Scott didn't ask for such a law after his election, breaking his promise. A spokesman for the USA Action said that the result should not concern the people who saw the Facebook article. \"We say he pledged to implement laws like Arizona,\" said the spokesman for the United States of America, working Josh Shorin. \"Only because he has not accomplished it does not mean that he has not undertaken to do it.\" In 2012, the United States Supreme Court found parts of the Arizona Act unconstitutional, but endorsed the basic requirement that officers verify the status of persons suspected of undocumented migrants. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u25cf February 3, 2012, excludes dreams of citizenship? This attack shows signs of Scott &apos; s statements against dreams early in his tenure. He also ignores the fact that his recent position is more favourable to this group of migrants. Dreams are immigrants who were illegally brought to the United States by their parents when they were children. Just weeks before he took office, Scott spoke against the DREAM bill in Congress. \"I'm against the law of dreams,\" he said in December 2010. \"Why? I don't believe in forgiveness.\" In 2013, Scott objected to a bill to allow dream organizers to obtain driver &apos; s licences. The 2012 Obama administration &apos; s silence criticized the deferred work for the arrival of children as a policy of \"unfavourable Congressional direction.\" (The association allowed these illegal immigrants to apply for temporary status - later cancelled by Trump.) Scott also argued that the Florida driver &apos; s license bill was unnecessary because those with a federal employment licence card could actually obtain a temporary driver &apos; s licence. But in 2014, as he was seeking re-election, Scott signed a bill to give Dormers a state education. \"Students who spent their childhood here in Florida deserve the same education in the states,\" he said. It was a complete prank from 2011 when he said, \"On state education for illegal immigrants, I totally oppose it.\" In September 2017, when Trump was deciding whether to screw the Development Assistance Committee, Scott issued a statement saying: \"I do not like punishing children for the actions of their parents.\" He said, \"These children must be allowed to pursue the American dream, and Congress must act immediately.\" He explained his point of view in January 2018 in the United States of America today, calling on Congress to \"secure the status of immigrants for dreams,\" a reference to Trump, saying that he would provide protection for dreams. Scott called on Congress \"to do the right thing for these children by removing uncertainty on their future goals and dreams.\" Although the extension of the deferred procedure is not the same as citizenship, it is clear that Scott managed his opinion and became more open to dreamers who have a way of remaining legally in the United States. \"If Rick Scott is his way, he will encourage racial profiling of immigrant communities here in Florida. He also opposed allowing dreams to stay in the US. This announcement gives viewers the misleading impression that these are Scott's current policies. That's not true. In 2010, Scott promised to bring the Arizona Immigration Act to Florida. It is feared that the law may lead to racial profiling. As soon as Scott was elected, he never followed the idea. Scott was more active in his previous opposition to allowing dreams to stay in the country, but that also changed. He publicly objected to Obama &apos; s postponed program of work for people who had illegally come to the country when they were children, saying that Obama had bypassed Congress. Scott also objected to a bill to grant driving licences to dreams. But in 2014, Scott signed a bill to give dreams education in the state and last year he spoke in favour of helping dreams. Overall, the announcement creates a misleading impression that Scott is anti-immigrant by taking advantage of only part of his record. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/500d024f-7ecb4209-8c88-d4247da3a6f5", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01323"}
