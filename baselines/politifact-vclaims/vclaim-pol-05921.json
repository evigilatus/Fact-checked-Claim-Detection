It also described those making allegations of police racism as \u2018hate groups\u2019 and \"domestic terrorists with an agenda.\"\nAt a press conference on Sept. 16, Conway responded to critics of the piece and said he planned to meet with some who disagreed with his viewpoint or accused him of \"burying his head in the sand\" to racism in policing today. It was at that time that Conway also said that the racial and ethnic makeup of his department mirrors Gwinnett, the state\u2019s second largest county.\nSo what do the numbers show?\nWe contacted Shannon Volkodav, a spokeswoman for the Gwinnett County Sheriff\u2019s Office, to request supporting data on all department staff, as well as its leadership.\nShe provided a racial/ethnic breakdown of the department\u2019s current staff, which we compared with estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau on the population of Gwinnett County in 2014, the latest year for which information is available.\nThe Gwinnett County Sheriff\u2019s Office, with a 706-member staff, is 55.81 percent white, 35.55 percent African-American, 5.95 percent \u00a0Hispanic, 2.27 percent Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.42 percent Native American/Alaskan.\nAnd the department serves an estimated 877,922 Gwinnett County residents, 58.1 percent of whom are white, 27 percent of whom are African-American, 20.5 percent of whom are Hispanic, 11.6 percent of whom are Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.8 percent of whom are Native American/Alaskan, according to the data we reviewed.\nConway said in a telephone interview that a diverse department has been something he\u2019s worked to achieve since first being elected sheriff in 1996.\nHe said the administration is not as racially and ethnically diverse as he would like. But he said that\u2019s a byproduct of the department and county having been predominately white well into the 1990s and senior administrators, most of whom have 20 to 25 years of experience, having risen through the ranks. (Whites make up 74 percent of front-line supervisors -- lieutenants, sergeants and corporals, according to department data.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRonald Weitzer, a professor of sociology at George Washington University who specializes in police and minority relations, said the situation is not unusual.\n\"It takes time for minority officers to move up through the hierarchy,\" Weitzer said. \"It is also important that -- from the perspective of citizens who have contact with officers -- \u00a0what matters is how diverse the department is on the ground.\"\n\"Average residents may never encounter the top leadership or know what their demographics are,\" he said.\nThe exception would be the chief of police, whose racial background would be known to the public, Weitzer said.\nWe wondered how the Sheriff\u2019s Office compared with Gwinnett County government as a whole.\nJoe Sorenson, the communications director for the county, provided data showing that 73.96 percent of the county\u2019s workforce is white, 18.69 percent is black; 4.6 percent is Hispanic and 2.43 percent is Asian or Pacific Islander.\nThe county is working to increase its diversity, but it\u2019s not a quick process, Sorenson said.\nSome of its efforts include recruiting police officers at historically black colleges and universities, including Florida A&M University, Bethune-Cookman and Albany State, Sorenson said.\nOur ruling.\nConway said his department mirrors the community it serves in racial and ethnic diversity. Data we reviewed show the department is more diverse than Gwinnett County government as a whole.\nAfrican-Americans and other major ethnic and racial groups are represented in the department -- some groups are more proportionally represented in the department than others.\nBut Conway\u2019s overarching point stands up.\nWe rate his statement as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05921"}
