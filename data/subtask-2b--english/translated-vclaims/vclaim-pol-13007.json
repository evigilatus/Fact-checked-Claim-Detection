Sarah Palin filed a claim for the volume of debt accumulated under the leadership of President Barack Obama. \"Look at the debts accumulated in the past two years,\" Palin, a republic, told Fox News Greta Van Susteren on 31 May 2011, with its bus rolling on the highway. \"It's more a debt under this president than all the other presidents combined.\" This allegation is similar to the allegations we have verified in the past - to varying degrees - so we have also thought of checking Balin. A few pre-principles. First, there are two common debt measures. One, called public debt, corresponds to the debt held by the public, while the total federal debt is a larger figure that collects public debt in addition to the debt held by the Government itself, such as in social security funds or medical trust funds. Both figures are legitimate, and since Palin has not identified which of them she was referring to, we will do a search for the figures for both categories of debt. Secondly, we will assume that all of Obama's accumulated debt should be attributed to it. In fact, this is not a logical allocation, since the first budget he wrote was in fact for the fiscal year 2010 and because - like all the presidents - he inherited the financial legacy of his predecessor. However, its calculation in this way is much simpler - and, as we will see, the outcome will not matter. We moved to the Treasury Department's calculator \"Debt to the Beny,\" where we found that the public debt on the first day of Obama's tenure, in January 2009, amounted to $6,307 trillion; the federal debt totalled $10.627 trillion. For the latest available date - 27 May 2011 - these figures were $9.718 trillion and $14.345 trillion, respectively. This means that under Obama, public debt rose by $3.411 trillion and the total federal debt rose by $3.718 trillion. And this is a huge amount of money -- but it's much less than the 43 Obama ancestors' accumulated. Because debt is cumulative (except for any overlapping surpluses), the debt level of the former 43 presidents is equal to the amount of debt on the day of Obama &apos; s inauguration. Therefore, even by the standards that we used -- which are not particularly favourable to Obama -- his accumulated debt is either 54 per cent of his ancestors &apos; common debt (using the public debt figure) or 35 per cent (using the gross federal debt). None of these numbers are \"more... than all these other presidents together,\" as Palin said. If she had said the same thing as Rebec Cantor, R-Va, last fall, she would have been right to say that \"the budget that Obama submitted would add to religion more than the debt owed by the 43 former presidents combined.\" We've assessed that right. In other words, Cantor did not use the two-year timetable that Palin did - this change improves the accuracy of the claim. But Palin didn't say that. Specifically, Obama had accumulated more debt in two years than the 43 former Presidents collectively. Although Obama (along with Congress) has already accumulated a lot of debt for various reasons, its total debt for two years, even if the most generous criteria were used to judge a Palin comment, is still below the amount required to make the Palin statement accurate by between $3 trillion and $7 trillion. So we assess her claim is wrong. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13007"}
