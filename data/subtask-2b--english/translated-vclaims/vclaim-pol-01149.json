Some lose thousands of dollars a month. Farmers were reinforced by the news in December that Congress had approved an agricultural bill worth $867 billion, partly driven by the pressure exerted by farmers hit by President Donald Trump in his trade battles with China. Following the signing of the invoice, the United States Department of Agriculture announced a second round of direct payments to the most affected farmers. However, this good news was short-lived, with parts of the Government closed on 22 December 2018 in the midst of the dispute over the financing of the planned border wall in Trump. For example, farmers say that requests for an emergency aid package worth $12 billion are pending. The deadline for submitting an application for this programme was supposed to be 15 January 2019, but may have to be extended. The United States, Sun. Tammy Baldwin, whose website faked its legislative efforts on behalf of dairy farmers, weighed in January 2, 2019 with this tweet: \"Wesconsin lost over 600 farms last year and our farmers cannot afford #Tromp Chowdown.\" Did Wisconsin lose over 600 farms last year? Would the closure hurt the rest of them? The Baldwin Office referred to the data of the Ministry of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection of Wisconsin, which showed that in December 2018, Wisconsin was 8.163 dairy herds. One year earlier, in December 2017, there were 8,839 losses on 676 dairy farms. This represents a 7.6 per cent decrease in the number of registered dairy herds - the largest since record-keeping began in 2004. So, tweeting at a point if you're just looking at dairy farms. But, as the Ministry of Agriculture website indicates, \"Wisconsin is the land of Albanians in America, but in our case there is more productive and equipped than just milk and cheese.\" According to \"Wisconsin Group Statistics\" 2017 (most recently available): *The state is home to 68,500 farms with an area of 14.3 million acres. The average farm size in Wisconsin is 209 acres. * The country ranks third in the production of potatoes, with potatoes accounting for some 67,000 acres in 2017. * The production of raspberry in Wisconsin in 2017 totalled 5.37 million barrels. Farmers harvested 20,600 acres. Wisconsin produces 64 per cent of the nation &apos; s crop, making it the country &apos; s highest country of cranberry production. The State also produces a large cherry crop, producing 11.3 million pounds in 2017. * Wisconsin produced 49 million pounds of apples in 2017. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy, January 20, 2021 * Wisconsin is home to about 8,000 dairy farms, more than any other state, and 1.28 million cows. No dairy plantations have been identified by the Baldwin tweet. Is it possible that when non-armoured farms are listed, the aggregate total is growing? Not likely. The final figures for 2018 are not yet available, but in order for there to be an increase, they will have to resist a steady trend in the opposite direction. Here's a look at the last years: 2014: 69,000 farms, 2015, 68,900 farms 2016: 68,800 farms, 2017: 68,500 farms, the impact of the closure, let's go back to the second part of Baldwin's claim, that the closure has a negative impact on Wisconsin farmers. On 28 December 2018, news bulletins updating the closure of the Government, the United States Department of Agriculture assured farmers receiving assistance in the commercial war that inspections would continue during the first week of the closure. However, direct payments to farmers who have not certified production, as well as agricultural loans and disaster assistance programmes, will be suspended and will start again only after the full reopening of the Government. The offices of the Agricultural Services Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, which processes agricultural loans and collects the data that farmers need for decision-making, have been closed. About $10 million in payments went to Wisconsin farmers through the federal farm rescue programme, with 11 farms receiving more than $50,000 each, 237 less than $100, and a few thousand farms somewhere between them. According to the story of Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in November 28, 2018, federal data obtained by the Washington, D.C. Environmental Working Group show that the average payments to Wisconsin farmers were USD 2,145. The article in the Centinel newspaper explained that, based on a survey of its members, the Wisconsin Farmers &apos; Union stated that a 55-cow dairy farm would receive a one-time payment of $725 from the Trump Rescue Programme, but would lose between $36,000 and $48,000 over the year owing to lower milk prices. 80 cows are gonna get $889... barely enough to cover the electricity bill for a month. In the meantime, you're gonna lose $35,000. Two hundred and ninety cows are gonna get $4,905 but they're gonna lose as much as $400,000. The Wisconsin Farmers &apos; Union, based in Chipiwa Falls, is mostly small and medium-sized farms. \"Wesconsin lost more than 600 farms last year and our farmers cannot afford #Trompshowdown.\" The figures show that 600 are on the football field among dairy farms. While dairy farms make up a small percentage of total State farms, recent years have shown a downward trend there as well, and we know that dairy farms were particularly beaten in 2018. In addition, it is clear that at least some government farms - especially those in the dairy industry - are adversely affected by the closure. We assess Baldwin's claim mostly true.
