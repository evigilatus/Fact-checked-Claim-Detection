That's 96 animals a day!\"\nIs it true that elephants are killed at the rate it takes to down a cup of joe?\nThe estimate is derived from a reputable academic study, but IFAW is oversimplifying the complexities of that research to score a good soundbite.\nEvery 15 minutes\nBeth Allgood, IFAW\u2019s director for U.S. campaigns, told us the 96 elephants figure comes from a 2014 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study that provided the first reliable continent-wide estimate of illegal kills.\nThe researchers used data at carcass-monitoring field sites maintained by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) to model the Africa-wide number of illegal elephant deaths.\nThe study determined the percentage of elephants estimated to be killed by poaching. It then took that percentage and applied it to current estimates of the total number of African elephant\u00a0species total.\nThe study used two different approaches to calculate the total number of African elephants killed over three years \u2014 reaching 99,997 in one version and 101,784 in the other. (For context, the entire species had an estimated population size of 420,000 to 650,000 in 2012.)\nAveraged over three years, that\u2019s an annual rate of 33,630 elephants, researchers said. That's\u00a0a daily rate of 92 elephants (not 96) or the equivalent of one elephant illegally poached every 15 to 16 minutes.\nWe spoke to the lead author of the study, George Wittemyer of Colorado State University, about his findings and the IFAW claim.\nWittemyer said the IFAW calculation was \"plausible,\" but he also said that \"confidence intervals around the numbers are a bit wide.\"\nIn other words, IFAW is taking a fairly shaky estimate and describing it as a certainty.\nThe better take-away from the paper is the order of magnitude (tens of thousands of elephants killed per year), rather than\u00a0exact figures, said Julian Blanc, the data analyst for CITES\u2019 elephant monitoring program.\n\"I therefore cannot vouch for the \u201896 elephants a day\u2019 figure,\" Blanc told us.\nAbout that coffee comparison\nWhether that translates to one elephant \"by the time you drink your coffee\" depends on if you sip or chug. Yes, we understand the line is a rhetorical flourish, but hey, we\u2019re fact-checkers so we conducted an unscientific Twitter poll to gauge caffeination speeds.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of nearly 2,200 respondents, a third said it takes them 15 minutes to finish their java. For these coffee drinkers, that does correspond to one elephant poached by the time they\u2019re done. But for a third of respondents who drink faster, the claim doesn\u2019t hold up. \u00a0And for the other third who were more indolent, the claim actually lowballs the amount of elephant deaths.\nIvory and elephants\nVarious wildlife groups list demand for ivory as one of, if not the, main reason for the decimation of African elephants.\nBut recent reports suggest poaching may be on the decline, which may push this coffee factoid further from reality.\nWhen Europeans began colonizing Africa in the 1800s, there were an estimated\u00a026 million elephants before the world gained an appetite for their tusks. Americans consumed 200 tons of ivory \u2014 used to make combs, art, pool balls and piano keys \u2014 per year in the early part of the 20th century and the elephant population had declined to an estimated 10 million.\nAccording to the first comprehensive survey of the species conducted by zoologist Iain Douglas-Hamilton, the population had dwindled to 1.3 million in 1979 and fell to 600,000 within a decade.\nThis poaching crisis, said Allgood of the IFAW, led CITES to ban the international ivory trade in 1989. Then the overall elephant population rebounded from just 286,000 in 1995 to 472,000 in 2007 before a resurgence of the crisis.\n\nAccording to a CITES report, illegal ivory trade activity and the weight of the ivory more than doubled since 2007 as a result of rising demand from growing Asian economies. The area hardest hit has been Central African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon, where illegal sales help fund war and terrorism.\nToday, the outlook looks slightly brighter for elephants as killings have declined since the peak in 2011, CITES reports.\nThat\u2019s important to note for two reasons. First, the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences study cited by IFAW includes the peak year of 2011. Second, a decline in more recent years would knock down the total number of elephants poached.\nFurthermore, China, the world\u2019s biggest ivory consumer, and the United States agreed to enact a complete ban on ivory in the fall of 2015.\nOur ruling\nKelly said, \"By the time you drink your coffee, an elephant is killed for its ivory tusks.\"\nThe group behind this claim, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, is trying to draw attention to a real problem by boiling down complex research into a simple-to-use factoid.\nBut they are testing limits of the research they\u2019re citing.\nThe study measured three years and estimated that about 100,000 elephants were killed by poachers in that time period.\nExperts caution against taking those figures -- which rely on estimates -- and boiling them down in the way IFAW did. And since that study concluded, other research suggests that poaching has declined.\nAnd, it should be obvious, but this only really matters if you take 15 minutes to drink a cup of coffee.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ca9d0be8-735f-4cc9-83c7-7c1e8696fb27", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04957"}
