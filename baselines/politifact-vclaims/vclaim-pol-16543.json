Obama's 4,000-word speech spends about two paragraphs on Iran and Syrian; its main purpose was to argue for withdrawing from Iraq.\n\n\nAfter discussing the need to reduce troops and increase diplomacy, Obama outlines a number of possible scenarios, including sending more troops to Afghanistan. After that, he says the reduced forces in Iraq would still have a role to play in sending a message to Iran and Syria.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's an exagerration to say that he has dramatically switched positions.\n\n\nThe Clinton campaign is right when it asserts that there is little difference between Clinton and Obama on Iran policy. Both advocate aggressive diplomacy and economic sanctions, and both say a military strategy cannot be ruled out.\n\n\nBut selectively quoting Obama from the November speech is a weak point for this argument, so we rate this claim Half-True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16543"}
