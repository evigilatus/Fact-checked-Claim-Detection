Other exemptions, such as one for breast pump supplies, had only passed the Senate. Another, passed by both houses but not yet signed into law, would allow localities to provide property tax exemptions on accessibility improvements to the homes of severely injured service members.\u00a0\nTax credits that were enacted include one for green roofs, though this happened after Flanagan made his statement, a three-year extension of a tax credit program for employers of people with disabilities, an incentive for employers to provide child care, a three-year extension for a credit for using clean heating fuel, and expansion of a credit for historic property rehabilitation.\u00a0\nWe also asked a spokesman for the Senate minority, Scott Reif, for evidence of Flanagan\u2019s claim. Reif told us that Senate Democrats approved \"more than a billion dollars in new taxes and fees\" this year and $4.5 billion next year.\u00a0\nReif\u2019s claim regarding new taxes is accurate, according to David Friedfel, director of state studies at Citizens Budget Commission and a former Assembly majority staff member who worked on budget issues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeppner, the Senate Democrats\u2019 spokesman, noted that Republicans voted against the budget, which made permanent the 2 percent cap on property taxes. The Rockefeller Institute estimates the cap has saved property owners $25 billion since it was enacted in 2012.\u00a0\nSenate Democrats did not include a middle-class income tax cut in their list, which was included in the budget. It is implemented thanks to a previously enacted statute, so they did not claim credit.\u00a0\nExperts we talked to had differing views on whether Senate Democrats had enacted any tax cuts.\u00a0\nFriedfel, who once worked for the Assembly\u2019s Democratic majority, said that the budget \"definitely\" contained some cuts, such as extension of a film tax credit and the clean heating fuel credit. The property tax cap doesn\u2019t provide a tax cut automatically, Friedfel said, but in looking at an upward trend in property taxes over time, politicians could argue that the cap will result in a cut.\u00a0\nRon Deutsch, executive director at the Fiscal Policy Institute, which leans left, said it is \"debatable\" whether the tax cap can be considered a tax cut. The cap allows for 2 percent growth in local property tax levies, though the cap could be keeping taxes lower than they would have been without the cap.\u00a0\nE.J. McMahon, of the right-leaning Empire Center for Public Policy, said the tax cap is a \"wonderful thing\" but it is not a tax cut. He looked over the list the Senate Democrats provided of credits, exemptions\u00a0and reductions, and said they aren\u2019t what most people would consider a tax cut.\u00a0\n\"When most people hear the phrase \u2018tax cut,\u2019 they think of a general reduction in some category of taxes, not a refund you might get if you do something the state wants to encourage,\" McMahon said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\nFlanagan made it tough on himself by making such a hyperbolic statement -- not one tax cut.\u00a0Senate Democrats have proposed and enacted some forms of tax relief for New Yorkers, though it may not be what most residents would consider a \"tax cut.\" Many of these exemptions or credits are for narrow segments of the population. The property tax cap, now permanent, has kept property taxes $25 billion lower than they would have been othewise. \u00a0\nWe rate Flanagan\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00458"}
