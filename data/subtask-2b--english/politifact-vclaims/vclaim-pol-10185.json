He characterized the Democratic Party as increasingly supportive of abortion, \"without restriction and with taxpayer funding.\"\n\nThen he got to China.\n\n\"The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn't second-guess their one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations,\" Ryan said. \"That to me is pretty extreme.\"\n\nWe decided to fact-check whether Ryan was describing Biden\u2019s position accurately.\n\nFirst, a little background: China\u2019s one-child per-couple policy dates back to 1979, when the government became alarmed by its rapid population growth during the prior 30 years. As a response, it restricted the number of children to one per family, with some exceptions. China\u2019s population growth rate slowed with each ensuing decade.\n\nBut the population-control measure has received widespread criticism from the international community because government officials in localities have been known to force women with unauthorized pregnancies to get abortions and sterilizations. \u00a0\n\nForced abortions are illegal in China, and recent news reports suggest they became less frequent in the last decade, but they still happen.\n\nWhat Biden said\n\nIn a 2011 visit to Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, Biden answered a student\u2019s question about the United States\u2019 downgraded credit rating and its plan for reducing the deficit. The solution, Biden said, was to reform U.S. entitlement programs such as Medicare.\n\nHe said as the Baby Boomer generation retires, a relatively small working population will be left to support those retirees.\n\nThen he likened the situation to China\u2019s growing inequity in the ratio of workers to seniors -- \u00a0a consequence of its one-child policy:\n\n\"As I was talking to some of your leaders, you share a similar concern here in China. You have no safety net. Your policy has been one which I fully understand -- I\u2019m not second-guessing -- of one child per family. The result being that you\u2019re in a position where one wage earner will be taking care of four retired people. Not sustainable.\"\n\nSo Biden did make a trip to China and said he fully understood and did not second-guess the country\u2019s one-child policy.\n\nReproductive rights advocates have room for displeasure here -- he had an opportunity to condemn the policy and he didn\u2019t. But that\u2019s far from an affirmative endorsement that Ryan\u2019s words imply.\n\nShortly after Biden\u2019s China visit, the White House argued that he called the one-child policy unsustainable. He didn\u2019t though: He said a situation in which one worker takes care of four retired people is \"not sustainable.\"\n\nIn response to criticism about Biden\u2019s remarks at the time, a White House spokeswoman said Biden \"strongly opposes all aspects of China\u2019s coercive birth limitation policies, including forced abortion and sterilization\" and \"believes such practices are repugnant.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nRyan accused Biden of going to China and saying he \"sympathized and wouldn\u2019t second-guess their one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations.\"\n\nBiden did not use the word \"sympathize\" and didn\u2019t endorse the one-child policy. Instead, he said that he understood it and wouldn\u2019t second-guess it. \u00a0Days after the speech, his spokeswoman said he specifically condemned \"coercive birth limitation policies.\"\n\nRyan\u2019s claim contains a kernel of truth, but it ignores critical context that would leave a different impression. We rate this Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10185"}
