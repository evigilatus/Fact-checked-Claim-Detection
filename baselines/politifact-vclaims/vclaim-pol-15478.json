Charlie Crist's firewall when confronted with criticism that he isn't conservative enough.\n\n\n\"I signed the largest single tax cut in the history of Florida, a $25 billion tax cut over five years, directed at property tax cuts,\" Crist said while speaking to a group of Michigan Republicans in September. \"My state goes back to 1845; the largest tax cut since 1845 in the Sunshine State.\"\n\n\nCrist touts his tax-cutting record over and over, in news releases, political speeches and in the first radio ad for his U.S. Senate campaign.\n\n\nThe line is good politics. But is it true?\n\n\nThe property tax changes proposed by Crist and the Legislature in early 2007 were sold as the antidote to citizens' complaints that local government spending had spiraled out of control. Crist famously predicted taxes would \"drop like a rock.\"\n\n\nOn June 21, 2007, the governor signed House bills 1B and 5B \u2014 the two-pronged tax package.\n\n\nHouse Bill 1B required local governments to reduce their property tax rates to 2006 levels and mandated deeper cuts based on how much a local government collected in property tax dollars. The reported savings to taxpayers: $15.6 billion over five years.\n\n\nHouse Bill 5B, meanwhile, let voters consider further property tax changes. Also known as Amendment 1, the changes \u2014 which included an additional homestead benefit, limited property value increases for non-homesteaded property and created portability for Save Our Homes \u2014 were approved by voters in January 2008. The savings: $9.3 billion over five years.\n\n\nCombined, that's the $25 billion Crist is talking about.\n\n\nWe have to address two questions to see if Crist's claim is right: Are the estimates correct? And do they constitute the largest state tax cut ever?\n\n\nCaution: The following information is considered highly wonky.\n\n\n\n\nCrist's tax math\n\n\n\n\nTo estimate the financial impact of the 2007 and 2008 property tax changes, analysts at the governor's office first forecast a future as if the changes had not occurred.\n\n\nThe process was relatively simple. Analysts estimated five years of statewide property tax collection information by multiplying a tax rate, which they did not change, by taxable property values, which they grew at 3 to 5 percent a year.\n\n\nThe calculation, analysts said, attempted to replicate the billions of dollars in property taxes Floridians would pay each year if nothing else happened.\n\n\nWith that baseline, analysts next built a world post-tax changes, multiplying an estimated new tax rate by the same property values.\n\n\nThe difference between Year 1 of the first calculation and Year 1 of the second constitutes the governor's estimate of the savings to Florida taxpayers. They did the same math for years 2 through 5, and voila \u2014 $25 billion in savings.\n\n\nSimple?\n\n\nNo, says David Gamage, an assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in taxation.\n\n\nThe governor's estimates would be accurate only if property tax values increased as analysts predicted and local governments failed to reduce their tax rates, Gamage says.\n\n\nWe will never know what governments would have done to their tax rates, but we do know about property tax values: They've gone down. Taxable property values dropped 15 percent in 2008, according to figures from county property appraisers. Property values are expected to drop again in 2009.\n\n\n\"Even if this policy hadn't been enacted, the future would look different than today,\" Gamage said.\n\n\nIt's the same reason that a recent Florida Association of Counties report concluded that of the $1.5 billion trimmed from property tax collections at the county level in the past three years, almost half is a result of falling property values, not the Crist-led changes.\n\n\nWhen questioned by PolitiFact, the governor's office admitted that its original savings estimates are now likely high and it has not rerun the analysis.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we do know is this: the Department of Revenue said that as a result of the legislative-mandated tax rate rollbacks, the state's property tax collections fell about $300 million (\n\npage 9\n\n) from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2008. And property tax collections in total fell an estimated $745 million (\n\npage 163\n\n) from fiscal year 2008 to 2009, the first year the Amendment 1 changes took effect.\n\n\nThat's a $1.05 billion reduction in property taxes. The governor's estimate predicted $6.1 billion in savings during that same period. If property values fail to increase, the gap will only widen since the changes are estimated to have a bigger impact in later years.\n\n\nPart of the difference in the numbers is that the governor's office counted future, theoretical increases in tax collections as part of its estimated \"tax cut.\"\n\n\nAnd part of the difference is that falling property values wrecked the governor's projections.\n\n\n\n\nIs it the biggest?\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite inaccurate projections, the governor's office says the 2007 and 2008 tax cuts are still the state's largest.\n\n\nBut what else competes? The governor's analysts point to the repeal of the intangibles tax.\n\n\nThe intangibles tax \u2014 created during the Depression \u2014 was paid on investments, and at its peak, sat at 2 mills ($2 for every $1,000). The tax was cut under Gov. Lawton\n\n\nChiles and repealed entirely in 2006 by Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\nAt its height in 1999, it provided the state about $1.2 billion in revenue, according to the Department of Revenue. Adjusted for inflation, that translates to about $1.5 billion in 2007.\n\n\nThat's a bigger tax break than what the Crist-led changes delivered in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, but not more than Crist's rosy projection.\n\n\nWe wondered if anyone previously has claimed to be Florida's tax cut king.\n\n\nBush did. In 1999, Bush and the Legislature passed what they called \"the largest tax cut in state history.\" The $1.01 billion plan included further cuts to the intangibles tax, as well as the repeal of a per-drink tax on alcohol, a rollback in the school property tax rate and a reduction in unemployment taxes businesses pay, among other things.\n\n\nKurt Wenner, director of Tax Research at Florida TaxWatch, suggested a third tax change that could be considered the state's largest: Save Our Homes.\n\n\nThe amendment to the state Constitution proposed and approved by citizens in 1992 limited increases to the property value of homesteaded property in Florida. While there is debate about whether those savings were offset by people without homestead exemptions, the savings to homesteaded property owners is quantifiable.\n\n\nFrom 1996 to 2008, almost $1.9 trillion in property value went untaxed because of Save Our Homes. Using a conservative tax rate of 17 mills, that equates to $32 billion less in property taxes paid \u2014 or about $2.66 billion per year without adjusting for inflation. In 2007, the savings was about $7.27 billion and from 2004 to 2008 the estimated savings was more than $26 billion.\n\n\nThose numbers certainly are bigger than the Crist cuts so far, in reality and in projection.\n\n\nThe governor's office said it did not consider Save Our Homes when it made the claim that the Crist tax changes constitute the state's largest. Officials then provided data that showed the saving in the first years of Save Our Homes was modest. But that's because the large savings came in later years as Save Our Homes protected against increases to properties' taxable value.\n\n\nFailing to consider Save Our Homes didn't sit well with Ken Wilkinson, the Lee County property appraiser who led the push for Save Our Homes \u2014 and supported the Crist-led changes.\n\n\n\"I would say Save Our Homes is the largest tax cut in the history of Florida,\" Wilkinson said. \"There is a savings, you can look it up, and it's real.\"\n\n\nWilkinson and Wenner said you can't ignore Save Our Homes just because it was a citizen initiative. Moreover, the Crist-led changes built off Save Our Homes in two major ways \u2014 by making Save Our Homes portable and by creating a Save Our Homes style benefit for commercial and rental properties.\n\n\nIf one's a tax cut, so is the other.\n\n\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Crist-led changes to Florida's property tax structure certainly required the lowering of tax rates and assessment values throughout Florida. But there are all kinds of holes in projecting the size and scope of the legislation's impact.\n\n\n\nThe basis for the governor's estimate assumed a future that did not come to pass. Specifically, the governor's estimates relied on future property values continuing to increase and local governments failing to lower their property tax rate. We now know property values are decreasing.\n\n\nThe governor's office admits its projections are now inaccurate because of declines in property values statewide.\n\n\nA state analysis concluded that the tax measures have failed to produce the savings estimated by the governor. Portability, for instance, was predicted to cut taxable property values by $11.5 billion in 2008. But it cut property values only $3.4 billion, the analysis showed.\n\n\n\nHere's the bottom line: While the tax structure changes passed by the Legislature, signed by Crist and approved by voters undoubtedly will result in less property taxes being paid by Florida residents, the specific financial impact of the initiatives remains quite unclear. Experts say projections can be misleading.\n\n\nBut given the decline in home values, we know Crist will have difficulty reaching his claim of $25 billion over five years.\n\n\nIn the absence of additional data, and with the knowledge that Save Our Homes has cut property tax bills for Florida residents $32 billion or more, we can't agree with Crist that the 2007 and 2008 changes constitute the largest tax cut in state history.\n\n\nWe rule Crist's statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15478"}
