We began to wonder if Earth was on a collision course with a giant\u00a0asteroid.\nTurns out, the answer is no.\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nClose, but not that close \nThe Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory keeps a database that details all instances where objects in space have had a \"close approach\" to the Earth. The asteroid in question, 2016 NF23, is on that list.\u00a0\nAccording to that database, the asteroid is predicted to be closest to the Earth on Aug.\u00a029, 2018. It will be travelling at 20,000 miles per hour, or about 5 and a half miles per second.\nThe database also says the asteroid is estimated to be 70 meters to 160 meters in diameter, or about 75 to 175 yards. That\u2019s roughly the size of a soccer field.\nBut there\u2019s actually no reason to worry about 2016 NF23. That\u2019s because even at its point of closest approach to the Earth, the asteroid will be more than 3 million miles away (or, a lot of soccer fields). That\u2019s more than 13 times the distance between the Earth and its moon.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From an astronomical perspective, that may be close, but from a human perspective, it\u2019s obviously not very close at all; the asteroid is certainly not \u2018skimming\u2019 past the Earth, as the story claims,\" said Paul Chados, the manager of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, in an interview.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe added, \"In no way is our prediction a \u2018warning,'\u00a0as the story intimates.\"\nThe Wakefield Express is also incorrect in saying that 2016 NF3 \"has been labelled 'potentially hazardous'\" by NASA.\nAlan Chamberlin, a senior engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told PolitiFact, \"The object is not classified as a PHA (Potentially Hazardous Asteroid) as defined in our CNEOS website.\"\nThat\u2019s because the asteroid has too high of an absolute magnitude (a measurement for determining how bright asteroids appear) and is too small of an object to be considered a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid.\nBoth Chados and Chamberlin suggested that the article was misleading and recommended that readers who are concerned about asteroids and other objects possibly striking the Earth\u00a0look at NASA\u2019s Sentry page.\nUnlike the close approach database, the Sentry page only lists asteroids \"that have even the slightest chance of colliding with our planet over the next century or two,\" as Chados put it.\nThe Wakefield Express did not respond to a request for comment sent to the editorial email listed on its\u00a0Contact Us page.\nOur ruling\nA headline on the website Wakefield Express claimed that \"NASA says an asteroid bigger than a football pitch is heading towards Earth.\"\nNASA has indeed confirmed a large asteroid is heading in the direction of Earth. But the asteroid will not actually do any damage to us. It will stay far, far, far away.\nIn addition, the article says that NASA has labeled the asteroid \u2018potentially hazardous.\u2019 NASA has made no such designation.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01695"}
