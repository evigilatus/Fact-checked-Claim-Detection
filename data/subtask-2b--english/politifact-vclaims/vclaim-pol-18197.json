No.\nThe idea appears to stem from a tweet by an Indian comedian whose account goes by the name Nasir Chinioti.\nThe tweet says, \"#Covid_19 #StayAtHome Vladimir Putin has given Russians two options. You stay at home for 2 weeks or you go to jail for 5 years. No middle ground.\"\nTwo days later, the author of the original post tweeted, \"Just joke,\" with three emojis.
