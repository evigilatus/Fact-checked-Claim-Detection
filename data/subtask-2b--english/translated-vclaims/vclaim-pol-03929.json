Well, that's what some sites say. \"Report: 3 Million Voices in Presidential Elections by Illegal Foreigners,\" reads an address in InfoWars, a conspiracy site run by Alex Jones. The article was shared over 48,000 times over Facebook when we last looked. Other web sites have also written this report, including Milo, New American and Freedom Dayly. So is there any truth to that? Well, we don't know for sure. But the report is actually a tweet, and the person who wrote the tweet won't explain how it got to his character. If this is not sufficient cause for doubt, independent experts and historical analyses suggest that this is highly questionable. In other words, don't buy it. Where's the report? As evidence of her claim, InfoWars refers to a report from VoiceFraud.org and tweets from Greg Phillips, whose Twitter file says he's the founder of the Sounds Stand, an application for reporting voter fraud. There is no report from VoiceFraud.org, however, Philips PolityFact said he did not belong to that site. The information comes from tweeting from Phillips on 11 and 13 November. Here it is: We have verified more than three million votes made by non-citizens. We're joining. @truetheVote for commencement of legal proceedings. ==External links==*unriged-Grig Phillips@JumpVote) November 13, 2016 completed the analysis of the 180 million voter registration database. The legal advisory group Greg Phillips (@JumpVote) (11 November 2016), will not provide any additional information when Paulette Fuckett asks him. He had chosen not to publish more information because he was still working on analysing and verifying the accuracy of the data. Also Philips will not say what the data are or where it came from, or what methodology he used. Phillips said he'd make the information public as soon as it finally ended. According to his page on Linked In, Phillips is a former financial director of the Alabama Republican Party. He also served as Executive Director of the Mississippi Republican Party and was Managing Director of the Super-Elite Party, which supported the Newt Gengrich presidential campaign in 2012. A lot of reasons to be suspicious of the fact-checking features that Greg Kelly mentioned on January 11, 2021 in a television segment says Joe Biden is a very good guy. Although we do not know how Philips made his claim that three million non-citizens voted, people who filed similar claims in the past cited the 2014 report, claiming that 6.4 per cent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 per cent of non-citizens voted in the 2010 mid-term congressional elections. That report was based on data from a Harvard survey of people. However, the data were flawed, creating flaws in the next report. According to survey authors, a small proportion of respondents, citizens, have mistakenly identified themselves as non-citizens in the survey. This is because the respondents did not read the question carefully and inadvertently chose the wrong answer to the question. How do researchers know this? One of the authors of the survey, Brian Schavener, said that people later changed their answers when asked about their nationality. \"When we took from the people who changed their answer to the citizenship question and just looked at the people who consistently answered that they were non-citizens, we found none of the reported non-citizens who voted,\" Shafner told Poletti Fuckett. Other research contrasts with Phillips' tweeting. New Zealand 21, a national investigation reporting project funded by the Carnegie Foundation in New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found only 56 non-citizens who voted between 2000 and 2011. A report by the Brennan Liberal Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law found that most non-citizens &apos; votes were accidental. \"although there are a few recorded examples in which non-citizens appear to have registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they are unlikely to realize that doing so was improper,\" as reported in the 2007 report. At the same time, States that attempted to cleanse non-citizens of the voters &apos; lists, even government data, were not available. In 2012, the Florida Governor &apos; s Department began an attempt to suppress non-citizens who vote by comparing driver &apos; s license data with voters &apos; lists. Through this process, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Florida has drawn up a list of 182,000 potential non-citizens who voted. This number was reduced to 2,700, and then to about 200 before the clearance was stopped in the midst of criticism that the data was flawed due to the number of wrong positives - including a veterinarian born in the Second World War in Brooklyn. In the end, only 85 people were removed from the voting lists. State officials began a second attempt to cleanse before the 2014 elections, but also abandoned that effort. Richard Hasen, an expert in electoral law at the University of California, Irvine, called Philips' claim \"false news.\" \"There's no credible evidence I've seen to show large numbers of non-citizens voting in the U.S. elections anywhere,\" said Hansen. \"The idea that three million non-citizens have voted illegally in our elections without being discovered is absurdly ridiculous.\" Our ruling reports say that 3 million \"illegal aliens\" voted in this year's election. The articles refer to tweeting from Greg Phillips, who worked for the Republican Party and has an application to report voter fraud. However, Phillips will not provide any evidence to support his claim, which he happens to be undermined by publicly available information. If Phillips issues a more detailed report, we will consider that information. But for the time being, this allegation is inaccurate. We assess it wrong.
