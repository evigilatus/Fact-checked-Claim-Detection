Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., brings up on the presidential campaign trail is her ability to work across the political aisle. \u00a0\n\"Even in the last Congress, President Trump signed 18 of my bills. I don't think he knows he did, but he did,\" Gillibrand told the editorial board at the Des Moines Register. \u00a0\nShe repeats it often, so we checked her claim.\nIt quickly became clear that evaluating the truthfulness of her statement would not be as simple as searching for her sponsored legislation in a Congressional database and seeing which bills passed.\nThe list\nWe approached Gillibrand\u2019s campaign for evidence of her claim. Spokeswoman Meredith Kelly provided a list of legislation the senator sponsored or co-sponsored that made it into law in some form, typically as part of other bills, during the 115th Congress in 2017-18.\nThis list had 17\u00a0pieces of legislation, including an amendment, and the 18th item was several bills intended to change sexual harassment policies in Congress.\nWith one exception, the renaming of a post office, the bills did not follow a simple path from her sponsorship to a signing by the president.\nIn some cases, bills originated in her office, but the House version was signed into law. This includes a bill regarding a hydroelectric project at the Cannonsville Dam, east of Binghamton. In this case, Rep. John Faso, a Republican, sponsored identical legislation in the House one month\u00a0after Gillibrand introduced her bill. His bill ultimately passed both houses. Gillibrand\u2019s bill, meanwhile, had been amended in the Senate. At the time, Faso was a member of the Republican majority in the House, and Gillibrand was in the Democratic minority in the Senate. \u00a0\nIn another case, the House version of a bill to conduct a study in Oswego was signed, though Gillibrand carried a related bill in the Senate. \u00a0\nIn two of the bills that became law, Gillibrand was an original co-sponsor, meaning that she signed on to the bill when it was introduced. This happened with a bill sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to provide\u00a0benefits to public safety officers and their survivors. Another, sponsored by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, allows military families more flexibility in where they live before or after a new assignment. That bill became law as part of a large defense spending bill. Gillibrand\u2019s campaign provided evidence of Grassley and Blunt\u00a0crediting Gillibrand for her work\u00a0on the bills.\u00a0\nThe majority of the items on the list started out as bills sponsored by Gillibrand, but were passed in whole or in part as part of other bills. Gillibrand\u2019s Computer Science Career Education Act was signed into law after it became a provision of another bill, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education For The 21st Century Act. Provisions of another one of Gillibrand\u2019s bills, which promotes hands-on manufacturing and learning, was also included in the career and technical education act. A bill aimed at reducing wealth inequality was included in a defense spending bill. Provisions from her bill to help dairy farmers were adopted as part of a farm bill. \u00a0\u00a0\nIn one case, she offered an amendment to a defense spending bill to clean drinking water polluted by Air Force-supported activities. The spending bill was signed into law.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 18th item on the list was a collection of reforms to sexual harassment policy in Congress that Gillibrand had been pushing. Though she was not a sponsor of adopted legislation, the final law had provisions from\u00a0Gillibrand's sponsored legislation. These elements included making sure interns were covered by the policy, eliminating a mandatory 30-day mediation before a complaint is filed, and conducting a \"climate survey\" of House and Senate offices about sexual harassment and other workplace issues, among others. Her activities around these reforms garnered her significant national media attention.\nMeasuring effectiveness\nEvaluating effectiveness is not simple, experts said. It can be difficult to measure how much a lawmaker worked behind the scenes to advance legislation, because the paper trail isn\u2019t always clear, said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University.\nRolling bills into other legislation is common, said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"Negotiating the legislative process in the Senate often means giving senators what they want in exchange to lift their fillibuster threat,\" Huder said.\nA good legislator doesn\u2019t insist that his or her legislation pass as a free-standing\u00a0bill, said Dan Diller, a former senior Senate staff member and director of policy at the Lugar Center, which measures bipartisanship. \"If you were so arrogant (to insist) that your bills pass free-standing, nothing would ever get done,\" Diller said.\nBut, if you sign on as the 15th co-sponsor, you probably haven\u2019t done much to advance the bill, he said. Gillibrand did not claim credit for any bills in which she was not an original co-sponsor, nor for any if her contributions were not acknowledged by the bill sponsor.\nIn the case where part of a bill was adopted as part of a larger bill, that\u2019s a sign of a flexible legislator dedicated to governance, Diller said. It\u2019s difficult to pin down how much credit a lawmaker should receive in this instance, but a lawmaker should get credit if their entire bill is adopted as part of a different bill, he said.\nCraig Volden, an expert in legislative effectiveness and a professor at the University of Virginia, took a different view. In his model, he and his partner, Alan Wiseman, assign credit only for bills that a lawmaker sponsored, not ones they co-sponsored. As for ideas or language that ends up in law, \"there is no established objective standard,\" Volden said. \u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to Congress.gov, maintained by the Library of Congress, Gillibrand was a sponsor of one bill that Trump signed during the 115th Congress, a post office renaming, and a co-sponsor of 18 other bills. These co-sponsored bills were largely not the ones that Gillibrand\u2019s campaign provided to us. \u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\nGillibrand said that Trump has signed \"18 of my bills.\"\nThe bills to which Gillibrand referred were not strictly bills that originated in her office.\nAs the experts said, legislating requires flexibility in order to get anything accomplished.\u00a0Indeed, provisions from bills that Gillibrand sponsored or supported early became law, but typically as part of other bills. Evaluating her contributions to those laws and how she influenced policy\u00a0requires nuance and understanding how legislating works.\nBut her phrasing lacked nuance. They may largely have been\u00a0her ideas, but she called them \"my bills.\"\u00a0For all but one of the bills, she left out an important detail: In their final form, the bills were sponsored by someone else.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate her claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00505"}
