In December, President Tim Moore of the Council of Republic announced his support for the placement of $1.9 billion in school bonds in the polls in 2020. In January, the Republicans introduced into the Senate a pay-as-you-go plan using tax revenues - avoiding borrowing and avoiding voting. In response, the Democrats argued that the Senate plan used money that could go towards other priorities. On February 20th, Willie Nickel took a step further. \"SB5 pays for school construction with increased teachers' salaries,\" Senator Carey Grodd, referring to the invoice number. In the same tweet, Nickel retracted his claim, noting that the teacher's salary was not immediately affected: \"This plan jeopardizes funding for increased teachers' wages, classroom supplies, broadband, roads and training of correctional staff.\" Then his tweet concludes: \"The teachers of the National Convention must not pay for the construction of the school.\" Politicians often try to enquire about the negative consequences of the legislation they oppose - even if such consequences are unlikely or uncertain. The nickel tweet is a key example of the claim that should raise the eyebrows. It is suggested that elected officials take money from teachers (who vote) and place it in the direction of buildings (which do not vote). The bill in question, SB5, was considered by Polyte Fact to answer the question: Does it take the money allocated to teachers' salaries and place it in capital projects? No. We have found no evidence that the bill affects teachers &apos; salaries or possible increases. The bill calls for the use of funds from the State Capital Infrastructure Fund, a new fund established in 2017, which is expected to receive 4 per cent of this year &apos; s tax revenue. \"The Republicans propose to increase the contribution to the Fund to 4.5 per cent of tax revenues, and allow K-12 schools to use some money to build schools,\" reported The News and Surveillance. She asked the Department of Public Education of North Carolina whether the bill immediately affected teachers &apos; salaries. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \"We have looked at the bill and the answer to your first question is no. The bill does not use the money allocated to compensating the breeder.\" Drew Elliot, Director of Communications of NC, said the Department of Public Information. The Polyte Fah Foundation also asked the Department of Public Information whether the bill could affect teachers &apos; salaries in the future. Elliot said: \"It is difficult to answer without knowing the larger context of the full budget bill.\" Nickel admitted that there was no mention of teachers &apos; salaries in the proposal to build a school. He was draining money from the State General Fund, leaving less money to the State for other projects. According to Nickel, the GOP plan leaves the State with one of three budget formulation options: the teacher does not pay an increase in sales taxes and fees to cover the difference. It's not the only nickel that says he's worried about the plan that affects future spending. Joe Coletti, a senior colleague at the John Locke Foundation, a conservative think tank, told Carolina magazine that the legislature might choose to use other funds if tax revenues ever decreased. However, these predictions and concerns are more than mere assumptions. It does not reflect the direct impact of the Senate &apos; s plan to finance school construction. ===Politifact RULING===The nickel SB 5 said \"paid for school construction with increased teachers' wages.\" This is a rhetorical point that can be taken literally. The bill could leave less money to increase teachers &apos; wages and other budgetary priorities. However, the bill itself does not take money directly from teachers &apos; salaries or transfer money away from them. We're assessing this wrong.
