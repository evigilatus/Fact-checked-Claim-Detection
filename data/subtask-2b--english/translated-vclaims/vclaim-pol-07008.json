The influx of Spanish-born voters - good news for Democrats. But Fox News Analyst Brett Hum managed the idea at its head during his post-election analysis. Home said that the fastest growing segment of the country was the elderly. This is good news for the big old party. \"Old citizens, not Hispanics, are the fastest growing population in the country,\" said Home. \"It is clear that Hispanics are the fastest-growing ethnic groups in the country, but their size as a dwarf group is 65 demographics and older, which were moving towards the Republicans,\" by Home. \"If the Republican Party continues to make gains, it may make up for more than any advantage of Democrats with ethnic groups.\" The simple question is: Are older people, not Hispanics, the fastest growing population in the United States? (Homi did not respond to our requests for further information.) In view of what happened every two years, the United States Census Bureau issues a report that distributes qualified voters by race, ethnicity and age. Of particular importance in tracking the Spanish vote is the exclusion of non-citizens. This table, which is based on census office data, shows that the top group did not grow in any decade at a faster rate than those of Spanish origin. (All figures in thousands) Group 1980 1990 growth 1980-90 2000 growth 1990-2000 growth 2000-00 growth 2000-10 growth 2000-10 Spanish 18+ 5 856 + 53.9 13 158 + 53.6% 21285 + 61.8% 65 + 23 514, 29, 192 + 24.1% 31,815 + 9.0 3745 + 18.6%, which is the same for the initial number of eligible voters, except for the period 1980-1990. Therefore, the situation of HOME appears to be weak at the present time. In view of the future as a general rule, we in Bondet Fact do not evaluate forecasts, but we can compare the sense of the future by what the Census Bureau tells us to expect. Here, Hume finds a little more support. Between 2020 and 2030, one decade is estimated to increase by 30 per cent, while the Spanish population will increase by 26 per cent. (Note: These estimates look only at the population and not at voter turnout. The census does not expect voters to vote. Again, the figures presented here are in thousands.) The 2010-2020 growth group 2010-2030 growth 2020-30 2040 verification of the facts in particular Greg Kelly mentioned on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden on the video \"Show to\" elections in \"Acknowledgment.\" By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021 Growth 2030-40 Hispanic 18+ 21 285 43,407 103.9% 54,827 26.3% 67,309 22.8% 65 + 37,745 55,969,72.774.0 72,774.0 79,719 9.5% applies the same pattern when we look at absolute population change. The 2010-2020 growth group 2010-2030 2020-30 2040 growth 2030-2030-40 18+21 285 43,407 22,122 54,827 11,420 67,309 12,482 65 + 37,745, 55,969, 18,224, 72,774 16,805 79,719, 6,945 and a few important warnings under Home, voters are either elderly or of Hispanic origin, but of course, some will be both. And by focusing on older people, it seems that Home assumes that age, not race, is more than that to shape a person's voice. This may or may not be true, and is in fact the bulk of any comparison. There is also no doubt that older persons have more reliable access to the ballot box than those of Spanish origin. In the 2010 elections, about 61 per cent of older persons voted. The Spanish rate was half that, only 31%. Now that the number of older persons has risen, 37.7 million in 2010 compared to 21.2 million Spanish-born voters, you can see where Hume has a point that is far from the rapid growth of each group. If the Republicans receive 57 per cent of the elderly voting, and the Democrats receive 70 per cent of the Hispanics voting, the Republicans advance 13.1 million of the elderly to 4.6 million of the Hispanics. We can enter into more complex calculations of presidential races, electoral colleges and concentration of Hispanics in some states, but we will leave that to 5.38.com. Our rule (Hum) said that older persons, not of Spanish origin, are the fastest growing population. The census office numbers tell us that's not accurate right now. Historically, the population of Spanish origin has increased at a faster pace than the large population. The Spanish group will continue to grow at a faster pace until about 2020, according to the projections of the Census Bureau. In the following decade, the upper group is expected to grow faster, but after 2030, the growth rate for Spanish is rising again. The analysis of HOME &apos; s election (based on older persons who appeared to vote) was more targeted than the trend he cited as evidence, but we are only dealing with his factual statement, which is in line with the census figures of one of five decades. We assess the claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07008"}
