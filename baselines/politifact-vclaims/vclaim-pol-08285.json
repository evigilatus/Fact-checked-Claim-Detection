Charlie Crist has done a slew of national television interviews recently promoting his new book, The Party's Over: How the Extreme Right Hijacked the GOP and I Became a Democrat. So it\u2019s only natural that he\u2019s been quizzed on his political evolution.\nOn Fox News\u2019 The O\u2019Reilly Factor on Feb. 4, Bill O\u2019Reilly asked Crist about his changing stance on abortion.\n\"On abortion, you wanted in the State of Florida to outlaw it, except in rape and incest,\" O\u2019Reilly said. \"But, now, you morphed into, \u2018Hey it's a woman's body. She can do what she wants.\u2019 It's a pretty big change.\"\nIn response, Crist portrayed himself as being consistent on the topic.\n\"When I was a young state senator from Tampa Bay -- back in the early \u201890s is when I got elected -- one of the first votes I had as a state senator was on a health care committee. And the bill said you have to have a 24-hour waiting period before a woman could have an abortion if she is making that decision. As a Republican, back in the \u201890s, I voted against the bill. As a result of my \u2018no\u2019 vote it died on a tie vote. So I\u2019ve always been pro-life personally. But in terms of wanting to change the law, what I said in 2006 was \u2018I\u2019d rather change hearts than laws\u2019 and that\u2019s still how I feel.\"\nWe decided to put Crist\u2019s stances on abortion on our Flip-O-Meter. We\u2019re not passing judgment on whether a change of position is right or wrong; we\u2019re merely documenting whether there actually has been a change of position or not.\nWe went to the archives to review our earlier fact-checks about Crist\u2019s views on abortion. Overall, we\u2019ve found it hard to label Crist at any point as an abortion rights supporter or an opponent, because he\u2019s been all over the map on the issue. Let\u2019s review the evidence.\nCrist as a state legislator\nIn 1992 when he ran for the state Legislature, Crist said he was \"pro-choice\" but opposed to state-funded abortion, the Miami Herald reported. Crist won that race.\nIn 1995, Crist was a Republican state senator from St. Petersburg serving on a Senate health care committee. As he told O\u2019Reilly, Crist joined Democrats in voting against a bill that would have required a 24-hour waiting period for women to obtain an abortion. The 3-3 vote meant that the bill failed.\nThe Tampa Bay Times reported then that Crist was a supporter of abortion rights:\n\"I generally don't like the government telling people what to do,\" Crist said. \"I believe in individual rights and freedom. That's why I'm a Republican.\"\nBut the next year, the health care committee approved a waiting period bill 5-3,\u00a0after an amendment offered by Crist to restrict the bill to women younger than 18. News reports at the time said Crist favored abortion rights but wanted minors to be adequately counseled. The bill failed in the House.\nIn March 1998, then-Sen. Crist voted to override Gov. Lawton Chiles\u2019 veto of a bill banning what opponents call a \"partial birth\" abortion, a late-term procedure. The House and Senate successfully overrode the veto and\u00a0that summer the Supreme Court upheld the ban.\nWhen he was running for the U.S. Senate for the first time in 1998, Crist said in a questionnaire for the Times: \"I am pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government.\"\nWhen debating his Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Bob Graham, Crist was asked if he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortion.\n\"No, I would not,\" Crist said. \"I think this is a very personal decision. And I think it is a decision that a woman should make and have the right to make after consulting with her family, her physician and her clergy but not her government.\"\nThe 2006 governor\u2019s race\nIn 2006 when he was running for governor, the Times wrote that \"On abortion, Crist\u2019s position is a moving target,\" noting that Crist called himself pro-life. But he didn\u2019t support repealing the U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe vs. Wade, and he opposed a 24-hour waiting period for abortion. \"I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians, and I think it's very important to respect the medical profession,\" said Crist, whose father is a doctor.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso during the 2006 race, he told a priest in Pensacola that he would sign a bill outlawing abortions except when the mother\u2019s life was at stake. But then he told an AP reporter that\u00a0he would only sign such a bill if it included exceptions for rape and incest.\nAs Crist and then CFO Tom Gallagher competed for votes in a Republican primary, Crist launched an attack ad calling Gallagher \"pro-choice\" and referring to himself as \"pro-life.\"\nLater, in the general election debate against Democrat Jim Davis, Crist said: \"I'm pro-life on this issue, but I also understand that it's very important to respect the views of others, and I do,\"' Crist said. \"I don't think it's important to change the law. What I do believe is important is that we change hearts and not the law. . . . I'm pro-life and I'm proud of it, but I don't think that I should impose my will on other people as a result of it.\"\nThe 2010 Senate race\nIn January 2010, Crist\u2019s Republican U.S. Senate campaign released a statement saying he would \"fight for pro-life legislative efforts.\"\nIn April, as he lagged in a primary against Marco Rubio, Crist left the Republican Party to become a \"no party affiliation\" candidate.\nWeeks later, he vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure \"punitive\" and that the measure was \"almost mean-spirited.\"\nCrist lost the Senate race in 2010 and left the governor\u2019s office in January 2011.\nPost 2010\nIn 2012, Crist endorsed President Barack Obama in an op-ed in the Times and complained about growing Republican extremism, including on women\u2019s issues.\n\"Look no further than the inclusion of the Akin amendment in the Republican Party platform, which bans abortion, even for rape victims,\" Crist wrote.\nCrist was exaggerating here. The platform clearly opposed most abortions but was vague on the details. It does not specifically say that it bans abortion for rape victims. Also, there is no official Akin amendment referring to then-Senate candidate Todd Akin of Missouri who made the \"legitimate rape\" comment. We rated Crist\u2019s statement Half True.\nA few months later, Crist officially signed papers to become a Democrat at a Christmas reception at the White House.\nWe sent a sample of Crist\u2019s past stances on abortion to his campaign.\n\"He is pro-life. He\u2019s just not anti-choice,\" replied Kevin Cate, a paid Crist adviser. \"They aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.\"\nCate argued that Crist has been consistent in that he is \"personally pro-life\" but believes the government should not interfere with decisions between a woman and her doctor.\nIn an interview with Watermark, a Central Florida publication that covers the gay community, Crist was asked about his stance on abortion in December:\n\"It\u2019s confusing because I\u2019m \u2018pro-life,\u2019 but by my definition. I\u2019m for life. But I don\u2019t believe the government should tell women what they can and can\u2019t do with their bodies. That may sound inconsistent\u2026 I don\u2019t care. I think we\u2019re all for life, and I don\u2019t like the fact that one side of this issue has taken that term and made it theirs. Because when they say they\u2019re pro-life, what are they saying about those of us who believe in choice\u2026 that we\u2019re pro-death?! We\u2019re all pro-life. So I\u2019m pro-life, and I\u2019m pro-choice. I\u2019m pro-life because I\u2019m for life, but I will not impose my will on others.\"\nOur Flip-O-Meter rating\nIf we look at Crist\u2019s comments and actions on abortion in sum over his career, this much is clear: He has been conflicted about abortion. In fact, we struggled to find a consistent position he's ever held on the matter. Crist has used the \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice\" labels to describe himself at different points in his career,\u00a0and he now says he is both.\u00a0There is a kernel of consistency in that he often -- but not always -- talked about being personally \"pro-life\" but wanting to respect the right of women to make decisions with their doctors.\u00a0\nWhat is more telling is his stances on particular abortion laws.\u00a0He has backed restrictions such as a waiting period for minors and a ban on partial birth abortion. But he's also\u00a0rejected\u00a0a waiting period for adults and has\u00a0said he doesn\u2019t want to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\nOverall, Crist seems to have partially changed\u00a0position several times, without having any one inflexible position\u00a0along the way. For this reason, we rate his position\u00a0on abortion a Half Flip.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08285"}
