Trump said he wanted to retain some provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which he pledged to repeal, and he would be open to a partial wall, part of the perimeter of the fence along the United States-Mexico border rather than a large concrete structure. \"What about the commitment to deport millions and millions of undocumented migrants?\" CBS Leslie Stahl asked 60 minutes ago. \"What we're going to do is get people who are criminals and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, maybe 2 million, \"But we will get them out of our country, they are here illegally.\" Also, after securing the border \"and after everything has been normalized,\" the fate of the \"destructive people\" who remain illegally in the country, Tramp said. We questioned Trump &apos; s reference to 2 to 3 million illegal migrants with criminal records in the United States. Trump was referring to the report of the Ministry of Internal Security covering the fiscal years 2011-13. According to that report, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency estimated that there were 1.9 million \"degradable foreign criminals\" in the United States at the time - not 3 million. The report states that the total of 1.9 million includes immigrants who are here both legally and illegally. The term \"criminal alien\" does not necessarily mean that it is illegal. The term \"criminal alien\" is generally used by law enforcement agencies to determine \"non-citizens lawfully or illegally resident in the United States and convicted of a crime.\" It is misleading to say that 1.9 million in the entire DHS report is here illegally -- even though it may be \"can be removed.\" A person living legally in the United States may be subject to deportation under certain circumstances, including conviction for offences such as possession of cocaine. The report did not specify the number of illegal \"criminal aliens\" present here. An official of the Central Intelligence Agency said that the Agency could not confirm the percentage or number of migrants in the country who had been illegally convicted. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 On 3 February 2021, Jessica Vaughn, Director of Policy Studies at the Centre for Migration Studies, an intellectual institution favouring more stringent immigration policies, said her research said that the majority of illegal immigrants were here and supported Tramp's statement. Trump cited her research during his campaign. \"On the basis of my review of various data and records sets from ICE covering the delicate immigration situation of groups of deportations ICE, I am sure that most of this group of foreign criminals are illegal here,\" said Vaughn about 1.9 million in the federal report. \"In accordance with the law, foreign criminals who at one time had a general legal status will become ineligible for that legal status upon conviction for certain offences.\" Adam Cox, an expert in immigration law and a professor at the University of New York, said that the criminal conviction itself did not change the status of legal immigrants, such as a green card holder. \"These immigrants are not stripped of their status at the moment they are convicted,\" said Cox. If the convicted green card holder is placed in the deportation proceedings, he loses the green card only at the end of the immigration proceedings if, as Cox said, the immigration judge determines that a criminal conviction makes a person subject to deportation. Trump's claim that there could be \"up to 3 million\" illegal immigrants in the country exceeds calculations from an estimated group of less than 1 million people. In July 2015, the Institute for Migration Policy, a think tank that analyses the movement of persons and policies affecting them, estimated that 43 per cent, or 820,000 of the 1.9 million non-citizens convicted of crimes, were unauthorized migrants. The Institute analysed estimates of the unauthorized population and the number of non-citizens legally present in the country, and it was estimated that both groups were committing crimes at similar rates. The exact number of unauthorized migrants convicted of crimes may be higher or lower, with a margin of error in the low tens of thousands, according to the Institute. The Trump plan for the deportation of 2 to 3 million is in line with the total number of migrants deported under President Barack Obama. More than 2 million people were deported during Obama's presidency. Our rule, Trump, said that there might be \"perhaps 2 million, up to 3 million\" illegal criminal immigrants in the country. The Trump figures are slightly derived from a federal report that says that there are about 1.9 million \"insulated criminals,\" but this includes people here legally and illegally. Trump's claim that he could reach up to 3 million is based on a presumption. He's on the field, but he's missing important details. We evaluate the Trump statement half correct. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/56b11b37-a7db-494b-9ea6-ea4b0b059f3c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03941"}
