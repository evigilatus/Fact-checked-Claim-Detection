Mike Parson &apos; s top priorities were the 100th legislative session, followed by some representatives. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Cody Smith, R. Carthage, presented a budget plan to finance road and bridge improvements throughout the state. Smith said that his plan would finance infrastructure improvements without increasing taxes or accumulating new debt. Smith wanted to do so by allocating funds from public revenues to the State infrastructure rather than withdrawing more bonds. \"Our Department of Transport already has a heavy debt burden and has paid over $700 million in debt payments in the last two years only,\" Smith wrote in the Capitol report sent by his office. Has the Ministry of Transport of Missouri paid more than $700 million in debt payments in the past two years? Let's take a look at the numbers, the documents from the Ministry of Defence show that his numbers are on the point. The 2018 results of the Ministry of Defence and Finance show that the Department paid slightly more, totalling $702 million in 2017 and 2018. \"I'd rather avoid debt when it's possible,\" said Smith. However, the debt paid does not tell the whole story. The Administration paid $412 million in debt in 2017. Since 2004, the Administration has had an average of approximately $242 million annually. This number was higher in 2017 than in previous years because some of the Agency &apos; s debts were paid early. \"In 2017, $117.8 million of bonds were paid early, saving future interest costs of $29.4 million,\" said Sally Oksendler, Interim Speaker of the Ministry of Defence, Trade and Industry. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012, this helped to inflate Smith's point when he said that the debt of the Ministry of National Defence amounted to over $700 million in just two years. This chart of funds borrowed from the Ministry of Defence and its annual payments helps to visualize the amount of debt paid in 2017, compared to past debt payments. .................................................................................................................. The chart is a courtesy of the Ministry of Defence &apos; s financial picture, November 2018, compared to the other state transport departments, Missouri, which do not have much debt, said Todd Grosvener, Assistant Director of Financial Services, Ministry of Defence. However, Smith wants to limit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to obtain more debt. Smith said: \"Keeping our road money stable over the coming years is very important.\" \"When the Department of Defense takes more debt, it has less than a dollar to improve our methods and bridges.\" Why is he using borrowed money? The Agency stated that borrowed funds were and continue to be used in \"hundreds\" of road and bridge projects throughout Missouri. The Department borrowed the largest amount of money in 2010 when it required an additional $100 million to replace the Mississippi River Bridge in St. Louis. In 2010, the Department also borrowed $685 million for the Safe and Safe Bridge Improvement Programme. This three-and-a-half-year project replaced or repaired more than 800 bridges across the state. \"On behalf of the House of Representatives, I will closely monitor the extent of State debt to improve and maintain our transport infrastructure,\" said Smith. Our referee Smith said, \"Our Department of Transport already has a heavy debt burden and has paid more than $700 million in debt payments in the last two years alone.\" His numbers correspond to the records of the Ministry of Defence. However, these countries need clarification because the Ministry of National Defence paid a large part of the debt early, in order to avoid further accumulation of interest. Because the statement is precise and needs to be clarified, we appreciate the statement that it is often true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00662"}
