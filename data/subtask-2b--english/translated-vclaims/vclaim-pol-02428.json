During his State of the Union address, Trump highlighted the killing of Kayla Cuevas and Nessa Mickens in New York in 2016, and the related murder charges against MS-13 members. These two precious girls were brutally killed while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the MS-13 gang were charged with the murder of Kayla and Nyssa. Trump said he was 30 years old. \"Many of these gang members have exploited the blatant loopholes and our laws to enter the country as illegal and unaccompanied foreign minors. He ended up in Kayla and Nessa High School.\" In a 2017 press release on indictments, the United States Department of Justice did not specify whether the defendants charged with the murder of Cuevas and Mickens had illegally come to the United States as unaccompanied minors. We asked the Section to clarify, but we referred to the United States Immigration and Customs Agency, which did not provide a reply by the deadline. :: Polyte Vac decided to check whether gang members had used the \"opening of loopholes\" and the laws to come as unaccompanied minors, as Tramp claimed. The White House did not provide information in the register to support Trump &apos; s claim. It is not clear exactly how many gang members have come to the United States as unaccompanied minors, but the federal authorities have identified a small number of suspected or confirmed gang members. However, what Trump refers to as \"vols\" is in fact a specific protection for undocumented minors called for by law. Some of these minors are already fleeing gang violence in their own countries. Finally, the experts note that unaccompanied minors are subject to collective recruitment after their arrival in the United States. Here's a closer look at this complex issue. Background from the MS-13 gang and the United States presence of Lamara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, originated from the Los Angeles slums where many refugees from civil wars live in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua in the 1980s. According to the Ministry of Justice, the name Mara Salvatrucha comes from the word \"Mara,\" a term in El Salvador for a gang, \"Salva,\" for the word \"Salvadouran,\" and \"Trusha,\" a generic term for \"waking,\" \"warming,\" or \"whimpering.\" The 13 refer to the letter \"M.\" The 13th letter of the alphabet refers to loyalty to the Mexican mafia in prison. The MS-13 logo is \"Killing, Rape and Control,\" said Attorney General Jeff hearing. According to the Trump administration, there are over 10,000 MS-13 gang members across 40 American states and over 30,000 around the world. Experts have told us that the growth of MS-13 in the United States is related to harsh policies in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador that have led many gang members out of Central America. In the United States, law enforcement officials charged MS-13 members for a wide range of crimes, including murder, attempted murder, assault, obstruction of justice, arson and conspiracy to distribute marijuana. In recent years, an upsurge of gang violence and poverty has come illegally to the United States due to the arrival of unaccompanied minors in United States waves of unaccompanied minors, mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The number of arrests at the south-western border of unaccompanied minors peaked in 2014 at 68,541. Some 41,400 were arrested in fiscal year 2017, a 31 per cent decrease from fiscal year 2016, according to United States Customs and Border Protection. An unaccompanied foreign child is the legal term of a person who does not have legal immigration status in the United States; who is under the age of 18; who has no father or legal guardian in the United States, or who has no parent or legal guardian in the United States to provide care and physical custody. To highlight the gaps in the law due to illegal entry? Trump has previously claimed that \"snakes\" prevent the deportation of unaccompanied minors. This is often wrong. The \"disgusting\" to which he referred is explicitly required by law. Unaccompanied minors from neighbouring countries (Mexico and Canada) can be returned quickly to their countries; however, unaccompanied minors from other countries are not returned immediately, but are placed in formal deportation procedures and can seek asylum. Individuals may seek asylum if they are persecuted or fear persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. With regard to Trump's claim for \"discovery of gaps\" and gangs, we requested the United States Department of Homeland Security and its agencies to obtain data on unaccompanied minors who sought asylum in the United States while belonging to MS-13 or other gangs at the time of entry. No information was provided. The immigration experts told us that while gang members could apply for asylum, it would be difficult for them to obtain it. \"If the gang member persecuted others or committed a serious crime in the United States or in his country of origin, he is likely to be denied asylum,\" said Fatima E. Marov, Professor of Law and Director of the Immigration Rights Clinic at the University of Texas, A&M. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverdi on February 3, 2021 \"most asylum-seekers who we see flee from gangs or refuse to join a gang. It is also difficult for them to obtain asylum in the United States because they are not easily fit for one of the five reasons for asylum, as Marouf said. Do gang members come to the United States as unaccompanied minors? According to a written certificate issued in June 2017 by the Acting Chief of the United States Border Patrol, Carla Profust, since fiscal year 2012 the United States Border Patrol has arrested 159 foreign children unaccompanied by confirmed or suspected gang affiliations. According to Profust, 56 out of 159 children were suspected of belonging to MS-13 or were found to be affiliated with MS-13. \u2219 (On average, some 45,400 unaccompanied minors were arrested in fiscal year 2012-2017) The police chief &apos; s testimony did not break the number of unaccompanied minors who were confirmed to be gang members and the number of suspects. Saba N. Ahmed, a clinical trainer at the Immigration and Human Rights Clinic at Columbia District University, said David A. Clarke Law School. \"In fact, in the very recent collective case of Saravya, arising from the activity of Operation Matador in New York, the Federal District Judge ordered the Government to support these allegations, and they could not do so,\" Ahmed said. Sonia Wolfe, a researcher in the drug policy programme at the Centre for Economic Research and Thought of Mexico, said that the inflammation of \"suspects\" and \"confirmed\" was an exaggeration of the gang problem in the United States. \"Not all unaccompanied minors are involved in gangs, not all gang members are undocumented immigrants but often born in the United States,\" Wolfe said. The Institute reported that operations targeting gang members had led to the arrest of individuals who had come as unaccompanied minors. However, it is unclear whether they arrived as gang members or joined gangs after coming to the United States. Experts in immigration, gangs, criminal networks and law enforcement stated that unaccompanied minors were clear targets for recruitment. The then Commissioner of the Suffolk District Police Department in New York (currently the District Attorney General), Seni, told a Senate committee in May 2017 that unaccompanied minors were at risk of recruitment because they were young, unaccompanied, adapted to a new country, culture and languages, and sought a sense of belonging. \"while the vast majority of these children live a life that respects the law, (unaccompanied foreign children) are no doubt a source of recruitment in MS-13,\" said Seni. Of a sample of 156 active gangsters in Suffolk County, 39 were said to be unaccompanied. \"But it is not quite clear, however, that the percentage (unaccompanied foreign children) who came to the United States as members of the MS-13 gang were recruited while in federal custody or were their prey once they arrived in Suffolk,\" said Seni. In testimony before the Commission itself, Scott Michael Connelly, an investigator at the Chelsea Police Department in Massachusetts, said that while the majority of unaccompanied minors were fleeing violence, \"the smallest group of unaccompanied minors are \"boys\" sent by the gang to reinforce the ranks of the MS gangs operating in the United States.\" Connelly presented a recruitment scenario when non-gang gang members and minors in the same group travelled to the United States. Gang members collect information from non-gang members, such as their place of residence and relatives, and then use it later to recruit them. Connelly said that those who refused to join were subjected to attacks or threats to kill their relatives. MS-13 also uses human smuggling organizations to bring unaccompanied minors to the United States, as Angel M. Melendez, a special agent responsible for the internal security investigations conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency in New York, said during a hearing by the House Committee in 2017. \"Illicit corridors go hand in hand with MS-13 increasing its membership,\" said Melendez. \"When these children are smuggled into the United States, they become major targets of recruitment into the gang.\" Several studies have found that migrants are less likely to commit crimes than individuals born in the United States, despite allegations by the Trump Administration in general. Young immigrants from Central America - children and adults alike - are not only vulnerable to MS-13 threats, extortion and recruitment, but are almost always their main targets and victims, as Ahmed said, from the David A. Clark Law School of Columbia District University. \"DHS, hearings, Trump trying to shift the focus of immigration enforcement to MS-13 in order to dig repeatedly in the message that migrants are dangerous criminals,\" said Ahmed. But many gangsters were born in the United States, and gangs are in marginalized conditions, which, as Wolfe said, also exist in other countries, the researcher with CIDE in Mexico. \"MS-13 has undoubtedly engaged in dangerous and heinous forms of violence, and the destruction of families and communities. However, the focus on immigrants as a source of the gang problem in the United States is misleading, \"David S. Peroz, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Boulder, whose research includes gangs and criminal networks. While evidence suggests that migrants are less likely to be in gangs than young people born in the country, Beroz said that MS-13 is \"the ideal boogeyman, because of their ethnicity, transnationalism, and extreme violence.\" \"The problem is that constant invitations from the highest office in the country give MS-13 fame that they could not achieve on their own,\" he said. Our rule, Trump, said that many gang members used \"publication of loopholes and our laws to enter the country as illegal and unaccompanied foreign minors.\" What Trump used to refer to as \"snakes\" are explicitly required by law. It is also uncertain how many gang members came to the United States as unaccompanied minors, but some law enforcement officials said that some came. Experts note that unaccompanied minors are subject to recruitment after their arrival in the United States. In many cases, these minors are victims of gangs, not perpetrators. We're assessing Trump's claim of half the integrity.
