This is a state-level case.", "truth_label": "true", "date": "stated on February 24, 2019 in a newspaper article:", "title": "Did all the coal ash pools in Missouri really cause groundwater contamination?", "text": "In an article published on 24 February by St. Louis Post-Despache, Maxine Lepeles, Director of the University of Washington Multidisciplinary Environmental Clinic, made an alarming statement on the condition of groundwater in Missouri as a result of the contamination of coal ashes. \"All the pools in Missouri that we have data on cause groundwater contamination... this is a state-wide case,\" said Lebels. In its statement, reference is made specifically to coal ash pools and engineering pools used to dispose of coal ash wastes. Lipeles was responding to the efforts of the Missouri Legislature to transfer supervision of the disposal of coal ash from the federal to the state level. According to the Department of Energy Information, coal constituted 81 per cent of the electricity generation in Missouri in 2017, and coal consumes more for electricity generation in Missouri than in all other states except two. Coal ash is waste from coal burning for electricity. There are currently 16 coal-fired power plants and 41 coal ash pools in Missouri, according to a Washington University Law Report in 2019. Lipeles' statements may make you think again of any time you reach the kitchen taps. We checked Lepiles' claim to see if he was carrying water. :: Access to the data that we contacted with Libiles to understand the data on which her statement was based. :: Liplates directed us to the annual groundwater monitoring reports for 2017 submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency as of January 2018. The Environmental Protection Agency requires facilities to report groundwater monitoring data each year. The Environmental Protection Agency first requested reports starting in 2017. The 2018 reports have recently been added, but Liples has told us that she has not reviewed the latest reports. The Environmental Protection Agency also requested that plants share coal combustion residues, as required by the 2015 coal combustion disposal rule. Latest update of the EPA list on May 15, 2018. In examining the reports on the EPA list, we found that each groundwater monitoring report is produced for each utility company that appears to show at least one pollutant. Reports often emphasize corrective action plans and also try to demonstrate that an external source can cause groundwater pollution. We contacted Patricia Chouba, head of the environmental organization Labadi and a trained biologist, to give a second opinion on the claim of Lepiles. \"It's an honest statement that every [farm] that must reach under the base of the coal ash of Meisuri shows pollution,\" said Shoba. \"I think there's only a few that there's only one polluter, but arsenic appears to be the main polluter that appears in the Missouri test as well as Mulebdenum.\" In one interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \"more water fell in Houston in five days than in Niagara Falls in one year.\" Brandon Mulder also emphasized on February 5, 2021 the risk of groundwater contamination beyond drinking water. \"There's this great concern that we don't realize that these things are too dangerous as we put them in the water environment where they can become soluble.\" \"It pollutes a huge economic resource of the State, and I think the risk is quite unappreciated.\" As Apple Ross, Senior Environmental Safety Project Attorney, agreed to the claim of Lipeles. Having previously worked in the field of human health risk assessment as an associate researcher and toxicologist, Ross has submitted to us a 80-page report containing assessments of groundwater pollutants found at each power plant in Missouri that provided groundwater monitoring data in March 2018 in accordance with the 2015 coal combustion residue disposal rule. \"We were trying to determine whether each site had unsafe levels of groundwater contamination that could be attributed to organized coal ashes or landfills,\" said Ross via e-mail. \"In particular, we have calculated contamination at unsafe levels if (a) health-based standards were exceeded, and (b) levels in low-level wells were equal to or greater than those in advanced wells.\" According to the report, the only factory in Missouri that clearly did not cause groundwater contamination was the Sixton power plant. \"For Sixton, however, I would like to point out that there are high levels of coal ash index contaminants such as boron and sulfur in wells below graduation from the ash pond,\" said Ross. \"This tells me that Sixton Ash Pool is leaking. We did not include this in our report because the levels in groundwater, although above the background, do not exceed sanitary standards.\" For the final confirmation, we searched the Internet to find documents that could add support to Lepley &apos; s claim. After reviewing the Washington University &apos; s 2019 legal report on coal ash ponds, the data clearly support its claim that \"all the ponds in Missouri for which we have data cause groundwater pollution.\" Sixteen coal-fired power plants in Missouri were listed in the report, analysing a total of 41 pools of coal ash pools. For each plant on the list, its coal ash pools showed samples of groundwater that exceeded federal standards for drinking water for bourone, arsenic and/or sulphur. The only coal ash pools listed in the report that did not show groundwater contamination were those operated by plants that did not have groundwater monitoring data on their website to comply with the chemicals registration system. These include, but are not limited to, the municipal power plant in Colombia, the power plant in Missouri and the power plant in the Blue Valley. It should be noted that some plants that have not included groundwater monitoring data on their Convention compliance website contain coal ash pools that have been closed and are currently inactive. However, the closure of the coal ash pool does not always mean that it has been cleared. The governor Lepeles told us that every pond of Missouri's coal ashes for which there are data causes groundwater contamination. After analysing Washington University data and facility reports reported by the Environmental Protection Agency, each of the coal ash ponds in Missouri that published data either causes at least one type of chemical contamination of groundwater or shows signs that they have the potential to cause pollution in the near future. In view of the data in the context of Lipeles &apos; claim, we evaluate its statement correctly.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00700"}
