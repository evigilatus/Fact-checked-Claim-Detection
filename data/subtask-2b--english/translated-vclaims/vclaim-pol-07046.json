At some point during his attendance on October 28, 2014, at the North Milwaukee High School, Obama focused his remarks on women. Not to mention Jove. Scott Walker by name, the president filed a claim for equal pay and Republicans that we wanted to check. \"We believe that America is stronger when women are full and equal participants in the economy,\" said Obama, according to a copy of the White House. In 2012, the Republicans here in Wisconsin repealed the State Fair Pay Act. Now think about it. Just as I don't understand why someone against someone who has health insurance, I don't understand -- why do you want to repeal a law to make sure that women are treated fairly at work? Is this your platform? That's your agenda? Earlier this year -- this doesn't make sense. \" Thus, Obama's claim is that the Republicans in Wisconsin \"abolished the State-wide Fair Pay Act,\" which made \"check that women are treated fairly at work.\" This is similar to a statement made by the Great Wisconsin Liberal Committee in a television announcement attacking Walker. Let's check what the President said. We covered many of these reasons when Burke claimed that Walker's repeal of the 2009 law left Wisconsin one of five states \"without the Equal Pay Act that protects women from gender discrimination in their salary.\" We assessed her claim - which goes far beyond Obama's claim - that it was wrong. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. The fact is that white women gained employment.\" Through Nosiapa Mezan on January 15, 2021, here's what we found: Obama's law was the Equal Pay Enforcement Act. :: Adopted in 2009 when Democrats were in control of the state government, and then abolished in 2012 after Walker &apos; s election and his Republican colleagues won the majority in the legislature. The 2009 Act allows for equal pay claims to be brought before the State Court (which has already been and continues to be allowed before the Federal Court). This means that women who claim wage discrimination can raise more money - compensation and compensation - through the State Court, which some working lawyers consider to be easier and less costly than bringing a case before the Federal Court. Previously, at the state level, they could only file a complaint with a State agency, and they were likely to recover their wages and legal expenses. This approach is still in place. So Obama is right that the Republicans repealed the Fair Pay Act. The aim of this Act is to ensure that women are treated fairly at work. However, Obama &apos; s claim may give the impression that abolition means that Wisconsin did not have the Equal Pay Act, whereas in fact it still does. The abolition of the State Fair Employment Act, which has been in force since 1982, is not affected. It expressly prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of sex \"in promotion (f) compensation for work that is substantially equal or similar.\" It allows persons who believe that they have faced wage discrimination to ask their employers to return wages and legal fees - compensation less than they may receive in the State Court - through a State administrative hearing. There is also an option to bring an action in the Federal Court. Our assessment of Obama says that the Wisconsin Republicans have repealed the State Fair Pay Act, which made \"sure that women are treated fairly at work.\" Walker and the General Democratic Party-led legislature have repealed a law that provides for greater emphasis - through stronger penalties for employers in State courts - on the fair treatment of women. However, there is still a government law that allows women to receive less compensation for unequal pay through an administrative hearing process. For a precise statement, but it needs more information, our classification is often correct. To comment on this item, go to the biennial Malawi web page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07046"}
