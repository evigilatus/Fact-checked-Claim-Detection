Among other things, the legislation increases the sorts of beverages covered and leaves room for a possible increase from the current nickel deposit to a dime.\n\nIt\u2019s that last bit, the five to ten cents bit, that drew the strongEST rebuke from dissenting senators. The increase happens only if the return rate in Oregon dips below 80 percent two years in a row. Distributors don\u2019t think that will happen. In fact, they\u2019re so sure they can keep rates high that they endorsed the bill.\n\nBut some Republican senators didn\u2019t see how that made any sense. If proponents were so certain redemption rates wouldn\u2019t fall, why bother including that provision in the bill at all?\n\nSen. Jeff Kruse was among those who spoke against that piece of the expansion.\n\n\"We have some unintended consequences that may come in with this increase to a dime \u2026 I would point to a couple states -- Michigan and Massachusetts -- that increased their redemption value and what happened in both of those states is they could no longer afford the program because the redemptions were so high there was no profit in there,\" he told his colleagues.\n\nHis reasoning as far as we could tell -- and he later confirmed -- was that those states had such high redemption rates, the deposit money mostly got refunded and that left the states no money to run their programs.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty dire prognosis: The program could work so well that it would eliminate its own funding stream.\n\nPolitiFact Oregon decided to check it out. First up was Michigan. We talked to Terry Stanton, the spokesman for the state\u2019s Department of Treasury.\n\nMichigan\u2019s deposit, he said, was indeed 10 cents -- the highest in the nation -- and the return rate was nearly 97 percent. (For comparison, Oregon is just under 80 percent.)\n\nDoes the high redemption cause problems? Is the Michigan system going broke?\n\nAt first, Stanton didn\u2019t seem to understand what we were asking. The idea that the bottle redemption program was a way to raise funds and not to encourage recycling just didn\u2019t seem right.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said. \"That wasn't the purpose of the program \u2026 This was initiated really to clean up the road waste.\"\n\nRight, we said. Same with Oregon. But here, the unclaimed deposits help run the system. If there aren\u2019t any, the system might face problems. We asked again: Is that happening in Michigan.\n\nHe checked and sent us this e-mail:\n\n\"First, as noted on the phone, Michigan's bottle deposit law was put in place in the 1970's, to help cleanup roadsides, etc., that were becoming cluttered with bottles and cans. \u00a0The deposit has been at 10 cents since inception. \u00a0Michigan's program, which was approved by a vote of the people, was not designed to be a revenue generator but to keep roadsides and the environment clean. ...\n\n\"As for the unredeemed cans, the Michigan Bottle Deposit Law states that of the unclaimed deposits that revert to the state, 75 percent is deposited into the Cleanup and Redevelopment Trust Fund and 25 percent is returned to the retailers. ... \u00a0\n\n\"I'm not sure what the individual in Oregon is claiming as far as \u2018not having the money to operate.\u2019 \u00a0As far as I'm aware, Michigan's program is not experiencing problems.\"\n\nWell, that didn\u2019t seem to match very well with what Kruse had said. So, we gave him a call and asked where he\u2019d heard that Michigan was going broke.\n\n\"I don't have documentation,\" Kruse said, adding it came from \"a discussion we were having.\"\n\n\"The logic behind it is that the program pays for itself by those (deposits) that aren't returned. So, if you get to the point where you're getting 100 percent\" there\u2019s no fuel for the program, Kruse said. \"I guess i was trying to make the point that this move, if we got back to the dime, could come back to bite us in a way that we did not anticipate.\"\n\nThen, he added that the deposit might be even higher in Massachusetts -- even a quarter. Maybe there were issues there.\n\nWe did some Googling (we\u2019re hi-tech here) and couldn\u2019t find anything about a quarter deposit there. We did find a few articles about an expansion included in the Massachusetts governor\u2019s proposal, but that dealt only with the types of containers included. There wasn\u2019t a word about an increase from a nickel to a quarter.\n\nBut we like to be complete in our fact-checking, so we gave the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection a call. We talked to Edmund Coletta, the spokesman for the department, about the latest on the state\u2019s deposit system.\n\nThe bottle deposit, he confirmed, was still a nickel. The governor recently pushed to get more beverage containers included under the program, he said, but neither the state\u2019s House nor Senate included the changes in their budget proposals.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he added, increasing the current nickel deposit is \"definitely not in the governor\u2019s proposal.\"\n\nFor a final word on all this, we decided to give John Anderson a call. He\u2019s the president of the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative, the group that\u2019s helping to expand redemption centers through the state. We asked him whether Kruse might be on to something. Could an increased deposit lead to a collapse in Oregon\u2019s system?\n\nWhile it\u2019s true, he said, that unredeemed deposits \"are the major funding for the system\" it\u2019s unlikely that, even with a dime, we\u2019d hit Michigan\u2019s 97 percent return rate.\n\nPart of that has to do with the fact that Michigan is surrounded by major out-of-state population centers. That \"Seinfeld\" episode about Kramer taking empties from New York to Michigan for the double deposit? That actually happens.\n\nBut Oregon only has Vancouver nearby. So even at 10 cents, \"we end up about in the high 80s, that's my estimate,\" Anderson said. \"I think we lose on redeemed deposits, but I don't think we go into a crisis mode.\n\n\"I don't think that's a problem that we really need to spend a lot of time on.\"\n\nThis case seems pretty open and shut to us. Kruse tried to persuade his Senate colleagues that too-high deposits in Michigan and Massachusetts were crippling those programs. But Michigan says that\u2019s not the case and Massachusetts doesn\u2019t even have a higher deposit rate. Kruse doesn\u2019t have any evidence to back up his claim. The statement is not just false -- it\u2019s ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12984"}
