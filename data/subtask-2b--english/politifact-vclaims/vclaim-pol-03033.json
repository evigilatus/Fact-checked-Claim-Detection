The gang started in poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. It\u2019s grown into an international criminal organization with more than 30,000.\nTrump campaigned on the promise to deport millions of undocumented residents, often describing them as threats to public safety.\nHere\u2019s what Villaraigosa said\u00a0on July 31, 2017 on MSNBC.\n\"I think we all agree that people that commit violent crimes ought to be deported. But going after the undocumented is not a crime strategy, when you look at the fact that the National Academy of Sciences in, I think it was November of 2015, the undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born. That\u2019s just a fact.\"\nWatch the interview here.\u00a0\nWe decided to examine this last point as part of our Tracking The Truth series, which fact-checks\u00a0claims in the 2018 California governor's race.\nWe interpreted Villaraigosa\u2019s statement to mean undocumented people commit crimes at a lower rate than the native born.\nBut we wondered whether this was really a settled matter.\nWe set out on a fact check.\nOur research\nWe started by checking out the 2015 National Academy of Sciences study Villaraigosa cited. It found: \"Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates.\" The study added that \"This disparity also holds for young men most likely to be undocumented immigrants: Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan men.\"\nIt continued: \"Today, the belief that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes is perpetuated by \u2018issue entrepreneurs\u2019 who promote the immigrant-crime connection in order to drive restrictionist immigration policy.\"\nThe academy is a nonprofit research organization charged with providing independent advice to the nation. It is funded largely by the federal government.\nFindings in a\u00a0March 2017 study by the libertarian Cato Institute also support\u00a0Villaraigosa's statement:\n\"Illegal immigrants are 44 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal immigrants are 69 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal and illegal immigrants are underrepresented in the incarcerated population while natives are overrepresented.\"\nThe Cato study used information from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey\u00a0for\u00a0immigrants aged 18 to 54 who are incarcerated in the United States.\u00a0\nTo examine Villaraigosa's claim, we\u00a0also relied on research into similar claims by our partner national PolitiFact. In July 2016, it rated Mostly True a statement by Libertarian candidate for president Gary Johnson that Mexican immigrants \"are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic.\"\nPolitiFact found several studies that back up this claim by citing incarceration rates. It also found groups that challenged those studies or said more research is needed.\nPolitiFact\u2019s findings\nPolitiFact pointed to a July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit in Washington. The council analyzed data from the Census\u2019 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of all immigrant males (Census does not specify legal status) between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population.\nLooking at California prisons, immigrants are also underrepresented. U.S.-born men are incarcerated in the state at a rate of more than two-and-a-half times greater than that of foreign-born men, according to a study by the Public Policy Institute of California.\nThe American Immigration Council also reported that 2010 Census data shows incarceration rates of young, less educated Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan men \u2014 which comprise the bulk of the unauthorized population \u2014 are \"significantly lower\" than incarceration rates of native-born young men without a high-school diploma.\nSpecifically for Mexican men ages 18 to 39, the incarceration rate in 2010 was 2.8 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for native-born men in the same age group, the council\u2019s report said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report\u2019s authors.\n\"They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police,\" he told PolitiFact. \"This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence.\"\nCrime trends\nPolitiFact also noted that as the immigrant population has increased, crime has gone down, citing Ewing\u2019s report.\nBetween 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population increased from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent, and the number of unauthorized immigrants went up from 3.5 million to 11.2 million. At the same time, the violent crime rate (murder, rape and aggravated assault) decreased 48 percent and property crime rate fell 41 percent, the report said, citing FBI data.\nBianca E. Bersani, an assistant professor and director of the Criminology and Criminal Justice Program at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, says her research also shows that crime involvement among foreign-born residents is lower than that of U.S.-born citizens.\n\"The rhetoric of the \u2018criminal immigrant\u2019 does not align with the bulk of empirical research,\" Bersani said.\nAccording to Bersani\u2019s research, while first-generation immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population, the second generation (individuals born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent) more closely resemble patterns of their native-born peers (three or more U.S.-born generations).\n\"This does not suggest that the second generation is uniquely crime prone, but instead that they are acting in ways that are no different from the rest of the U.S.-born population,\" Bersani said.\nDatasets with information on both crime and immigrant status are rare, Bersani said, though more research and data are becoming available.\nMore research needed?\nThe Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration policies, in a 2009 study said that overall understanding of immigrants and crime \"remains confused\" due to lack of data and contrary information.\nUnless inmates are identified as immigrant or native-born, incarceration rates are a poor way to measure links between immigrants and crime, the study said.\nAs PolitiFact reported in 2015, there isn\u2019t exact data on how many undocumented immigrants are currently incarcerated.\nPolitiFact California spoke about this critique with Ewing of the American Immigration Council, whose research supports Villaraigosa\u2019s claim. He said he\u2019s confident in the work that\u2019s been done and said critics have used anecdotes, rather than full-blown research, to try to make their points.\nEwing added that the studies backing up Villaraigosa\u2019s statement are \"from such a wide range of researchers using so many different methodologies and sources of data -- not everyone can be wrong.\"\nOur ruling\nVillaraigosa said \"undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born.\"\nHe cited a 2015 study by the National Academy of Sciences that backs up this claim.\nIn a fact check last year, PolitiFact rated a similar claim Mostly True. It cited additional studies by scholars and partisan groups that show that the foreign-born population is less likely to commit crimes than the native-born.\nIt also found that researchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime. It said this was a needed clarification.\nPolitiFact California agrees with these findings.\nWe rated Villaraigosa\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nUPDATE: We have added information to the \u2018Our research\u2019 section of this fact check from a March 2017 study by the libertarian Cato Institute. The study\u2019s findings provide additional evidence backing up Villaraigosa\u2019s claim that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native born.\n Share the Facts 2017-08-03 23:21:44 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"Undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born.\"    Antonio Villaraigosa Candidate for California governor    Monday, July 31, 2017 2017-07-31    Read More  info    \n\nPolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in the 2018 California governor's race through\u00a0our Tracking The Truth series.\u00a0\nHear a claim you want fact-checked?
