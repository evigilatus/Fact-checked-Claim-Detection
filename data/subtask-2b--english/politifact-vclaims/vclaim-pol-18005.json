Showing a man in what appears to be a military uniform and holding a rifle, it claims:\u00a0\n\"Joe Biden\u2019s great-grandfather Joseph J. Biden (1828-1880) was a slave-owner and fought for the Confederate States of America.\"\u00a0\nThe June 22 blog post itself says: \"Hey!! Cancel Culture! Joe Biden's great-grandfather was a Confederate soldier and owned slaves.\"\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere was not a Joseph J. Biden among Joe Biden\u2019s grandfathers, great-grandfathers and great-great-grandfathers.\nAnd there isn\u2019t evidence to back either part of the claim.\nBiden and Obama\nBiden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, was born into a working class family in Scranton, Pa., that later moved to Delaware, where he served as a U.S. senator. He served as vice president starting with Obama\u2019s first term in 2008.\nIt was reported in 2007 that genealogists found that Obama, the American-born son of a white woman from Kansas and a Black man from Kenya, had a great-great-great-great grandfather and a great-great-great-great-great grandmother who each owned two slaves.\nWe traced Biden\u2019s ancestry on his father\u2019s side, starting with his own father. Here\u2019s what we found.\nFather: Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.\nJoe Biden Sr. held a number of jobs, including in used car and real estate sales.

Biden\nJoseph H. Biden, an oil salesman, lived in Baltimore. He was born in 1893 \u2014 28 years after the Civil War ended \u2014 and died in 1941, according to Smolenyak.\nGreat-grandfather: George T. Biden\nGeorge T. Biden lived in Baltimore County, Md., and worked as a produce dealer, according to a document from the 1910 Census.\nHe was born around 1867, two years after the last of the enslaved people in the United States learned they were free, and died in 1933, according to genealogist Megan Smolenyak, who has written about the Biden family tree.\u00a0\nGreat-great-grandfather: Joseph H. Biden\nThis Joseph H. Biden is from the Civil War period.\nA document from the 1870 Census shows that Joe Biden\u2019s great-great-grandfather had the same name as Joe Biden\u2019s grandfather. The document lists this Joseph H. Biden as a carpenter who lived in Baltimore County, Md.\u00a0\nHe was on a draft registration list for the Union Army, according to a document provided to PolitiFact by genealogist Megan Smolenyak, but she said it doesn\u2019t appear he served and there is no evidence he enslaved people. He died in 1895, she said.\nOther sources\nA State of Maryland slavery database lists no Bidens. People who were enslaved in Maryland were declared free in 1864.\nA National Park Service database of Civil War soldiers does not list Biden\u2019s great-great-grandfather as having served for either side.\nKurt Luther, professor of computer science at Virginia Tech and leader of a team that runs the Civil War Photo Sleuth online tool,\u00a0said the surname Biden does not appear in various Civil War soldier databases he examined. Smolenyak also said she found no Confederates in the Biden family.\nLuther said the image we\u2019re checking is of Richard Young Bennett, a Confederate soldier who served with Mississippi\u2019s 2nd Infantry during the Civil War.\u00a0\nThe fact-checkers Snopes and Lead Stories also found no evidence to back either the Confederacy or the slavery part of the claim.\nOur ruling\nA blog post includes an image that says Biden\u2019s great-grandfather, identified as Joseph J. Biden, was a Confederate soldier who enslaved people.\u00a0\nBiden\u2019s great-great-grandfather was Joseph H. Biden. We found no evidence to indicate he was in the Confederacy or enslaved people.\u00a0\nWe rate the post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18005"}
