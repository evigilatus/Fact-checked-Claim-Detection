The politician regularly posts memes, photos and his reactions to daily news, at times critical of reporting and often without attribution. His \"Miller for Texas\" Facebook fan page has more than 330,000 likes.\nOn Nov. 27, 2016, Miller posted a fresh unattributed photo, this time of the muscled actor Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, shown wearing a T-shirt with a message Miller endorsed. Johnson\u2019s shirt read: \"We stand for the flag, we kneel for the fallen,\" along with this Miller caption: \"Thanks to Dewayne Johnson AKA \"The Rock\" for standing up and defending our flag. There are a few good guys left in Hollywood and The Rock is one of them.\"\nAs of early December 2016, Miller\u2019s Johnson post had drawn 3,500 reactions, 1,092 shares and 111 comments, all supportive, some praising Johnson for being a \"stand up guy\" who\u2019s \"not ashamed to admit\" his love for country, or telling Johnson \"he is The Rock for a reason.\"\nIs photo real?\nBut when we saw the photo presentation, it looked to us like the unsourced photo\u2019s shirt text had alignment problems. Also, the text on the T-shirt looked skewed and a smudge next to Johnson\u2019s right arm looked as if there might have been additional removed text or imagery.\nWe knew too that Miller had previously posted a photo lacking\u00a0accuracy. In March 2016, we found \"Pants on Fire\" \u00a0what turned out to be Miller\u2019s Facebook post of a fake image of Barack Obama holding a T-shirt with Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara\u2019s face on it. Separately, the Texas Tribune in December 2016 compiled what its story described as 10 Miller posts of \"demonstrably false, misleading or unsupported information.\"\nA reverse image search\nWe started our review of the Johnson photo posted by Miller by conducting a reverse Google image search of it. Such a search enables anyone to pull up similar images across the web, demonstrating if other versions\u00a0have been posted in digital spaces. If multiple versions of a photo exist online, a reverse Google image search can show some of the different iterations.\nWhat came back from our search: The same T-shirt and Johnson pose with other slogans displayed, such as \"Only elephants should wear ivory\" or \"Still here, still strong, Native Pride.\"\n\u00a0\n\nAdditional results showed Johnson standing in a blank V-neck T-shirt, without any text. And among those, one photo came from the cover of the August 2013 issue of Essence Magazine; that photo shows Johnson wearing a similarly fitting navy blue V-neck T-shirt, without any text on the shirt. Then again,\u00a0Johnson holds a different pose and presents a\u00a0different facial expression.\nOther results--on websites such as Pinterest and Mid-day.com, an Indian news and lifestyle website--showed what looked to us like a blank T-shirt version of the Miller-posted photo.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiller spokesman calls inquiry 'silly'\nSo, what gives?\nWe turned to a Miller campaign spokesman, Todd Smith, to find out where Miller picked up his Facebook-posted photo. Smith said he personally \"had no clue\" and said ours was a \"silly, silly inquiry.\" He said the message of the T-shirt is what counts. When asked what his comment would be if the photo itself was fake, he said he hadn\u2019t heard complaints from Johnson.\nJohnson representative says Miller photo 'photoshopped'\nNext, we endeavored to reach someone familiar with Johnson\u2019s photo history. After calling Johnson\u2019s public relations team, we heard from Britt Johnson with the Garcia Companies, who identifies herself as a social media spokesperson for Johnson.\nBritt Johnson said by email: \"While I can't recall where that photo was taken, I can say with confidence that the image/shirt\" shared by Miller \"was photoshopped.\"\nForensic photography expert\nSeparately, a web search led us to a forensic photography expert at the Forensic and National Security Sciences Institute at Syracuse University. By email, \u00a0Cathryn Lahm responded that what she looked at after downloading a copy of the photo we\u2019d shared from Miller\u2019s Facebook post and viewing the photo in her software program, \"the T-shirt The Rock is wearing is most likely \u2018plain\u2019 and the graphics were placed on the photo -- made to look -- like it was actually on his shirt,\" referring to the pro-flag message. She said the artist likely applied the graphic design onto an existing image, so Johnson would look like he was wearing the presented T-shirt.\n\"The original image was shot at some press event -- I think -- based on the \u2018hot flash shadows\u2019 as if he is walking the red carpet for some opening of a movie or an event,\" Lahm said. If she \"had to go to court\" about the authenticity of the Miller-posted photo, Lahm said, she would call the image a fake.\nOur ruling\nMiller posted a photo of \"The Rock\" wearing a T-shirt with a message calling for people to \"stand for the flag and kneel for the fallen.\"\nThat image, we found, was a product of photo manipulation. It looks to us like Johnson actually\u00a0posed in a plain shirt without any message.\nWe rate this photo\u00a0post False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.
