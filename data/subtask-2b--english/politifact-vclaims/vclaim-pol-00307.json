Here's his statement:\n\n\"This wall is a horrendous example of Washington misguided policy. Congress only funded half of the wall.\"\n\n\nRichardson got it mostly right, although Congress has taken steps to pay for additional portions. The ultimate cost is still uncertain, however.\n\n\nIn 2006, Congress approved building the wall in the Southwest to restrict undocumented workers' access into America. It will run 850 miles when built, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongress has approved $1.2-billion to pay for it -- about half its estimated cost. But Richardon's statement gives the impression the funding has stopped. In fact, the White House and Congress have taken steps to pay for the remainder of the fence, although there is still some disagreement about what form the fence will ultimately take.\n\n\nThe White House requested another $1-billion in spending for the fence in 2008. The House approved the spending in June 2007 but with strict requirements because Democrats are skeptical of the proposal.\n\n\nThe Senate has not yet approved it.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00307"}
