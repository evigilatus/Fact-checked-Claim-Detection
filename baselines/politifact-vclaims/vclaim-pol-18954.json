(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe post\u2019s claim is untrue. AARP as an organization does not support the Democratic Party, and the claim has been debunked by fact-checkers before.\u00a0\nAn AARP spokesperson, Jason Young, confirmed that AARP is strictly nonpartisan.\u00a0\nYoung said AARP is a tax-exempt social welfare organization in good standing with the IRS, and pointed PolitiFact to the IRS\u2019 description of social welfare organizations.\u00a0\nOn its website, the IRS says that a tax-exempt social welfare organization is \"an organization must not be organized for profit and must be operated exclusively to promote social welfare.\"\nThe website further explains: \"The promotion of social welfare does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office.\"\nChief operating officer Scott Frisch signed AARP\u2019s most recent tax filing, confirming that \"AARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization empowering people to choose how they live as they age.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAARP has a policy \"against endorsing \u2014 or giving the appearance of endorsing \u2014 political parties, government officials or candidates for office,\" Young said. (The full policy can be found here.)\u00a0\nHe also said much of AARP\u2019s leadership doesn\u2019t donate to political candidates or campaigns.\u00a0\n\"Most of our board doesn\u2019t give to candidates or campaigns,\" Young said. \"Our CEO doesn\u2019t give to candidates or campaigns. And most of our executive team does not give. Rank-and-file employees have the right to give, of course, but they don\u2019t direct the organization or its policies.\"\u00a0\nPolitiFact used Federal Election Commission data to confirm that the majority of AARP board members and the majority of AARP executive team members haven\u2019t made recent political campaign contributions.\nIndividual donors associated with AARP have donated primarily to Democratic candidates in most election cycles including 2016, 2018 and 2020, according to an Open Secrets campaign contribution database.\u00a0\nBut when surveyed, about a third of AARP members report that their political leanings are conservative, a third report their leanings are liberal and a third consider themselves independent or in between, according to Young.\u00a0\nSo what does AARP do with the money it receives from donations or from its $16 per year membership fee?\nThe AARP lobbies for policies such as protecting Medicare, fighting high drug prices, protecting Social Security, combating fraud targeted at older people and addressing senior poverty.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post asks, \"Are you aware that a portion of everything you pay A.A.R.P Goes directly to the Democratic Party.\"\u00a0\nAARP is a tax-exempt social welfare nonprofit that is not permitted to participate in political campaigns. People who work for AARP can make individual political contributions, but those donations do not come from the organization as a whole.\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18954"}
