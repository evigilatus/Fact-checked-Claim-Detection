Bush\u2019s record on job creation.\n\nKaine said in a speech\u00a0that during the Bush administration \"while the population in that period grew by 10 percent, the number of jobs in the nation grew by 1 percent.\"\n\nWe wondered if that was really the case. Alec Gerlach, a DNC spokesman, couldn\u2019t identify the source on which the former Virginia governor based his claim. So we tried to find it on our own, comparing census records from January 2001 - the month Bush was sworn in - to January 2009, when Bush left office.\n\nThat can be a bit tricky because the U.S. Census Bureau only does actual counts at the start of each decade, and that doesn\u2019t exactly line up with Bush\u2019s term, which ran from Jan. 20, 2001 to Jan. 20, 2009. Between each census, however, the bureau provides monthly estimates on the number of people in the country.\n\nThe figures show that on Jan. 1, 2001, the U.S. population was 283.7 million. By Jan.1, 2009, that number had risen to 305.8 million.\n\nThose estimates show the population increasing by about 7.8 percent, below Kaine\u2019s claim that the population jumped by 10 percent under Bush.\n\nWhat about the second half of Kaine\u2019s claim that the number of jobs only grew by 1 percent under Bush\u2019s tenure?\n\nWe turned to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which show that in the month that the former president took office, there were about 132.5 million non-farm employees in the U.S.\n\nIn January 2008, the month after the official start of the Great Recession, the total number of non-farm workers peaked at 138 million.\n\nBut as the economic downturn took hold, that number declined, and by the time Bush left office in January 2009 there were 133.6 million non-farm employees.\n\nSo over the course of Bush Administration, the number of non-farm workers rose by about 1.1 million, or .83 percent. That\u2019s just shy of Kaine\u2019s claim that the number of jobs rose by 1 percent under Bush.\n\nWhile Kaine\u2019s numbers are a little off on employment and census, he\u2019s right in suggesting that that U.S. population grew 10 times faster that jobs during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nEven so, several economists told us comparing raw population growth and job numbers is not a preferred way to examine job creation versus demand. That\u2019s because not all of the new people -- such as babies born during the Bush administration -- need jobs.\n\nWe were told a more meaningful measure is labor force participation: the percentage of the population between 16 and 64 that is either employed or looking for work. According to BLS, participation was at 67.2 percent when Bush took office and 65.7 percent when he left.\n\nHere\u2019s another thing to keep in mind: Economists have told us time and again -- on this claim and others -- that the policies of presidents and governors have only minor impact on economic cycles and job creation. \"They get too much credit and too much blame,\" said Sylvia A. Allegretto, economist at the Institute for Research on Labor & Employment at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nKaine\u2019s comment didn\u2019t address job growth in Virginia during the Bush administration. But it you\u2019re curious, Virginia did better than the nation on Kaine\u2019s scale.\n\nThe number of nonfarm employees in the Virginia rose from 3.53 million in January 2001 to 3.7 million in January 2009 -- an increase of 4.8 percent.\n\nThe U.S. Census estimate for Virginia that was closest to the start of Bush\u2019s term was a July 1, 2001, \u00a0figure showing the state had 7.19 million. \u00a0A July 1, 2009, estimate shows the state\u2019s population had grown to 7.88 million -- a 9.6 percent increase.\n\nTo summarize, Kaine said that during former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, the U.S. population increased by 10 percent while the number of jobs went up only 1 percent.\n\nEstimates from the U.S. Census and the BLS show that during the Bush years, the population increased by 7.8 percent while the number of jobs rose by .83 percent.\n\nKaine\u2019s numbers are a little off his and spokesman doesn\u2019t know where they came from. Even so, his suggestion that population growth outpaced job growth by a ratio of 10 to 1 is pretty much on the mark, so we rate his claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13522"}
