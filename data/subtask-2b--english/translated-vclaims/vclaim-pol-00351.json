Rohl lived in Walmart, one of the largest retailers in the country and the site of the attack in El Paso, Texas, killing at least 22 people and injuring dozens of others. \"The Mart is America,\" said Rohl at the 5 August interview. \"Mart is the largest employer in the United States, one of the largest arms dealers of the type of assault.\" It is true that Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the United States, but the retailer does not sell assault-type weapons. In fact, the company banned the sale of assault-type rifles in its stores in 2015. The definition of \"weapons of assault\" used by Rohl for the term \"weapons of assault\" can lead to some confusion, as there is no universal definition. In general, people on both sides of the debate on firearms agree that full automatic weapons, which are heavily regulated, should be considered as offensive weapons. \u2022 Full automatic weapons are subject to strict regulations that make it difficult for civilian buyers to purchase them. However, there is disagreement over semi-automatic rifles, which have been used in several mass shootings. When a ban on \"semi-automatic offensive weapons\" was imposed in 1994, the Ministry of Justice said, \"In general, offensive weapons are semi-automatic firearms with a wide range of ammunition designed and equipped for the rapid use of fire and fighting,\" according to CNN. There's a lot of retailers selling semi-automatic guns right now. Walmart is not one of them. Walmart's sales of guns continue to sell some firearms and ammunition, as part of its long and complex history of weapons. However, it ended the sale of weapons that could be considered as an attack. Walmart said that his current arms sales policy would not change after the last two group shootings, which meant that the company would continue to sell some firearms despite calls for the complete elimination of arms sales. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2012, but Wal-Mart has taken some steps over the past few years to refine this policy. These included an end to the sale of assault rifles in 2015, a decision attributed by the company to a reduction in consumer demand, rather than calls for arms control, according to The New York Times. \"We stopped selling arms like the attack in 2015,\" Wallmart Randy Hargrove's spokesman, Paulette Fuckett, said. \"We have a long-term obligation to sell firearms safely and in compliance.\" It is true that Walmart is one of the largest sellers of firearms and ammunition in the United States, as Hargrove said. He noted that the company sold arms in nearly half of its 4,700 United States stores and not, for example, in the \"neighbourhood market,\" where the focus was on groceries. In 2018, Walmart removed some soft weapons, games and other materials from its website that resembled assault-type rifles, as Hargrove said. The minimum age for the purchase of weapons has also been raised to 21 years. The company also states that it sells handguns only in its warehouses in Alaska, and in July, it stopped selling all weapons in New Mexico after the state expanded its background check law. The Dick Sports Goods Company decided to stop selling assault-type rifles in 2018 as well. According to CNN, Bas Pro Shopps continues to sell semi-automatic rifles, and Cabela's branch offers what his website refers to as \"semi-automatic tactical rifles.\" Gander Outdoors also lists semi-automatic firearms on its website. Other retailers also sell semi-automatic rifles on the Internet. MSNBC did not respond to the request for suspension. The governor, Rohl, said Walmart was one of the largest arms dealers in attack mode. Walmart does not sell automatic weapons and stopped selling semi-machine guns in 2015. So we're setting this expression wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00351"}
