Will they?", "text": "App-based driving services such as Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart are bankrolling California\u2019s Proposition 22, which would keep their drivers classified as independent contractors, not employees.\nLeading into the Nov. 3 election, the ballot measure \u2014 which has become the most expensive in state history \u2014 is mired in controversy and is the subject of a lawsuit from Uber drivers alleging that the company inappropriately pressured them to vote for the initiative.\nBut what\u2019s occasionally lost in the debate over Proposition 22 are the claims about what it will mean for drivers for app-based services.\nDetractors, like unions and driver advocacy groups, say Proposition 22 would strip drivers of the protections of AB-5, a 2019 California law that requires drivers to be classified as employees. The law, which has been delayed by legal challenges, would afford them the associated benefits like paid sick leave, workers\u2019 compensation and access to unemployment insurance.\nSupporters, such as ride-sharing companies and the California Chamber of Commerce, say Proposition 22 would give drivers benefits, like a guarantee of minimum earnings and compensation when they are hurt on the job, while allowing them to maintain the flexible schedule of independent contractors.\nIn an online ad paid for by Lyft, the company says \"Prop. 22 will give them \u2026 health care benefits.\"\nThat sounds like drivers with Uber, Lyft and other app-based companies will automatically get health insurance if Proposition 22 passes. The truth is a little more complicated.\nWhat does \u2018health care benefits\u2019 mean?\nWe reached out to Lyft to back up its claim, and the company directed us to the \"Yes on 22\" campaign. This is how the campaign explained \"health care benefits\":\nUnder Proposition 22, drivers who qualify \u2014 more on that in a minute \u2014 would get a stipend they could use to buy an insurance plan from Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace.\nThat stipend would be calculated like this: App-based companies would look at the statewide average monthly premium of bronze-level plans sold on the Covered California exchange.\nThe companies would then give qualified drivers a stipend of 82% of the average premium, said Geoff Vetter, a spokesperson for the Yes on 22 campaign. (On average, U.S. employers covered 82% of premiums costs for single coverage in 2019.)\nSo hypothetically, if bronze plans cost an average of $100 per month, Uber, Lyft or a similar company would provide qualifying drivers with $82 per month.\nDrivers would be eligible for the full stipend \u2014 all $82 in the hypothetical case \u2014 if they average 25 hours per week of \"engaged\" time, which does not include time spent waiting between jobs.\u00a0\n\"Most drivers work part time\" and spend about one-third of their time waiting for rides and deliveries, according to the nonpartisan state Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. Using that equation, drivers would need to work an average of 37.5 hours per week for a single company in order to receive the full stipend.\nA driver who averages at least 15 but less than 25 hours of engaged time each week would be eligible for 50% of the stipend \u2014 or $41 per month.\nThe stipend would be similar to employer-sponsored insurance because both employers and employees would contribute to the cost of insurance, Vetter said.\n\"For the people who do work closer to full time, it does give them that ability to receive health care coverage by getting a typical employer contribution for that coverage,\" Vetter said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes a stipend equal coverage?\nBut this stipend bears little resemblance to traditional employer-based insurance, which is what drivers would get if they were considered employees instead of gig workers, said Ken Jacobs, chair of the University of California-Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education.\n\"It has very, very little relationship to what anyone would think of as job-based coverage,\" Jacobs said. \"It\u2019s really wrong to think of this as health insurance.\"\nFor instance, under Proposition 22, the stipends would be calculated and distributed quarterly, based on drivers\u2019 hours. That could force drivers to periodically reassess what kind of coverage they would qualify for and could afford.\nWith traditional employer-sponsored insurance, a driver would enroll in a plan once per year and the premium wouldn\u2019t change.\nA vacation or illness could mean that drivers can\u2019t maintain the hours required by the measure, costing them their stipend \u2014 and perhaps their insurance \u2014 for the quarter, and stripping them of the stability usually associated with job-based coverage, Jacobs said.\nAnd getting money to buy an individual plan isn\u2019t the same as participating in a large group plan offered by an employer, said Jen Flory, a policy advocate at the Western Center on Law & Poverty, a nonprofit organization that advocates for low-income Californians and opposes Proposition 22.\nCovered California plans are typically less generous than the policies employees usually get through work, she said. And bronze-level plans, which have the lowest monthly premiums, also have the highest out-of-pocket costs for medical services.\nConsider the deductible, which is how much a person needs to pay out-of-pocket before insurance starts paying for care.\nIn 2018, fewer than half of Californians who had work-based insurance had a deductible, and on average, that deductible was $1,402 for a single person, according to research from the California Health Care Foundation. (California Healthline is an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation.)\nThe deductible on a Covered California bronze plan for an individual in 2021 will be $6,300 for medical services plus $500 for prescription drugs. Proposition 22 ties the stipend \"to the highest deductible, highest out-of-pocket plans on the market,\" Flory said. \"And it\u2019s for workers who aren\u2019t making a whole lot of money.\"\nDrivers could use the stipend to buy a more generous plan, but the monthly premium would be higher and the stipend would cover less of it.\nDepending on their incomes and other factors, drivers may also be eligible for tax credits and state and federal subsidies to help them afford plans on the individual market. But Flory said this amounts to the government subsidizing health insurance that employers should be paying for themselves.\nIt\u2019s also problematic to base the stipends on a statewide average of bronze premiums because that doesn\u2019t take into account the huge regional differences in the cost of care, said Gerald Kominski, a senior fellow at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.\n\"In the Bay Area, that contribution is going to buy a lot less than it would in Southern California,\" Kominski said. \"We\u2019re a big state and have a lot of variation of health care costs.\"\nOur ruling\nThe stipend offered under Proposition 22 is a \"health care benefit,\" but the wording is misleading and ignores critical informaiton.\nWhile neither Lyft nor the Yes on 22 campaign says the proposition will give drivers health insurance, saying that it will offer them \"health care benefits\" gives the impression that the stipend is similar to traditional job-based coverage. It\u2019s not.\nDrivers who value the ability to make their own schedules would have to figure out how to work an average of nearly 40 hours a week \u2014 essentially full time \u2014 to receive the full stipend. The stipend would cover a fraction of the premiums for health insurance that\u2019s typically less generous than what they\u2019d get as employees.\nMoreover, because drivers\u2019 stipends could change quarterly based on their driving time \u2014 which could be affected by vacation or illness \u2014 any coverage purchased with the stipend could carry a cloud of uncertainty.\nWe rate this claim as Half True.\nClarification: This story was changed to clarify that \"engaged\" time\u00a0does not include time spent waiting between jobs.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18805"}
