(Emily\u2019s List helps Democratic women candidates who support abortion rights.) Schriock ticked off several actions that ran counter to the group\u2019s stance, including Bush\u2019s support of abstinence-only sex education.\n\"And let\u2019s not forget that Jeb once held $1 million in family planning grants hostage until the programs receiving the money agreed not to discuss birth control at all,\" she wrote.\nWe wondered what Schriock meant about Bush holding grant money hostage, so we took a closer look at the books.\nNot talking about it\nWe found only a few media mentions of a situation resembling a hostage crisis, and they were the same ones Emily\u2019s List sent to us as proof. The primary source was a March 2001 story in the Tampa Bay Times that focused on a budget request from Bush for lawmakers to consider during the legislative session.\nThe story detailed how Bush wanted $1 million of the state Department of Health\u2019s $5.7 million family planning allocation to create education grants for chastity counseling. This would have mirrored some federally funded programs in the state that told teens to wait until marriage to have sex, without discussing birth control methods. Those programs, many of which were privately run by religious groups, operated under names like Best Friends, Sex Can Wait and Everyone's Not Doing It.\nThe request would have marked the first time the state would have funded an abstinence-based counseling program. The idea was criticized by sex education advocates and legislators who said teaching abstinence didn\u2019t work. They also said diverting $1 million would keep many poor women from getting HIV tests, pap smears, birth control counseling and other services at clinics and county health departments.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut except for a couple of mentions in other articles about the proposal, the March 2001 Times article was the only place we found that the request was fully examined. Even Emily\u2019s List couldn\u2019t tell us what happened to Bush\u2019s proposal. They did tell us their aim was to point out Bush had made clear he preferred abstinence-only counseling, and was willing to put conditions on funding to achieve that goal. That doesn\u2019t strike us as Bush literally preventing that money from being used for regular family planning services, however.\nThough the Times story says the request was supported by then-health secretary Bob Brooks, it was still just a request. Florida governors routinely submit a proposed budget each year before the session, but the Legislature has the final say on how money is spent. It appears in 2001 lawmakers didn\u2019t follow Bush\u2019s wishes.\nThe state Department of Health shared appropriations for family planning services going back to 2000\u00a0and found nothing specifying funds had to go to abstinence education exclusively.\n\"It does not appear that there was any proviso language that directed $1 million to be spent on chastity programs from the family planning category,\" spokeswoman Mara Burger told us. The 2001 appropriation for family planning was almost $5.8 million, a figure that has since fallen to $4.2 million today.\nFlorida continues to specify abstinence should be taught as a part of sex ed classes, although school districts are given plenty of leeway. The state is still one of the biggest recipients of federal money for chastity programs. Even anti-Obamacare Republicans in the Legislature agreed in 2012 to take millions set aside for abstinence education in the Affordable Care Act, even while rejecting other aid tied to the law.\nOur ruling\nEmily\u2019s List said, \"Jeb once held $1 million in family planning grants hostage until the programs receiving the money agreed not to discuss birth control at all.\"\nThere are a handful of news stories that say Bush in 2001 asked the Legislature to set aside $1 million for chastity programs out of the state\u2019s almost $5.8 million for family planning. That's a bit different from threatening existing programs with a gag order. More importantly, there's no evidence Bush's proposal\u00a0went into effect. The health department said no requirements for abstinence programs were passed by lawmakers.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06395"}
