Edwards ran in 2004, he wasn't for universal health care. I'm glad he is now,\" she said.\n\n\nClinton is correct. In 2004, when he was running for president, Edwards favored universal coverage for children but stopped short of proposing universal coverage for adults. At the time, he was concerned that true universal coverage would be too costly. \"What we ought to be doing is something that No. 1 is achievable and No. 2 is responsible,\" he said at a debate in Manchester, N.H., on July 28, 2003.\n\n\nEdwards released a health care plan in February 2007 that mandates universal coverage. At a debate a few months later, moderator Tim Russert charged Edwards with changing his position.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
