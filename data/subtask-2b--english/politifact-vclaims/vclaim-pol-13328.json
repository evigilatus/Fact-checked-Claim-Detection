In Minnesota, the budgets follow fiscal years that begin in July. So the first budget Pawlenty could have put his stamp on was the 2004 budget that went into effect on July 1, 2003.\n\nWe found spending numbers dating back to 1960, and averaged the two-year increases for the general fund between 1965 and 2003. We arrived at \u00a021.09 percent, so that\u2019s in line with what Pawlenty said.\n\nWe then turned to the second part of Pawlenty\u2019s statement, that \"we brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year.\" First, note that he\u2019s comparing two-year increments with one-year increments, which would make the difference seem more dramatic.\n\nStill, we examined year-over-year change from 2004 to 2011. (Again, Pawlenty left office on Jan. 3, 2011, but the fiscal year started six months before that.)\n\nWe averaged the year-to-year changes in the budget for those years and arrived at an average increase of 1.64 percent, very close to what Pawlenty said. If you took the two-year average, it would be a bit higher, at 3.53 percent.\n\nYet those numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\nAs Pawlenty was leaving office, state budget agency released forecasts showing spending increasing 27 percent over the next two years -- before the incoming governor, Democrat Mark Dayton, made any changes to the budget at all.\n\nThe budget analysts said the state had used several mechanisms to reduce state spending. That included using $2.3 billion from the federal stimulus and two separate delays shifts in spending on K-12 education that totaled $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion.\n\nThe budget numbers led DFLers -- that\u2019s members of Minnesota\u2019s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, equivalent to Democrats in other states -- to blame Pawlenty for using one-time fixes and ignoring structural imbalances.\n\nPawlenty supporters acknowledged the anticipated spending increase but blamed it on DFLers for refusing to embrace Pawlenty\u2019s ideas for long-term solutions.\n\nPawlenty\u2019s statement was that from 1960 to 2003, \"the average two-year increase in Minnesota state spending was 21 percent. \u2026 we brought that down dramatically, to about 1.7 percent per year.\" The numbers are accurate, though Pawlenty is comparing two-year increases to one-year increases. More significantly, spending forecasts increased dramatically as Pawlenty was leaving office, when short-term budget fixes like the federal stimulus and spending delays for K-12 education expired. Given that increase, we rate his statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
