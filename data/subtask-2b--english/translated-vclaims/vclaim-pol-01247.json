It was a narrow race until the end between Abrams, the Democratic, and Brian Kemp, the Republican, who resigned as the Foreign Minister of Georgia only after the elections. Despite narrow voting margins, one thing was clear early: Democrats easily won Fulton County by more than 72 per cent of the votes. However, in November 11, the story of the big league policy stated that \"an enormous amount of provisional ballots presented in the Democrat stronghold were rejected as double ballots.\" The Fulton District includes the city of Atlanta, which serves as the district headquarters. \"Bombshill\" says the address. \"Fulton County figures show huge double ballots, rejected ballots, non-citizens trying to vote.\" This story was highlighted as part of Facebook &apos; s efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Association &apos; s Grand Policy, a web site founded by Breitbart Alum, did not immediately respond to a request for further information on the story. From the ballot papers that have been cast, have large numbers been repeated, rejected or clearly illegal? No. According to the results of the official elections held by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Georgia, 425,139 people voted in the Fulton district. This means about 60 per cent of all 703,177 voters registered there. This means that less than half of one per cent of all ballots have been rejected. Of the 3,549 provisional ballots received by the province, 1,994 were accepted and 1,555 were rejected. The polls were rejected because 581 voters were not registered, 972 voted in the wrong district, and 2 were not citizens. The number of non-citizens voting - two - represents approximately 0.500 per cent of the votes. In the story, what appears to be November 8 is the \"Temporary Election Brief\" of the Fulton District Department for Registration and Elections. According to the notification, out of 3,722 temporary ballots received, 355 were accepted, 1,811 were repeat ballots and 1,556 were rejected. The reasons for refusing to vote, according to the notification, included three cases \"not a citizen,\" 581 \"not registered\" and 972 \"outside the province.\" Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021, a spokesman for Fulton County sent a slightly different number of Polyte Fact in November 15. Of the 3,549 provisional ballots received by the province, 1,994 were accepted and 1,555 were rejected. The polls were rejected because 581 voters were not registered, 972 voted in the wrong district, and 2 were not citizens. The province did not respond to the request for a final inventory of the provisional cards accepted and rejected. Is this a bomb? No. First, let us take a look at the provisional ballot papers. It is designed to ensure that voters are not excluded from the voting process because of an administrative error. If the voter &apos; s eligibility is unclear - if his or her name is not on the voters &apos; lists or he or she does not have the required identity card, for example - electoral officials must offer them a provisional ballot instead of a regular ballot. The officials shall subsequently decide whether the voter is eligible to vote and whether that ballot should be counted. The manner in which the provisional ballots in Georgia were handled has raised the concerns of the Democrats. Abrams filed an action to prevent the provinces from dropping some of the blank and provisional ballots, and her campaign demanded that officials prepare provisional ballots for voters who had moved but whose previous addresses were still reflected in the voter registration records, according to the newspaper. How states deal with temporary ballots - the number that is issued and rejected - often according to the National Congress of State Legislatures. In November, a federal judge decided that Georgia must take steps to ensure that the provisional ballot was not improperly rejected, as stated by Associated Press. After that, let's take a look at the double ballot. Election officials in Georgia may establish double ballots if, for example, the ballot was torn, defective or otherwise defective and could not be processed by the scheduling machine. If a voter chooses more than one person for the same position, officials must only overlook that invalid vote and may establish a double ballot excluding him. In the case of Fulton County, \"Dual Voices\" are the provisional ballots given by voters who voted in an area that is not a designated registered constituency. \"It's called duplicates because we have to copy the voting of the registered constituency for the proper recording of their vote,\" said April Majors in an e-mail to Politifact. While our ruling is true that Fulton County has rejected and reproduced some votes - and some cases of non-citizens trying to vote, according to reports - this story points to something outrageous in the Governor's election. Without context, the description of \"big double ballots\" wrongly indicates that Fulton County was a voter fraud site. The headline also misleads readers to believe that a large number of voters are non-citizens. The province found this to be the case in only two cases. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01247"}
