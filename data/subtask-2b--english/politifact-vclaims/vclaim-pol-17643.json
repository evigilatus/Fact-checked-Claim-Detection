But we reluctantly welcome it to our archive of mistruths about the 44th president\u2019s citizenship.\u00a0\nThe story, posted on Occupycorporatism.com, has this headline: \"Obama\u2019s lawyers officially admit birth certificate is fake.\"\nIt goes on to say that \"lawyers for the Obama Administration announced that Barack Obama\u2019s long form birth certificate was a forgery\" and \"Alexandra M. Hill, representative defense attorney for Obama, made comments that brought the Tea Party members to question the legitimacy of Obama\u2019s birth certificate.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThis inaccurate story seems to stem from coverage of a 2012 lawsuit filed by two New Jersey residents challenging Obama\u2019s eligibility to appear on the state\u2019s presidential primary ballot.\nPlaintiff\u2019s attorney Mario Apuzzo got to the heart of the complaint during an April 2012 court hearing:. \"\"What evidence does New Jersey have that this person who is running for president is who he is?\" Apuzzo said, according to an April 10, 2012, story in the Home News Tribune, a daily paper serving Middlesex County. .\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresiding at the hearing, Judge Jeff Masin indicated how he would rule in the case, according to the Tribune, by saying that past court rulings determined that children who are born in the United States but have parents who are not from the United States are considered natural-born citizens. Masin said he would consider whether Hawaii-born Obama, whose father was not from the United States, needed to do more to prove to the state\u2019s elections division that he qualifies to run for president. But he forwarned he would not be considering the authenticity of the birth certificate the president posted online as he made his decision.\nThe Obama campaign sent a lawyer, Alexandra Hill, to that hearing.\u00a0\nDescribing Hill\u2019s statements during that hearing, conservative columnist Diana West wrote later that month that Hill \"couldn\u2019t have been more adamant about not citing the online birth certificate as a means of proving the president\u2019s identity in this recent challenge.\"\n\"Indeed, she called the Internet image \u2018legally irrelevant,\u2019\" West wrote, \"arguing that New Jersey law doesn\u2019t specifically call for a birth certificate to quality a presidential candidate for the ballot.\"\nBut we couldn\u2019t find any evidence that Hill admitted Obama\u2019s birth certificate was fake, as the story we\u2019re fact-checking claims. And this is already well-trodden territory. Back in 2012, Snopes debunked the allegation that Obama lawyers said his birth certificate was a forgery.\nBecause \u2014 one more time now! \u2014 it\u2019s not. Obama is not a Muslim from Kenya. According to the president and independent biographies, he\u2019s a Christian who was born in Honolulu. And we\u2019ve carefully documented his Hawaii birth certificate.
