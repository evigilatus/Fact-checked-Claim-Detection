Adam Schiff knew more about the makings of a whistleblower complaint against President Donald Trump than he let on, according to reporting from the New York Times. But Republicans, including Trump, who have seized on the Times reporting have erred in claiming the reporting suggests Schiff helped write the complaint itself.\nThe Oct. 2 story said Schiff \u2014\u00a0the head of the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Trump \u2014\u00a0had learned about the whistleblower complaint before it was officially filed. The newspaper reported that the CIA officer who filed the complaint had approached a committee aide for advice on how to proceed with concerns over Trump\u2019s July phone call with the president of Ukraine.\nThe article explained how Schiff, D-Calif., knew to press for the release of the whistleblower complaint, which the Trump administration had previously tried to keep from Congress.\u00a0\nThe same day that the Times published its report, several right-leaning outlets jumped on the story, claiming it showed the whistleblower \"colluded\" with House Democrats. During a press conference, Trump claimed Schiff \"probably helped write\" the complaint and called it a hoax.\u00a0\nOne Facebook post published the same day took it a step further, alleging Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., worked with lawyers to \"devise the complaint.\"\nAnother one says, \"Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff were participants with attorneys and are complicit in EDITING AND COMPOSING THE \u2018WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT\u2019 BEFORE IT WAS FILED.\"\nThose posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\n\u00a0\nWhat we know\nSchiff \"learned about the outlines\" of the whistleblower complaint from the House Intelligence Committee aide who consulted with the CIA officer, the Times reported. The Times did not report that Schiff helped write, or devised the complaint.\nThe Times reporting, which relied on anonymous sources and has been corroborated by the Washington Post, shows that the whistleblower approached one of Schiff\u2019s aides with only a vague accusation against Trump. The aide told the CIA officer to find a lawyer and then told Schiff some of what the whistleblower told them. The aide did not share the officer\u2019s identity with Schiff.\nThe whistleblower\u2019s primary concern centered on the phone call Trump had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25.\u00a0\nRELATED STORY: Timeline: The Trump impeachment inquiry\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring that call, a summary of which was released by the White House Sept. 25, Trump asked Zelensky to consider reviving an investigation linked to Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company that Joe Biden\u2019s son had worked for as a board member while his father was vice president. That request came after Trump froze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.\nThe whistleblower reached out to the House Intelligence Committee aide sometime before they filed the official complaint to the inspector general of the intelligence community Aug. 12. Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump on Sept. 24, and Schiff is leading that inquiry.\nThe Washington Post article said it is not uncommon for the House Intelligence Committee to receive informal inquiries from whistleblowers before a formal complaint is filed, according to \"current and former committee staffers.\" And the officer took their concerns to the committee only after they had a colleague relay them to the CIA\u2019s top lawyer, which resulted in the CIA alerting the White House. That spooked the whistleblower into taking their concerns directly to the House, the New York Times reported.\nWhat the whistleblower and Schiff say\nSchiff did receive some information about the whistleblower complaint before it was formally presented to Congress. But both the House Intelligence Committee and a lawyer representing the whistleblower told us the complaint was drafted independently of Schiff\u2019s input, and we could find no evidence to the contrary. At the same time, Trump and Republicans have produced no evidence to suggest Schiff had helped draft or shape the complaint.\nWe asked the House Intelligence Committee what Schiff learned from the aide about the whistleblower complaint. A spokesman declined to comment on the particulars of that interaction, but he denied that Schiff had any contact with the whistleblower directly.\n\"As Chairman Schiff has made clear, he does not know the identity of the whistleblower, has had no communication with them or their attorney, and did not view the whistleblower\u2019s complaint until the day prior to the hearing with the (Department of National Intelligence) when the (Office of the Director of National Intelligence) finally provided it to the Committee,\" the committee spokesman said in an email.\nRELATED STORY: PolitiFact's Trump-Ukraine-Biden coverage in one place\nWe also reached out to Mark Zaid, the attorney representing the CIA officer. He said he also can\u2019t comment on what Schiff knew about the whistleblower\u2019s concerns, but that the officer \"drafted the complaint entirely on their own.\"\n\"In fact, none of the legal team saw the complaint until it was publicly released by Congress,\" Zaid said in an email. \"To be unequivocally clear, no member or congressional staff had any input into or reviewed the complaint before it was submitted to the intelligence community inspector general. Nor has the whistleblower or the legal team met with or even discussed this complaint with congressman Schiff.\"\nOur ruling\nSeveral Facebook posts claimed that Schiff helped write the whistleblower complaint against Trump.\nWe still don\u2019t know exactly what information Schiff received about the whistleblower\u2019s concerns. But there is no evidence to suggest that Schiff knew who the whistleblower was, much less that he helped them draft this complaint. The Facebook posts go beyond what has been reported.\nAbsent any additional evidence, the claim that Schiff helped write the whistleblower complaint is inaccurate. We rate the Facebook posts False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00087"}
