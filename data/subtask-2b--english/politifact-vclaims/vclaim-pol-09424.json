Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, who like the school boards\u2019 group depended on preliminary spending estimates calculated by the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers union. In February 2012, the association said that Texas schools are spending $8,400 per student this year on items such as salaries for school personnel, student transportation, school books and energy. Its breakdown suggests Texas\u2019 per-student expenditures trailed such spending in every state but two.\n\nThose calculations place Texas 48th among the states in per-student spending.\n\nAnd how might someone conclude, like the school boards\u2019 association, that Texas ranks 49th?\u00a0 The compiled figures, shown on Summary Table K in the association\u2019s report, downloadable here, reflect spending within each state plus schools in the District of Columbia, which has current estimated expenditures of more than $14,000 per student. Consequently, the Texas spending level falls 49th among the 50 states plus D.C.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy phone, Catherine Clark, associate executive director of the school boards\u2019 association, confirmed that the group relied on the NEA calculations in declaring Texas as 49th in education spending among the states. If spending in the D.C. schools figures into that conclusion, Clark said, \"then we\u2019re wrong.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe group said Texas ranks 49th in per-pupil funding among the states.\n\nTexas ranks 48th among the states, according to preliminary figures, and 49th only if one also considers spending in the schools in Washington, D.C., which is not a state.\n\nThis claim is close to accurate, but without the D.C. clarification, it rates as Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09424"}
