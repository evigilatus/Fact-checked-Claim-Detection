(Sorry if you were hoping for a free sugar rush.)\n\"Dunkin' Donuts is providing a free \u1e0cozen Doughnut Box to everyone! to celebrate 68th Anniversary!\" a website Dunkin USA announces, encouraging its readers to partake in a short survey in exchange for the donuts. \u00a0\nWe were curious about whether we could truly take this opportunity to get some free donuts from Dunkin\u2019, so we took the survey to see what would happen.\nThe survey asks its participants three questions. The first is whether the participant has ever visited Dunkin\u2019, the second about why the participant prefers Dunkin\u2019, and the third and final question asks whether the survey-taker is satisfied by Dunkin\u2019s services.\nAfter we completed the survey, the website asked us to share the page on Facebook, comment \"Thanks for my coupon,\" and click \"Like.\" We followed all these instructions, but were not presented with a coupon for the donuts.\nThe link resembles past offers that have also turned out to be scams.\n\"We only have 332 Boxes remaining so hurry up!\" the Dunkin\u2019 offer claims. A previous scam targeting Delta also featured similar language as well as the number 332: \"Congratulations! You have been selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Delta Airline Tickets! We only have 332 Tickets remaining so hurry up!\" the website Delta-Flying.info stated. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, links supposedly offering their visitors coupons for free Dunkin\u2019 Donuts in celebration of the company\u2019s 67th anniversary have surfaced in the past. Snopes debunked a previous version of the scam that was widely circulated in December 2017. Michelle King, a spokeswoman for Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc., told the website Retailmenot.com that the offer is not affiliated with Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.\nIf that isn\u2019t enough, the survey is rife with grammatical and spelling errors.\nThe survey asks, \"Have you ever visited at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts?\" when it would be grammatically correct to ask \"Have you ever visited Dunkin\u2019 Donuts?\"\nIn addition, the answer selections available for the survey\u2019s question \"You prefer Dunkin\u2019 Donuts because of?\" are \"It\u2019s Cheapness,\" \"It\u2019s Environment,\" and \"Don\u2019t Know,\" even though it would be correct to use \"Its\" rather than \"It\u2019s.\" \u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, while the survey touts a \"free Dozen Doughnut Box,\" Dunkin\u2019 Donuts doesn\u2019t use that spelling of the sweet treat.\nIt\u2019s unlikely that an official Dunkin\u2019 Donuts offer would contain so many errors. We reached out to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts but did not hear back.\nA website\u2019s claim that visitors will receive a coupon for a free dozen of donuts in exchange for completing a survey is too good to be true.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01915"}
