It then labels each as having a \"Democrat majority\" before concluding with this: \"We don\u2019t need gun control, we need Democrat control!\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\nThe claim raises two questions on the accuracy of the \"deadliest\" label and the partisan leanings. But the third \u2014 bigger \u2014 question is whether it\u2019s reasonable to connect the two.\nLet\u2019s dive in.\nCities list is outdated\nThe graphic\u2019s \"deadliest\" label is attributed to the FBI Uniform Crime Report. We\u2019ll take that to refer to the \"murder and non-negligent manslaughter\" data the FBI compiles annually for every city in the US.\nThere are a few issues here.\nFirst, the varied demographic and cultural factors at play in each city make comparing raw data like this a questionable exercise. The FBI explicitly warns against this type of ranking:\nThese rough rankings provide no insight into the numerous variables that mold crime in a particular town, city, county, state, tribal area, or region. Consequently, they lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their residents. Valid assessments are possible only with careful study and analysis of the range of unique conditions affecting each local law enforcement jurisdiction\nIn addition, the ranking compiled here is out of date.\nEight of the cities listed in the graphic \u2014 including Atlanta, Cincinnati and Oakland \u2014 are no longer among the 25 with the highest per-capita rate of murder and manslaughter, based on the 2018 FBI crime data, which is the latest available.\nParty affiliation is hard to pin down\nThe second element of the claim, the party affiliation, is trickier to pin down.\nWe\u2019re taking this claim to refer to the politics of the city as a whole, rather than the leadership, since the \"majority\" reference and the adaptation of the gun control phrase both seem to refer to a general group more than those in authority.\nWe would typically use a recent national election such as the 2016 presidential race to compare communities around the country. But election results are traditionally reported at state and county levels, not the city level.\nWe did find an analysis that looked at Metropolitan Statistical Areas around cities. But these areas include surrounding counties that are more suburban (and Republican), so it wouldn\u2019t be reasonable to compare voting data from that larger area to crime data from within city limits.\nBut suffice it to say, urban areas vote Democratic.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New York Times broke down 2016 results at the precinct level, and the maps show a clear pattern across the country of concentrated Democratic voting in densely-populated urban centers, with increasing Republican support in the outlying areas.\nThe pattern applies for cities throughout the list in the Facebook post: St. Louis, Baltimore, Milwaukee, Chicago, even smaller cities like Dayton, Ohio.\nElected leadership skews heavily Democratic in these cities as well. Among the 25 cities with the highest murder/manslaughter rate in 2018, three had Republican mayors, according to Ballotpedia and our research. (But again, the FBI discourages ranking cities in this way.) Some of those cities, like Milwaukee, are led by a Democrat even if the office is officially nonpartisan.\nConnecting violence and party not reasonable\nAll of which brings us to the core question: is it reasonable to connect the violence and partisanship?\nIn short: no.\n\"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any data that would allow us to draw a causal conclusion here,\" said David Weisburd, executive director of the Center for Evidence Based Crime Policy at George Mason University. \"Somehow arguing that Democrats cause crime or something of that sort just doesn\u2019t fit the history of crime prevention in the U.S.\"\u00a0\nIf you interpret the claim as referring to Democratic leadership, Weisburd notes President Bill Clinton had one of the strongest recent administrations in terms of funding the criminal justice system.\nBut more broadly, linking crime and votes simply doesn\u2019t reflect how crime works.\nStudies have repeatedly found that urban crime is not a widespread phenomenon \u2014 like voting is \u2014 but a product of small groups of people in small areas.\u00a0\nOne 2015 study examined crime networks in Chicago and found 70% of nonfatal gun injuries occur within networks that contain just 6% of the city\u2019s population. Another study that year found crime across a number of cities was concentrated in \"microgeographic hot spots.\"\nWeisburd said his research revealed a \"law of crime concentration\": Across an array of large cities, 1% of city streets account for about 25% of the crime, and 5% of streets account for about 50% of the crime.\nAn array of local socioeconomic and cultural factors play a role in which areas yield that concentrated crime. But it\u2019s a lot more than politics.\nA 2018 study from Boston University found racial segregation is a key risk factor for firearm homicide. An array of other local factors skew homicide rates and make a raw ranking a poor tool for understanding what\u2019s happening, said David Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College of Criminal Justice told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel for a 2019 series on homicides.\n\"You get a number. It\u2019s completely accurate. And it\u2019s deeply unrepresentative of what\u2019s going on,\" Kennedy told the Journal Sentinel. \"Many American cities are the product of a long, long historical reality of white supremacy and racial violence and disproportionate action by the criminal justice system.\"\nOur ruling\nA viral Facebook post links \"America\u2019s deadliest cities\" with having a \"Democrat majority,\" implying a causal connection.\nThe data cited has some fundamental issues, notably that it uses out-of-date FBI data and ranks cities by crime rate when the FBI specifically warns against doing so.\u00a0\nThis glosses over the array of intensely local factors that influence crime. Violent crime in particular stems from a limited group of people in a limited area, so assuming that segment has a particular political bent based on the city at large \u2014 and that their violence stems from those politics \u2014 is a stretch at best.\nLarge cities do have more crime. And they do have more Democrats \u2014 both in terms of general voting and local leadership. But it\u2019s a classic example of correlation without evidence of causality.\nWe rate this Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17983"}
