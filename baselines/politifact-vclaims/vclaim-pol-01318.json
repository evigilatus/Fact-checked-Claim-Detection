Democrats made up 116 of those 347 winning votes. All of the opponents were Democrats.\nIt passed the Senate 92 to 5 on May 23, 2018. Democrats made nearly half the winning votes. The \"Nay\" votes were cast by two Democrats, two Republicans and one Independent.\nIn short, precisely two thirds of the Democrats in Congress voted for the bill.\nTo make the claim that \"Democrats blocked the VA healthcare bill\" strikes us a meme malpractice.
