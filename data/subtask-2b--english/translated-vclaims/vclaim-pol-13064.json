Bob McDonnell's job record in a recent speech. McCulliff, who had successfully run in the 2009 Democratic Governor &apos; s first instance, said that the state employment situation had declined since McDonnell, a Republican, became Governor in January 2010. \"We didn't go forward. We went backwards, \"McAuleffe, who's thinking of running for governor in 2013, and said in May 7's speech at a democratic rally. \"I know Bob is working, talking about these great press releases. But if you take population growth here in Virginia, we're net zero on job creation since I became governor.\" Has the population growth in Virginia exceeded its career growth since MacDonald became governor? We decided to check. We have been told by Levar Stony, spokesman for Makuliv, that information came from a January 2011 report of the Commonwealth Institute for Financial Analysis, a think tank focusing on economic issues facing low- and middle-income populations. The study states that if the pace of job growth in Virginia continues between February and December 2010, it will take until 2022 to bring the State back to pre-recession levels of employment. However, this report does not contain the specific statement made by Makulevi on the growth of jobs in the State, which tracks the population increase under the McDonald system. So we went to the Employment Statistics Office figures to see if McCulliff was right. This section compiles monthly figures from a household survey showing how the size of the population of working age in each state compares with the number of residents employed in each state. The population of working age is defined as the number of 16 persons who are not in the army, prisons or mental institutions. We will begin with February 2010, the first full month of McDonnell in office. The working-age population of Virginia was 6,049,306 that month. The working population was 3,891,279. This means that 64.3 per cent of the population of working age in the State has jobs. As of March 2011, the working-age population in Virginia was 6,125,642, the latest figures in the child mortality survey. There were 3,931,679 employed - 64.2 per cent of the working-age population. Therefore, in March 2011, the percentage of the population of working age in the state with jobs was 10 per cent lower than in February 2010. The working-age population increased by 76,336 over this period, while the working population increased by 40,400. Makulev is right that the increase in the population of the State has exceeded the increase in the number of jobs. However, this trend is not unique for Virginia. Between February 2010 and March 2011, only 10 states experienced an increase in the number of residents employed at a faster rate than the population of working age, in accordance with the Labour Code. At the national level, the percentage of persons of working age in employment was 58.5 per cent in February 2010 and March 2011. Virginia has easily outdone the national average every month during that period since McDonnell became governor. We do not refer to this to stand by McDonnell. We only note that there is a world of employment statistics that politicians are scrutinizing to paint images that are favourable to their performance that create jobs and understate the work of opponents. Maculiff did not mention the record of his democratic colleague Tim Kane, who preceded McDonnell as Governor. But Cain, who's running for the U.S. Senate next year, is open to the same criticism that McCullivi sends to McDonnell. In February 2006, the first full month in Cain, or 66.5 percent of the population of working age in the state, had a job. By December 2009, Kaine's last month was full, falling to 2.46 percent. The working-age population in Virginia rose by 275,496 during the State of Cain, while the number of employed persons increased by only 48,249. In short, McCullough said that since McDonnell became governor in January 2010, the state's population growth has exceeded that of its functions. (McDonnell) Republican. Makulev does not note that the same trend existed when his democratic colleague Tim Kane was Governor from 2006 to 2010. Economists say that conservatives have little control over economic conditions. Virginia has consistently one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country this century. Irrespective of these points, McDonnell makes himself up as a governor who creates a job. Maculiff carefully summarized a series of employment statistics in Virginia during the McDonnell term. We're assessing his statement right. On January 18, 2021 in the Committee &apos; s discussion.
