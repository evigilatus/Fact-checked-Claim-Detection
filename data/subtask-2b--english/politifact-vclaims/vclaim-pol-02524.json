(As Eisen noted, Trump, as president, is exempt.)\nThese rules are overseen by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, or OGE, an executive branch agency whose 4,500 ethics officials serve as watchdogs over the executive branch to prevent (or resolve) conflicts of interest, with the aim of safeguarding governmental integrity.\nEisen specifically pointed to a section of the rules that deal with executive branch employees misusing their government jobs. The section states that an executive branch employee \"shall not use his public office for the endorsement of any product or enterprise.\"\nBecause of that rule, the ethics office also has long considered it improper for an executive branch employee to condemn a company, said Walter Shaub, who led the OGE until his resignation in July 2017.\n\"You can't use your government position to endorse a company, and you can't trash a company to the advantage of a different company,\" said Shaub, who is now the senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center.\nIt's unclear if Trump\u2019s event is being held by the White House or the Trump/Pence campaign, and neither organization replied to our questions. (Eisen's tweet \u2014 and this analysis \u2014 deals with official government events. A separate set of laws, including the Hatch Act, would apply if White House staffers participated in a campaign event, sources said.)\nWould White House staffers\u2019 participation breach ethics rules?\nAbsolutely, according to Shaub, who retweeted Eisen\u2019s warning to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\"Hey @PressSec & @RajShah45, Norm is right. If you or ANY WH staffers work on this or post it on the WH website, it will be a violation of the Standards of Conduct. Beware of laws on using federal appropriations too, if there are any visuals, certificates, handouts, or trophies,\" Shaub tweeted Jan. 7.\nHey @PressSec & @RajShah45, Norm is right.

Bush administration, said that while some ethics rules can be ambiguous,\u00a0a Trump staffer's participation would be out of bounds.\n\"The endorsement of some news outlets and the condemnation of others crosses the line under the OGE regulations,\" he said. \"It\u2019s hard to show where that line precisely is, but what I can tell you is it has been crossed in this instance.\"\nAbsent some kind of serious government study showing systemic failures by certain media organizations, there\u2019s no compelling government interest that justifies the staging of fake news awards, he said.\n\u2018Treading really close to a First Amendment problem\u2019\nPainter said Trump\u2019s tweets, as well as other administration actions affecting the media industry, raise First Amendment concerns. This\u00a0makes it more likely an ethics official would find a staffer broke the rules by participating in Trump's fake news awards, he said.\nDuring his time in office, scores of Trump\u2019s tweets have followed a familiar pattern: praise for Fox News and scorn for its competitors.\nOn Twitter, Trump mentioned Fox News, its programs or its hosts in more than 70 tweets that describe the right-wing media outlet in positive, if not glowing, terms. Trump uses Twitter to promote Fox News reporting, highlight favorable coverage of him and his administration and lavish praise on the network while condemning their competitors.\n\"The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!\" Trump tweeted Feb. 15, 2017.\nThe fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017\n\nOver the same period, Trump has mentioned Fox News' rivals more than 50 times. Aside from two tweets promoting his own interview on ABC News, these tweets have ranged from negative to\u00a0scathing.\n\"The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!\" Trump tweeted Feb. 17, 2017.\nIn addition to Trump's tweets, Painter said there\u2019s other evidence the administration has used its power to play favorites in the media industry,\u00a0raising\u00a0First Amendment concerns that bolster the case that the fake news awards are\u00a0out of bounds.\nHe pointed to the Justice Department's antitrust suit against Time Warner, which has raised questions about whether this was done as retribution against CNN; Trump\u2019s threat against NBC's license over reporting he disputed; and Trump\u2019s repeated \u2014 and false \u2014 attacks on Amazon and its chairman Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post.\nPainter also noted Trump congratulated Rupert Murdoch, who co-chairs 21st Century Fox, over a deal to sell significant Fox assets to Disney, after Trump reportedly sought reassurance that Fox News wouldn\u2019t change hands.\n\"There's some concrete evidence that they're playing favorites with the media organizations in official action, and penalizing those who do not give them the news coverage they like,\" Painter said. \"Couple that with the president's tweets, including several that suggest he wishes he were in a country without the First Amendment, and this is viewed as a part of a pattern of conduct.\"\nBoth Painter and Shaub noted the ethics rules also require loyalty to the rule of law and the constitution.\n\"In effect the president is trying to establish official news media, establish that Fox is good and CNN is bad,\" Painter said. \"That does loop back into what's a reasonable application of the OGE rule if what you're doing is treading really close to a First Amendment problem.\"\nEisen and Painter are chair and vice chair, respectively, of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which unsuccessfully sued Trump for violating a constitutional bar on presidents and federal officials accepting gifts and payments from foreign governments.\nOur ruling\nEisen said the White House staff risks violating federal ethics rules if they participate\u00a0in Donald Trump\u2019s \"fake news awards.\"\nTwo experts, who practiced government ethics at the highest levels, said participation by White House staffers would violate federal ethics rules. Trump, for the record, is exempt.\u00a0They added that the president and his administration\u2019s pattern of playing favorites among media outlets raises First Amendment issues that would subject this event to heightened scrutiny by ethics officials.\nWe rate this statement True.\n Share the Facts 2018-01-11 22:10:18 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  The White House staff risks violating federal ethics rules if they participate in Donald Trump\u2019s \"fake news awards.\"    Norm Eisen President Barack Obama's former ethics czar https://twitter.com/NormEisen/status/950127003801411584   in a tweet Sunday, January 7, 2018 2018-01-07    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02524"}
