Mark Walker, a Greensboro Republican, tweeted a thank you to President Trump on Nov. 27.\n\n\"Thank you @realDonaldTrump. These cartels endanger Americans and threaten our country\u2019s national security. The problem is so bad that @StateDept issued a \"Do Not Travel\" advisory to a Mexican state that has a 230m border with the US\u2013the same designation as Syria,\" Walker tweeted.\u00a0\nWalker, who has 26,000 Twitter followers, tweeted his comments in reaction to a story about the U.S. designating drug cartels as terrorist groups. But Walker\u2019s claim \u2014 about a Mexican state having the same travel warning as Syria \u2014 isn\u2019t addressed by the New York Times story he tweeted.\u00a0\nSo we wondered whether the claim by Walker was true. And, from our research, he\u2019s on-point.\nWe analyzed Walker\u2019s claim in three parts:\nDid the U.S. government issue a \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for a Mexican state?\nDid the U.S. government issue the same travel advisory for Syria?\u00a0\nAnd how long is that Mexican state\u2019s border with the U.S.?\nTravel advisories\nThe State Department labels the safety levels in foreign countries using a four-step scale:\n1- Exercise normal precautions.\n2- Exercise increased caution.\n3- Reconsider travel.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4- Do not travel.\nThe State Department considers Mexico as a whole to be a Level 2 country, meaning travelers should \"exercise increased caution.\" The department also assigns advisory levels to individual states. Five states are at the \"do not travel\" level: Colima, Guerrero, Michoacan, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas.\nA \u2018lawless\u2019 border state\nOnly one Level 4 state, Tamaulipas, shares a border with the United States. And it is known for being dangerous.\nThe Associated Press has described the Tamaulipas as a \"lawless border state.\" The state department website says this about the area:\n\"Violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion, and sexual assault, is common. Gang activity, including gun battles and blockades, is widespread. Armed criminal groups target public and private passenger buses as well as private automobiles traveling through Tamaulipas, often taking passengers hostage and demanding ransom payments.\"\nAs it turns out, Tamaulipas has the same travel advisory as Syria.\u00a0\nLength of the border\nWalker\u2019s tweet about the length of the border \u2014 230m \u2014 might give readers pause. The letter \"m\" is an abbreviation for a meter of length. A meter is about 39 inches. So, at first glance, one might think Walker was referring to a border slightly longer than two football fields.\nBut, given the U.S. isn\u2019t on the metric system, it\u2019s more likely that Walker was referring to miles. And indeed that was the case, according to spokesman Jack Minor.\u00a0\n(Quick fact: the correct abbreviation for a mile is \"mi,\" according to Dictionary.com.)\nAsked for the source of Walker\u2019s information, Minor emailed a link to a 2012 McClatchy DC story, \"Along Mexico border, drug taint on politicians lingers.\"\nThe second paragraph describes Tamaulipas as \"a muggy Gulf Coast state that shares a 230-mile border with Texas and is a major conduit for licit and illicit trade.\" And that length estimate checks out. A page found on the Mexican government website describes the Tamaulipas-U.S. border as being 370 kilometers, which is equal to 230 miles.\nOur ruling\nWalker said Mexican cartels are so bad that the U.S. \"issued a \u2018Do Not Travel\u2019 to a Mexican state that has a 230m border with the US\u2013the same designation as Syria.\"\nThat state is Tamaulipas. It has the same \"Do Not Travel\" advisory warning as Syria. And the border is roughly 230 miles long. We rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16654"}
