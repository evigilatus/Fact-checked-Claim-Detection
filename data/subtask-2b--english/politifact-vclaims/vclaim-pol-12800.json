The two Williamses (unrelated) are both Republicans who recently dropped U.S. Senate bids to run in the same newly created North Texas House district.\n\n\"My opponent does not live in the district,\" Roger Williams said June 28, according to The Weatherford Democrat. \"My opponent has never voted in the district.\"\n\nNot living there? Never voted there?\n\nPer the U.S. Constitution, a citizen does not have to live in a congressional district to hold its House seat, though they must be an inhabitant of the same state. If a candidate doesn't live in the district, though, their opponents are likely to point that out.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this episode, Roger Williams was questioning his foe's ties to the 33rd Congressional District just drawn by the Republican-controlled Legislature. Its map of the state\u2019s 36 congressional districts awaits Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s approval.\n\nMichael Williams\u2019 campaign disputed Roger Williams\u2019 charge in a June 30 press release. The release says Michael Williams and his wife, Donna, \"have owned and claimed a homestead exemption on the same home\" in the district since 1995 and, it says, Williams has voted in Arlington many times.\n\nIn an interview, Will Fullerton, Michael Williams\u2019 campaign manager, told us Williams lived in an Austin condominium while serving on the Texas Railroad Commission, from 1999 to this spring, to satisfy a state constitutional provision requiring statewide elected officials to live in the capital. He said too that Williams has lived in his Arlington home since resigning from the commission as of April 2.\n\nWilliams was registered to vote in Austin while serving as a commissioner, Fullerton said, though he laid plans to register in Tarrant County after stepping down.\n\nWe turned next to government sources.\n\nAccording to a clerk with the Tarrant County Appraisal District, Michael and Donna Williams have claimed a homestead exemption on an Arlington residence since 1995. A county elections clerk, Rita Castillo, told us the county fielded a voter registration application from Michael Williams on June 24 and it\u2019s being reviewed by the Texas secretary of state\u2019s office, which oversees elections. Castillo said a state database lists Michael Williams as currently registered to vote in Austin.\n\nResponding to our open-records\u2019 request, Tarrant County later provided information indicating that Michael Williams went to the county\u2019s polls 10 times from November 1994 through November 1999.\n\nTo our inquiry, Roger Williams\u2019 spokesman Colby Hale stressed by email that Michael Williams admits to living in Austin for a decade and to making Austin the \"principal location where he votes.\" He later added that Roger Williams intended to say that for more than a decade, Michael Williams lived, worked and voted in Austin.\n\nFar as we can tell, this amended description is about right. However, Michael Williams has also lived in Arlington, where he has claimed a homestead in Arlington for more than 15 years. And contrary to his foe\u2019s published statement, Michael Williams also has voted in the 33rd district and lives there now.\n\nAll told, the essence of Roger Williams\u2019 statement \u2014 that Michael Williams is a carpetbagger \u2014 doesn\u2019t hold up. We rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12800"}
