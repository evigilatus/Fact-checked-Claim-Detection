The comment says, \"When President Trump's travel to England is covered, why does every news channel show the same footage of the protesters on Trump but no one will show the thousands who showed up to support him? Well, this is a picture of what the British Trump supporters look like.\" The photo was made public as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No, the people in that picture weren't there for Donald Trump (which wasn't even in the country yet anyway). In fact, the show took place on June 2 the day before Trump arrived in the United Kingdom, marking the victory of the Liverpool Football Club 2-0 on Tottenham Hotsbor at the 2019 Champion League Final in Madrid. According to BBC, the police estimated that more than 750,000 fans had turned into a parade of victory. The Liverpool Echo published an article on the wrong picture on January 12, 2021. The photograph was not even taken in London, where the President stayed during his three-day visit. This happened in Liverpool, of course, which is more than 200 miles north of the country's capital. The dominant color of the Panel is red and does not represent the red clothing worn by some supporters of the President. This allegation came when several outlets stated that tens of thousands of people gathered on the streets of London to protest the visit to Trump. There are also reports of pockets of Trump supporters in these crowds, but this picture, which has been described as \"thousands of English Trump supporters,\" is not correct. We value it pants on fire! Correction, June 18, 2019: An earlier version of this story contains an erroneous attribution of a story to the wrong picture. The newspaper Liverpool Echo published the article. This correction does not change the classification.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00529"}
