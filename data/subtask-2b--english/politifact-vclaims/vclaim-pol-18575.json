In that time the Illinois teen has become something of a conservative celebrity, generating millions of dollars for his release and the ongoing legal case where his lawyers will argue he acted in self defense.\nRittenhouse was released from custody Nov. 20, 2020, but we learned an array of new details the day before in a jailhouse interview with the Washington Post \u2014 including how he came by the gun used in the shooting.\nOne widely shared Instagram post honed in on that detail Nov. 20, saying, \"Kyle Rittenhouse used his COVID-19 stimulus check to purchase the AR-15 he used in the fatal Kenosha shooting.\"\nDid the gun used in the streets of Kenosha really come from a federally-funded stimulus?\nA confusing quote\nThe balleralert Instagram account that posted the claim cited the Washington Post as its source, and that is largely what the paper reported.\nThe Nov. 19 story reads in part, \"The Post found that Rittenhouse, who was too young to buy a rifle, had arranged for an adult friend to buy the weapon for him using money Rittenhouse had received from a government stimulus program.\"\nThat friend, 19-year-old Dominick Black of Burlington, Wis., purchased the weapon for him at an Ace Hardware store in Ladysmith, Wis., on May 1, 2020, according to a criminal complaint charging Black with two felony counts of intentionally giving a dangerous weapon to someone under 18, resulting in death. The gun was then stored at Black\u2019s stepfather\u2019s house in Kenosha, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.\nHere\u2019s how Rittenhouse described the purchase to the Post.\n\"I got my $1,200 from the coronavirus Illinois unemployment because I was on furlough from YMCA,\" he said. \"And I got my first unemployment check so I was like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll use this to buy it.\u2019\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where the matter gets a bit muddled.\nThe Post reported generally that stimulus funds were used, while the Instagram post made a more specific reference to \"stimulus checks,\" which would reference the payments of $1,200 per person. And Rittenhouse appears to confuse the two in his statement.\nThe stimulus checks approved by Congress in March were indeed for $1,200, but those are different from unemployment. Stimulus payments went to all adults under certain income limits, while unemployment benefits are paid only to those out of work \u2014 as Rittenhouse was, based on his furlough description.\u00a0\nRittenhouse told the Post he lived with his mother, a circumstance that would typically mean she claims him as a dependent on her taxes. That would make him ineligible for the $1,200 stimulus payment.\nInstead, it appears Rittenhouse was referencing several weeks of unemployment compensation approved through the CARES Act, said Washington Post Investigations Editor Jeff Leen. He said Rittenhouse\u2019s mother later told the paper that money for the gun came from \"special unemployment\" related to the pandemic.\nRittenhouse had noted he was off work, and the act signed into law March 27 provided an extra $600 per week in unemployment through the end of July.\nRittenhouse\u2019s attorneys did not return a phone call or email seeking clarification.\nOur ruling\nAn Instagram post says \"Kyle Rittenhouse used his COVID-19 stimulus check to purchase the AR-15 he used in the fatal Kenosha shooting.\"\nWe don\u2019t have bank records or documents to concretely prove this, leaving us to take Rittenhouse at his word on the source of the funds.\u00a0\nRittenhouse did tell the Post he used $1,200 in coronavirus funds, but\u00a0he appears to confuse stimulus and unemployment payments.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s more likely Rittenhouse was referring to unemployment than the stimulus program itself, based on his life circumstances and description from him and his mother. That is indeed a \"COVID-19 stimulus,\" but not the one people would think of based on this post\u2019s description.\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18575"}
