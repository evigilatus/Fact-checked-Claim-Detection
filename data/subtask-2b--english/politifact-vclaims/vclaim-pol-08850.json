Really?", "text": "Indulge us this fantasy: Beckoned by summer\u2019s end, you escape work early and head for the sandy shores of your favorite Florida beach. It\u2019s fishing time!\nAs you stand near gentle waves, fishing rod in hand, an authority figure approaches with a buzzkill of a question: Where\u2019s your license, pal?\nMy what?\nYep, there\u2019s really a requirement for a saltwater shoreline fishing license under state law. We were as surprised to hear about it as Gov. Rick Scott during his recent \"listening tour\" for tax and fee cuts around the state.\n\"You have to get a license to fish on our beaches. I didn't know that,\" Scott told health care workers in Tampa on Sept. 18. \"We're going to get rid of that.\"\nGood news for amateur anglers: It\u2019s free to state residents (not counting convenience fees for ordering by phone or Internet). So repealing it is a freebie for Scott\u2019s promise to cut $500 million in taxes and fees.\nFlorida used to have no such requirement, but the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission requested it during the 2009 legislative session. Otherwise, a federal registration requirement carrying a $15-$25 fee would have gone into effect in 2011, according to a Q&A about the license.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoreen Costa\n\n\nstated on August 10, 2011 in a radio interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The studies have shown us that [drug testing for welfare recipients] will be saving us money\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy C. Eugene Emery Jr. \u2022 August 26, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it\u2019s important for people to realize that fish and wildlife resources belong to everyone,\" said FWC spokesman Gary Morse. \"One of the most important reasons that we have to have the license is for the ability to manage our fisheries. We need to know how much pressure is being put on the fishery for both commercial (purposes) and recreation.\"\nWith more information in hand, officials can make better decisions about fishing rules and regulations, he said.\nPopped for fishing on the beach without a license? Officials generally issue a warning -- the first time, Morse said. After that there could be fines.\nThe shoreline license only covers people fishing from land or a structure attached to land, not someone fishing\u00a0from a boat or a shore reached by boat. Wading into the water is okay, as long as you can stand on the bottom.\nYou don\u2019t have to have the free version if you already possess a saltwater fishing license (annual license starts at $17) or if you are under age 16 or a senior resident. There\u2019s an exemption from the shoreline license for people approved for food stamps, temporary cash assistance or Medicaid by the Department of Children and Families.\nActually, there are a lot of regulations and exemptions with all fishing licenses, and you can read more about them from FWC here. (If you want to avoid registration altogether, the state offers two upcoming license-free saltwater fishing days on Oct. 12 and Nov. 30.)\nScott may have said he wants to get rid of the requirement, but his press office said there are no plans to formally propose a repeal.\nAs for his statement about needing a license to fish on the beach, we found nothing fishy about it.
