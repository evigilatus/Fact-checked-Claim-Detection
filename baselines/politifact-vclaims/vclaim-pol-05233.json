Pat McCrory, unveiled his education plan March 8.\nEducation is a large chunk of the state budget, and it\u2019s a hot topic for both Republicans and Democrats. Cooper\u2019s plan lays out eight basic goals, and it slams McCrory and the Republican-led General Assembly for cutting taxes rather than putting more money into public schools.\nThe Great Recession began in December 2007 and forced states to slash budgets. North Carolina cut many areas, including K-12 education, and Cooper says funding still hasn\u2019t bounced back.\n\"North Carolina spends $855 less per student than it did before the Great Recession, and we have one of the lowest per pupil spending levels in the nation,\" Cooper\u2019s plan reads.\nThe question of whether higher per-pupil spending generates better academic results is another debate entirely. For now, we\u2019ll just focus on the numbers.\nSo does Cooper ace this math problem? Or will his former teachers want to dock him points for his statement?\nIt turns out that like many claims about education funding, it\u2019s complicated \u2013 especially the part about \"$855 less.\"\nOne of the country\u2019s lowest spending levels\nFirst, the easy part. Does North Carolina spend less per student than most states?\nThe National Education Association, a teacher\u2019s union that has been tracking all sorts of public school funding data for 70 years, says yes.\nIt reported North Carolina\u2019s per-pupil spending was $8,615 in 2007 (compared with a national average of $9,663). It was $8,867 in 2008 (national average $10,259), and $8,632 in 2014 (national average $11,355).\nThose numbers show North Carolina has been falling further behind the national average. NEA\u2019s 2015-16 report isn\u2019t out yet, but in 2014-15 it ranked North Carolina 46th out of 51, counting all the states and Washington, D.C., in per-pupil expenditure. That backs up Cooper\u2019s claim that \"we have one of the lowest per pupil spending levels in the nation.\"\nA U.S. Census Bureau report on 2013 per-pupil funding also ranks North Carolina as one of the lowest states. However, the Census hasn\u2019t released more up-to-date numbers.\nFace value versus inflation\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, those NEA numbers show North Carolina\u2019s per-pupil spending is actually higher than it was in 2007 and only slightly lower than in 2008, certainly not $855 lower. So what about Cooper\u2019s claim that North Carolina spends $855 less per student than before the recession?\nFirst let\u2019s define two terms: real dollars and nominal dollars. Nominal value refers to a number\u2019s face value. Real value is the inflation-adjusted figure.\nCooper appears at first glance to reference nominal dollars. In that case, he would be wrong.\nBut even though he didn\u2019t mention inflation, the numbers Cooper cited did account for it. And that\u2019s important, because inflation has risen by about 10 percent since the recession began, according to the federal government\u2019s CPI Inflation Calculator.\nFor example, if you made $40,000 in 2008 and didn\u2019t make at least $44,034.14 in 2015, you\u2019re facing the same type of hurt that Cooper is talking about here \u2013 not a cut per se, but a loss of purchasing power nonetheless.\nCooper\u2019s campaign pointed us to the source of his claim, a report from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that did find an inflation-adjusted drop of $855 per student since the recession.\nBut that report was from October 2014 \u2013 about 17 months ago. There\u2019s an updated report from this January which shows that in the past year, North Carolina has been moving closer to pre-recession numbers.\nIn fact, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said North Carolina\u2019s increase from 2014 to 2015 was the fifth-largest in the country in terms of percent change.\nOther numbers and sources\nUnsatisfied with the report from 2014, we looked at some more recent numbers. It turns out that depending on whether you count total funding or just state funding, Cooper\u2019s claim \u2013 though based on outdated numbers \u2013 is still right in the middle of the range.\nUsing state numbers from the Department of Public Instruction\u00a0and combined state, federal and local numbers from the National Education Association, we adjusted the 2008 numbers for inflation. Then we compared it with the most recent available data, which was 2015 for the state and 2014 for all sources combined.\nThe combined per-pupil spending is down $1,118. State spending by itself is down $481. So Cooper\u2019s claim of \"$855 less\" is right in the middle of that range.\nOur ruling\nCooper is right that North Carolina is one of the states that spends the least per student.\nWhen citing the actual amount he used a report that, while not inaccurate, was outdated. And more context and transparency would\u2019ve been helpful. But Cooper is still right in the general sense that North Carolina\u2019s public schools have less purchasing power than before the recession, and that almost every other state spends more money on education per student than North Carolina.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05233"}
