0001	LAUER	Good evening, everyone, from the Carrier Intrepid here in New York City.
0002	LAUER	In just a couple of short months, Americans are going to vote in a critical election.
0003	LAUER	Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are vying not only to become president of the United States, but one of them will become the leader of the most potent military force the world has ever seen.
0004	LAUER	Im standing in a place where I can actually see the site of the World Trade Center.
0005	LAUER	Fifteen years ago this week, the worst terror attack on American soil changed the world and launched this nation into years of war.
0006	LAUER	Tonights forum is a great opportunity for these nominees to talk about national security and the complex global issues that face our nation.
0007	LAUER	And theyll get to tell you why they are ready for the role of commanderinchief.
0008	SYSTEM	(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
0009	KENNEDY	It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States.
0010	JOHNSON	I have today ordered to Vietnam the Air Mobile Division.
0011	REAGAN	Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against the headquarters and military assets that support Moammar Gadhafi.
0012	GEORGE H.W. BUSH	No president can easily commit our sons and daughters to war.
0013	BILL CLINTON	We can and will succeed because our mission is clear and our troops are strong.
0014	GEORGE W. BUSH	I can hear you.
0015	GEORGE W. BUSH	The rest of the world hears you.
0016	GEORGE W. BUSH	And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.
0017	OBAMA	I can report to the American people the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaida.
0018	SYSTEM	(END VIDEO CLIP)
0019	ANNOUNCER	The CommanderinChief Forum, live from the Carrier Intrepid in New York.
0020	ANNOUNCER	Here now is Matt Lauer.
0021	LAUER	Good evening, everyone.
0022	LAUER	The decisions a commanderin chief makes can have a profound and lasting impact on all Americans, but none more so than the brave men and women who serve, fight, and die for our country.
0023	LAUER	What makes tonights forum unique, some of the questions will be asked by U.S. military veterans who are in our audience.
0024	LAUER	The presidential nominees will appear backtoback tonight.
0025	LAUER	After a coin toss yesterday won by Mr. Trump, he chose to go second.
0026	LAUER	So that means we begin tonight with the Democratic nominee for president.
0027	LAUER	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Hillary Clinton.
0028	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0029	CLINTON	Matt, how are you?
0030	CLINTON	Good to see you.
0031	CLINTON	Thank you.
0032	CLINTON	Hi.
0033	CLINTON	How are you?
0034	LAUER	Good to have you.
0035	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0036	LAUER	Nice to see you.
0037	LAUER	Good evening.
0038	CLINTON	Thank you very much.
0039	CLINTON	Im happy youre doing this.
0040	LAUER	Let me  thank you very much, Im happy to be here.
0041	LAUER	Let me ask you something ahead of time that Ill ask Mr. Trump in a half an hour.
0042	LAUER	To the best of your ability tonight, can we talk about your qualities and your qualifications to be commanderinchief and not use this as an opportunity to attack Mr. Trump, all right?
0043	LAUER	And Ill ask him the exact same thing.
0044	CLINTON	I think thats an exactly right way to proceed.
0045	LAUER	OK.
0046	CLINTON	This is a very important decision for our country.
0047	CLINTON	And each of us should be presenting our experience, our expertise, and our plans to protect and defend the United States and our allies around the world.
0048	LAUER	What is the most important characteristic that a commanderinchief can possess?
0049	CLINTON	Steadiness.
0050	CLINTON	An absolute rock steadiness, and mixed with strength to be able to make the hard decisions.
0051	CLINTON	Because Ive had the unique experience of watching and working with several presidents.
0052	CLINTON	And these are not easy decisions.
0053	CLINTON	If they were, they wouldnt get to the president in the first place.
0054	CLINTON	And when youre sitting in the Situation Room, as I have on numerous occasions, particularly with respect to determining whether to recommend the raid against bin Laden, what you want in a president, a commanderinchief, is someone who listens, who evaluates what is being told to him or her, who is able to sort out the very difficult options being presented
0055	LAUER	Youre talking about judgment.
0056	CLINTON	 and then makes the decision.
0057	CLINTON	Makes the decision, thats right.
0058	LAUER	So judgment is a key.
0059	CLINTON	Temperament and judgment, yes.
0060	LAUER	The word judgment has been used a lot around you, Secretary Clinton, over the last yearandahalf, and in particular concerning your use of your personal email and server to communicate while you were secretary of state.
0061	LAUER	Youve said its a mistake.
0062	CLINTON	Mmhmm.
0063	LAUER	You said you made not the best choice.
0064	LAUER	You were communicating on highly sensitive topics.
0065	LAUER	Why wasnt it more than a mistake?
0066	LAUER	Why wasnt it disqualifying, if you want to be commanderin chief?
0067	CLINTON	Well, Matt, first of all, as I have said repeatedly, it was a mistake to have a personal account.
0068	CLINTON	I would certainly not do it again.
0069	CLINTON	I make no excuses for it.
0070	CLINTON	It was something that should not have been done.
0071	CLINTON	But the real question is the handling of classified material, which is I think what the implication of your question was.
0072	CLINTON	And for all the viewers watching you tonight, I have a lot of experience dealing with classified material, starting when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee going into the four years as secretary of state.
0073	CLINTON	Classified material has a header which says top secret, secret, confidential. Nothing  and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice  none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header.
0074	LAUER	Were some of the emails sent or received by you referring to our drone program, our covert drone program?
0075	CLINTON	Yes, because  of course, there were no discussions of any of the covert actions in process being determined about whether or not to go forward.
0076	CLINTON	But every part of our government had to deal with questions, and the secretary of states office was first and foremost.
0077	CLINTON	So there are ways of talking about the drone program
0078	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0079	LAUER	And you said you thought your communications on that were fairly routine?
0080	CLINTON	Well, let me say, the FBI just released their report about their investigation, they discussed drone matters in the unclassified section of their report.
0081	LAUER	But Director Comey also said this after reviewing all the information.
0082	LAUER	He said there is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clintons position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.
0083	CLINTON	Well, Matt, I just respectfully point to the hundreds of experienced foreign policy experts, diplomats, defense officials who were communicating information on the unclassified system because it was necessary to answer questions and to be able publicly to go as far as we could, which was not acknowledging the program.
0084	CLINTON	But I would be in Pakistan, as I was on several occasions.
0085	CLINTON	There might very well have been a strike.
0086	CLINTON	I would be asked in a public setting, in an interview, about it.
0087	CLINTON	It was known to have happened.
0088	CLINTON	We had to have an answer that did not move into classified area.
0089	CLINTON	And I think we handled that appropriately.
0090	LAUER	You mentioned youre in Pakistan.
0091	LAUER	Some of the emails you sent and received happened while you were overseas.
0092	LAUER	And Director Comey also said that while they have no proof, we assessed that it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clintons personal email accounts.
0093	CLINTON	Matt, there is no evidence.
0094	CLINTON	Of course anything is possible.
0095	CLINTON	But what is factual is the State Department system was hacked.
0096	CLINTON	Most of the government systems are way behind the curve.
0097	CLINTON	Weve had hacking repeatedly, even in the White House.
0098	CLINTON	There is no evidence my system was hacked.
0099	LAUER	Let us bring in Hallie Jackson of NBC News whos been covering this campaign.
0100	LAUER	Shes getting questions from our veterans.
0101	LAUER	Hallie, who are you with?
0102	JACKSON	Hi, Matt.
0103	JACKSON	Im with Lieutenant Jon Lester (ph), who will stand with me here.
0104	JACKSON	He began his military career by enlisting in the Air Force and then switched over to the Navy before he retired, where he flew P3 Orions in Desert Storm and in Desert Shield.
0105	JACKSON	Hes a Republican, and he has this question for you, Secretary Clinton.
0106	CLINTON	Thank you.
0107	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, thank you very much for coming tonight.
0108	QUESTION	As a naval flight officer, I held a top secret sensitive compartmentalized information clearance.
0109	QUESTION	And that provided me access to materials and information highly sensitive to our warfighting capabilities.
0110	QUESTION	Had I communicated this information not following prescribed protocols, I would have been prosecuted and imprisoned.
0111	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, how can you expect those such as myself who were and are entrusted with Americas most sensitive information to have any confidence in your leadership as president when you clearly corrupted our national security?
0112	CLINTON	Well, I appreciate your concern and also your experience.
0113	CLINTON	But let me try to make the distinctions that I think are important for me to answer your question.
0114	CLINTON	First, as I said to Matt, you know and I know classified material is designated.
0115	CLINTON	It is marked.
0116	CLINTON	There is a header so that there is no dispute at all that what is being communicated to or from someone who has that access is marked classified.
0117	CLINTON	And what we have here is the use of an unclassified system by hundreds of people in our government to send information that was not marked, there were no headers, there was no statement, top secret, secret, or confidential.
0118	CLINTON	I communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system.
0119	CLINTON	I took it very seriously.
0120	CLINTON	When I traveled, I went into one of those little tents that Im sure youve seen around the world because we didnt want there to be any potential for someone to have embedded a camera to try to see whatever it is that I was seeing that was designated, marked, and headed as classified.
0121	LAUER	Let us
0122	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0123	CLINTON	So I did exactly what I should have done and I take it very seriously, always have, always will.
0124	LAUER	Sir, thank you.
0125	LAUER	Thank you very much for your question.
0126	LAUER	Secretary Clinton, lets talk about your vote in favor of the war in Iraq.
0127	LAUER	Youve since said it was a mistake.
0128	CLINTON	Mmhmm.
0129	LAUER	Obviously, it was not something you said you would do again.
0130	LAUER	I asked before for people to raise their hand if you served in Iraq.
0131	LAUER	Can you do it again?
0132	LAUER	How do you think these people feel when the person running to be their commanderinchief says her vote to go to war in Iraq was a mistake?
0133	CLINTON	Look, I think that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake.
0134	CLINTON	And I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my perspective, my mistake.
0135	CLINTON	I also believe that it is imperative that we learn from the mistakes, like after action reports are supposed to do, and so we must learn what led us down that path so that it never happens again.
0136	CLINTON	I think Im in the best possible position to be able to understand that and prevent it.
0137	CLINTON	But I will say this.
0138	CLINTON	Im asking to be judged on the totality of my record, what Ive done for our veterans as first lady, as senator, what Ive done for Gold Star Families, working with them to increase the death benefit from $12,000 to $100,000, working with Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, to get TRICARE for our National Guard members who didnt have health care unless they were deployed, working to provide more support for the care of our veterans, those who are wounded, working with the Fisher family, now into the third generation of caring for our fallen heroes, working with John McCain to raise money for Brooke Medical Centers Intrepid Center to take care of those who are coming back with profound injuries, working on TBI and PTSD and so much more, working with groups to end veteran suicide, like TAPS.
0139	CLINTON	So, yes
0140	LAUER	Im going to get on to that subject in a second.
0141	CLINTON	There was  there was a mistake.
0142	CLINTON	Now, my opponent was for the war in Iraq.
0143	CLINTON	He says he wasnt.
0144	CLINTON	You can go back and look at the record.
0145	CLINTON	He supported it.
0146	CLINTON	He told Howard Stern he supported it.
0147	CLINTON	So he supported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening, and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.
0148	CLINTON	I have taken responsibility for my decision.
0149	LAUER	Let me go to another
0150	CLINTON	He refuses to take responsibility for his support.
0151	CLINTON	That is a judgment issue.
0152	LAUER	Let me go to another question.
0153	LAUER	Hallie?
0154	JACKSON	(OFFMIKE) who served in the Air Force for nearly a decade, where she was an intelligence specialist, specializing in countering violent extremism.
0155	JACKSON	Like you, Secretary Clinton, shes a Democrat and she has this question for you.
0156	QUESTION	Thank you.
0157	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, to your point, you have had an extensive record with military intervention.
0158	QUESTION	How do you respond to progressives like myself who worry and have concerns that your hawkish foreign policy will continue?
0159	QUESTION	And what is your plan to end wasteful war campaigns in which our peers, servicewomen and men, continue to be killed and wounded?
0160	CLINTON	Well, I assume youre talking about Iraq, because of my vote, and you probably are talking about Libya, because of the role that I played in the administrations decision about whether to take on Gadhafi.
0161	CLINTON	But before I get to that, let me say very clearly I view force as a last resort, not a first choice.
0162	CLINTON	I will do everything in my power to make sure that our men and women in the military are fully prepared for any challenge that they may have to face on our behalf.
0163	CLINTON	But I will also be as careful as I can in making the most significant decisions any president and commanderinchief can make about sending our men and women into harms way.
0164	CLINTON	With respect to Libya, again, theres no difference between my opponent and myself.
0165	CLINTON	Hes on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya, when Gadhafi was threatening to massacre his population.
0166	CLINTON	I put together a coalition that included NATO, included the Arab League, and we were able to save lives.
0167	CLINTON	We did not lose a single American in that action.
0168	CLINTON	And I think taking that action was the right decision.
0169	CLINTON	Not taking it, and permitting there to be an ongoing civil war in Libya, would have been as dangerous and threatening as what we are now seeing in Syria.
0170	LAUER	Im going to jump in.
0171	LAUER	Thank you very much for your question.
0172	LAUER	Let me ask you about the Iran nuclear deal.
0173	LAUER	It was signed under Secretary Kerry it was begun under you.
0174	LAUER	You started those talks.
0175	CLINTON	Right, I did.
0176	LAUER	You have said you expect the Iranians to cheat, you think theyll buy time, and perhaps stay along their course to building a nuclear weapon.
0177	LAUER	If they cheat, Secretary Clinton, will you have any course of action other than a military course of action?
0178	LAUER	Would you enter into negotiations with again (ph)?
0179	LAUER	Would you go back to economic sanctions knowing they cheated and are then closer to a nuclear weapon?
0180	CLINTON	Matt, look, let me put this in context, because this is one of the most important strategic questions we face.
0181	CLINTON	When I became secretary of state, the Iranians were on a fast track to acquiring the material necessary to get a nuclear weapon.
0182	CLINTON	That had happened the prior eight years.
0183	CLINTON	They mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, they built covert facilities, they stocked them with centrifuges, and they were moving forward.
0184	CLINTON	What was our decision?
0185	CLINTON	Our decision was to try to put together an international coalition that included Russia and China to exert the kind of pressure through sanctions that the United States alone could not do.
0186	LAUER	Right, but youve said that you think theyre going to cheat
0187	CLINTON	Now, wait, let me  look, this is an important issue.
0188	CLINTON	I know were on TV and we dont have a lot of time.
0189	LAUER	I want to get to a lot of questions.
0190	CLINTON	I will talk quickly.
0191	CLINTON	But I want people to understand this.
0192	CLINTON	So, yes, I put together the coalition.
0193	CLINTON	We imposed the sanctions.
0194	CLINTON	We got them to the negotiating table.
0195	CLINTON	And after I left, we got the agreement.
0196	CLINTON	That agreement put a lid on their nuclear weapons program and imposed intrusive inspections.
0197	CLINTON	I have said we are going to enforce it to the letter.
0198	LAUER	Do you think theyre playing us?
0199	CLINTON	On the nuclear issue, no.
0200	CLINTON	I think we have enough insight into what theyre doing to be able to say we have to distrust but verify.
0201	CLINTON	What I am focused on is all the other malicious activities of the Iranians  ballistic missiles, support for terrorists, being involved in Syria, Yemen, and other places, supporting Hezbollah, Hamas.
0202	CLINTON	But heres the difference, Matt.
0203	CLINTON	I would rather as president be dealing with Iran on all of those issues without having to worry as much about their racing for a nuclear weapon.
0204	CLINTON	So we have made the world safer we just have to make sure its enforced.
0205	LAUER	Hallie?
0206	JACKSON	Im with Kenneth Anderson (ph).
0207	JACKSON	Hes one of our undecided voters here.
0208	JACKSON	He considers himself an independent.
0209	JACKSON	He earned the rank of sergeant in the Marine Corps, where he was an Arabic translator during three tours in Iraq.
0210	JACKSON	Kenneth, you have a question for Secretary Clinton.
0211	QUESTION	Yes, Secretary Clinton, last October you said that surveys of veterans show that theyre overall satisfied with their treatment and that the problems with the V.A.
0212	QUESTION	arent as widespread as theyre made out to be.
0213	QUESTION	So do you think the problems with the V.A.
0214	QUESTION	have been made to seem worse than they really are?
0215	CLINTON	Look, I was outraged by the stories that came out about the V.A.
0216	CLINTON	And I have been very clear about the necessity for doing whatever is required to move the V.A.
0217	CLINTON	into the 21st century, to provide the kind of treatment options that our veterans today desperately need and deserve.
0218	CLINTON	And thats what I will do as president.
0219	CLINTON	But I will not let the V.A.
0220	CLINTON	be privatized.
0221	CLINTON	And I do think there is an agenda out there, supported by my opponent, to do just that.
0222	CLINTON	I think that would be very disastrous for our military veterans.
0223	CLINTON	So Im going to do everything I can  Im going to have a meeting every week in the Oval Office.
0224	CLINTON	Were going to bring the V.A.
0225	CLINTON	people, were going to bring the DOD people, because weve got to have a better fit between getting mustered out and getting into the V.A.
0226	CLINTON	system, sometimes  and you probably know this, Sergeant  Ive met so many vets who get mustered out, who leave the service, they cant find their records from DOD, and those records never make it to the V.A.
0227	CLINTON	They feel like theyre living in a funhouse.
0228	CLINTON	They have to go over the same things over and over.
0229	CLINTON	Were living in a technological world.
0230	CLINTON	You cannot tell me we cant do a better job getting that information.
0231	CLINTON	And so Im going to focus on this.
0232	CLINTON	Im going to work with everybody.
0233	CLINTON	Im going to make them work together.
0234	LAUER	And Im going to jump in.
0235	CLINTON	And were going to fix the problems in the V.A.
0236	LAUER	Sergeant, thank you very much for your question.
0237	LAUER	Lets talk about veterans and suicide.
0238	CLINTON	Yes, lets, please.
0239	LAUER	Its an alarming, alarming story.
0240	LAUER	The population of veterans has a rate of suicide far above the general population.
0241	CLINTON	Twenty  twenty suicides a day.
0242	LAUER	What are you going to do to stop it?
0243	CLINTON	Well, this month is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month.
0244	CLINTON	And Ive spent a lot of time with family members, survivors, whove lost a loved one after he or she came home, sometimes suffering from PTSD or TBI or sexual assault, being handed bags of opioids, not being given an appropriate treatment to help that particular person, which is something, to go back to the sergeants question, we have to change.
0245	CLINTON	So I rolled out my mental health agenda last week, and I have a whole section devoted to veterans mental health.
0246	CLINTON	And weve got to remove the stigma.
0247	CLINTON	Weve got to help people currently serving not to feel that if they report their sense of unease, their depression, that somehow its going to be a mark against them.
0248	CLINTON	We have to do more about addiction, not only drugs, but also alcohol.
0249	CLINTON	So I have put forth a really robust agenda, working with a lot of the VSOs and other groups, like TAPS, who have been thinking about this and trying to figure out what were going to do to help our veterans reenter civilian life and live full, productive lives.
0250	LAUER	Hallie?
0251	JACKSON	Im with Ernie Young.
0252	JACKSON	Come on up here with me, a former Army captain, who led troops during tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan.
0253	JACKSON	Hes an independent voter.
0254	JACKSON	And you have a question for the secretary.
0255	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, as an Army veteran, a commanderin chiefs to empathize with servicemembers and their families is important to me.
0256	QUESTION	The ability to truly understand implications and consequences of your decisions, actions, or inactions.
0257	QUESTION	How will you determine when and where to deploy troops directly into harms way, especially to combat ISIS?
0258	LAUER	As briefly as you can.
0259	CLINTON	We have to defeat ISIS.
0260	CLINTON	That is my highest counterterrorism goal.
0261	CLINTON	And weve got to do it with air power.
0262	CLINTON	Weve got to do it with much more support for the Arabs and the Kurds who will fight on the ground against ISIS.
0263	CLINTON	We have to squeeze them by continuing to support the Iraqi military.
0264	CLINTON	Theyve taken back Ramadi, Fallujah.
0265	CLINTON	Theyve got to hold them.
0266	CLINTON	Theyve got to now get into Mosul.
0267	CLINTON	Were going to work to make sure that they have the support  they have special forces, as you know, they have enablers, they have surveillance, intelligence, reconnaissance help.
0268	CLINTON	They are not going to get ground troops.
0269	CLINTON	We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again.
0270	CLINTON	And were not putting ground troops into Syria.
0271	CLINTON	Were going to defeat ISIS without committing American ground troops.
0272	CLINTON	So those are the kinds of decisions we have to make on a casebycase basis.
0273	CLINTON	And, remember, when I became secretary of state, we had 200,000 troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.
0274	CLINTON	And Im very grateful that we have brought home the vast majority of those.
0275	CLINTON	We have a residual force, as you know, in Afghanistan.
0276	CLINTON	We have built up several thousands of the folks that Ive talked about who are assisting in the fight against ISIS.
0277	CLINTON	But it is in our national security interest to defeat ISIS.
0278	CLINTON	And I intend to make that happen.
0279	LAUER	Thank you very much for your question.
0280	CLINTON	And as part of it, were going after Baghdadi, the leader, because it will help us focus our attention, just like going after bin Laden helped us focus our attention
0281	LAUER	Secretary
0282	CLINTON	 in the fight against Al Qaida in the Afghanistan Pakistan theater.
0283	LAUER	Secretary Clinton, I am fast running out of time.
0284	LAUER	I want to get to one of the concerns just about everybody in this country, and that is terror attacks on our soil.
0285	CLINTON	Right.
0286	LAUER	Either directed by ISIS or inspired by ISIS.
0287	LAUER	Would your message as the next president of the United States or potential next president be to Americans that we simply are living in the reality that those attacks will happen?
0288	LAUER	And can you guarantee people that after four years of a Clinton presidency, they will be safer on the streets of San Bernardino or Boston than they are today?
0289	CLINTON	Well, Matt, Im going to do everything in my power to make sure that thats the result.
0290	CLINTON	Im not going to, you know, promise something that I think most thinking Americans know is going to be a huge challenge, and heres why.
0291	CLINTON	Weve got to have an intelligence surge.
0292	CLINTON	Weve got to get a lot more cooperation out of Europe, out of the Middle East.
0293	CLINTON	We have to do a better job of not only collecting and analyzing the intelligence we do have, but distributing it much more quickly down the ladder to state and local law enforcement.
0294	CLINTON	We also have to do a better job combating ISIS online, where they recruit, where they radicalize.
0295	CLINTON	And I dont think were doing as much as we can.
0296	CLINTON	We need to work with Silicon Valley.
0297	CLINTON	We need to work with our experts in our government.
0298	CLINTON	We have got to disrupt, we have got to take them on in the arena of ideas that, unfortunately, pollute and capture the minds of vulnerable people.
0299	CLINTON	So we need to wage this war against ISIS from the air, on the ground, and online, in cyberspace.
0300	CLINTON	And here at home, for goodnesss sakes, we have to finally pass a law prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in the United States of America.
0301	CLINTON	So weve got work to do.
0302	CLINTON	I know we can do that work.
0303	CLINTON	Im meeting with a group of terror experts, counterterrorism experts.
0304	CLINTON	But I want to just say one additional thing.
0305	LAUER	Ive got 30 seconds left.
0306	CLINTON	Matt Olsen, the former director of the National Center on Counterterrorism, has a great article out today saying the last thing we need to do is to play into the hands of ISIS.
0307	CLINTON	Going after American Muslims, defaming a Gold Star family, the family of Captain Khan, making it more difficult for us to have a coalition with Muslim majority nations
0308	LAUER	And we tried to have an agreement
0309	CLINTON	 that is not going to help us to succeed in defeating ISIS and protecting our American homeland.
0310	LAUER	Secretary Hillary Clinton, thank you very much.
0311	CLINTON	Thank you.
0312	CLINTON	Thank you all.
0313	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0314	CLINTON	Thank you so much.
0315	CLINTON	Too short a time.
0316	LAUER	I know.
0317	LAUER	Were going to take a break.
0318	LAUER	Were going to have much more with her competitor, Donald Trump, right after this.
0319	LAUER	Youre watching NBC News special, the CommanderinChief Forum.
0320	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0321	LAUER	We welcome you back now to this NBC News special, the CommanderinChief Forum.
0322	LAUER	Tonight were speaking with the two major party presidential nominees to find out where they stand on the critical issues.
0323	LAUER	Now, please welcome the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump.
0324	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0325	LAUER	Good to see you.
0326	TRUMP	Thank you, Matt.
0327	LAUER	Thank you very much for joining us.
0328	TRUMP	Thank you.
0329	LAUER	You heard me say to Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and it didnt completely work out toward the end there, as much as possible Id like you to tell our veterans and our people at home why you are prepared for the role of commanderinchief and try to keep the attacks to a minimum.
0330	LAUER	Weve had a year of that and maybe 60 more days of it.
0331	TRUMP	To a minimum, absolutely.
0332	LAUER	OK, perfect.
0333	LAUER	To a minimum.
0334	LAUER	I guess thats a question of definition.
0335	TRUMP	I guess.
0336	LAUER	Any time you interview a president, sitting or past president, they will tell you that the most daunting
0337	TRUMP	Was I supposed to answer this question?
0338	LAUER	No, no, no, I mean just keep the attacks to a minimum.
0339	LAUER	Any time you talk to a president, theyll tell you the most daunting part of the job is the role of commanderinchief.
0340	TRUMP	Right.
0341	LAUER	What have you experienced in your personal life or your professional life that you believe prepares you to make the decisions that a commanderinchief has to make?
0342	TRUMP	Well, Ive built a great company.
0343	TRUMP	Ive been all over the world.
0344	TRUMP	Ive dealt with foreign countries.
0345	TRUMP	Ive done very well, as an example, tremendously well dealing with China and dealing with so many of the countries that are just ripping this country.
0346	TRUMP	They are just taking advantage of us like nobodys ever seen before.
0347	TRUMP	And Ive had great experience dealing on an international basis.
0348	TRUMP	I look today and I see Russian planes circling our planes.
0349	TRUMP	Theyre taunting us.
0350	TRUMP	I see in Iran, I see the boats taunting our ships, our destroyers, and I think
0351	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0352	LAUER	But what have you done in your life that prepares you to send men and women of the United States into harms way?
0353	TRUMP	Well, I think the main thing is I have great judgment.
0354	TRUMP	I have good judgment.
0355	TRUMP	I know whats going on.
0356	TRUMP	Ive called so many of the shots.
0357	TRUMP	And I happened to hear Hillary Clinton say that I was not against the war in Iraq.
0358	TRUMP	I was totally against the war in Iraq.
0359	TRUMP	From a  you can look at Esquire magazine from 04.
0360	TRUMP	You can look at before that.
0361	TRUMP	And I was against the war in Iraq because I said its going to totally destabilize the Middle East, which it has.
0362	TRUMP	It has absolutely been a disastrous war, and by the way, perhaps almost as bad was the way Barack Obama got out.
0363	TRUMP	That was a disaster.
0364	LAUER	People talk about you and commanderinchief, and not just Secretary Clinton, but some of your Republican opponents in the primary season, and they wonder about your temperament.
0365	LAUER	They say, does Donald Trump have the temperament to be commanderinchief?
0366	LAUER	You said something recently that I found interesting.
0367	LAUER	You admitted that sometimes in the heat of a debate or when youre talking about a lot of issues you say things that you later regret.
0368	LAUER	So can we afford that with a commanderinchief  to have a commanderinchief who says things that he later regrets?
0369	TRUMP	Well, when you say regret, yeah, sure, I regret.
0370	TRUMP	But in the meantime, I beat 16 people and here I am.
0371	TRUMP	So, you know, to a certain extent there is a regret.
0372	TRUMP	I would have liked to have done it in a nicer manner.
0373	TRUMP	But I had 16 very talented people that I had to go through.
0374	TRUMP	And that was a lot of people.
0375	LAUER	But when you say
0376	TRUMP	That was a record, Matt.
0377	TRUMP	That was a record in the history of Republican politics.
0378	TRUMP	I was able to get more votes than anybody ever has gotten in the history of Republican politics.
0379	LAUER	But when you say inflammatory things (CROSSTALK)
0380	LAUER	 in a presidential campaign, its different than saying them when youre commanderinchief.
0381	LAUER	If you say things you regret
0382	TRUMP	I agree with you.
0383	LAUER	 when youre commanderinchief, you can spark a conflict, you can destabilize a region, you can put American lives at risk.
0384	LAUER	Can we afford to take that risk with you?
0385	TRUMP	Well, I think absolutely.
0386	TRUMP	I think if you saw what happened in Mexico the other day, where I went there, I had great relationships, everything else.
0387	TRUMP	I let them know where the United States stands.
0388	TRUMP	I mean, weve been badly hurt by Mexico, both on the border and with taking all of our jobs or a big percentage of our jobs.
0389	TRUMP	And if you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today where the people that arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government.
0390	TRUMP	Thats how well we did.
0391	LAUER	Back in August
0392	TRUMP	And thats how well were going to have to do, Matt.
0393	LAUER	Back in August, when you admitted that you regret some of the things you said, you also said this.
0394	LAUER	I can promise you this I will always tell you the truth.
0395	TRUMP	Its true.
0396	LAUER	So let me read some of the things youve said.
0397	LAUER	I know more about ISIS than the generals do.
0398	LAUER	Believe me. Was that the truth?
0399	TRUMP	Well, the generals under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have not been successful.
0400	TRUMP	ISIS
0401	LAUER	Do you know more about ISIS than they do?
0402	TRUMP	I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the generals have been reduced to rubble.
0403	TRUMP	They have been reduced to a point where its embarrassing for our country.
0404	TRUMP	You have a force of 30,000 or so people.
0405	TRUMP	Nobody really knows.
0406	TRUMP	But probably 30,000 people.
0407	TRUMP	And I can just see the great  as an example General George Patton spinning in his grave as ISIS we cant beat.
0408	TRUMP	We had the greatest
0409	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0410	LAUER	Yeah, youve said if we had MacArthur today or if we had Patton today, we would not have ISIS, that the rise of these military commanders that we have today, they come up the chain of command, and by the time they get to the top, theyre too politically correct.
0411	LAUER	And we know thats not a compliment coming from you.
0412	LAUER	Have you lost faith in the military commanders?
0413	TRUMP	I have great faith in the military.
0414	TRUMP	I have great faith in certain of the commanders, certainly.
0415	TRUMP	But I have no faith in Hillary Clinton or the leadership.
0416	TRUMP	You look at whats happened.
0417	TRUMP	And, you know, when she comes in and starts saying, oh, I would have done this, I would have  shes been there for 30 years.
0418	TRUMP	I mean, we need change, Matt.
0419	TRUMP	We have to have it, and we have to have it fast.
0420	LAUER	Lets go to Hallie Jackson in our crowd.
0421	LAUER	Hallie?
0422	JACKSON	Im with Phillip Clay (ph), who was a public affairs officer in the Marine Corps.
0423	JACKSON	He spent a year in Anbar province in Iraq.
0424	JACKSON	He left the military with the rank of captain, service that inspired him to write a book.
0425	JACKSON	Hes a Democrat, and he has this question for you, Mr. Trump.
0426	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, over the past 15 years, a lot of U.S. troops have bled and died securing towns and provinces from Iraq to Afghanistan, only to have insurgent groups like ISIS spring back the moment we leave.
0427	QUESTION	Now, youve claimed to have a secret plan to defeat ISIS.
0428	QUESTION	But youre hardly the first politician to promise a quick victory and a speedy homecoming.
0429	QUESTION	So assuming we do defeat ISIS, what next?
0430	QUESTION	What is your plan for the region to ensure that a group like them doesnt just come back?
0431	TRUMP	Sure.
0432	TRUMP	I mean, part of the problem that weve had is we go in, we defeat somebody, and then we dont know what were doing after that.
0433	TRUMP	We lose it, like as an example, you look at Iraq, what happened, how badly that was handled.
0434	TRUMP	And then when President Obama took over, likewise, it was a disaster.
0435	TRUMP	It was actually somewhat stable.
0436	TRUMP	I dont think could ever be very stable to where we should have never gone into in the first place.
0437	TRUMP	But he came in.
0438	TRUMP	He said when we go out  and he took everybody out.
0439	TRUMP	And really, ISIS was formed.
0440	TRUMP	This was a terrible decision.
0441	TRUMP	And frankly, we never even got a shot.
0442	TRUMP	And if you really look at the aftermath of Iraq, Iran is going to be taking over Iraq.
0443	TRUMP	Theyve been doing it.
0444	TRUMP	And its not a pretty picture.
0445	TRUMP	The  and I think you know  because youve been watching me I think for a long time  Ive always said, shouldnt be there, but if were going to get out, take the oil.
0446	TRUMP	If we would have taken the oil, you wouldnt have ISIS, because ISIS formed with the power and the wealth of that oil.
0447	LAUER	How were we going to take the oil?
0448	LAUER	How were we going to do that?
0449	TRUMP	Just we would leave a certain group behind and you would take various sections where they have the oil.
0450	TRUMP	They have  people dont know this about Iraq, but they have among the largest oil reserves in the world, in the entire world.
0451	TRUMP	And were the only ones, we go in, we spend $3 trillion, we lose thousands and thousands of lives, and then, Matt, what happens is, we get nothing.
0452	TRUMP	You know, it used to be to the victor belong the spoils.
0453	TRUMP	Now, there was no victor there, believe me.
0454	TRUMP	There was no victor.
0455	TRUMP	But I always said Take the oil.
0456	TRUMP	One of the benefits we would have had if we took the oil is ISIS would not have been able to take oil and use that oil
0457	LAUER	Let me stay on ISIS
0458	TRUMP	 to fuel themselves.
0459	LAUER	Let me stay on ISIS.
0460	LAUER	When weve met in the past and weve talked, you say things like Im going to bomb the expletive out of them very quickly.
0461	LAUER	And when people like me press you for details like that gentleman just said on what your plan is, you very often say, Im not going to give you the details because I want to be unpredictable.
0462	TRUMP	Absolutely.
0463	TRUMP	The word is unpredictable.
0464	LAUER	But yesterday, you actually told us a little bit about your plan in your speech.
0465	LAUER	You said this.
0466	LAUER	Quote, Were going to convene my top generals and they will have 30 days to submit a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS. So is the plan youve been hiding this whole time asking someone else for their plan?
0467	TRUMP	No.
0468	TRUMP	But when I do come up with a plan that I like and that perhaps agrees with mine, or maybe doesnt  I may love what the generals come back with.
0469	TRUMP	I will convene
0470	LAUER	But you have your own plan?
0471	TRUMP	I have a plan.
0472	TRUMP	But I want to be  I dont want to  look.
0473	TRUMP	I have a very substantial chance of winning.
0474	TRUMP	Make America great again.
0475	TRUMP	Were going to make America great again.
0476	TRUMP	I have a substantial chance of winning.
0477	TRUMP	If I win, I dont want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is.
0478	LAUER	But youre going to
0479	TRUMP	And let me tell you, if I like maybe a combination of my plan and the generals plan, or the generals plan, if I like their plan, Matt, Im not going to call you up and say, Matt, we have a great plan. This is what Obama does.
0480	TRUMP	Were going to leave Iraq on a certain day.
0481	LAUER	But youre going to convene a panel of generals, and youve already said you know more about ISIS than those generals do.
0482	TRUMP	Well, theyll probably be different generals, to be honest with you.
0483	TRUMP	I mean, Im looking at the generals, today, you probably saw, I have a piece of paper here, I could show it, 88 generals and admirals endorsed me today.
0484	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0485	LAUER	Its a numbers game.
0486	LAUER	Hillary Clinton claims more numbers.
0487	TRUMP	Well, its not really  its not  yeah, numbers.
0488	TRUMP	People that have been losing for us for a long period of time.
0489	TRUMP	I mean, the fact is, we have had the worst and you could even say the dumbest foreign policy.
0490	TRUMP	Our results are so bad.
0491	TRUMP	We would have been better off had we never, ever spent $2 in that part of the world.
0492	LAUER	You recently  you recently received two intelligence briefings.
0493	TRUMP	Yes, I did.
0494	LAUER	Did anything in that briefing, without going into specifics, shock or alarm you?
0495	TRUMP	Yes.
0496	TRUMP	Very much so.
0497	LAUER	Did you learn new things in that briefing?
0498	TRUMP	First of all, I have great respect for the people that gave us the briefings.
0499	TRUMP	We  they were terrific people.
0500	TRUMP	They were experts on Iraq and Iran and different parts of  and Russia.
0501	TRUMP	But, yes, there was one thing that shocked me.
0502	TRUMP	And it just seems to me that what they said President Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, who is another total disaster, did exactly the opposite.
0503	LAUER	Did you learn anything in that briefing  again, not going into specifics  that makes you reconsider some of the things you say you can accomplish, like defeating ISIS quickly?
0504	TRUMP	No, I didnt learn anything from that standpoint.
0505	TRUMP	What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts and our truly  when they call it intelligence, its there for a reason  what our experts said to do.
0506	LAUER	Hallie?
0507	TRUMP	And I was very, very surprised.
0508	TRUMP	In almost every instance.
0509	TRUMP	And I could tell you.
0510	TRUMP	I have pretty good with the body language.
0511	TRUMP	I could tell they were not happy.
0512	TRUMP	Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending.
0513	LAUER	Hallie?
0514	JACKSON	Im with former Army Captain Sue Fulton, who was a member of the First West Point class to include women.
0515	JACKSON	She served as a signal corps officer in Germany.
0516	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0517	JACKSON	Shes a Democrat, and she has this question for you, Mr. Trump.
0518	QUESTION	Mr. Trump.
0519	TRUMP	Hi, thank you very much.
0520	QUESTION	Thank you.
0521	QUESTION	Do you believe that an undocumented person who serves  who wants to serve in the U.S. armed forces deserves to stay in this country legally?
0522	TRUMP	I think that when you serve in the armed forces, thats a very special situation, and I could see myself working that out, absolutely.
0523	LAUER	So shes saying has already served in the armed forces or wants to serve, plans to serve?
0524	QUESTION	Plans to serve.
0525	QUESTION	Plans to serve in the armed forces.
0526	QUESTION	As you know, under DACA, we already have people who are undocumented who are serving.
0527	TRUMP	I think military is a very special thing.
0528	TRUMP	If they plan on serving, if they get in, I would absolutely hold those people  now, we have to be very careful.
0529	TRUMP	We have to vet very carefully.
0530	TRUMP	Everybody would agree with that.
0531	TRUMP	But the answer is, it would be a very special circumstance, yes.
0532	TRUMP	Thank you.
0533	LAUER	Thank you very much for your question.
0534	LAUER	Hallie, you have another one?
0535	JACKSON	I do.
0536	JACKSON	Alex Gronkowski (ph) was an Army staff sergeant assigned in special operations.
0537	JACKSON	He was stationed at Fort Bragg and was deployed to Afghanistan and other places across the Middle East.
0538	JACKSON	He has not decided who he will vote for yet in November.
0539	JACKSON	And you have a question for Mr. Trump.
0540	QUESTION	I do.
0541	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, as you know, tensions between the United States and Russia have been at the highest level since the Cold War.
0542	QUESTION	In your first 120 days of presidency, how would you deescalate the tensions?
0543	QUESTION	And more importantly, what steps would you take to bring Mr. Putin and the Russian government back to negotiating table?
0544	TRUMP	I think I would have a very good relationship with many foreign leaders.
0545	TRUMP	I think its very sad, when you look at Barack Obama, as an example, lands Air Force One in China, and they dont want to put out stairs to get off the plane.
0546	TRUMP	And he has to use the stairs that mechanics use to get up and down to fix the plane.
0547	TRUMP	They wouldnt give him stairs.
0548	TRUMP	I think its very sad, when he lands in Saudi Arabia, and he lands in Cuba, and there arent high officials to even greet him.
0549	TRUMP	This is the first time in the history  the storied history of Air Force One.
0550	TRUMP	I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin.
0551	TRUMP	And I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Russia.
0552	TRUMP	As I said, take a look today.
0553	TRUMP	Take a look at what happened with their fighter jets circling one of our aircraft in a very dangerous manner.
0554	TRUMP	Somebody said less than 10 feet away.
0555	TRUMP	This is hostility.
0556	TRUMP	And I saw, just two or three days ago, they looked like they were not exactly getting along, but I looked at President Obama and Putin staring at each other.
0557	TRUMP	These were not two people that were getting along.
0558	TRUMP	And, you know, the beautiful part of getting along, Russia wants to defeat ISIS as badly as we do.
0559	TRUMP	If we had a relationship with Russia, wouldnt it be wonderful if we could work on it together and knock the hell out of ISIS?
0560	TRUMP	Wouldnt that be a wonderful thing?
0561	LAUER	Let me ask you about some of the things youve said about Vladimir Putin.
0562	LAUER	You said, I will tell you, in terms of leadership, hes getting an A, our president is not doing so well.
0563	LAUER	And when referring to a comment that Putin made about you, I think he called you a brilliant leader, you said its always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his country and beyond.
0564	TRUMP	Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating, according to the different pollsters, who, by the way, some of them are based right here.
0565	TRUMP	Look, look
0566	LAUER	Hes also a guy who annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine, supports Assad in Syria, supports Iran, is trying to undermine our influence in key regions of the world, and according to our intelligence community, probably is the main suspect for the hacking of the DNC computers
0567	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0568	TRUMP	Well, nobody knows that for a fact.
0569	TRUMP	But do you want me to start naming some of the things that President Obama does at the same time?
0570	LAUER	But do you want to be complimented by that former KGB officer?
0571	TRUMP	Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, Ill take the compliment, OK?
0572	TRUMP	The fact is, look, its not going to get him anywhere.
0573	TRUMP	Im a negotiator.
0574	TRUMP	Were going to take back our country.
0575	TRUMP	You look at whats happening to our country, you look at the depleted military.
0576	TRUMP	You look at the fact that weve lost our jobs.
0577	TRUMP	Were losing our jobs like were a bunch of babies.
0578	TRUMP	Were going to take back our country, Matt.
0579	TRUMP	The fact that he calls me brilliant or whatever he calls me is going to have zero impact.
0580	LAUER	But the fact that you say you can get along with him, do you think the day
0581	TRUMP	I think Id be able to get along with him.
0582	LAUER	Do you think the day that you become president of the United States, hes going to change his mind on some of these key issues?
0583	TRUMP	Possibly.
0584	TRUMP	Its possible.
0585	TRUMP	I dont know, Matt.
0586	TRUMP	Its possible.
0587	TRUMP	And its not going to have any impact.
0588	TRUMP	If he says great things about me, Im going to say great things about him.
0589	TRUMP	Ive already said, he is really very much of a leader.
0590	TRUMP	I mean, you can say, oh, isnt that a terrible thing  the man has very strong control over a country.
0591	TRUMP	Now, its a very different system, and I dont happen to like the system.
0592	TRUMP	But certainly, in that system, hes been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.
0593	TRUMP	We have a divided country.
0594	TRUMP	We have a country where you have Hillary Clinton with her emails that nobodys ever seen where she deletes 33,000 emails, and thats after getting a subpoena from Congress.
0595	TRUMP	If you do that in private business, you get thrown in jail.
0596	LAUER	Hallie?
0597	JACKSON	Steve Korea (ph), here with me, was in the Army Reserves and spent 10 months in Iraq right at the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
0598	JACKSON	He is a Republican and has this question for you.
0599	QUESTION	Good evening, Mr. Trump.
0600	TRUMP	Hi.
0601	QUESTION	I like what you say about supporting veterans and how theyre important.
0602	QUESTION	But I havent heard what the actual plans are to continue that support beyond words.
0603	QUESTION	How do you translate those words to action after you take office?
0604	TRUMP	Well, I love that question, because Ive been very close to the vets.
0605	TRUMP	You see the relationship I have with the vets just by looking at the polls.
0606	TRUMP	In fact, today a poll came out.
0607	TRUMP	And my relationship has been very good.
0608	TRUMP	I have a very, very powerful plan thats on my website that you possibly saw.
0609	TRUMP	One of the big problems is the wait time.
0610	TRUMP	Vets are waiting six days, seven days, eight days.
0611	TRUMP	And by the way, Hillary Clinton six months ago said the vets are being treated essentially just fine, theres no real problem, its overexaggerated.
0612	TRUMP	She did say that.
0613	LAUER	No, no, she went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the V.A.
0614	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0615	TRUMP	Look, I mean, she made up half of the things she said about me.
0616	TRUMP	Im telling you, this is  she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.
0617	TRUMP	Now, under my plan, if youve got to wait  and, by the way, people are dying on line.
0618	TRUMP	Theyre dying, waiting, waiting to get to see a doctor.
0619	TRUMP	Theyre waiting five days and six days.
0620	TRUMP	Under a part of my plan, if they have that long wait, they walk outside, they go to the local doctor, they choose the doctor, they choose the hospital, whether its public or private, they get themselves better.
0621	TRUMP	In many cases, its a minor procedure or a pill or just a prescription.
0622	TRUMP	And they end up dying because they cant get to see the doctor.
0623	TRUMP	We will pay the bill.
0624	TRUMP	They go outside, they get a doctor, they get a prescription, they do what they have to do, and we pay the bill.
0625	TRUMP	That is something that I have been praised  and, by the way, I never said take the V.A.
0626	TRUMP	 take the Veterans Administration private.
0627	TRUMP	I wouldnt do that.
0628	TRUMP	Too much respect for our people.
0629	TRUMP	I would never do that.
0630	LAUER	OK.
0631	TRUMP	I heard it was said that I said that.
0632	TRUMP	I would not do that.
0633	TRUMP	But I do believe  I do believe, when youre waiting in line for six, seven days, you should never be in a position like that.
0634	TRUMP	You go out, you see the doctor, you get yourself taken care of.
0635	LAUER	Hallie, youve got another question.
0636	JACKSON	I do.
0637	JACKSON	Rachel Fredericks (ph), who specialized in aviations operations in the Marine Corps, serving stateside, she lost two friends to suicide.
0638	JACKSON	And you now struggle yourself with PTSD.
0639	JACKSON	Shes a Republican, but leaning towards you, still undecided a little bit.
0640	JACKSON	Rachel, you have a question for Mr. Trump.
0641	QUESTION	I do.
0642	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, I wanted to ask what your plan will be to stop 20 veterans a day from killing themselves.
0643	TRUMP	And actually its 22.
0644	TRUMP	And its almost impossible to conceive that this is happening in our country, 20 to 22 people a day are killing themselves.
0645	TRUMP	A lot of it is theyre killing themselves over the fact that they cant  theyre under tremendous pain and they cant see a doctor.
0646	TRUMP	Were going to speed up the process.
0647	TRUMP	Were going to create a great mental health division.
0648	TRUMP	They need help.
0649	TRUMP	They need help.
0650	TRUMP	They need tremendous help.
0651	TRUMP	And were doing nothing for them.
0652	TRUMP	The V.A.
0653	TRUMP	is really almost, you could say, a corrupt enterprise.
0654	TRUMP	If you look at whats going on, as an example, Matt, in Arizona, where they caught people stealing, and they cant even do anything about it, they cant even fire the people.
0655	TRUMP	So we are going to make it efficient and good.
0656	TRUMP	And if its not good, youre going out to private hospitals, public hospitals, and doctors.
0657	TRUMP	Thank you very much.
0658	LAUER	Hallie, one more?
0659	JACKSON	Donald Day (ph) here, who served as a radio operator in the Marine Corps in the Vietnam era.
0660	JACKSON	He had tours of duty in Southeast Asia and in Europe.
0661	JACKSON	Hes also a Democrat and has this question for you.
0662	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, I have a daughter who is interested in joining the service, but when she researched the military, she saw the stats on sexual assault and decided not to go.
0663	QUESTION	I have a concern about the rape of women in our armed forces.
0664	QUESTION	As president, what specifically would you do to support all victims of sexual assault in the military?
0665	TRUMP	Its a great question.
0666	TRUMP	And its a massive problem.
0667	TRUMP	The numbers are staggering, hard to believe, even.
0668	TRUMP	But were going to have to run it very tight.
0669	TRUMP	I at the same time want to keep the court system within the military.
0670	TRUMP	I dont think it should be outside of the military.
0671	TRUMP	But we have to come down very, very hard on that.
0672	TRUMP	And your daughter is absolutely right, it is a massive problem.
0673	TRUMP	But we have to do something about that problem.
0674	TRUMP	And the best thing we can do is set up a court system within the military.
0675	TRUMP	Right now, the court system practically doesnt exist.
0676	TRUMP	It takes too long.
0677	LAUER	In 2013, on this subject, you tweeted this, quote, 26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military, only 238 convictions.
0678	LAUER	What did these geniuses expect when they put men and women together?
0679	TRUMP	Well, it is  it is  it is a correct tweet.
0680	TRUMP	There are many people that think that thats absolutely correct.
0681	TRUMP	And we need to have a
0682	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0683	LAUER	So this should have been expected?
0684	LAUER	And does that mean the only way to fix it is to take women out of the military?
0685	TRUMP	Well, its happening, right?
0686	TRUMP	And, by the way, since then, its gotten worse.
0687	TRUMP	No, not to take them out, but something has to be happen.
0688	TRUMP	Right now, part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted.
0689	TRUMP	You have reported and  the gentleman can tell you, you have the report of rape and nobody gets prosecuted.
0690	TRUMP	There are no consequence.
0691	TRUMP	When you have somebody that does something so evil, so bad as that, there has to be consequence for that person.
0692	TRUMP	You have to go after that person.
0693	TRUMP	Right now, nobodys doing anything.
0694	TRUMP	Look at the small number of results.
0695	TRUMP	I mean, thats part of the problem.
0696	LAUER	So many of the issues that weve talked about with you, Mr. Trump, tonight, and Secretary Clinton, are so complex that even career military people and career diplomats and politicians have trouble getting their arms around them.
0697	TRUMP	Right.
0698	LAUER	Youve had a very different background, in business.
0699	LAUER	So nobody would expect you to have taken over the last 20 years really deep dives into some of these issues.
0700	LAUER	But Im curious about what youre doing now.
0701	LAUER	What kind of research are you doing now?
0702	LAUER	What kind of homework are you doing?
0703	LAUER	What kind of things are you reading as you prepare for the day in two months where you might be elected the next president of the United States?
0704	TRUMP	Sure.
0705	TRUMP	Well, in the front row, you have four generals.
0706	TRUMP	You have admirals.
0707	TRUMP	We have people all throughout the audience that Im dealing with.
0708	TRUMP	Right here is a list that was just printed today of 88 admirals and generals that I meet with and I talk to.
0709	LAUER	How much time are you spending on this?
0710	TRUMP	Im also  a lot.
0711	TRUMP	A lot.
0712	TRUMP	And Im doing a lot of different things.
0713	TRUMP	Dont forget, were running a big campaign.
0714	TRUMP	Were doing very well.
0715	TRUMP	Im also, you know, and Im very much giving it to my children and my executives to run, Im also partially running a business.
0716	TRUMP	Im campaigning, Im running a business.
0717	TRUMP	Ive got a lot of hats right now.
0718	TRUMP	But were doing very well.
0719	TRUMP	But in the meantime, I am studying.
0720	TRUMP	And Im meeting constantly  you see  you see General Flynn and you see some of the folks that we have, and theyre scattered throughout the audience.
0721	TRUMP	So we have admirals, we have generals, we have colonels.
0722	TRUMP	We have a lot of people that I respect.
0723	TRUMP	And I think Ive learned a lot.
0724	TRUMP	But I think, also, I certainly  I really feel I have a common sense on the various issues that youre talking about, Matt.
0725	LAUER	You said in the speech today, you said history shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is the greatest.
0726	TRUMP	And were not prepared.
0727	LAUER	Will you be prepared on day one, if youre elected president of the United States, to tackle these complex national security issues?
0728	TRUMP	One hundred percent.
0729	TRUMP	Hey, Matt, again, she made a mistake on Libya.
0730	TRUMP	She made a terrible mistake on Libya.
0731	TRUMP	And the next thing, I mean, not only did she make the mistake, but then they complicated the mistake by having no management once they bombed you know what out of Gadhafi.
0732	TRUMP	I mean, she made a terrible mistake on Libya.
0733	TRUMP	And part of it was the management aftereffect.
0734	TRUMP	I think that we have great management talents, great management skills.
0735	LAUER	But you are prepared?
0736	TRUMP	And I have to tell you  totally prepared.
0737	TRUMP	But remember this.
0738	TRUMP	I found this subject and these subjects of interest all of my life, Matt.
0739	TRUMP	This hasnt been over the last 14 months.
0740	TRUMP	Ive found these substantiates of tremendous interest.
0741	TRUMP	Thats why they were asking me about Iraq 14 years ago.
0742	TRUMP	They were asking me these questions.
0743	TRUMP	They dont ask businesspeople those questions.
0744	LAUER	Let me end in kind of the same place I started.
0745	LAUER	Have you given much thought, Mr. Trump, if youre elected president and commanderinchief, to that moment where youre going to have to make that first decision that puts American men and women in harms way?
0746	TRUMP	I think its the most difficult decision you can possibly ever make.
0747	TRUMP	Youre talking about death.
0748	TRUMP	And were talking death to not just our side.
0749	TRUMP	Were talking death all over.
0750	TRUMP	I would be very, very cautious.
0751	TRUMP	I think Id be a lot slower.
0752	TRUMP	She has a happy trigger.
0753	TRUMP	You look, she votes for the wars, she goes in Libya
0754	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0755	LAUER	Have you thought about personally the emotional burden of that moment?
0756	TRUMP	I think its a tremendous burden.
0757	TRUMP	I think there is no greater burden that anybody could have.
0758	TRUMP	Ive been preparing this for a long time.
0759	TRUMP	And, you know, my theme is make America great again.
0760	TRUMP	Were going to make America great again.
0761	TRUMP	But, Matt, weve also got to make America strong again.
0762	TRUMP	And right now, we are not strong.
0763	TRUMP	Believe me.
0764	TRUMP	We have a depleted military.
0765	TRUMP	We have the greatest people in the world in our military.
0766	TRUMP	But it is very sadly depleted.
0767	LAUER	The Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald Trump.
0768	TRUMP	Thank you, Matt.
0769	LAUER	Thank you.
0770	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0771	LAUER	Were going to be much  well be back with much more from the Intrepid carrier on this CommanderinChief Forum right after this.

0774	LAUER	We want to thank the many veterans in our audience for their questions and, most importantly, for their service.
0775	LAUER	We want to thank our hosts at the IAVA, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and, of course, the Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum, this amazing venue.
