(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nLegal experts told us it would not be illegal for anyone on either end of the call to record it, or to disseminate the recording. Furthermore, the conversation did not bear on sensitive national security matters covered by the federal Espionage Act.\n\"This is silly,\" said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck, whose specialties include national security and constitutional law. \"Not only is there no universe in which the conversation between Trump and Raffensperger included the kind of \u2018information relating to the national defense\u2019 that\u2019s covered by the Espionage Act, but the president himself publicly described the conversation\" the next day in a tweet.\n\"There\u2019s nothing close to a crime here.\"\nFleshing out the call and the claim\nRaffensperger, a Republican, has maintained that Georgia\u2019s returns accurately reflected a Biden victory in the Nov. 3 election. Votes were counted three times, showing Biden won by nearly 12,000 votes.\nIn the call, Trump told Raffensperger: \"All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.\"\nThe Jan. 4 Facebook post is from Conversation Controversy, which is identified as a media user on Facebook. It includes a 2.5-minute video narrated by Doug TenNapel, who is a graphic novelist, video game designer and a former writer for the conservative website Breitbart.\u00a0\nIn the video, TenNapel doesn\u2019t mention espionage, but cites a Jan. 4 article by the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, that does.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article references a Jan. 3 tweet by Jack Posobiec, a reporter for One America News Network, a conservative cable news service. The tweet, which alludes to the Washington Post story that revealed the telephone call, claimed that the White House is \"planning to refer Brad Raffensperger WaPo leak to Secret Service for investigation under national security grounds of the Espionage Act.\"\nNeither the article nor the tweet cites any evidence that Raffensperger is facing espionage charges. The White House, the Secret Service and TenNapel didn\u2019t reply to our requests for information.\nAs for how the recording was leaked, the Post and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution both reported that they obtained the recording the day after the phone conversation, but did not say how they obtained it. Raffensperger\u2019s office did not respond to our requests for comment.\u00a0\nVladeck and Asha Rangappa, a Yale University national security law instructor and former FBI agent, said that both Georgia and Washington, D.C., are one-party consent jurisdictions \u2014 meaning it is legal to record, and to distribute recordings, made with only one party\u2019s consent.\nRaffensperger has indicated that the recording was released because Trump\u2019s tweet \"broke privacy\" and contained false information. Trump\u2019s tweet said that in the call, Raffensperger was \"unwilling, or unable, to answer questions\" about voter fraud in Georgia.\n\"If President Trump wouldn\u2019t have tweeted anything and would have stayed silent, we would have stayed silent, as well,\" Raffensperger said in a TV interview.\nLegal experts see no basis for espionage charges\nVladeck knocked down Posobiec\u2019s report on Twitter. He and Rangappa said the FBI, not the Secret Service, investigates violations of the Espionage Act.\nGiven that the phone conversation had to do with counting votes in Georgia, \"to me, it\u2019s absurd on its face\" that disclosing what was said could violate the Espionage Act, Rangappa said.\nThe Espionage Act \"covers certain unauthorized disclosures of \u2018national defense\u2019 information,\" said Columbia University law professor David Pozen.\u00a0\n\"Even the most expansive definitions of this term that I\u2019ve ever seen proposed would not cover what happened here. The idea that Raffensperger should face Espionage Act charges is absurd and outrageous.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claimed Raffensperger \"faces espionage charges.\"\nThere is no evidence for the claim.\u00a0\nMoreover, legal experts said it is not illegal for Raffensperger or anyone on the call between him and Trump to have recorded the call, or to have shared the recording. And disclosing discussions about ballot counting in Georgia do not involve sensitive national defense information that would invoke the Espionage Act, the experts said.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19122"}
