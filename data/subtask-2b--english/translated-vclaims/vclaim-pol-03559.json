Is he right?", "text": "Illegal immigration from the United States-Mexico border fell significantly during his first full month in office, and President Donald Trump said at his first meeting of the Council of Ministers. \"In the first full month of my administration after the issuance of my executive orders, illegal immigration on our southern border declined by an unprecedented 40 per cent,\" said Tramp March 13. The Ministry of Internal Security recently reported that 40 per cent of illegal crossings on the south-west border had decreased from January to February 2017. How much credit can Trump make for this decline and is it unprecedented? According to experts, Trump &apos; s hard-line migration discourse was likely to have played an important role, but there are other factors that also merit consideration. This decrease represents a significant decrease compared to recent years. On March 8, National Security Minister John Kelly described an \"unprecedented\" decline at the illegal south-west border crossings from January to February. The total concern on the south-west border decreased by approximately 44 per cent from January (42,504) to February (23,589). The overall concerns include the following: arrests by United States border patrols between ports of entry, and the inadmissibility decided by the United States Customs and Border Protection Office for field operations at ports of entry. Specifically, the sub-group of arrests by border patrols along the United States-Mexico border decreased by about 40 per cent, from 31,578 in January to 18,762 in February. The Customs and Border Protection Office has historically seen an increase of between 10 and 20 per cent in concerns from January to February, as stated by Kelly. Monthly data on arrests at the south-western border for the fiscal years 2012-2016 are available here, showing an increase in arrests from January to February. However, the concerns may increase in the coming months, according to the Ministry of National Security. \"We will remain vigilant to respond to any changes in these trends, as the numbers of illegal crossings usually increase between March and May,\" said Kelly. However, early results show that enforcement is important, deterrence is important, and comprehensive migration enforcement can have an impact. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 3 February 2021 Immigration orders issued by Tramp, execution notes issued by Tramp indicate a decrease in illegal migration along the southern border in the first full month of his administration, and reference instructions signed in late January. Among the things covered by the Tramp Immigration Orders and the Kelly Implementation Notes are: a directive to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico; a declaration to appoint 15,000 additional immigration law enforcement officers at the border and within the country; and a cessation of the practice of \"fishing and releasing\" or the release of migrants who are illegally arrested across the border. (A complete conclusion.) According to experts, Trump &apos; s intransigent discourse on migration played an important role in reducing illegal border crossings. However, they also caution that the value of the data for one month is not sufficient for a full assessment and that other factors should also be considered. \"I believe that the election of President Trump is probably the most important factor driving these changes. But it's still too early to get certain conclusions, \"Said Christopher Wilson, Deputy Director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. His speech so far is likely to have a stronger impact than his policies, as changes on the ground and implementation take longer, as Wilson said. Faye Hippsman, a policy analyst with the United States Immigration Policy Program at the Institute of Migration Policy, said, is a non-partisan think tank looking at migration trends and policies. In February 2017, the number of fears was five years lower, as Hippsman said. The country has not experienced a 40% drop in fears in the past five years. But monthly concerns in fiscal year 2011 \"were on a par with February figures,\" as she said. \"The factors driving border crossing today - now the majority in Central America - have not changed,\" noted Hippsman. \"Violence and insecurity continue to dominate the region, poverty has not improved, and tens of thousands of families still live separately with some members of the United States and other Central American countries with a desire for reunification.\" While arrest data were generally used to measure illegal border crossings, previous administrations used both high and low numbers as an indicator of strong border enforcement, Donald Kerwin, Executive Director of the Centre for Migration Studies, a think tank studying international migration and a member of a global network of migrant shelters and service centres. \"This metric can go both ways,\" said Kerwin. The Governor, Trump, said, \"In the first full month of my administration, after my executive orders, illegal immigration on our southern border declined by an unprecedented 40 per cent.\" The numbers check. February &apos; s fears fell by 40 per cent. However, the call for an unprecedented decline is extremely difficult. Experts caution that one month &apos; s data is not sufficient to indicate a downward trend in irregular migration and that other factors, along with Trump &apos; s letter and executive orders, should be taken into account in analysing the decline in concerns. The Trump statement is accurate but requires additional information. We're mostly assessing it right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/832Af59f-8bea-4eb9-9811-9b7e5dcc6adf", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03559"}
