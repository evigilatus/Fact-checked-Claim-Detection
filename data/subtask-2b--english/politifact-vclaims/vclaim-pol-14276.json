John Boccieri's voting record as proof he's Nancy Pelosi's puppet", "text": "Turning House Speaker Nancy Pelosi into an electoral boogeyman is all the rage this year among Republicans trying to gain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nRepublicans have spent much of 2010 portraying Rep. John Boccieri as Pelosi\u2019s clone. The GOP candidate for Boccieri\u2019s seat, Jim Renacci, has repeatedy stated that Boccieri votes with Pelosi\u00a0\u00a094 percent of the time.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee label\u2019s Boccieri as one of \"Pelosi\u2019s Puppets\" on its website. It attacks his voting record in a television ad it began airing this week.\n\n\"In fact, 93 percent of the time, Boccieri voted with Nancy Pelosi,\" the ad claims. \"Nancy Pelosi can count on John Boccieri,\" concludes the ad, which pictures of both legislators. \"What about us?\"\n\nPolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.\n\nThe NRCC cites a Washington Post voting database to back up its contention.\n\nBut Boccieri dismisses claims that he frequently votes with Pelosi as dishonest because House speakers seldom vote. The Washington Post voting database shows Pelosi has voted a mere 94 times in the past two years, while Boccieri has cast 1,550 votes.\n\n\"That is just a tradition for Speakers -- they often don't vote,\" says Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly. \" She votes on some bills, not all.\"\n\nThe Washington Post says its database represents \"the percentage of votes on which a lawmaker agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members,\" rather than the frequency with which they vote with a particular party leader. It says Boccieri voted with his party 94 percent of the time over the past two years. The average party loyalty for all members is listed at 90.6 percent.\n\nWhy does the NRCC claim the the Washington Post database represents how often Boccieri votes with Pelosi rather than how often he backs the Democratic majority?\u00a0\u00a0NRCC spokesman Tory Mazzola thinks there\u2019s no difference because Pelosi is the party leader.\n\n\"Speaker Pelosi is the leader of John Boccieri\u2019s party, and this non-partisan, independent database confirms that he votes with Speaker Pelosi and her Democratic party at almost every turn.\" said an email from Mazzola.\n\nThe difference between the 94 percent statistic in the database and the 93 percent number in the ad may be because the Washington Post regularly updates \u00a0the database, and extra votes were cast since the NRCC extracted its information. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth arguing over such a small difference.\n\nBut how much would the statistic change if Boccieri\u2019s votes were measured against the 94 votes that Pelosi actually cast? Did he vote with her 93 percent of the time? We decided to do the math.\n\nWe exclude three quorum calls from our calculations because they\u2019re noncontroversial votes where everyone says they\u2019re \"present.\" With those out of the picture, Boccieri voted with Pelosi in 77 out of 91 votes, an agreement ratio of 84.6 percent, which makes the Democrat from Alliance look somewhat more independent than Republicans maintain.\n\nAnd Boccieri differed from Pelosi on some key votes:\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe voted against the first incarnation of a health insurance reform bill that he ended up supporting after it was altered by the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe backed an amendment designed to block tax dollars from funding abortions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoug MacGinnitie\n\n\nstated on June 23, 2010 in a campaign commercial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you were casting your vote for Republicans, Brian Kemp was voting for Democrats.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 July 7, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe voted against a Pelosi-backed bill to restrict oil drilling after the BP spill.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHe supported a \u00a0symbolic measure that would have blocked the government from using $350 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Fund money.\n\n\n\nThere still is a kernel of truth here. The NRCC\u2019s underlying point is that Boccieri votes with the majority a lot. But the NRCC\u2019s accuracy suffers because it chose to try to tie Boccieri to a politican it deems unpopular, rather than say what the Washington Post\u2019s database shows.\n\nAnd when you look at how the House speaker\u2019s votes match up with Boccieri\u2019s, his support hasn\u2019t been as lockstep as the Republicans claim. We rate the NRCC\u2019s claim as Barely True.\n\nComment on this item.\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
