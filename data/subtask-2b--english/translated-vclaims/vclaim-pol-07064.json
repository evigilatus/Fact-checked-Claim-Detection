In his 18th weekly speech on October, he called on people to \"be guided by science and \"remember the basic facts.\" Obama said, \"Ebola is actually a difficult disease.\" \"It doesn't travel through the air like the flu. You can't just get on a plane or a bus.\" This last line, frequently repeated in various forms by the Department, has provoked the anger of critics, who believe that the statement is too disturbing. It also runs counter to some advice from health officials that people who may have been exposed to the virus should avoid public transport. So we decided to take a look at it ourselves: can you get an Ebola from \"only riding\" on a plane or a bus? As Thomas Vickett, Professor of Infectious Diseases at Temple University School of Medicine, said, \"There is no area free of infection\" just because you are on a bus or a plane. However, Vickett and others said that there was little chance that someone would be infected with Ebola during flight or use public transport. Very small. It will take much more than just sitting next to or sharing air with an injured person. Let's make that clear. How Ebola spreads people living with HIV who are not contagious until they show symptoms, according to experts and research. The symptoms are, first, fever, followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, which usually occurs between 2 and 21 days of HIV infection. The risk of Ebola is greater if you are in direct contact with \"blood, excretion, organs or other body fluids of infected persons,\" according to WHO. These fluids contain high concentrations of the virus that can lead to infection if you are exposed to your eyes, mouth, nose or skin wound, even for a relatively short period of time. There are also some risks, albeit low, that the virus can spread through \"almost 3 feet from a patient (Ebola), inside the patient's room or care area for a long period of time,\" or by touching the surfaces contaminated by the physical fluids of the infected patient. However, there is still little evidence that Ebola is spreading in this way. Studies from the former Ebola outbreak showed that \"all cases were infected through close direct contact with affected patients,\" indicated by the World Health Organization (WHO). What the government says is that some critics say that Obama and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention send mixed signals about the virus. While Obama says you can't simply pick it up from the plane or bus, the CDC at the same time warned people who have symptoms \"to limit your contact with others\" and \"to avoid public transport.\" The CDC also advises people who may have been exposed to Ebola to remain under control, which means, in part, that \"these individuals should not travel through commercial means of transport (e.g.). \"Airplane, ship, long-range bus, train\" The director of the Centre for Disease Control (Tom Frieden) recently spoke about this in a conference call with reporters: \"I think there are two different parts of that equation. The first is, if you're a member of the traveling public and healthy, do you have to worry that you've got it sitting next to someone? The answer is no. Second, if you're sick, and maybe you've got Ebola, should you get on the bus? The answer to that is no. You may get sick, and you may have a problem revealing someone around you. Because the danger is very low, we believe there is a very low probability that anyone travelling on this plane may be compromised, but we are putting in place additional margins of safety and that is why we are calling everyone on that flight.\" Ryan Fornier mentioned on Twitter on January 31, 2021 \"Biden's administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\" \"The danger comes from direct contact with human excreta and is greater in the hospital when excretions are heavily contaminated with many viable viruses or in a person's intimate home at an early stage of illness when no one thinks of taking precautions because it seems like a \"normal\" disease, Vickett said. \"But none of these things describe what happens on a bus or on a plane.\" So how does someone get Ebola off the bus or train? Ebola's not airborne. So you should be very close to someone with Ebola and at least have a fever. Furthermore, you have to come in direct contact with the body fluids of the injured individual. The most realistic scenario we can think of is someone sitting next to you really sick and throwing up on you. It's an annoying situation, of course, without thinking you touch your nose or your eyes before you're completely cleansed. However, people sick enough to vomit are also highly unlikely to be in a situation where they can take public transport or aviation, as Anne Raymond, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California Fielding at the School of Public Health, said. This is why the only individuals infected with Ebola in the United States are health-care workers so far. \"The thing about Ebola is that at the point that you're really contagious for other people is when you're in the final stages of your illness, when you're really terrible diarrhea and non-stop vomiting,\" said Raymond. \"No one will be in contact with a person with Ebola at that stage under any kind of normal status.\" What about sneezing or coughing? Stephen Jer, a researcher in Harvard Department of Organic and Evolutional Biology who studies Ebola genomes, said if someone who shows symptoms sneezed directly on you from 3 feet away, But people shouldn't worry more about those particles hanging in the air. We should add that cough and sneeze are not symptoms of Ebola and there is no documented evidence that the disease is transmitted in this way. What if the body fluids of an injured person end up on a bus seat or an airplane cushion? Can you get an Ebola like that? Under very limited conditions the virus can remain outside the body, said Gire. First, the liquid must remain in liquid form. Once the virus is dried, it will die. Second, it must be a very cold and dark situation. \"It must be a highly designed environment for Ebola to survive in this environment,\" said Jerry. \"The temperature is stable; on the right type of surface; not exposed to light, etc. These are unlikely scenarios in nature and natural environments, and should not be seen as something likely to happen.\" Our governor Obama said, \"You can't get Ebola from just riding a plane or a bus.\" He's right in the sense that you can't \"just\" get him from being on a plane or a bus with an injured person. The injured person must have the symptoms, and he must have direct contact with that person &apos; s physical fluids, that is, with these symptoms. Blood or vomiting. Can that happen? In theory, of course. This has been confirmed by experts, and the CDC goes so far as to warn people exposed to the virus that they should not take public transport. But it's also a very unlikely scenario. It is rare to be in direct contact with the physical fluids of patients while riding a bus or a plane. And someone at that stage of the disease is probably too sick to fly or ride. Experts said that the likelihood of such a transition was too small to be so accurate. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07064"}
