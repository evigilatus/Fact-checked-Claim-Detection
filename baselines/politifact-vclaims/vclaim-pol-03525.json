Some Republicans have long argued that such state-by-state regulation, including minimum requirements for health insurance plans, has kept the price of premiums high. They argue that a more unfettered, free-market approach -- where insurers compete to sell identical policies anywhere, regardless of what the purchaser\u2019s state requires -- would drive down the cost of coverage for consumers.\nCritics counter that effectively getting rid of state regulation of insurance coverage within their borders would weaken consumer protections and promote a \"race to the bottom\" in the quality of coverage. (Here are some articles that discuss the pluses and minuses of the approach.)\nA provision to do what Trump promised didn\u2019t make it into the American Health Care Act, the House Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. However, Trump reiterated his support for the proposal in future legislation -- and his allies have kept up the rhetoric.\nDuring a March 19 appearance at the Church by the Glades in Coral Springs, Fla., Vice President Mike Pence said, \"Under President Trump\u2019s leadership ... we're going to give the American people the freedom to buy health insurance across state lines -- the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance.\"\nPence made a similar remark eight days earlier while visiting Kentucky. And on March 14, White House spokesman Sean Spicer reiterated the theme at his daily briefing. \"Who could be against allowing insurance to be sold over state lines?\" Spicer said. \"It\u2019s something that you can do (for) your car insurance.\"\nOne PolitiFact reader wrote to ask whether the comparison of health insurance and car insurance was accurate, so we decided to take a look.\nWe found that their analogy is flawed. Contrary to what Pence and Spicer said, the rules governing the sale of car insurance are much the same as how health insurance is sold today -- not how the Trump administration wants it to be sold tomorrow. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.)\nCurrently, states have laws that set minimum standards for both health insurance and car insurance. For instance, when you buy car insurance, you may be required to pay for policies with a minimum level of liability coverage, medical coverage, property damage coverage and coverage for other drivers in an accident who are uninsured or underinsured. (Here\u2019s an interactive tool from Geico\u00a0to see the particular requirements in your state.)\nSo it\u2019s common for consumers to buy an auto insurance policy online from an out-of-state vendor -- just as they can buy a health insurance policy from a vendor whose headquarters are out of state.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key factor, though, is that for both types of insurance, that out-of-state vendor has to tailor the plan it sells you to the laws of your state.\nToday, if you live in Maryland, you can purchase an auto policy from Progressive, which is based in Ohio. But the policy you buy from Progressive must adhere to the minimum requirements of your home state, Maryland. It can\u2019t simply sell you a one-state-fits-all policy.\nThat\u2019s effectively the same setup as it is for health insurance. If you are living in Maryland but decide to buy a health insurance policy from Aetna -- a company headquartered in Connecticut -- that plan must conform to Maryland\u2019s minimum requirements.\nIn reality, then, Pence got it backwards. What the Trump administration wants to do would make buying health insurance unlike the way you buy car insurance today -- not more like it, as Pence had said.\n\"Auto insurance is regulated by the states, which have different laws and regulations,\" said Roger Feldman, a professor of health policy and management at the University of Minnesota. \"It doesn't matter from whom I buy my policy -- all auto insurers that sell policies in Minnesota must live by the Minnesota laws.\"\nFeldman called the formulation by Pence and Spicer a \"false analogy.\"\nLynne McChristian, executive director of the Center for Risk Management, Education and Research at Florida State University, agreed.\nIn fact, she said, \"if you buy your health policy today and move from one state to another, when you notify the insurer of the change of address, the policy changes according to the requirements of the new state of residence -- just like auto insurance would.\"\nOur ruling\nPence said that Trump\u2019s proposal to allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines would make it the same as \"the way you buy car insurance\" today.\nExperts say this analogy is deeply flawed. Contrary to what Pence suggested, today\u2019s rules for car insurance are not a free-market, borderless nirvana. Car insurance is just as regulated, on a state-by-state basis, as health insurance is. So using today\u2019s car-insurance system as a model for the administration\u2019s vision of cross-border health-insurance sales is wrong. Making the change Trump wants would actually make the rules for health insurance and car insurance different -- not the same.\nWe rate the statement False.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    5 7  Politifact Rating: False  Says President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines would make it the same as \"the way you buy car insurance\" today.
