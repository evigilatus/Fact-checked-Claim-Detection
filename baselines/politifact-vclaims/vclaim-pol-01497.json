It goes on to say that he took \"$36,550 from payday lenders, then let them stick our troops with outrageous fees. It\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with Congress.\"\nIt is no secret that payday lenders routinely sock consumers with excessively high charges and fees. But did Barr \"let them\" stick military families with outrageous fees, while also taking money from them for his campaign?\nYes and no.\nFirst, some background\nAccording to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \"payday loans are small-dollar, short-term, unsecured loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck or regular income payment.\" Payday loans often include very high interest rates or fees.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, formed under President Barack Obama through the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010,\u00a0launched the nation's first program for supervising \"non-bank\" financial services, which include payday loan providers, as well as debt collectors, mortgage companies and credit-score companies.\nSo what did Barr do, exactly?\nAt issue is Barr\u2019s 2017 vote for the Financial CHOICE Act, which passed the House but failed in the Senate. Barr was one of seven original cosponsors of the bill.\nThe bill would make sweeping changes and repeal provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, in part by weakening the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nUnder the plan, the agency would lose its oversight of payday lenders. There is a line in the legislation that says, \"the agency may not exercise any rulemaking, enforcement, or other authority with respect to payday loans, vehicle title loans, or other similar loans.\u2019\u2019\nWith Honor spokeswoman Ellen Zeng also pointed to a June 2017 Military.com article that grappled with whether the bill would undo certain protections for active and retired service members and their families.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bureau has played a major role in \"providing restitution and help to troops taken advantage of by illegal financial practices,\" the article states.\nOne program, in the bureau's\u00a0Office of Servicemember Affairs department, has fielded over 74,000 complaints about predatory financial practices from the military community since 2011, a 2017 CFPB report says, resulting in more than $130 million in relief to affected service members.\nBut then there\u2019s the Military Lending Act\nBarr\u2019s campaign released a statement after the ad aired calling it misleading. There are\u00a0existing laws that protect military families from payday lenders, the campaign said.\nThe 2006 Military Lending Act\u00a0put a 36 percent cap on the amount of interest small-dollar lenders could charge on loans to military families.\nWhen veterans groups raised concerns about the Financial CHOICE Act, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who sponsored the bill and chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said it would not touch protections for veterans.\n\"The Financial Choice Act does not weaken the laws that specifically protect active-duty and retired members of our armed forces,\" he said in a June 2017 statement.\nZeng says the group stands by the ad, as the bill would have drained the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she says plays a vital role in protecting military veterans and their families from predatory payday lenders.\nDid Barr collect over $36,000 from payday lenders?\nThis part is pretty straight-forward. Yes, he did.\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, an authoritative database of campaign finance data, Barr has accepted $36,550 from PACs and individuals associated with the payday lending industry since his 2014 campaign. He has received $7,500 from payday lenders in 2018.\nOur ruling\nWith Honor says Barr \"would let shady payday lenders take advantage of our troops\" and that he received $36,550 in campaign donations from payday lenders.\nIt is true that Bar has accepted $36,550 in donations from payday lenders. But the other part is more complicated.\nBarr voted for legislation that would weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s power over payday lending agencies, which could indirectly affect military families as the agency fields complaints from the community.\nHowever, a 2006 law provides servicemembers protection, with a 36 percent cap on the interest small-dollar lenders could charge families.\nSo while the CFPB could have provided more protections to the military community than the 2006 law, the ad makes it appear as if Barr\u2019s actions were connected to legislation specifically about veterans.\nWe rate it Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-10-09 16:37:45 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Says Kentucky Rep.
