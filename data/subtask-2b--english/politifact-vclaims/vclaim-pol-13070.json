But officials also sharply rebuked the school, writing \"Virginia Tech's violations warrant a fine far in excess of what is currently permissible under the statute.\"\n\nCuccinelli plans to appeal the fine. In a scathing written response, the Republican took exception to the department\u2019s ruling and painted the investigation as shoddy.\n\n\"It is not just that federal bureaucrats are engaging in Monday-morning quarterbacking \u2014 it is that they have had four years\u2019 worth of Monday mornings,\" Cuccinelli said in a news release. \"Yet, in all that time, they have not once gotten into the car and driven down to Blacksburg to talk to the police chief or the university president or to anyone else who had to deal with these events in real-time. Their investigation \u2014 if you can call it that \u2014 appears deeply flawed, and their indifference to the facts on the ground is shocking.\"\n\nIs it true that no department officials visited the scene of the massacre before reaching their decision? We decided to check.\n\nAsked how the attorney general came to make such a claim, spokesman Brian Gottstein said that University Counsel Kay Heidbreder was the only member of the school\u2019s policy group to speak who to anyone from DOE. \u00a0\n\n\"It was over the phone and DOE did not visit the campus or speak to anyone else,\" Gottstein said in an email. \"All Kay and the DOE representative discussed were procedural investigative issues. \u00a0He asked no questions about what happened [on April 16, 2007].\"\n\nThe easiest way to get started was to ask the Department of Education if anyone had visited Blacksburg during the investigation. We did that on April 29. Two weeks later, after asking a second time, we got a response.\n\n\"We had several conversations, interviews and email exchanges with school officials in the process of conducting this review, and there were numerous opportunities throughout the process for Virginia Tech to provide input \u2013 most notably as the school did in its official 72-page response to our draft report,\" wrote Sara Gast, a spokeswoman with the DOE. \u00a0\n\n\"The lines of communication were certainly open, and they had multiple chances to respond and communicate with us throughout the entire process. However, because of the sensitive and legal nature of the proceedings, we did not meet with officials face-to-face,\" she added.\n\nCalled for comment, Virginia Tech spokesman Larry Hincker said that school officials did contribute to the report submitted to the DOE, but added that they were never asked to be interviewed or even submitted questions relating to the incident. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe should note that a state commission investigating the shootings interviewed 34 Tech officials before releasing a 2007 report that also concluded the university failed to issue a timely campus alert about the violence, which occurred over 2-1/2 hours. Virginia reached an $11 million settlement with many of the victims\u2019 families. Two families have filed a $10 million suit against Tech officials that is scheduled for trial this fall.\n\nLet\u2019s review.\n\nCuccinelli said DOE officials never visited Virginia Tech while probing the university\u2019s response during the 2007 shootings that left 32 dead. He said the DOE investigators never conducted face-to-face interviews with the Tech officials making decisions that dreadful day.\n\nA DOE spokeswoman acknowledged both points, although she said it did not taint the examination. She said there was plenty of communication via email and telephone.\n\nWe\u2019ll let others debate Cuccinelli\u2019s opinion on the integrity of DOE\u2019s probe. But his claim that DOE investigators never visited Tech to conduct interviews is True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13070"}
