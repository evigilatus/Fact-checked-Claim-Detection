Increase spending. High unemployment. Candidate for governor.\" As she \"finds\" some Barrett material online, she offers a running commentary.\n\n\"Tom Barrett increased spending in Milwaukee by $300 million? Huh. \"Raised taxes every year but one. Uh oh.\"\n\n\"And what did his taxes and spending do to the economy? Unemployment up 27 percent. Under Barrett, Milwaukee\u2019s one of America\u2019s 10 worst cities for unemployment.\"\n\nShe concludes: \"Spending -- up. Taxes -- up. Unemployment -- up. Governor Tom Barrett? I don\u2019t think so.\"\n\nThe RGA ad claims on taxing and spending are not in dispute.\n\nBut did unemployment jump 27 percent during Barrett\u2019s first two terms, spanning 2004 to 2012? And was Milwaukee one of the toughest places in the United States for employment? We decided to investigate both -- and the ad\u2019s claim Barrett\u2019s policies were responsible.\n\nUnemployment rates are reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and state agencies such as the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development.\n\nWe found a 26 percent \u00a0increase in the number of unemployed from April 2004, when Barrett took office, to January 2012, according to the latest figures reported on the BLS site.\n\nThe number is 27 percent if you do the math on the unemployment rates for those years (8.1 percent and 10.3 percent), though such comparisons are usually expressed as percentage point changes. In other words, you would typically say unemployment went up 2.2 percentage points under Barrett.\n\nBut either way the RGA is pretty much on target on that piece.\n\nOn the second part of the RGA claim, a top-10-worst ranking,\nthe group\u2019s spokesman pointed to 2005 -2007, when Milwaukee was sixth-highest for unemployment rate among large cities and to 2009, when the city was 10th.\n\nThe RGA uses the nation\u2019s 50 largest cities as a pool of comparison.\n\nIf you expand to municipalities of any size, Milwaukee improves hundreds of places in the rankings. But it seems reasonable to compare Milwaukee, which is near the middle of the 50 largest cities, to its peer group.\n\nSo it\u2019s clear the city was in the top 10 for highest unemployment in four of Barrett\u2019s first five full years in office.\n\nBut what about 2008, and the most recent two years, 2010 and 2011?\n\nMilwaukee improved to 16th in 2008, and ranked 11th in 2010, when six California cities were among the worst. (The annual average for 2011 was not available as of early April 2012.)\n\nSo the city\u2019s ranking has edged out of the top 10 worst in three recent years under Barrett.\n\nOne note: the TV ad subtly makes two different claims on the \"top 10\" ranking. The on-screen graphic says Milwaukee \"was\" one of the worst 10, while the narrator says that \"Milwaukee\u2019s one of America\u2019s worst\" -- a line that suggests the top-10 ranking is current.\n\nBut either way the claim of a top-10 ranking is accurate or very close in five of the seven full years under Barrett.\n\nBut the claim is about more than numbers. It places the blame squarely on Barrett and his policies (\"what did his taxes and spending do to the economy?\" asks the ad).\n\nMayors clearly have a policy role on job creation, but state and national trends drive much of the employment picture at the local level.\n\nBy the RGA\u2019s logic, Scott Walker, as much as Barrett, could be accused of causing unemployment to soar when he was the elected executive of Milwaukee County, which includes the city of Milwaukee.\n\nWhy? Because both Barrett\u2019s and Walker\u2019s eighth budgets included spending that was more than 30 percent higher than the budgets they inherited. (We used eight budgets for an apples-to-apples comparison; Barrett has submitted eight budgets; Walker did nine.)\n\nSeparately, property taxes went up 20 percent over Walker\u2019s first eight years, compared with 25 percent under Barrett. (Note: Walker never proposed a tax hike but used County Board levy increases as his base the following year).\n\nOur conclusion\n\nThe Republican Governors Association, which backs Scott Walker, was basically accurate on its claims, but overstates the influence of a mayor on taming unemployment.\n\nThis comes in Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11289"}
