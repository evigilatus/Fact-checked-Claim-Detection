Rob Portman was asked for his views about refugees from Syria and what the U.S. role should be.\nPortman said that refugees face a dire situation due to actions of the Syrian government, but it would not be wise for the United States to increase the number of refugees admitted.\n\"Before the Homeland Security Committee, the director of the FBI said that we cannot figure out who these people are, what their intentions are, because we have no information on them, because we don\u2019t have any contact with the Syrian government or any people on the ground to be able to determine that,\" Portman said. \"That to me is not a good thing for the United States to do.\"\nIs that what FBI Director James Comey said? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nThe United States vets all refugees through an extensive process that involves the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department and other agencies.\nThe process can take two or even three years, as Democrat Ted Strickland said during the debate. Refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks, and because of special concerns about terrorism, Syrian refugees actually have to go through extra hurdles.\nExperts have told us repeatedly that refugee background checks are the most extensive security screening the country has for any type of visitor.\nComey spoke to the Homeland Security Committees of both chambers of Congress last year, sharing much the same opinion both times. His opinion was not exactly what Portman implied.\nWhen Comey spoke before the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21, 2015, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., asked Comey whether there is concern that the FBI could miss a potential terrorist infiltrator because intelligence databases don\u2019t contain complete information for every refugee.\nComey said the procedure isn\u2019t perfect. \"We can only query against that which we have collected,\" Comey said. \"If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but ... there will be nothing show up because we have no record on that person.\"\nSo Comey was saying that, despite the thoroughness of the process, he couldn\u2019t guarantee there would never be a problem or that no terrorist would ever slip through the cracks.\nComey noted that when the United States performed background checks on Iraqi refugees, they had a much larger database because the United States has had a presence there for more than a decade. Not having the same intelligence infrastructure in Syria has resulted in much less information with which to cross-reference an applicant.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said at the same hearing that it\u2019s possible a refugee could have an unknown criminal past or suddenly commit a terrorist act after entering the United States.\nThat said, despite the pitfalls of admitting refugees from war-torn regions, Comey said the process works and has been improving over the years.\n\"The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago,\" Comey told U.S. Rep Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., later in the hearing. \"The bad news is, there is no risk-free process.\"\nComey was echoing concerns he voiced to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Oct. 8.\n\"There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that,\" he told the Senate committee. \"From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals. \u2026 I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps.\"\nHe repeated that sentiment to the House Judiciary Committee on Oct. 22.\n\"We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news,\" Comey said. \"The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria.\"\nWe\u2019ll also note that, especially given the extra scrutiny for Syrian refugees, experts have told us it \"makes no operational sense\" for ISIS to take advantage of the refugee program.\n\n\"Given how easy it is to send a European extremist to the U.S. via Europe, why would an ISIS guy in Syria wait the three years it takes to get refugee status?\" Anne Speckhard, a counterterrorism expert at Georgetown University, told us previously.\nFinally, we should note that we\u2019ve looked at claims from Donald Trump before that the United States doesn\u2019t have a system to vet refugees. That more extreme claim is False. Portman\u2019s claim offers more nuance and context.\nOur ruling\nPortman said, \"The director of the FBI said that we cannot figure out who (Syrian refugees) are, what their intentions are, because we have no information on them, because we don\u2019t have any contact with the Syrian government or any people on the ground to be able to determine that.\"\nPortman had a point that Comey expressed concerns about information gaps on potential Syrian refugees. However, he exaggerated the extent of Comey\u2019s concerns when he said that Comey indicated that \"we cannot figure out\" who they are, and that we have \"no information on them.\" All told, Comey said the vetting process is thorough, but imperfect.\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04081"}
