Information from the agency, a reliable source for job-related calculations, earlier helped us confirm that 1.04 million Texans were unemployed as of August 2011, the latest month for which such data were available.\n\nAlso correct, per the bureau: The state\u2019s August 2011 unemployment rate, 8.5 percent, was the highest Texas had experienced since the 9.3 percent rate reached in November 1986, nearly 25 years before.\n\nFinally, the unemployment rate has doubled during Perry\u2019s governorship -- going from 4.2 percent in December 2000 to 8.5 percent in August 2011.\n\nHowever, we rated a previous Romney claim to this effect Half True. Experts reminded us that governors have little to do with statewide job losses or gains that take place during their terms. Put another way, neither Romney nor Perry merits credit or blame for job conditions in their respective states. Economies rise and fall due to many conditions beyond a governor\u2019s sway. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThat should make the next debate a lot shorter, shouldn\u2019t it?\n\nThe logical weakness in blaming a state\u2019s governor for the state\u2019s jobless residents and unemployment rate makes Romney\u2019s triple-barreled claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12233"}
