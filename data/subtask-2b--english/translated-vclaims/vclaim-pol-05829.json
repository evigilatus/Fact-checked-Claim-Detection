Rubio said that the EPA rules were very stressful, referring to two businessmen who joined him in his speech, James McCall, President of Artex Oil, and Tom McCall, President of Fairfield East Coal. \"The Environmental Protection Agency has unilaterally changed how to interpret the Clean Water Act. They now protect not only rivers and lakes, but also the drainage trenches and the special basins they maintain. So when mining or drilling, Jerry and Tom should be careful not to disturb the bodies of water barely bigger than the pool.\" We wondered: Does the Clean Water Act allow the Government to regulate how mining and drilling affect water bodies \"a lot larger than ponds?\" A spokesman for Rubio refused to comment. However, Rubio was supposed to refer to a recent change in the rules of the Clean Water Act, where the \"plumber\" emerged as a controversial issue. The clean water law rule was first changed by the court, some background. The Clean Water Act, originally passed in 1972, following an incident in which there was widespread publicity that caught fire in the Kouyahoga River in Ohio. Another factor that led to the adoption of federal law was the record number of fish killed by pollution - the largest in Florida in Lake Tuntosa in 1969. In general, its objective is to organize demobilization operations. However, what water bodies should be included was a highly contested issue for many years. The decisions of the United States Supreme Court in 2001 and 2006 created uncertainty as to the applicability of the law. Officials of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said that these decisions had retracted the federal protection of about 60 per cent of flows and millions of hectares of wetlands. In May 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency announced a new rule aimed at clarifying which water bodies fell under the law. The new rule came months after the general comment and entered into force on 28 August, with the exception of 13 States in which the Court suspended its enactment. Subsequently, earlier this month, a different court held nationwide legislation. The first thing to know about the new rule is that size doesn't matter. What matters is whether the body of water can carry pollution in other large waters. Under this rule, the Federal Government intends to regulate water bodies - including tributaries, pools, streams and wetlands - so that companies or other entities do not dump wastes that could flow into larger ecosystems. This definition of the waters of federal jurisdiction is in fact preceded by the new rule, which instead stems from Supreme Court cases. In 2001, the Court held that the use of unseaworthy \"insulated\" pools within states was not in itself a sufficient basis for the application of the Clean Water Act. In the 2006 case, Judge Anthony Kennedy found that one of the determining factors in determining whether the Clean Water Act was applicable was whether the water had a \"close connection\" to traditional navigable water. Therefore, a narrow current -- even if dry for part of the year -- could remain under federal jurisdiction if it could flow into more important water during the rainy season. However, an isolated pool that is not linked to other major waters does not fall within the competence of the act. \"Even if some very small water bodies are covered by the Clean Water Act when they are sufficiently connected to another body of water, his statement gives a picture of a small surface of isolated water that will not be covered,\" said Todd Agard, Deputy Dean of Villanova Law School, and former environmental lawyer at the Ministry of Justice. Although jurisdiction under the law is determined by connection, not by size, it is the size of the water bodies that has become a cry that mobilizes critics who believe that the new rule transcends federal borders. During the suspension period, the organization of the pond became a point of discussion for conservatives and business defenders. It is therefore assumed that the final rule explicitly addressed the question of the pool: \"The proposed rule did not expressly exclude the pool because the agencies never considered the pool to meet the minimum standard of 'United States water', which is inaccurate. The pond is usually considered a very small, shallow, and very expressive pond of water formed on a pier or heights during or after a rain storm or similar precipitation event. However, many commentators requested that agencies explicitly exclude them in a rule. The last rule does that.\" The rule also specifically excludes certain types of water as well as pools, including groundwater, most trenches and small decoration water, for example. In one of his interviews on January 31, 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \"more water fell in Houston in five days than it went over Niagara Falls in a year.\" If the rule specifically states that the ponds do not fall within the purview of the rule, why do critics continue to say that they include a pond or something that is not much larger? We met with seven environmental experts, including one working for an organization that sued the Environmental Protection Agency. They were all skeptical that the base would cover anything like a pond. That's because a small body like a pond, or something a little bigger, that isn't connected to other water shouldn't have a definitive effect on the types of navigable water regulated by the Clean Water Act. \"What kind of water body is barely larger than a pond? How big is the pool? If it refers to a small pool where a child is thrown, a fair reading of the rule is that it does not cover such an area,\" said Stetson University Law Professor Royal Gardner, an expert in wetland law and policy. At the same time, Rubio specifically mentioned mining and drilling - activities that are already highly regulated. While mining and drilling can have a negative impact on groundwater, groundwater is expressly excluded by law. We have reached out to some industrial groups that have sued the Environmental Protection Agency against Al-Qaida, including the United States Farm Office Federation and the United States Chamber of Commerce. Both argue that al-Qa &apos; idah language is so broad that it can eventually include something that is not much larger than a pond. \"The agencies use the terms \"water\" and \"water\" in an unequivocal reference to rivers, streams, trenches, wetlands, volcanoes, lakes, bull brackets and other types of natural or man-made water systems, which can be determined by the waters in these water systems or by their chemical, natural and biological indicators. Agencies use the terms \"water\" and \"water objects\" interchangeably in this preamble. For Parish, that means \"you don't even need water in it.\" Only chemical, physical and biological indicators are needed. What the hell is this? It's too broad.\" They asked for examples from the real world where the EPA organized something about the size of a pond, the spokesman for Will Rodger's farm office sent us a picture of a farm field in Tennessee that appears to be showing the beginning of a dry current. He said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced this patch of land. (This occurred in 2014 before the entry into force of the new rule.) We examined the environmental experts and said that water on land that appears even during only part of the year could eventually flow into larger huts of water. But again, the key is that water must be prepared to flow to other important waters, which seem distinct from a small isolated pool. Carl Copplan, from the law school in Bess, said: \"It's true that the head water from the streams is small, but the small feathers go to the river.\" \"The purpose of the Clean Water Act is to cover that river to the point where it begins.\" For their part, environmental experts said that they could not think of any examples in which EPA had tried to organize something that was barely larger than a pond. \"It's a ridiculous confirmation, William L. Andrin, Professor of Law at the University of Alabama. \"There are no cases in this regard because agencies have never confirmed their jurisdiction in such remarkable cases.\" The governor Rubio said that adherence to the EPA rules in mining or drilling should be \"wary not to disturb water bodies that are barely larger than a pool.\" A new final rule - currently suspended due to litigation - seeks to clarify the types of water that EPA can oversee through the Clean Water Act. However, the rule expressly excludes ponds, along with most trenches and decorative objects of water. In addition, the main factor in determining the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act is the relevance of the water mass, not its size or smallness. To the extent that the pond, or something slightly larger, should not be a \"large\" contributor to large navigable waters located far away - a criterion established by the Supreme Court decision of 2006 - it should not be regulated under the new rule. This issue is still under litigation, but the best evidence we have gathered suggests that Rubio &apos; s claim is at least significantly exaggerated. We mostly rate it wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4837e7f4-5230-4af2-a319-b5dc553050f", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05829"}
