The flag essentially is a black-and-white version of the American flag, with a single red stripe replaced by a blue one.\nThat blue stripe is meant to symbolize police officers as the \"thin blue line\" between order and chaos.\u00a0\nThe Facebook post featured a screenshot of a Twitter post by author and Dartmouth College English professor Jeff Sharlet, that included a photo and read: \"Tonight in Wisconsin. First the anti-Black Lives Matter flag flew outside his rallies, then beside the American flag. Now it has replaced the American flag. That\u2019s significant.\"\u00a0\nAlongside the screenshot, the Facebook post read: \"Trump flew the anti-Black Lives Matter flag at his rally in Wisconsin. So much for not disrespecting the troops \u2026\"\nThe post in question was shared by a group called \"The Other 98%\" -- a left-leaning nonprofit, according to its bio on Facebook -- the day after the rally. The post has been shared more than 2,500 additional times and reacted to by more than 7,200 people.\nThis post was flagged as a part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nSo was the flag really flying behind Trump during his Waukesha rally?\u00a0\nAnd is it an \"anti-Black Lives Matter\" flag?\nWas the flag real?\u00a0\nIn a review of photos of the Oct. 24, 2020 Waukesha rally taken by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the Thin Blue Line flag is hung prominently behind the risers behind behind the podium where Trump spoke.\nThe flag was featured very prominently at the rally -- a change from the last several Wisconsin rallies that Trump has held in other cities.\u00a0\nIn Janesville on Oct. 17, 2020, the flag was featured on one side of the stage, while a larger American flag was featured on the other side of the stage, photos from the Journal Sentinel showed. In Mosinee on Sept. 17, 2020, Trump spoke in front of Air Force One and no flags were prominently displayed, according to photos by the Journal Sentinel.\u00a0\nSo the portion of the post that says that the flag was featured prominently -- and more prominently than at earlier rallies -- is on the money.\nBut what about the meaning of the flag?\u00a0\nA controversial flag meant to support police officers\nThe flag has been popularized by the company \"Thin Blue Line USA,\" which also sells clothing emblazoned with the symbol. According to the company\u2019s website, the flag is meant to be a sign for \"promoting compassion and support for our nation\u2019s police officers.\"\u00a0\n\nThe company began marketing the flag in 2014 amid the Blue Lives Matter movement, which itself was launched in response to the Black Lives Matter movement.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement arose in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who killed teen Trayvon Martin in Florida, according to the movement\u2019s website. Black Lives Matter has been invoked around the country this year during massive protests that were launched by the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers.\nIn a June 8, 2020, article by The Marshall Project headlined \"The Short, Fraught History of the \u2018Thin Blue Line\u2019 American Flag,\" Andrew Johnson, president of Thin Blue Line USA said: \"The flag has no association with racism, hatred, bigotry. It\u2019s a flag to show support for law enforcement\u2014no politics involved.\"\nAccording to the article:\nJacob said the flag was not a direct reaction to the first Black Lives Matter protests\u2014an idea suggested by a previous origin story in Harper\u2019s\u2014but he allows he may have first seen the thin blue line image after those protests spurred the circulation of pro-police imagery online. \"That\u2019s maybe why it came to my eyes,\" he said.\nWhatever the intended meaning of the flag, it has come to carry different connotations to different people\nAt protests in Charlottesville in 2017, where white supremacist groups and supporters gathered to protest the removal of Confederate statues throughout the country, the blue-line flag was featured alongside Confederate flags, according to an Aug. 18, 2017 report from USA TODAY. (The company disavowed its use in Charlottesville)\nA July 31, 2020 NPR report highlighted a fight between a Massachusetts fire department flying the flags in honor of fallen police officers, and community members who felt the flag was an overt display of racism.\nA June 9. 2020 Politico report said even police officers have mixed reactions to the symbol, with some departments banning it outright, while others display it on government-owned vehicles.\nThe Politico report also noted that the flag is controversial because of its likeness to the American flag, and because of the U.S. Flag Code, which states: \"The (American) flag should never have placed upon it, nor any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture or drawing of any nature.\"\u00a0\nWhen asked why the flag was placed behind the president, Wisconsin Trump Victory --\u00a0 the state\u2019s Trump campaign group -- did not respond.\u00a0\nTo be sure, it is possible to support police officers and the Black Lives Matter movement.\nBut Trump himself has been harshly critical of the Black Lives Matter protests this summer, labeling them as violent and claiming they were stoked by anti-government elements.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims an \"anti-Black Lives Matter\" flag replaced the American flag behind Trump during a Waukesha campaign rally.\nTo be sure, the flag itself violates the U.S. Flag Code, and should not be considered a legitimate U.S. flag by those standards.\u00a0\nIn terms of the Facebook claim, The image and description -- that the flag has taken on greater prominence at the Trump rallies in Wisconsin -- is on target. And the Thin Blue Line flag has become a prominent part of the pro-police Blue Lives Matter movement -- which arose to counter the Blak Lives Matter movement.\nThat said, while it is possible to support both, Trump has made clear he opposes the Black Lives Matter protests -- and made that opposition, and a strong law-and-order message, a prominent part of his re-election campaign. So, those attending the rally or seeing the images could easily see the flag as an \"anti Black Lives Matter flag.\"\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18800"}
