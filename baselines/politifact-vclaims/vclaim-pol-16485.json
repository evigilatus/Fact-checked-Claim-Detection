The\n\nHouston Chronicle,\n\nafter an extensive analysis of Federal Election Commission reports, puts the figure at $63,440 for the same period.\n\n\nThe disparity in the figures is caused by the complicated nature of campaign contributions.\n\n\nMassie Ritsch, a spokesman for CRP, speculates that the difference between their numbers and those of the\n\nChronicle\n\nare because the newspaper had access to small contributions and was more familiar with the military connections of people who might not have listed the military as their employer.\n\n\nRegardless, Paul is right that he's on top.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

It just may be the way this small slice of people is making a statement, because it's one of the ways they can make a statement. If you're active military, there aren't too many ways you can protest the mission you've been assigned.\"\n\n\nJohn McCain comes in third, with CRP reporting he received $40,000 and the\n\nChronicle\n\nsaying $48,208.
