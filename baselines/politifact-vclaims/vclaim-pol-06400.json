The Qatar Airways average fleet (age) is only four years and one month.\"\nPolitiFact Georgia decided to fact-check Al Baker\u2019s claim.\nBut first a little background.\nAl Baker first made the unflattering claim about Delta\u2019s fleet when he met with a reporter to address a complaint being spearheaded by Anderson.\nThe complaint accuses three major Middle East airlines -- Etihad, Emirates and Qatar -- of receiving $42 billion in \"unfair\" subsidies. Delta, United and American Airlines say the subsidies give the Gulf carriers an unfair advantage and are allowing them to expand around the world.\nQatar Airways currently flies into Washington D.C., Chicago, New York, Houston, Miami and Dallas and is scheduled next year to launch service to Los Angeles, Boston and Atlanta.\nAl Baker denies receiving any \"subsidies.\"\n\"The state of Qatar is the owner of Qatar Airways and whatever funds are put into the airline is as equity, which is quite legitimate,\" he has said.\nAl Baker and Anderson sparred earlier this year after the Gulf carriers complained that some U.S. airlines received their own subsidies in the form of Chapter 11 bankruptcy and federal loan guarantees and aid after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\nU.S. airlines countered that bankruptcy is not a subsidy, and the restructuring process is transparent.\nAnderson in February told CNN: \"It's a great irony to have the United Arab Emirates from the Arabian peninsula talk about [bailouts for U.S. airlines] given the fact that our industry was really shocked by the terrorism of 9/ 11 which came from terrorists from the Arabian peninsula that caused us to go through a massive restructuring.\"\nAl Baker shot back: \"I think he should be ashamed to bring the issue of terrorism to try to cover his inefficiency in running an airline.\"\nThe numbers\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVernon Jones\n\n\nstated on June 3, 2010 in a candidate forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Four years as a congressman, he [U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson] never talked about MARTA.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Stirgus \u2022 June 27, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, to the specifics of Al Baker\u2019s claim.\nQatar Airways, the national carrier for the State of Qatar, was launched in 1997 and bills itself as \"one of the fastest-growing airlines operating with one of the youngest fleets in the world.\"\nWe contacted the airline for documentation that it had a fleet of airplanes, averaging 4.1 years in age. We received data that showed the fleet was actually newer -- averaging 3.1 years.\nThe airline, based in Doha, has 152 passenger and cargo airplanes, including some Airbus A330s with \"designer sleeper suites\u2019 for first-class passengers.\nData on the age of U.S.-registered aircraft is available at the FAA website, which helped with our research.\nAt Delta, spokesman Trebor Banstetter told us the the airline has about 1,250 airplanes, averaging 14 years in age and 15 years on its trans-oceanic fleet.\n\"Of our 1,200 plus aircraft, there are a total of four that are older than 30 years,\" Banstetter said. \"They are all about 30.5 years old, and all scheduled for retirement this year.\"\nThe average age of the fleet is shown as slightly higher -- 17 years --- on Delta\u2019s quarterly filing to the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. That\u2019s largely a reflection of change -- new Boeing 737s being purchased; planes being moved into retirement; and others salvaged for parts, Banstetter said.\nWe were unable to contact Al Baker to ask where he got the information to suggest Delta was flying 35 year old airplanes.\nAviation expert Richard Aboulafia said airlines are defined by their products, not the age of their jets.\n\"Business class passengers, who are the only ones who really drive these considerations, look at the state of interiors, seats, food, and other amenities,\" Aboulafia said. \u00a0\"Jet age is largely irrelevant. And Delta's average fleet age certainly is nowhere near 30.\"\nOur conclusion\nAl Baker was conservative in saying that Qatar Airways had a fleet of airplanes that was 4.1 years on average. The age of Qatar\u2019s 152 passenger and cargo airplanes is actually on average 3.1 years.\nBut Al Baker veered off course when his comments morphed into an attack on Delta.\nDelta has more than 1,200 aircraft. Four are due to retire this year. Each of those is about 30.5 years old, Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said. The majority of Delta\u2019s fleet is much newer.\nAl Baker\u2019s comments contain an element truth but they ignore critical facts that would give the average reader a different impression\nWe rate Al Baker\u2019s comments Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06400"}
