Perdue\u2019s record on preexisting conditions doesn\u2019t match his promises", "text": "Health insurance has emerged as a defining issue in the Georgia Senate race, and Republican incumbent Sen. David Perdue declared that there is one angle where he can\u2019t be attacked.\n\"I\u2019ve always believed in protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. Period,\" Perdue tweeted Aug. 18. \"Anyone who says otherwise just isn\u2019t telling the truth.\"\nThe campaign ad attached to the tweet adds, \"Health insurance should always cover preexisting conditions. For anyone. Period.\"\nThat is a sweeping policy \u2014 guaranteed coverage for anyone, with no penalty for a preexisting condition.\nIf that\u2019s Perdue\u2019s position now, it doesn\u2019t jibe with his record as a lawmaker.\nHe\u2019s voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 and a bill he cosponsored to guarantee coverage fails to match the ironclad protections under that law.\u00a0\nComparing protections: Obamacare vs the Protect Act\nPerdue makes no bones about opposing the ACA, which contains several interlocking provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions. He voted to repeal it in 2015 and backed the Senate\u2019s failed repeal-and-replace effort in 2017.\u00a0\nPerdue\u2019s campaign said that it\u2019s possible to be against Obamacare, and in favor of patient protections. It said, \"Perdue co-sponsored legislation to ensure preexisting conditions are covered at no additional cost to those patients.\"\nThat bill, called the Protect Act, never came to a vote in the Senate and doesn\u2019t match the ACA\u2019s guarantees.\u00a0\nThe current law blocks insurers from using any eligibility rule, list of covered services or pricing to deny anyone coverage. The Protect Act does say that insurance companies can\u2019t deny coverage based on \"any preexisting condition.\" But it gives a carrier the option to deny certain coverage, if \"it will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately.\" Since the bill doesn\u2019t define what that clause means, it leaves open the possibility that carriers could use it to drop coverage of certain expensive diseases from all of their policies.\nTo Allison Hoffman, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, that\u2019s a big loophole.\n\"Insurers could exclude someone\u2019s preexisting conditions from coverage, even if they offered her a policy,\" Hoffman told us in 2018 when the bill was first introduced. \"That fact alone sinks any claims that this law offers preexisting condition protection.\"\nRodney Whitlock, a health policy expert who worked for Republicans in Congress, told us concerns about loopholes are reasonable.\n\"Insurers will use the rules available to them to take in more in premiums than they pay out in claims,\" Whitlock said in 2018. \"If you see a loophole and think insurers will use it, that\u2019s probably true.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoffman notes that the Protect Act\u2019s language against insurers discriminating based on genetic information also concerns her. The bill says carriers \"shall not request, require, or purchase genetic information with respect to any individual prior to such individual's enrollment.\"\nBut the bill says information collected incidentally can be used by insurers. That could happen, for example, when an employee inadvertently reveals details on a questionnaire, despite being told not to include information that can be linked back to their DNA. Insurers can\u2019t use that information for setting premiums, but Hoffman says it could shape the list of covered maladies.\n\"If an insurer comes across genetic information incidentally, it seems to me that they could exclude any related conditions,\" Hoffman warned. \"This loophole could be huge considering the amount of incidental collection and how broadly it is construed.\"\nThe bill has other holes: for instance, permitting insurers to charge women more than men.\nPerdue and short-term plans\nPerdue\u2019s stance on short-term health insurance plans also raises issues.\u00a0\nThese plans offer limited coverage that\u2019s intended to tide people over when they\u2019re between jobs. They don\u2019t need to follow the strict rules of the ACA. They don\u2019t have to cover the package of essential benefits under the law and they can exclude coverage for preexisting conditions. Under the ACA, they were limited to 90 days\u2019 coverage.\nThe Trump administration extended that to 364 days, with the option to renew them for up to three years.\nPerdue voted against a 2018 resolution to oppose Trump\u2019s expansion of short-term plans. The measure failed by one vote.\nThe Perdue campaign said that Obamacare isn\u2019t the only way to take care of people.\n\"The best way to protect those with preexisting conditions, lower costs for all Georgians, and expand access to coverage is through free market solutions,\" the campaign said in a statement.\nThe campaign noted that many counties have only one insurance company offering coverage. It argues that if more companies found it profitable to move into those areas, competition would improve the options for consumers.\nOur ruling\nPerdue said that his policy is that \"health insurance should always cover preexisting conditions. For anyone. Period.\"\nPerdue opposes the Affordable Care Act and weighed in on the side of short-term health plans that lack some of the ACA\u2019s strong protections for people with preexisting conditions. Perdue\u2019s bill to maintain those protections contains loopholes that insurance companies could use to avoid covering certain conditions.\nPerdue\u2019s promise is sweeping and absolute. The policies he has backed offer some limited protections, but don\u2019t match that promise.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18861"}
