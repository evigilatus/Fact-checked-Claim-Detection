With one of the lowest unemployment rates in years and steady growth in employment opportunities, there is much to show. But to what extent does the overall economic performance of Trump's administration compare with Barack Obama's predecessor? How was the working climate under the leadership of the two Presidents? Here's what Mr. Ron Johnson, R. Wisconsin, claimed in a tweet from July 15, 2019: \"Republical policies have led to the growth of commercial investment, which was ten times faster than we saw under President Obama.\" He says the numbers don't lie. But how exactly does it measure them? Although the tweet is a little old, the issue will be important in the next election, so we decided to take a look. Johnson's employees came to his conclusion, telling us that he used data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce that measures economic growth. Johnson referred to statistics measuring \"private fixed investment, non-residential\" and showing the size of businesses investing in structures, equipment and intellectual property, such as software and research and development. Johnson widely said that growth was 10 times faster in Trump than Obama in his tweet. It is assumed that those who read it will believe that they took the full eight-year term of Obama. However, in the data used by Johnson, he only compared the last two years of the Obama administration, 2015 and 2016, with just over two years of data for the Trump department. This approach often refers to the choice of cherry. Let's dig deeper. \"We're using the last two years of Obama's comparison because it's a similar period of time with two years of data for Trump,\" said Ben Folkle, spokesman for Johnson. \"It's close to, rather than far from, Trump years.\" According to Johnson data points, Obama's growth rate was 0.6% in that period, compared to 6.4% under Trump. The Bureau of Economic Analysis updated the statements shortly after Johnson &apos; s statement. In doing so, the figures for some services were slightly adjusted, but the overall trend was largely the same. New figures showed between 2015 and 2016, the average growth of commercial investment in the Obama administration was 0.7 per cent. In the meantime, between 2017 and 2018 (2019), the Trump Administration recorded growth of approximately 5.5 per cent. This is not far from the original numbers, although it is not as strong. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 On January 20, 2020, the full picture did not begin the Obama term in 2015. In the eight full years of Obama &apos; s administration, the growth rate of business investment was about 3.7 per cent. When the term Trump reached the last number, overall growth was about 4.9 percent. Therefore, given the entire Obama term, the figures are more comparable. What about the beginning of Obama's term? How do you compare to the beginning of Trump's period? In the first two years of Obama plus an additional quarter -- the period that Johnson mentioned -- the rate of commercial investment actually fell by 0.3 per cent. This was the period immediately following the Great Depression. This confirms the volatility of numbers -- and how the time frame you choose can make a big difference. Other measures, other factors there are other ways to study business growth - and another part of the claim for consideration: Johnson asserts that growth was due to public employment policies. Tara Sinclair, Professor of Economics at George Washington University, said that average growth rates for business investment seemed stronger in recent years, but when measured as a proportion of GDP, the picture was very similar in both departments. Why? The gross domestic product (GDP) of the State - a traditional measure of the size of the economy - has grown over time. \"The share of GDP goes to \"fixed, non-residential private investment\" less than the peak seen in the 1980s and 2000s,\" said Sinclair in an e-mail to Poletti Fact and Wisconsin. Sinclair said policies that reduce regulations may have helped promote commercial investment under Trump's administration, but it is difficult to blame or credit a presidential administration for most of the economic results. Indeed, as we have repeatedly noted in fact, experts say it is wrong to attribute too much to individuals or certain policy changes. There are simply too many factors in the economy that cannot be reduced to one. \"As you can see from the data, quarterly growth rates are very volatile, so more data to determine a clear direction would be useful,\" said Sinclair. Our assessment, Johnson, says: \"Republic policies have led to business investment 10 times faster than we saw under President Obama.\" This language may allow the reader to think about comparing Obama's entire duration. Joensen, though, said he was only comparing the first two years of Trump to the last two years of Obama. This article has been treated with truth. But this element is undermined by the broader picture: when you look at all Obama State measures and other measures, such as the share of GDP, the picture is much closer to even the two. In addition, Johnson outstrips the cause of recent growth in public policies, when there are many other factors in employment. Our definition is often wrong: \"A statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.\" That fits me right here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00080"}
