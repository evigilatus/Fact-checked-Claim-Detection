It\u2019s the single biggest expense in the state budget (This year alone, the cost of k-12 education is $7.9 billion, or 43.4 percent of the state\u2019s $18.3 billion budget). And it\u2019s one of the biggest issues in this year\u2019s closely watched governor\u2019s race.\nOn Aug. 12, Republicans issued a statement attacking Jason Carter, the Democratic state senator who is hoping to wrestle the job of governor from Republican Nathan Deal.\nSonny Perdue, Deal\u2019s predecessor, in 2003 became Georgia\u2019s first Republican governor since Reconstruction. The GOP now controls the Georgia House, Senate and all major statewide offices. Democrats see Carter, a two-term state senator from the Decatur area and former President Jimmy Carter\u2019s grandson, as their best chance for regaining a foothold.\n\"How can Carter criticize Gov. Deal for 'underfunding' education when he backed three of (Deal\u2019s) budgets?\" John Padgett, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, said in the press release.\nThe release goes on to accuse Carter, 39, of playing politics -- voting for Deal\u2019s first three state budgets, but against Deal\u2019s last budget after announcing as a candidate for governor. All four budgets included major, so-called austerity cuts to education.\n\"He (Carter) thinks that with enough rhetoric he can hide the fact that he cares more about advancing his own career than improving the education system in Georgia,\" Padgett said in the statement.\nThe party chair is parroting a claim that Deal\u2019s campaign has been making. PolitiFact decided it was time to fact-check Carter\u2019s voting record on the state budgets.\nCarter has voiced concerns about the state\u2019s commitment to public education during most of his short Senate career. His criticism, specifically of Deal on education, has sharpened in recent months, with his campaign manager at one point calling Deal Georgia\u2019s worst education governor. (See PolitiFact\u2019s Pants On Fire ruling of that claim.)\nFor our current fact check, we started at the General Assembly website, where the votes of lawmakers on all bills -- including state budgets -- are public.\nWe confirmed that Carter voted \"Yes\" with the majority in the Senate for Deal\u2019s fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014 budgets. Austerity cuts to education in each of those budgets exceeded $1 billion.\nIn this year\u2019s General Assembly session, only four out of 56 state senators voted against the 2015 budget. Gubernatorial candidate Carter cast one of those \"No\" votes.\nAusterity cuts were part of the 2015 budget. But at $747 million, they were the smallest since 2009 and, as such, viewed as largely positive by leaders in education.\n---------------------------------------------------\nAusterity Cuts to K-12 education 2011-2015\n2011 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $1,089,521,696\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2012 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $1,147,859,436\n2013 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $1,143,762,797\n2014 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 $1,061,127,407\n2015\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $746,769,852\nTotal 2003-2015 $8,436,724,814\nSource: Allotment sheets, Georgia Department of Education\nSince 2003, governors and lawmakers haven\u2019t fully funded schools based on the state\u2019s education funding formula. These austerity cuts have totaled $8.4 billion, according to reports filed with the Georgia Department of Education. In combination with plummeting property tax collections -- fallout from the national housing market collapse -- the austerity cuts have thrown many of the state\u2019s 180 school systems into a tailspin. As a result, there have been staff reductions, unpaid furlough days, larger class sizes and, in many cases, shorter school years.\nCarter has explained his decision to vote this year against Deal\u2019s budget.\nAt one of his back-to-back school tours last week, the Democrat said the 2015 funding boost was election-year politicking to mask the governor\u2019s \"dismantling\" of public education.\n\"The governor on average has underfunded our schools by $1 billion each year, and the claim that they have done enough is just not true,\" Carter said. \"The $750 million shortfall into the education fund this year is not something I support.\"\nHe would not comment about his three prior votes for Deal\u2019s budget when contacted by PolitiFact.\nIn an email, Bryan Thomas, Carter\u2019s spokesman, reiterated many of the candidate\u2019s past criticisms of Deal\u2019s handling of k-12 education, as well as the popular HOPE scholarship program.\n\"Governor Deal has shortchanged our schools by an average of $1 billion a year since taking office,\" Thomas said. \"He likes to brag about his election-year budget, but he still missed the mark by more than $750 million.\"\nIn November, Thomas said, voters can choose \"between a governor who only seems to care about schools in an election year, or Jason, whose commitment to our schools has never wavered.\"\n(State education funding has increased during Deal's tenure, in part due to enrollment growth. Budget reports show K-12 spending has increased from $7.067 billion when he took office to $7.94 billion this year.)\nCarter, who was member of a special Senate task force on education in 2012, has said, if elected governor, he would push to create a separate education budget that would be tantamount to an untouchable trust fund for schools.\nIn summary, John Padgett, GOP state chairman, was correct. Jason Carter voted in favor of three of Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s state budgets that each included $1 billion-plus in austerity cuts to education. Carter voted this year against a fourth, annual state budget proposed by Deal that included about $747 million in austerity cuts to K-12 education, the smallest cut since 2009.\nWe rate Padgett\u2019s statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07424"}
