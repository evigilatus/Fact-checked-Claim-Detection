Thurmond is a state assemblyman who represents Richmond, Berkeley and other East Bay communities and is supported by teacher unions. Tuck is a former education executive backed by charter school groups. The incumbent, Tom Torlakson, will be termed out in January after serving two four-year terms.\nSeveral recent attack ads by each side, funded by tens of millions of campaign contributions, have turned the typically under-the-radar race into a hotly-contested one.\nWe wanted to know whether there was evidence to support the claim Thurmond was \"sued by the ACLU.\"\nOur research\nBefore he was elected to the state Legislature, Thurmond was a board member for the West Contra Costa Unified School District, based in Richmond, from 2008 to 2012.\nThe TV attack ad and its claim about the lawsuit refer to this period of Thurmond\u2019s career. Here\u2019s the full version of the ad:\n\"Before he was running for State Superintendent, politician Tony Thurmond was responsible for a school district with widespread budget problems. Ranked last in the state for failing to serve students of color. Sued for leaving at-risk students in rotting trailers with mushrooms growing in the floors. Reprimanded by the Obama Administration for failing to address widespread sexual harassment and assault in district schools. Tony Thurmond failed the students he was supposed to help. California deserves better.\"Marshall Tuck-supporting PAC ad targeting Tony Thurmond, 2018 from EdSource on Vimeo.\nThe ad was produced by Students, Parents and Teachers supporting Marshall Tuck, an independent expenditure group created by EdVoice, a nonprofit that supports charter schools.\nDuring the voiceover, the ad uses large text that reads: \"TONY THURMOND: Sued by the ACLU\" to relay this claim, blurring the line between Thurmond and the school district.\nThe campaign mailer is even less subtle, using bold block letters reading: ACLU. WHY DID THE ACLU FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST TONY THURMOND?\nWe agreed with analysis from EdSource, a nonprofit education news group, on this misleading nature of this claim:\n\"The ad\u2019s statement that Thurmond was sued over school facilities is technically accurate, in that he was named as a defendant board member in an American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s lawsuit against West Contra Costa Unified. However, the lawsuit named every member of the school board, along with the district, its superintendent and its associate superintendent. The district\u2019s daily management falls to its administration, not the elected board members.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingling out Thurmond for the problems cited in the June 2012 lawsuit gives the wrong impression. He served on the board during the period cited in the suit, but was not directly responsible for the conditions.\nAbdi Soltani, executive director of the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, wrote in a letter to EdVoice that the foundation, not the national ACLU, filed the lawsuit. Soltani added that the foundation had nothing to do with the campaign mailer and doesn\u2019t endorse candidates.\nA spokeswoman for EdVoice pointed us to a website created by the independent expenditure group backing Tuck. It repeats the same claims as the TV ad and includes a link to the lawsuit. But it doesn\u2019t connect Thurmond directly to any of the unsafe conditions.\nWhen we asked Thurmond\u2019s campaign about the TV spot and mailer, it pointed to groups and individuals from the NAACP to U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris and San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who have all called out the claims.\nIn a related fact check, we rated False the claim Thurmond was \"reprimanded\" by the Obama administration\nOur ruling \nA recent TV spot and campaign mailer by a group supporting Marshall Tuck claimed Tony Thurmond was \"sued by the ACLU.\"\nIn reality, ACLU Foundation of Northern California filed a lawsuit in 2012 against the West Contra Costa Unified School District over unsafe school conditions. All five members of the district\u2019s board, including Thurmond, were named in the lawsuit, along with the district\u2019s administrators.\nThe lawsuit, however, doesn\u2019t directly tie Thurmond to any of the school conditions, which are managed daily by administrators, not board members.\nBy focusing on Thurmond only, the campaign mailer and the text of the TV ad distort the facts, giving the wrong impression he was the sole target of the lawsuit and uniquely responsible. That\u2019s simply not the case. \u00a0\nWe rated the claim False.\n\nFALSE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2018-11-05 21:05:25 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says Tony Thurmond was \"sued by the ACLU\" for leaving students in unsafe conditions.
