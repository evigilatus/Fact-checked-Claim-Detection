Trump also said that text messages, between former agent Peter Struzk and office attorney Lisa Paige, would have revealed the probe of private lawyer Robert Mueller as a trick, had they not been \"intentionally and unlawfully deleted.\" Here's Trump tweet: \"The greatest anger that still exists in a long, volatile and very conflicting period, is the fact that 19,000 text messages required between Peter Struzk and his FBI girlfriend, Lisa Paige, have been deliberately and illegally deleted. He would have explained all the Hawks, who are now under protest!\" The greatest anger so far in a long time, so volatile and so conflicting, Muller chasing the witch is the fact that 19,000 requests for text messages between Peter Struzk and his FBI boyfriend, Lisa Paige, were deliberately and illegally deleted. We found that there were some major factual problems in Trump's claim. First, a new report by the Internal Comptroller of the Ministry of Justice indicates that approximately 19,000 letters infiltrated through cracks due to technical errors with the FBI's tool for collecting data on Samsung's devices, not because Straussock and Paige went around the system. Second, perhaps more importantly, while the letters were not initially picked up, they have since been retrieved. The Tramp claim gives the wrong impression that the texts are still missing. Indeed, at least part of the recovered texts was submitted to Congress and described in press reports. The Inspector General &apos; s Office of the Ministry of Justice has published some letters between Struzok and a page in a report issued in June 2018. The Inspector General was unable to retrieve the Strzok and Page text messages that might have been sent using the iphones given to them when they joined the Muller team. However, a private consultant reviewed the iPhone Struzk device before reset it and found that it did not contain essential messages. There's no evidence that text messages show that a private lawyer's investigation is \"awe.\" We contacted the White House for comment, but we did not hear about the Inspector General &apos; s search for missing texts following the 2016 elections, and the Internal Comptroller of the Ministry of Justice considered whether the FBI had followed the protocol when it investigated the use of a private e-mail server by Hillary Clinton while serving as Secretary of State. The results were published in a report issued in June 2018. As part of its investigation, the Inspector General &apos; s Office compiled texts between Struzok and Paige, some of which showed hostility towards Tramp and preference for Clinton. Strazok was later kicked out of the FBI and Paige has since left. The Inspector General discovered a five-month gap in the Starzuk-Bag communications, from mid-December 2016 to mid-May 2017. This prompted the Inspector General to submit a follow-up report to update his findings in June 2018. The follow-up report, which provided a further description of the Inspector General &apos; s forensic efforts to recover lost texts from Strzok-Page, was issued on 13 December. Were the messages deliberately erased? The Inspector General found no evidence that Struzok and Paige tried to stop the FBI from collecting their messages. The observer &apos; s findings suggest that the most likely reason for not picking up texts relates to technical flaws in the FBI data collection process, not a deliberate error. The study concluded: \"I decided that the FBI collection tool was not just a failure to collect any data on certain phones during certain periods of time, nor did it appear to have collected all the text messages even when they were generally working to collect text messages.\" According to the Inspector General &apos; s report, the FBI tech specialists mentioned a number of possible explanations for the disruption of text collection, from software malfunction in 2016, to poor speculation during telephone preparation to a range of possible machine errors. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for open security, and told her that we were \"not working for you.\" By Samsung Butterman, on January 17, 2021, the collection failure rate was estimated at 20% when it was used with the FBI's Samsung S5 mobile devices. Both Struzok and Paige used the S5 model during the five-month period found in the report. Only later in mid-2017 were S7 models issued \"as part of a regular technical update and case handling with the FBI text-gathering tool,\" according to the Inspector General. An outside expert hired by the Inspector General to assist in the Samsung section of the investigation concluded that \"Struzok and Paige were unlikely to attempt to circumvent the FBI's ability to collect text messages,\" and the observation dog found no evidence of this. The Inspector General also found that \"the content of the text messages does not appear to be a factor\" in the practice of keeping Struzk and a page. Apart from the Samsung device, the Apple IPhones was released when they began serving as members of the Special Counsel &apos; s investigation. By the time the Inspector General obtained Apple &apos; s telephones, they had been reset in the plant &apos; s preparations so that they could be reassigned, and did not include any data regarding the use of the previous owner, as mentioned in the report. The Inspector General &apos; s Special Advocate &apos; s Records Officer said that she had reviewed the iPhone of the Ministry of Justice at Strauzok after returning it to the Special Counsel \"and decided that it did not contain substantive text messages.\" (After leaving the FBI, Paige left her iPhone in her office, instead of returning it to the private lawyer's records officer.) It appears that approximately 19,000 letters retrieved Trump's tweet indicate that Starzuk-Bagg's letters have disappeared forever - and that is why Trump regrets that they \"were\" going to exonerate him. However, this overlooks the fact that the Inspector General was able to recover thousands of messages that were initially not collected because of the technical uncertainty described above. \"OIG Digital Forensics used forensic tools to recover thousands of text messages\" from Samsung S5 devices from Strzok and a page, the report indicates. Forensic experts recovered more than 9,300 letters sent or received from Stzok S5, of which approximately 8,300 were sent to or from a page. They also collected 10,760 messages from the S5 device on the page, about 9,700 of which were contacts with Struzok. It is impossible to determine precisely the number of unique texts recovered. This is because some duplicates are identical, and because the Inspector General arrested some fragments of messages that had no date or associated time, and were not included in the Inspector General &apos; s account. They also retrieved texts from a separate database that added marginally to the total number of texts recovered by the Inspector General. The Trump reference to 19,000 texts appears to be the result of the addition of the total text from the Struzok and Paige S5 phones together. But his suggestion of permanent loss of messages is a mistake. The IGO recovered a total of more than 126,000 lines of text from Struzk and a page. At least part of the recovered texts were given to Congress and described in press reports. Some of the letters between Struzok and Paige were published in the Inspector General &apos; s June 2018 report on the FBI &apos; s handling of the Clinton e-mail investigation. Our referee Trump said that 19,000 text messages were exchanged between former FBI officials that were deliberately and illegally deleted... The report of the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice indicates that the texts slipped through the cracks because of technical flaws in the FBI data collection tool, not because they were deliberately deleted by Struzok and Paige. An outside expert hired by the Inspector General concluded that it is unlikely that Struzok and Paige tried to circumvent the FBI's ability to collect text messages. Trump &apos; s suggestion that messages are permanently lost is wrong. OIG has recovered more than 19,000 letters from the Government's Samsung telephones from Struzok and a page, totalling more than 126,000 lines of text. Finally, there is no evidence that the texts show that the Special Adviser's investigation is, as Trump called it, \"awe.\" We're assessing this pants claim on fire.
