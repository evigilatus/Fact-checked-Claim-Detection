When he returned to the United States, he wrote about the trip in Look magazine. The article was titled, \"Suppose God Is Black.\" He wrote:\n\"During five days this summer, my wife Ethel and I visited South Africa, talking to all kinds of people representing all viewpoints. Wherever we went \u2014 Pretoria, Cape Town, Durban, Stellenbosch, Johannesburg \u2014 apartheid was at the heart of the discussion and debate.\n\"Our aim was not simply to criticize but to engage in a dialogue to see if, together, we could elevate reason about prejudice and myth. At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve.\n\"\u2018But suppose God is black,\u2019 I replied. \u2018What if we go to heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and hs is not white?
