Here\u2019s the cost breakdown, according to the meme posted on Facebook Dec. 9:\n\"Cost of Mueller\u2019s investigation: $3,200,000\nBenghazi \u2018investigation\u2019: $7,000,000\nTrump\u2019s golfing trips: $83,000,000\nNew debt from Republican tax bill: $1,500,000,000,000\"\nThe meme adds: \"Dear Republicans, please spare us your selective outrage about the cost of the Trump-Russia investigation.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe meme includes accurate information, but leaves out critical facts and details.\nMueller\u2019s investigation, $3.2 million?\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 elections and whether Trump\u2019s campaign supported those efforts. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia.\nIt\u2019s unclear when the meme began circulating, but it was shared on Facebook as recently as Dec. 9, 2018.\nThe investigation\u2019s first spending report came in December 2017 and showed that from May 2017 through the end of September 2017, Mueller\u2019s office incurred $3.2 million in direct spending, and $3.5 million in indirect spending, totaling $6.7 million.\nIf the meme relied only on that report, then it omitted from its tally indirect spending costs. Also, the spending didn\u2019t stop there.\nMueller\u2019s office released additional spending reports in May 2018 and again in December 2018.\nThe latest information released Dec. 14 shows that since the investigation started in May 2017 through Sept. 30, 2018, direct spending reached $12.3 million and indirect spending $12.9 million, totaling $25.2 million.\nThat\u2019s notably higher than the $3.2 million claimed by the meme.\nBenghazi investigation, $7 million?\nLawmakers in May 2014 began investigating the 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLed mostly by Republicans, critics saw the congressional investigations as a political move against Hillary Clinton, who served as secretary of state when the attack happened. The investigations concluded in 2016, costing about $7 million. The investigations did not suggest that Clinton was personally responsible for or could have prevented the attack.\nThis claim in the meme is more in line with the facts than the claim about the Mueller probe.\nTrump\u2019s golfing trips, $83 million?\nTrump routinely criticized his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the time he spent golfing. Trump as president has been a regular on the golf course, and that has motivated observers to track his trips to the golf course. (We have our own Trump golf tracker.)\nThe meme\u2019s source for $83 million is unclear. But Sophie Germain, self-described as a data junkie, runs the website trumpgolfcount.com, which updates its tally after Trump visits \"a location whose primary offering is golf (i.e., a \u2018golf club\u2019).\" The site relies on White House press pool reports.\nAccording to trumpgolfcount.com, Trump has made 154 daytime visits to golf clubs since his inauguration, \"with evidence of playing golf on at least 70 visits,\" and that has cost taxpayers $84 million. (The site\u2019s last recorded outing was Nov. 25, 2018.)\nIt says its cost estimates are based on:\n\u2022 Flights to Trump properties;\n\u2022 Coast Guard protection for Mar-a-Lago (a Trump property in Florida);\n\u2022 Trump's stay at his club and rental of luxury vehicles in Turnberry, Scotland, in July 2018; and\n\u2022 \"An additional $6.4 million per year, prorated per day at a rate based on money reimbursed so far, allocated to Palm Beach and Bedminster for \u2018extraordinary law enforcement personnel costs\u2019.\"\nWhile the site has been cited by multiple outlets, our fact-checking friends at the Washington Post found that some of its estimates, particularly the cost of Air Force One flights, may be too high. The Washington Post Fact Checker also questioned whether it\u2019s fair to attribute all costs of presidential travel and support to a golf outing, since that logistical support follows the president wherever he goes.\nThe Washington Post\u2019s July 2018 fact-check also cautioned against the site\u2019s then-use of a precise dollar figure for the cost of Trump\u2019s golf outings, since it\u2019s not known exactly how many times Trump has golfed or the precise costs.\nTrumpgolfcount.com addressed the fact-check on its website, saying: \"At the time his article was published, our cost estimate was $72,251,706, but (Washington Post\u2019s Glenn) Kessler correctly pointed out that since our estimates have a great deal of uncertainty, they shouldn't be stated to the exact dollar. We've updated our site accordingly, and our total cost is now rounded to the nearest million.\"\nThe meme suggests that it\u2019s known how much Trump\u2019s golfing trips cost, but that figure is uncertain.\nNew debt from Republican tax bill, $1.5 trillion?\nPresident Donald Trump in December 2017 signed into law a new tax bill that included significant tax cuts for corporations as well as temporary tax cuts for individuals.\nThe changes in the tax law are projected to increase the federal deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The deficit is the difference between annual government spending and government revenue. Debt is the total amount the government owes.\nWe rated as False a claim by Larry Kudlow, top economic adviser to President Donald Trump, that \"the entire $1.5 trillion tax cut is virtually paid for by higher revenues and better nominal GDP.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook meme says, \"Cost of Mueller\u2019s investigation: $3,200,000; Benghazi \"investigation\": $7,000,000; Trump\u2019s golfing trips: $83,000,000; New debt from Republican tax bill: $1,500,000,000,000.\"\nThe meme includes a mix of information that\u2019s accurate with information that is incomplete and questionable.\nOn balance, we rate the claim Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-12-19 18:27:56 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Says \"Cost of Mueller\u2019s investigation: $3,200,00; Benghazi \"investigation\": $7,000,000; Trump\u2019s golfing trips: $83,000,000; New debt from Republican tax bill: $1,500,000,000,000.\"    Bloggers Bloggers    in a Facebook post Sunday, December 9, 2018 2018-12-09    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01177"}
