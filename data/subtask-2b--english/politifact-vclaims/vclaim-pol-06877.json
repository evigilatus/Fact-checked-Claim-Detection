The website NaHaDaily responded by posting a story that claimed Fox News had botched the photo that accompanied its coverage of Scott\u2019s death.\n\"Stuart Scott succumbed to cancer at the age of 49 and Fox News television ran a tribute today in his memory, but instead released a picture of ESPN\u2019s Stephen A. Smith,\" NaHaDaily wrote.\nBoth men are African-American.\nThe item included what appears to be a Fox News Facebook page comment, \"You know all famous black people look-a-like. No harm, no foul.\"\nThis hoax image appears on the NaHaDaily Facebook page:\n\nThere is no truth to the NaHaDaily article. Fox News discussed Scott\u2019s passing on air, which included many videos of Scott (and none of Smith).
