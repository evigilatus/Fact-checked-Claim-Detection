A local NBC affiliate reported that the protests began peacefully but were broken up by police as they became destructive.\u00a0\nTwenty-eight windows were broken, five lamp poles were damaged, and American flags were burned by demonstrators, according to Newsweek.\u00a0\n\"One protester was able to gain access to the Statehouse through a broken window to an office,\" Newsweek quotes Ohio State Highway Patrol Lt. Craig Cvetan as saying. \"However, the protester fled back out the window before troopers could apprehend him from the interior.
