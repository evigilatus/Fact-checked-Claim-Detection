The tradition was broken in 2013 by Ken Cuccinelli, a Republican who lost the gubernatorial \u00a0election that year to Democrat Terry McAuliffe. Cuccinelli was criticized by many Democrats and editorial writers for remaining attorney general throughout the campaign.\nHerring was on the Democratic ticket in 2013, making his first of two successful runs for attorney general. Gilbert says Herring made a \"pledge\" then to resign as the state\u2019s chief lawyer should he run for governor. Gilbert points to the following paragraph in a Sept. 30, 2013 article in The Virginian-Pilot:\n\"In line with his pledge to take politics out of the office, Herring has said he would resign as attorney general if he decided to run for governor. Cuccinelli has weathered criticism for staying in office as he campaigns for governor, bucking a pattern set by several of his predecessors.\"\nGilbert said, \"If Herring is serious about his announced plan to run for governor, he must immediately make good on his pledge to resign his office.\"\nMichael Kelly, a spokesman for Herring, said the attorney general \"will not be resigning anytime soon.\" Is this tantamount to Herring reversing his position on resigning, as Gilbert says? We put the matter to the Flip-O-Meter, which gauges whether politicians have been consistent on issues.\nTiming is pivotal\nElection Day for the next governor in Nov. 2, 2021 - almost three years ahead.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNine attorneys general have resigned\u00a0to run for governor over the last seven decades, and they all waited to the election year to step down. Here are their names, political party, and the month and year they left their posts:\n\n\u2022Lindsay Almond Jr., D, \u00a0August 1957;\n\u2022Albertis Harrison, D, April 1961;\n\u2022Andrew Miller, D, January 1977;\n\u2022Gerald Baliles, D, January 1985;\n\u2022Mary Sue Terry, D, January 1993;\n\u2022Jim Gilmore, R, June 1997;\n\u2022Mark Earley, R, June 2001;\n\u2022Jerry Kilgore, R, February 2001; and\n\u2022Bob McDonnell, R, February 2009.\n\nThere\u2019s no precedent for an attorney general seeking a promotion in state government to resign three years before the next gubernatorial election - as Gilbert demands - or even one year out. It\u2019s a stretch to assume that Herring implied groundbreaking action when he promised that he, too, would step down.\nKelly, Herring\u2019s spokesperson, dismisses Gilbert\u2019s statement as \"manufactured outrage.\" Kelly noted\u00a0the Pilot's article ran about a month before the 2013 general election and, at that time, Cuccinelli stayed as attorney general despite \"campaigning full time for governor for many, many months.\"\nKelly added that \"Herring has told folks what he intends to do in a few in a few years, but ain\u2019t exactly \u2018running a campaign\u2019 at the moment, so the situations are very different.\"\nOur ruling\nIn 2013, Herring said he would resign as attorney general if he decided to run for governor. Now that he has acknowledged his intention to run for governor in 2021, Gilbert is calling on Herring to honor his pledge and immediately step down as attorney general. Herring will not.\nWe don\u2019t find this hypocritical. The next gubernatorial election is almost three years away. The nine attorneys general who have resigned to run for governor since 1957 all waited to the election year to do so. There\u2019s no reason to believe that Herring, who did not specify when he would resign, was promising anything different. Herring \"has told folks what he intends to do in a few years,\" his spokesman says.\nHerring has been consistent. We rate this \"No Flip.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01186"}
