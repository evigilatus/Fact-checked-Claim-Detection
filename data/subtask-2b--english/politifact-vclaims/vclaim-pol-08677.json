Let\u2019s look at how the Republican arrived at that number.\nCuccinelli says the McAuliffe\u2019s pledges add up to $14 billion in new spending over the next four years. About $12 billion of that sum stems from statements McAuliffe has made on three issues: public school funding, college debt and public teacher pay.\nOn K-12 education, Cuccinelli points to a section on page 11 of McAuliffe\u2019s platform where the Democrat laments cuts to school funding that the state made during the Great Recession and has not fully restored.\n\"It\u2019s time to restore those standards and make sure our schools have the tools they need to get the job done,\" McAuliffe\u2019s platform says.\nCuccinelli interprets that statement as a McAuliffe pledge to fully restore education money at the start of his administration. The Republican cites research by The Commonwealth Institute, a liberal think tank, which found that in inflation-adjusted numbers, the per-pupil general fund spending for K-12 students was about $5,000 during the 2007-08 school year \u00a0fiscal year, but only about $4,000 this school year.\nWith enrollment data from the Virginia Department of Education showing about 1.2 million K-12 students in 2012-13, Cuccinelli estimates that restoring per-pupil funding to 2007 levels would cost more than $1.2 billion annually, or $5 billion over a four-year McAuliffe term.\nThe second biggest expense, Cuccinelli says, would come from what he interprets to be McAuliffe\u2019s position on college debts assumed by Virginia undergraduates.\nPage 12 of McAuliffe\u2019s platform says, \"Every student deserves the opportunity to get a quality education and start their working lives without the burden of debt.\" Cuccinelli says that means McAuliffe is vowing to clear all Virginia students\u2019 debts.\nUsing figures from the Institute for College Access, which estimated that 2011 college graduates receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in Virginia had an average debt of $14,628, Cuccinelli estimated it would cost $667 million to pay off the loans of the entire class. Once rising enrollments and debt loads are taken into account, \u00a0Cuccinelli says the total cost of this policy would be nearly $3.9 billion over the next four years.\nCuccinelli also says McAuliffe has vowed to raise teacher pay in Virginia to the national average. He points to a May 25 speech in Manassas in which McAuliffe said, \"as governor, I want to make sure that we pay our teachers the national average in order for us to get the best possible teachers.\"\nCuccinelli took figures from the National Education Association showing there are 103,908 teachers in Virginia. During the 2011-2012 school year, Virginia instructors earned an average of $48,703. That was $6,715 below the national average of $55,418. Cuccinelli estimates it would cost about $700 million a year -- or $2.8 billion over four years -- to end the disparity.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo compute the tax cost per family, Anna Nix, a Cuccinelli spokeswoman, says the campaign divided its estimated four-year, $14 billion cost of McAuliffe\u2019s full agenda by four, which comes to $3.5 billion annually. Cuccinelli\u2019s camp divided that yearly cost by the state\u2019s population of 8.2 million and arrived at an estimate of $427 per person. So an average \u00a0four-person family would pay slightly more than $1,700, Nix reasons.\nJosh Schwerin, a McAuliffe spokesman, dismisses Cuccinelli\u2019s calculations, saying his campaign \"is just making up numbers.\"\n\"Terry has no plans to raise taxes,\" Schwerin said in an e-mail.\nHe also denied that McAuliffe has made any of the three major promises Cuccinelli attributes to him. He said that McAuliffe\u2019s comments on restoring public school funding, raising teacher salaries to the national average and easing college students\u2019 debts merely reflect his boss\u2019s \"spending priorities.\"\n\"It would be irresponsible to say how much you\u2019re going to spend before knowing how much revenue there will be,\" Schwerin wrote.\nCuccinelli\u2019s $1,700-a-year tax estimate assumes McAuliffe will accomplish all of his policy ambitions during his first months in office without reducing any governmental expenses.\nMcAuliffe has pledged to \"save millions of taxpayers dollars through operational efficiencies,\" but his plan is not greatly detailed. He\u2019s broadly called for reducing government energy costs, cutting state employee travel expenditures and streamlining agencies.\nCuccinelli\u2019s estimate assumes there will be no increase in state revenues during a McAuliffe governorship, ignoring that general fund tax receipts have risen by an annual average of 3.7 percent over the last three years.\nIt also assumes McAuliffe will fail to convince the General Assembly to expand Virginia\u2019s Medicaid program to reap federal dollars available under Obamacare. There may be good reason for Cuccinelli\u2019s hunch: the Republican-led House is staunchly opposed to the enlargement. McAuliffe says the expansion could produce $500 million a year in new revenues and savings, but some predict analysts predict the annual yield may only be $50 million.\nCuccinelli\u2019s tax estimate also ignores some standard practices in state budgeting. For example, it assumes that the state would pay the entire cost of raising average teacher salaries to the national average. Virginia traditionally shares the cost of increasing teachers\u2019 pay with localities.\nOur ruling\nCuccinelli says McAuliffe wants to raise taxes by $1,700 annually for an average four-person family to pay for his \"promises.\"\nThe major problem is that Cuccinelli\u2019s claim is based on his own interpretation of McAuliffe\u2019s agenda. He assumes, for example, that McAuliffe\u2019s statement that college graduates \"deserve the opportunity\" to start their careers without the burden of student debts is a promise that the state will pay off their loans, starting his first year in office. He assumes McAuliffe\u2019s statement that \"it\u2019s time\" to restore per-pupil funding in public schools to pre-recession levels is a vow to do that instantly.\nThen, Cuccinelli takes his assumptions and multiplies them by a stew of worst-case scenarios to come up with his unreliable tax estimate.\nWe don\u2019t fault Cuccinelli for demanding specifics on McAuliffe\u2019s agenda; the Democrat has addressed issues with a broad brush throughout the campaign. It\u2019s fair to ask how McAuliffe would accomplish his objectives and keep his word not to raise taxes.\nBut that doesn\u2019t give Cuccinelli the license to create a platform for his rival.
