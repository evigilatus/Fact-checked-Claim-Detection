Fox, a Northeastern University criminology professor who adjusted federal data for unsolved homicide cases believed to be linked to intimate partners.\nAnother tally, this one from a 2013 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report, shows 10,470 women killed in intimate partner homicides from 2002 to 2010. (That tally should be higher, too, because it does not account for the 3.5 months that followed Sept. 11, 2001.)\nIn summary, it\u2019s possible that some female victims were killed by female \"intimate partners,\" but we don't know for sure because the data isn't broken down that way. But because the available\u00a0data also excludes recent years, the true number is likely higher overall.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSherrod Brown\n\n\nstated on January 8, 2021 in an interview with Ohio reporters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummer \u201cprotesters outside the White House were met with tear gas, rubber bullets, a full militarized response.

Also, a few people have died in recent years due to complications from injuries and conditions related to 9/11. Bottom line: The figure is less than 3,000 if you count only \"Americans\" as Steinem said. (People from 90 different countries died in the attacks, according to the U.S. State Department.)\nAs for the wars, the U.S. Department of Defense releases a daily count of casualties involving military and government personnel from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe American death count for Operation Iraqi Freedom, which began in March 2003 and was renamed Operation New Dawn in 2010, is 4,491 deaths.\nThere have been 2,210 total American deaths in Afghanistan stemming from Operation Enduring Freedom, which started with airstrikes in Afghanistan on Oct. 7, 2001. Another 134 Americans have died in places outside of Afghanistan in work related to the operation, and three civilian Defense Department employees were also killed in this effort. That brings the total to 2,347.\nSo the total deaths from Sept. 11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is a maximum of 9,838. It\u2019s lower when we exclude non-American victims on Sept. 11.\nOur ruling\nSteinem said that more women were killed by their husbands or boyfriends since Sept. 11 than \"all the Americans who were killed by 9/11 or in Afghanistan and Iraq.\"\nYou can argue about the significance of such a comparison, but on the numbers, Steinem is accurate.\nSince Sept. 11, 2001, more women \u00a0have been killed by \"intimate partners\" -- the federal jargon for current or former spouses -- than all of the victims in Sept. 11 and the American victims in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that ensued.\nWe rate her claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07189"}
