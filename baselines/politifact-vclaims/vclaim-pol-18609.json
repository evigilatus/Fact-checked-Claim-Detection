Phil Scott came out firing when the issue of\u00a0Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman\u2019s proposed wealth tax came up during a debate Tuesday.\u00a0\nZuckerman touted his plan to raise a tax on the wealthiest 5% for revenue to build out broadband and fund climate change initiatives like home weatherization.\u00a0\nScott, who has opposed new tax increases, criticized the plan, arguing that it would impact middle class families, in addition to wealthy residents.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"That 5% starts at $159,000 per family,\" Scott said. \"So we\u2019re not talking about a grand amount of money here. Think about two teachers, married teachers. The tax proposal that I\u2019m hearing from David is that it\u2019s going to impact them.\"\u00a0\nZuckerman has said the tax would target the high-income earners who benefited from the federal tax cuts Trump instituted in 2017. Zuckerman hasn\u2019t proposed a specific rate, but his campaign says the tax would raise $100 million.\nWe\u2019re certain that not all two-teacher households are making $159,000. But setting that anecdote aside, Scott\u2019s income bracket didn\u2019t square up with what Zuckerman and other Progressive and Democratic lawmakers have been saying about the proposed wealth tax, when discussing initiatives like the Green New Deal.\nSo VTDigger decided to find out who, exactly, would be impacted by a tax on Vermont\u2019s top 5% of earners.\u00a0\nThe Evidence\nAfter the debate, Colleen Jackson, a spokesperson for Zuckerman, disputed Scott\u2019s numbers and told VTDigger the top 5% of earners start at households earning $294,000 per year. She pointed to a document from the Joint Fiscal Office to support that claim.\nJason Maulucci, Scott\u2019s campaign manager, said the governor was citing an analysis by the Vermont Department of Taxes, in response to legislation, S.311, that proposes a wealth tax. It was sponsored by Sen. Anthony Pollina, P/D-Washington, and co-sponsored by 13 other senators.\u00a0\nThe Tax Department found the top 5% starts at $159,000 in taxable income, according to its 2018 data.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n\nstated on October 1, 2018 in a speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"99 percent inequality.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Lola Duffort \u2022 October 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPollina\u2019s bill would place a 1.6% income tax surcharge on Vermonters making between $200,000 and $500,000. For people making more than $500,000, the tax rate would go up an additional 0.15%.\nThis would mean that someone making about $500,000 a year would pay about $3,000 more in state income taxes under the proposal, which would raise about $30 million annually.\nThe decision to begin the tax on people with an adjusted gross income of $200,000 and up is based on an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a non-partisan think tank.\nUsing estimates of Vermont\u2019s 2018 tax data, ITEP reported that the top 5% begins with people who are making between $215,000 and $517,790. The average income of this group, ITEP, is $294,600 \u2014\u00a0incredibly close to what the Zuckerman campaign said the top 5% begins.\nGraham Campbell, the member of the Joint Fiscal Office who summarized the ITEP report in late 2019 for Pollina, reviewed the data and said the institute\u2019s \"percentile breakdowns are likely not as exact as the Tax Department\u2019s.\"\nOur ruling\nScott said \"that 5% starts at $159,000 per family\" when referring to his opponent\u2019s proposed tax on the wealthiest Vermonters.\u00a0\nThe Department of Taxes reports that filers with $159,000 in adjusted gross income would indeed be included in Vermont\u2019s wealthiest 5%.\nWhile the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy\u2019s analysis shows that 5% would encompass people making $215,000 or more, closer to Zuckerman\u2019s projection, the Department of Taxes\u2019 data is a more accurate reflection of who the current proposal would impact.\nWe rate Scott\u2019s statement True.\u00a0\nEditor\u2019s note: The headline on this article was changed after publication to better reflect the statement being fact-checked.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18609"}
