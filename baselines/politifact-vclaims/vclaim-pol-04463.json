Still, Republican congressional candidate Claudia Tenney uses the company\u2019s history in the area to attack her Democratic opponent, Kim Myers, whose father founded the retailer.\u00a0The company grew for more than four decades in the area before relocating its headquarters to the Pittsburgh area in 1994.\n\"After all, Myers is an Albany-style liberal politician who voted repeatedly to raise taxes on the people of Broome County, but made millions off of tax savings when her family business relocated its headquarters and jobs to Pennsylvania for a more favorable tax climate.\"\nThis is Tenney\u2019s second run for the 22nd Congressional District seat. Current U.S. Rep. Richard Hanna will leave\u00a0office at the end of this term. It is Myers' first campaign for Congress.\nDid Myers vote to raise taxes in Broome County, but make millions off of tax savings when her family\u2019s company relocated?\nWho\u2019s Kim Myers?\nKim Myers is the daughter of Richard \"Dick\" Stack, who founded Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods in Binghamton in 1948. He was 18 years old at the time.\nMyers worked in the family business after college, but she left in 1987 - seven years before Dick's left Binghamton -\u00a0to start a children\u2019s clothing store. That small business no longer exists.\nShe served 18 years on the Vestal Central School District board, eight years as president. In 2014, she won election to the Broome County Legislature.\nVoting on taxes\nShe has voted on one county budget since her election to the legislature. In November 2015, Myers voted for a budget with a 1.88 percent tax levy increase. That was lower than the 2.21 percent increase Broome County Executive Debbie Preston proposed.\nShe also voted to raise property taxes when she served on the Vestal School Board. That only affected residents in the school district, not Broome County overall.\nIn New York State, it\u2019s not unusual for school districts to increase taxes. The Vestal Central School District\u2019s board one year approved\u00a0an increase of less than 1 percent. Another year it approved a 3.9 percent increase.\u00a0The tax levy decreased by 1 percent for the 2009 - 2010 school year.\nMoving to Pennsylvania\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Schmitt\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a news conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jill Terreri Ramos \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven years before Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods moved its headquarters to Pennsylvania, Myers had left her direct role in the company to start her own business.\nTenney claims that Dick\u2019s saved enough money on taxes from the move for Myers to make millions. Tenney\u2019s campaign could not provide us with any evidence to support that claim. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods did not reply to our questions about its move from Binghamton to the Pittsburgh area.\nBroome County Historian Gerald Smith found a print article in Binghamton\u2019s newspaper, The Press & Sun Bulletin from 1994. No mention was made of tax savings in the article. Instead, the article cited the new location's proximity to Pittsburgh International Airport.\u00a0An article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also cited the airport.\nA copy of the International Directory of Company Histories says Dick\u2019s chose Pittsburgh \"because of its access to airports and its national sports teams and as an area of extensive growth for the company, with a local population of outdoor enthusiasts.\" Tax incentives were not mentioned.\nThe state would not give us a list of financial incentives given to the company. In our search, the first mention of incentives comes four years later, when\u00a0Dick\u2019s had considered moving out of the Pittsburgh area. Dick's was given a $1 million loan from Allegheny County, a $350,000 grant from the state\u00a0and local school tax abatements for five years on a sliding scale.\nOur analysis of historical data from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance and the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue reveals the corporate tax rate in the early 1990s was \u00a0higher in Pennsylvania than New York. The personal income tax rate in Pennsylvania was less than half of New York State\u2019s rate, but at that point Myers was not directly involved in Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.\nFamily company stock\nMyers did not own shares in Dick's Sporting Goods until the company went public in 2002, almost a decade after it relocated to Pennsylvania.\nA financial disclosure form\u00a0Myers filed on May 29 with the House of Representatives\u00a0shows she received between\u00a0$100,000 and $1 million in dividends in 2016 from her share in the company, the same as in 2015. The form allows candidates to report their assets and income\u00a0in ranges, not exact amounts.\nOur ruling\nClaudia Tenney said in July that Kim Myers voted \"to raise taxes on the people of Broome County, but made millions off of tax savings when her family business relocated its headquarters and jobs to Pennsylvania.\"\nIn her only budget vote since joining the Broome County Legislature, she supported a spending plan that raised the\u00a0tax levy by under 2 percent. She also voted to increase property taxes while president of the Vestal School Board.\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods relocated its headquarters to Pennsylvania 20 years before Myers\u2019 election to the Broome County Legislature. We could not find any information to support Tenney\u2019s claim that the company saved millions in taxes by moving to Pennsylvania.\nWe rate this claim as Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b6815b53-19e1-4b4c-88dd-5bd51c4d7346", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04463"}
