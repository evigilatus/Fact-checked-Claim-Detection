During the discussion of the draft law on 1 April, Reich raised the labour market in her region, pointing to low unemployment. Reich said: \"We have an unemployment rate of 1.5 in Bonn County, and we cannot find enough workers.\" \"This is [Bill will allow employers to hire criminals if they want to.\" We decided to see whether these unemployment figures would hold. When asked where she had obtained her data, Rishes explained that she was referring to a figure measuring the unemployment rate in Colombia, the metropolitan area Mo, which consisted of the province of Bonn, during October 2017, citing an article on Colombia Tribune. Rich &apos; s allegations correspond to the preliminary statistics contained in a November 2017 news report by the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics, but more recent data show that the unemployment rate has not remained the same. The unemployment rate measures the number of unemployed, which refers to those who did not work during the measurement time, who were currently available for employment and actively seeking employment, as a percentage of the civilian labour force. According to the Office of Labour Statistics, the average monthly unemployment rate in Colombia was 2.6 per cent in February 2019. The unemployment rate varies seasonally, which means that in October the rates are usually lower than in February. In 2018, the average annual unemployment rate was 2.4 per cent. Since 2010, unemployment rates have declined in Colombia. For comparison, the unemployment rate in Colombia was 2.6 per cent in February 2018 and 3.2 per cent in February 2017. This difference between the 1.5 per cent of Reich and the annual estimate of 2018 of 2.4 per cent is the difference between \"a very narrow labour market and a very narrow labour market,\" said the Professor of Economics of the State University of Michigan Steve Woodbury in an e-mail. Is this difference statistically important? The Office of Labour Statistics does not issue credit periods for unemployment rates in urban statistical areas, but we know that these estimates are subject to sampling and other errors. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 On January 20, 2020, compared to other cities and towns in the United States, the unemployment rate in Colombia was low. When the feathers reiterated their claim for unemployment in the past, they included this in their talking points. \"This [1.5 percent] is the second lowest [unemployment rate] in the country,\" said Rich on March 28. \"We can't find enough staff. We would like to put these criminals to work. We need them to avoid going back to crime and making a better life for themselves and their families.\" Rich stated that she based her claim on the same Labour Statistics Data Office from October 2017. In February 2019, Colombia was actually associated with the 10 lowest unemployment rate. There are many possible explanations for the low unemployment rate in the Rich region. :: Bernie Andrews, Executive Director of the Regional Economic Development Corporation, an economic development organization in Colombia and the province of Bonn, notes that Colombia has a diversified business economy based on stable industries such as education, health care and insurance. In addition, both the District of Columbia and the Province of Bonn have high levels of education. The unemployment rate among persons with university education is lower than that of the ordinary civilian population. According to census data, 54.3 per cent of the 25 or more persons in Colombia have a bachelor &apos; s degree or more. For the province of Bonn, this figure is 45.9 per cent. In comparison, the national average is 30.9 per cent. Our assessment, Reich, says, \"We have an unemployment rate of 1.5 in Bonn County, and we can't find enough workers.\" The feather numbers do not reflect the latest data, but what she said is that her region still has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. We're assessing this statement half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00693"}
