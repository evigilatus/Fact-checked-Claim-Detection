But Joe Biden could give him a run for his money.\nA popular Facebook photo of the former vice president includes several purported quotes from him. The post says the statements come from times that Biden has \"attacked voters\" during Democratic primary elections.\n\"There is something seriously wrong with Joe Biden. He is unfit for office,\" reads the caption from conservative Facebook page Robertson Family Values.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nAfter winning big on Super Tuesday and in several state primaries March 10, Biden has emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. He has a history of verbal gaffes on the campaign trail, so we wanted to look at each statement in the Facebook post to see if it\u2019s accurate.\nWhile some quotes need additional clarification, Biden did say most of them.\n\"\u2018Look, fat,\u2019 \u2018old,\u2019 \u2018you\u2019re a damn liar\u2019 to elderly Iowa man\"\u00a0\nThis checks out.\u00a0\nBiden said this during a campaign stop in Iowa in December. In a video depicting the event, a man confronts Biden about his son\u2019s connection to Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.\n\n\"You\u2019re selling access to the president just like he is,\" the man says in the video.\n\"You\u2019re a damn liar, man,\" Biden responds.\nLater in the exchange, Biden challenges the man to do push-ups and says \"look, fat, look, here\u2019s the deal\" while addressing him. He also refers to the man as \"Jack\" and challenges him to an IQ test.\n\"\u2018You\u2019re a lying dog-faced pony soldier\u2019 to college girl\"\nThis statement is also accurate, but it needs more context.\nBiden said it during a February campaign event in New Hampshire. In a video of the event, he responds to a woman\u2019s question about his fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How do you explain the performance in Iowa, and why should the voters believe that you can win the national election?\" she asks.\n\"That\u2019s a good question,\" Biden responds. \"No. 1: Iowa\u2019s a Democratic caucus. You ever been to a caucus?\nThe woman said yes. But Biden didn\u2019t believe her.\n\"No, you haven\u2019t. You\u2019re a lying dog-faced pony soldier,\" he said.\nIt sounds like an attack, but the audience laughed after Biden made the joke. His campaign said the line \u2014\u00a0which Biden has used before \u2014 comes from a John Wayne movie, but it\u2019s not clear that it does. (Email us if you know the source of the line.)\n\"\u2018You\u2019re full of s---,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll slap you,\u2019 to a factory worker\"\nThis quote is partially accurate.\nBiden made the statement before the March 10 Michigan primary while touring a Fiat Chrysler plant in Detroit. A video of the incident shows a man confronting Biden about his stance on gun rights.\nWATCH: \"You\u2019re full of sh*t,\" @JoeBiden tells a man who accused him of \"actively trying to end our Second Amendment right.\"\"I support the Second Amendment,\" Biden adds while vising under-construction auto plant in Detroit. @CBSNews pic.twitter.com/sueOSBaY9P\u2014 Bo Erickson CBS (@BoKnowsNews) March 10, 2020 \n\"You are actively trying to diminish our Second Amendment right and take away our guns,\" the man says.\n\"You\u2019re full of s---,\" Biden responds, cutting off a person from the campaign who was trying to stop him, saying \"shush.\" \"I support the Second Amendment.\" Biden then said he was fine with people owning firearms, but not assault weapons or weapons that shoot \"100 rounds.\"\nWhat happens next is less clear.\nSome media outlets first reported that Biden said, \"Don't tell me that, pal, or I'm going to go out and slap you in the face.\" But a closer angle of the moment seems to show Biden saying \"I'm going to go outside with you.\"\nLater, Biden says: \"Give me a break, man. Don\u2019t be such a horse\u2019s ass.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post lists three times that Biden has allegedly \"attacked voters this primary.\"\nThe assertion that Biden said \"look, fat,\" \"old\" and \"you\u2019re a damn liar\" to an Iowa man checks out. The second quote, \"you\u2019re a lying dog-faced pony soldier,\" is also accurate, although it was said to a college student in jest. The final claim, that Biden said \"you\u2019re full of s---\" and \"I\u2019ll slap you\" to a factory worker, is half right. Another angle of the confrontation does not show Biden saying, \"I\u2019ll slap you.\"\nThe Facebook post is accurate but needs clarification and additional information.
