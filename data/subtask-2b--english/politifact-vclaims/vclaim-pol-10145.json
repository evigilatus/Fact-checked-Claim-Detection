Bill Nelson is a big fan of tax increases, says his Republican rival U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV of Fort Myers.\n\n\"Bill Nelson voted for higher taxes 150 times, 150 times,\" Mack said during a debate at Nova Southeastern University in Davie Oct. 17. \"I voted to cut taxes \u2026 if you voted for higher taxes 150 times, it's time for you to go.\"\n\nLater in the debate Nelson said that Mack\u2019s claim was \"simply not true.\"\n\n\"Outside fact-check organizations have said it's not true,\" Nelson said. \"You haven\u2019t talked about all the tax cuts I voted for.\"\n\nMack repeated the claim again: \"Senator, your propensity to vote for higher taxes is shocking, absolutely shocking. Like I said, if you voted for higher taxes 150 times, it\u2019s time for you to go.\"\n\nWe fact-checked this claim by Mack in August and rated it False. We will summarize what we learned from our earlier research.\n\nDouble-counting votes and other tallying tricks\n\nMack\u2019s campaign sent us a list of what they characterized as at least 157 votes in favor of higher taxes during Nelson\u2019s Senate career, which started in 2001. (They sent us a similar list again the night of the debate.)\n\nAbout half of the votes on the list are Democratic budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. So it's technically incorrect to say the budget resolution raised, lowered or even kept taxes the same. The documents cannot change tax law.\n\nMack\u2019s tally counts multiple votes on the same budget resolution. For example, Mack cites nine votes Nelson took in 2008 about Congressional Resolution 70, a five-year budget plan.\n\nMack also counted multiple votes on actual legislation. It\u2019s common for senators to take multiple votes as both parties engage in maneuvering and introduce competing amendments.\n\nFor example, in 2001 Mack counts 15 of Nelson\u2019s votes against H.R. 1836 -- the $1.35 trillion in tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush. That counts as one example of Nelson opposing tax cuts -- not 15 examples.\n\nWhich brings us to another point: Is opposing a tax cut the same as \"voting to raise our taxes?\" Mack\u2019s list counts several examples of Nelson opposing tax cuts. Some are minor, such as Nelson\u2019s vote to table an amendment to get rid of the medical device tax in 2010.\n\nWe sent Mack\u2019s list to a three federal budget experts, who \u00a0generally agreed that a vote against a new tax cut doesn\u2019t equal a tax increase.\n\nJoshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction, said Mack\u2019s long list was \"ludicrous.\"\n\n\"Voting to lessen the size of a tax cut in a budget resolution is not voting for a tax increase,\" he said. \"So, I would argue the methodology represents a crazy way to look at this issue.\"\n\n Nelson supported some tax cuts\n\nMack\u2019s statement omits that Nelson has sometimes voted in favor of tax cuts. Here, we will focus on the Bush tax cuts.\n\nNelson opposed a $1.35 trillion tax cut in 2001 because he said it didn\u2019t do enough to reduce debt or help low- and middle-income taxpayers. He also said that as a congressman he had voted for President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cuts and that led to huge deficits.\n\n\"I don't want to see Congress make that mistake again,\" Nelson said in 2001.\n\nIn 2003 on the second round of Bush tax cuts, Nelson voted against the $350 billion package on the conference report. But in 2006 and in 2010 Nelson, supported extending the tax cuts.\n\nThis year, he went along with Obama\u2019s plan and voted in July to keep tax cuts only for those earning less than $250,000, though he had said he would have preferred keeping the Bush-era tax cuts for those earning up to $1 million.\n\n\"His favored position, and one he still holds, is to let the Bush cuts expire on those making more than $1 million,\" said his Senate spokesman Dan McLaughlin.\n\nNelson called for other tax cuts at times. During his first Senate term he bucked his party in favor of repealing the estate tax and in 2007 he sponsored an amendment to reduce the tax on large cigars.\n\nSome of Nelson\u2019s votes cited by Mack would only affect certain businesses -- for example he voted in favor of repealing exemptions for oil and gas companies in 2010. He took many votes in favor of eliminating corporate tax breaks to pay for projects such as port security.\n\nMack\u2019s spokesman told us that the largest tax increase Nelson voted for was \"Obamacare.\" The health care law did raise taxes on the wealthy and health insurance companies. (Read about those provisions in a fact-check we did on a claim by Rush Limbaugh.)\n\nIn an interview on debate night, Mack campaign consultant Gary Maloney defended including the budget resolutions and said they are important because they bind congressional committees on their spending and build in assumptions of revenue, taxes and spending. \"A vote for a budget that assumes higher taxes is a vote that is designed to produce a revenue bill that will raise taxes,\" he said.\n\n Our ruling\n\nMack said, \"Bill Nelson voted for higher taxes 150 times.\"\n\nMack arrives at that figure through some tricks: He counts non-binding resolutions and duplicative votes on the same bill. He counts a vote against a tax cut as a vote for a tax increase, even though it\u2019s not the same thing. And Mack failed to tell debate viewers that Nelson has also voted in favor of tax cuts or extending tax cuts.\n\nIn the list of votes that Mack supplied to PolitiFact after the debate, he included a note that explained it included non-binding votes and other caveats. But during the debate, Mack didn\u2019t explain any of that -- he just repeated the claim without further explanation.\n\nWe rate this claim False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10145"}
