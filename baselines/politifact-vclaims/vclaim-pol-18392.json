Are you prepared to apologize to those women?\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThe video cuts between Joe Biden stuttering as he tries to answer questions and The View hosts looking uncomfortable in close up shots.\nThe text of the tweet reads, \"WTF did I just sit through?

In the original video, he discusses how the Me Too movement has helped him evaluate his actions.\u00a0\n\"I have to be, and everybody has to be, more aware of the private spaces of both men and women\u2026 and I am much more cognizant of that,\" Biden says to Hostin\u2019s question.\nThe top right corner of the tweeted clip offers a clue about what happened. That\u2019s where the Daily Caller logo with the word \"comedy\" appears.\nWhen this video was uploaded on April 26, 2019 to Daily Caller, a conservative news and opinion website, it was posted under a comedy tag. The title originally identified the video as satire and described it as \"some highlights of his most incoherent moments.\"\u00a0\nComments then and now \u2014 like the tweet by @johncardillo \u2014 show not everyone is sharing the clip in its joke context, obscuring Biden\u2019s real answer.\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18392"}
