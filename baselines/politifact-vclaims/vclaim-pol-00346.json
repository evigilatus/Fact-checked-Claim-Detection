An analysis of income tax returns by economists Emmanuel Saez at the University of California, Berkley, and Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics found that income going to the top 1 percent doubled from 8 percent of total income earned in the workforce in 1980 to 16 percent in 2004, and reached pre-Depression levels in 2005.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
