This item appears on the Pointtrumpresidency.blogspot.com website, with a main title: \"For me, Trump is a successful man's symbol and role model for every young American, which our nation has been looking for for for a year. I don't think America will ever get a leader like him again.\" But neither the text in the body of the article, nor the video contained in the article, supports the enhanced headline. The body of the article has absolutely nothing to do with politics. He's telling a novel about Reeves' experience on the set during the filming of \"The Speed\" in 1994, which was filmed jointly by Sandra Bullock. The video at the end of the article shows an interview by Reeves with a journalist in Uruguay, who discussed his early career and current film projects. Neither the text nor the video mentions politics, let alone the views of the representative on Trump. In fact, the only example we found in Reeves to discuss Trump publicly was when he seemed to criticize the President's ban on travelling during a January 2017 question and answer with journalists at the Red carpet event. On January 17, 2021, President Donald Trump stated in an interview with Fox News that he \"cannot say anything (about riots in the American Capitol Building) because the platforms removed it.\" By Bill McCarthy on January 18, 2021, Reeves told a journalist that he believed the travel ban was \"awful,\" according to an article published in January 31, 2017, Associated Press. The only other references we found to support the alleged Trump Reeves were from other suspicious locations that repeated the same unfounded quote. Reeves' dealer confirmed the quote was fake. \"It's totally wrong,\" said Cheryl Messell, from the PMK-BNC Talent Agency. \"He has never made such comments and has never conducted such an interview. They're all made.\" This isn't the first time Reeves has been the subject of a fake quote. We've already verified a long cultural criticism that was distributed to Reeves, who evaluated the pants on the fire. The ruling bloggers said that Reeves described Trump as a symbol of success and an example for young Americans. We didn't find any evidence that he said those words. We value these pants on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00298"}
