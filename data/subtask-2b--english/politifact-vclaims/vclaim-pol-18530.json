Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens, said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0that House Democrats in swing districts who supported \"Medicare for All\" won re-election, without exception.\u00a0\n\"Every single swing-seat House Democrat who endorsed #MedicareForAll won re-election or is on track to win re-election.

Different organizations may rate different seats as competitive, but the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan political analysis organization, is a highly regarded and commonly cited source.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its final Nov. 2 House race ratings, Cook listed 23 swing seats held by Democratic incumbents who were seeking re-election as \"toss up\" or \"leans Democratic.\" Of those 23, two incumbents - Reps. Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania and Peter DeFazio of Oregon\u00a0- co-sponsored a bill providing Medicare for All. Those two won.\u00a0\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign, when we asked for\u00a0evidence of her claim, provided a longer list of House Democrats that it said were in competitive races. Its list included Reps. Mike Levin and Katie Porter of California, Susan Wild of Pennsylvania and Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona, all co-sponsors of H.R. 1384, the Medicare for All Act of 2019. Levin, Porter\u00a0and Wild\u00a0won seats in historically Republican districts in 2018. Kirkpatrick won in 2018 in a district that has historically swung between the parties. But the Cook Report rated Wild's seat \"likely Democratic,\" and the other seats solid Democratic.\u00a0\nWe approached the University of Virginia Center for Politics about this claim, and it sent us an analysis of 2018 races, in which political scientist Alan I. Abramowitz found support for Medicare for All was a \"vote loser\" in U.S. House races.\u00a0\nThe Ocasio-Cortez campaign also sent a list of eight members who did not co-sponsor H.R. 1384 and are in competitive districts and lost. It doesn\u2019t directly address the claim we are fact-checking here.\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\nOcasio-Cortez said that every House Democrat in a swing seat who supports Medicare for All won their race.\u00a0\nOcasio-Cortez's statement is true as far as it goes, but it leaves a misleading impression. Only two of the 23 Democratic incumbents running for re-election\u00a0whose races the Cook Political Report rated as \"toss-up\" or \"lean Democratic\" had signed on as co-sponsors of the bill.\nWe rate her statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18530"}
