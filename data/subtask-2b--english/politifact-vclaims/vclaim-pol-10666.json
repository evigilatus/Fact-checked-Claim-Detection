Jim Doyle. On taxes, Hovde\u2019s like Thompson, only worse.\"\n\nThe ad shows a smiling Hovde at the start of a 2009 TV appearance as a financial pundit on CNBC\u2019s \"Squawk Box\" beneath the words: \"No Problem Raising Taxes.\"\n\nHovde fired back with his own TV spot that calls the Neumann (actually Club for Growth\u2019s) tax accusation \"false.\" (The campaign acknowledges \u00a0Hovde gave $500 to Democrat Doyle\u2019s re-election campaign in 2005. It has not explained why, but notes that Hovde has given almost exclusively to Republicans, and in much larger amounts.)\n\nSo, did Hovde\u2019s remarks suggest he has no problem with raising taxes?\n\nWe watched the nearly 11-minute discussion between Hovde and the cable show\u2019s hosts and found a brief exchange on taxes that closely -- but not exactly -- mirrors the language in the group\u2019s ad.\n\nThe background\n\nHovde\u2019s March 3, 2009 appearance on CNBC focused on the ongoing financial crisis and his criticisms of actions under both Republican President George W. Bush and newly elected President Barack Obama. \u00a0\n\nHovde said the country was in a \"depression,\" Obama\u2019s stimulus bill was unfocused and out of control federal spending was taking the country into \"quasi-Socialist\" territory.\n\nAt the 7:25 mark of the segment, as the Journal Sentinel\u2019s Dan Bice reported in April 2012, Hovde abruptly turned the talk to taxes, tax breaks and the Obama administration.\n\nUnprompted, he began: \"Look, I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes. I\u2019ve been blessed in my life and I\u2019ve been very fortunate. But some of the things that they\u2019ve done are just insane.\"\n\nThen he referred to an Obama 2009 proposal to reduce the mortgage-interest tax deduction for households earning more than $250,000.\n\n\"Taking away deductions on home mortgage payments -- I don\u2019t need it, but a lot of other people do.\" Hovde said. \"We\u2019re in a housing recession -- are you kidding me?\"\n\nSo, the Club for Growth claims Hovde said he had \"no problem with raising taxes.\" He actually said: \"I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a significant difference, especially since he immediately noted that eliminating housing deductions, for instance, would be unwise in a recession.\n\nThe timing is also important.\n\nIn 2009, Hovde was a private citizen, not a candidate running on a platform of what he would do if elected.\n\nAn candidate can have a personal opinion on an issue but may decide to vote another way for a variety of reasons. For instance, a lawmaker personally would not seek an abortion but votes pro-choice to leave the decision up to the mother.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear from the 2009 CNBC interview exactly what Hovde was talking about. Did he mean paying more through a higher top tax rate? Through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts?\n\nWhen asked about the claim, the Club for Growth noted it would take a tax increase of some kind for Hovde\u2019s personal tax bill to rise.\n\nAs a candidate in 2012, Hovde told Bice he was not referring to Obama\u2019s so-called Buffett Rule legislation to make sure high earners pay at least 30 percent in federal income tax (a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic candidate in the race).\n\nHovde has said he was thinking of the tax break on \"carried interest\" -- the portion of a fund\u2019s investment gains taken by fund managers (like Hovde) as compensation. It also applies to venture capitalists and private equity specialists.\n\nIn an interview, Hovde agreed that it would be a tax increase for that narrow group. Some government estimates put the total at more than $1 billion a year.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at his tax positions as a candidate in 2012.\n\nHovde has pledged to reduce individual income tax rates across the board, drop the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and eliminate the estate tax.\n\nSo Hovde has made it clear he is against raising tax rates. In fact, he wants dramatic cuts in people\u2019s tax bills.\n\nThat leaves his support for eliminating tax deductions -- a move that would bring the government more revenue.\n\nHovde says he would vote to eliminate \"nearly all\" of the deductions in the current tax code, which he sees as riddled with favors to big corporations at the expense of small businesses. He also thinks the individual tax code is too complicated.\n\nAnd he told us he still favors eliminating the \"carried interest\" tax provision, which he sees as eliminating a loophole.\n\nHovde, who has made debt and deficit reduction a major theme, has told voters he would accept a budget-balancing deal that gets $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in new revenue through the elimination of loopholes or deductions.\n\nHe told us his strong preference would be that such a deal include cuts in the tax rates.\n\nHe said he would consider supporting a 10-to-1 deal that holds rates steady instead of lowering them, depending on which loopholes or deductions are removed.\n\nBut does that constitute a tax increase?\n\nEven conservative Republicans disagree on this. Americans for Tax Reform\u2019s widely publicized \"taxpayer protection pledge\" frowns on deduction eliminations unless the new revenue is completely offset by lower rates. Thompson and Neumann have signed that pledge, but Hovde has not. \u00a0A leading conservative in the Senate, Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, has criticized the group\u2019s pledge as too narrow to allow for smart reform of the tax code.\n\nPolitiFact National consulted a range of experts in January 2012 in evaluating a Mitt Romney claim that Obama \"has raised taxes 19 times.\"\n\nViews differed on some issues, but the consensus was that eliminating or limiting such deductions as those for prescription or other medical expenses clearly deserved the label of tax increases.\n\nDonald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center, told us it\u2019s case by case -- some of these \"tax preferences\" are best seen as taxes, but others as spending programs in disguise.\n\nGiven Hovde\u2019s pledge to wipe out nearly all deductions, it seems clear that some of those moves could be labeled as tax increases. Even Hovde acknowledged eliminating the \"carried interest\" provision would be a tax increase for a narrow group.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nThe national Club for Growth used Hovde\u2019s own words from a cable TV interview in 2009 to frame him as in favor of raising taxes.\n\nHovde said what he said -- he would pay more, which put him on record as open to some kind of tax increase. There\u2019s no other way to read it.\n\nBut the ad takes the 2009 comment and alters it in a subtle but significant way, changing the context. By also changing the timing, leaving viewers thinking Hovde is campaigning in 2012 on a plan to raise taxes, the issue is further distorted.\n\nIn the current campaign, Hovde has made it clear he wants dramatically lower taxes and would not raise rates, while staying open to a net revenue increase from loophole elimination as part of a massive spending-and-tax-cut deal. That doesn\u2019t square with the breezy portrayal of Hovde as having \"no problem raising taxes.\"\n\nThe Truth-O-Meter says Mostly False claims have an element of truth but ignore critical facts that would give a different impression.\n\nWe think that fits the Club for Growth ad claim. Mostly False.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10666"}
