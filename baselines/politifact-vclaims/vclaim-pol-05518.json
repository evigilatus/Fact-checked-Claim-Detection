(Watch the clip.)\nDid Trump really say that? He definitely tweeted that view once in 2012, though he has since distanced himself a bit from that theory.\nThe clearest example comes from a tweet sent by Trump on Nov. 6, 2012. \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\"\n\nSo Sanders certainly has evidence to support his claim. But Trump has somewhat backed off after Sanders' comments, calling the Chinese link a \"joke.\"\nOn Jan. 18, after Sanders had attacked Trump\u2019s climate change views in the Democratic debate, Trump told Fox & Friends, \"Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be \u2014 received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very \u2014 you know, their standards are nothing. But they \u2014 in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business.\"\nSo Trump has said his 2012 tweet was a joke. However, he has used the word \"hoax\" repeatedly in describing climate change, although he doesn\u2019t always fault China. (For the record, in 2014 we rated the claim that climate change is a \"hoax\" Pants on Fire.)\nMost recently, on Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., \"Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and \u2026 a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, OK? It's a hoax, a lot of it.\"\nThat\u2019s three times using \"hoax\" in one sentence. Trump has also used the word on Twitter since that 2012 tweet.\nOn Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, \"NBC News just called it the great freeze \u2014 coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: \"Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!\"\n\nThat same day, he tweeted, \"Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.\"\n\nTrump also called climate change a \"hoax\" on Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends.\nTrump said on Sept. 24, 2015, on CNN\u2019s New Day, \"I don\u2019t believe in climate change.\"\nAnd as we noted earlier, even when calling his earlier tweet a joke, Trump on Jan. 18, 2016, said\u00a0that climate change\u00a0\"is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change.\"\nOur ruling\nSanders said that Trump \"thinks that climate change is a hoax, invented by the Chinese.\"\nTrump did tweet that view in 2012. Whether Trump still feels that way is less clear.\u00a0Asked about it recently, the real estate developer called it a joke.\nHowever, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a \"hoax\" in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn\u2019t necessarily repeated the charge that China \"invented\" climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate\u00a0change \"is done for the benefit of China.\"\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05518"}
