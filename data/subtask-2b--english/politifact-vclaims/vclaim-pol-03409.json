It\u2019s aimed at boosting jobs in the United States.\nSpeaking April 18, 2017 at Snap-on Inc., a tool manufacturer, Trump made a claim about China. He implied it had a hand in the loss of American jobs, saying:\nFor too long, we\u2019ve watched as our factories have been closed and our jobs have been sent to other faraway lands. We\u2019ve lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization. And you\u2019ve seen that, you\u2019ve heard about it -- 70,000. The World Trade Organization -- another one of our disasters.\nCongress cleared the path for China\u2019s 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization, which deals with the rules of trade between nations and works for open trade. The entry spurred investment in China and produced a lot more movement of goods -- leading to broad agreement that the change cost America millions of jobs.\nBut how many factories? And were there other factors?\nPrevious claim\nTrump\u2019s claim is nearly the same one he made a month earlier at a rally in Kentucky, when he said: \"Since China joined \u2014 that\u2019s another beauty \u2014 the WTO in 2001, the U.S. has lost many more than 60,000 factories.\"\nPolitiFact National\u2019s rating was Mostly True.\nHere\u2019s what our colleagues found:\nThe latest-available U.S. Census counts, for 2014, show the number of American factory establishments has dropped to below 300,000. The decrease since China joined the World Trade Organization was nearly 61,000, according to one Census tally, and more than 73,000 according to another.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of that decline is due to China\u2019s becoming a bigger player in the world economy by joining the WTO, as our colleagues reported:\nAround the same time China joined the WTO, the United States gave China permanent normal trade relations status. Both of these actions removed significant barriers to trade and investment with China, basically putting them on an even playing field with the United States\u2019 other trading partners. In the 16 years since, United States imports from China have quadrupled, in large part because production is so cheap there, making U.S.-based manufacturers less competitive. We found three significant economic studies from the past few years that all conclude increased free trade with China has had a negative impact on American manufacturing and jobs.\nAt the same time, experts said\u00a0the loss of factories was also brought on by other factors, including U.S. trade deficits with other parts of Asia and Europe; a slow recovery after the Great Recession; and increased manufacturing productivity in the United States.\nThe Trump-O-Meter, which tracks Trump\u2019s campaign promises, shows Trump has pledged to reverse China\u2019s entry into the WTO.\nFor its part, China maintains that its entry has led to global economic growth.\nOur rating\nTrump said: \"We\u2019ve lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization.\"\n\nThe latest U.S. Census figures, for 2014, produced two counts: 73,000, which supports Trump\u2019s claim, and 61,000. And at least some of the losses can be attributed to increased trade with China.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\nMore Trump\nAs he prepared to visit Wisconsin, Trump\u2019s record on the Truth-O-Meter -- on statements fact checked since he\u2019s been president -- shows roughly two-thirds of his statements have been rated near the bottom of the meter.\n Share the Facts 2017-04-19 17:01:36 UTC   Politifact    2 1 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly True  \"We\u2019ve lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization.\"     Donald Trump President   In a speech Tuesday, April 18, 2017 2017-04-18    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03409"}
