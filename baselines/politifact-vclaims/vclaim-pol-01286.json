(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nU.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar shared the original photo with the Houston Chronicle in 2014, along with a series of other images that showed cramped and unsanitary conditions in a Customs and Border Protection facility in South Texas.\nThe claim that immigrants bring infectious diseases isn\u2019t new. We\u2019ve fact-checked a couple iterations of the claim over the years.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2014, a congressman said migrants may be bringing the Ebola virus across the U.S.-Mexico border. We rated that Pants on Fire.\nIn 2015, Donald Trump said, \"Tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border.\" At the time, the health experts we spoke with agreed that there was no evidence of massive influx of infections across the border.\nMost recently, other posts have gone viral about the migrants in the caravan heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border supposedly bringing diseases. There are no known reports of this being the case, according to The New York Times.\nThe photo in the Facebook post is from a particular outbreak of scabies in 2014. Scabies is a treatable skin condition, but it can spread rapidly under crowded conditions. That outbreak was largely contained to migrants living in close quarters in detention centers. Only a small handful of border patrol agents appear to have contracted it.\nThere is some evidence that diseases cross between the U.S.-Mexico border, but the Center for Disease Control attributes spread of disease in that region not to illegal immigration but to legal back-and-forth between the United States and Mexico.\nOur ruling\nThere is no evidence that undocumented immigrants to the U.S. are carrying deadly diseases. Spread of disease is more likely from the much larger numbers of legal crossing across the border and the number of international travelers visiting other countries and then returning to the United States. We rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-11-07 15:16:45 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says photo of man shows \"diseases coming across the border.\"    Bloggers Bloggers    in a Facebook post Friday, November 2, 2018 2018-11-02    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01286"}
