0001	DICKERSON	Good evening.
0002	DICKERSON	I'm John Dickerson.
0003	DICKERSON	This holiday weekend, as America honors our first president, we're about to hear from six men who hope to be the 45th.
0004	DICKERSON	The candidates for the Republican nomination are here in South Carolina for their ninth debate, one week before this state holds the firstintheSouth primary.
0005	DICKERSON	George Washington wrote that the truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains taken to bring it to light.
0006	DICKERSON	We hope to shed some light on the candidates' positions tonight to help voters make up their minds.
0007	DICKERSON	So gentlemen, please join us on stage.
0008	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0009	DICKERSON	With us tonight  with us tonight are retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson of Florida, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.
0010	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0011	DICKERSON	Businessman Donald Trump of New York.
0012	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0013	DICKERSON	Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.
0014	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0015	DICKERSON	Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida.
0016	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0017	DICKERSON	And Governor John Kasich of Ohio.
0018	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0019	DICKERSON	Now, as most of you have heard by now, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died today at the age of 79.
0020	DICKERSON	He was the longestserving member of the court, appointed by President Reagan in 1986.
0021	DICKERSON	Justice Scalia was the court's leading conservative, and even those who disagreed with his opinions regarded him as a brilliant legal scholar.
0022	DICKERSON	Please join us and the candidates on our stage in a moment of silence for Justice Antonin Scalia.
0023	DICKERSON	Thank you.
0024	DICKERSON	We will talk to the candidates about Justice Scalia and the road ahead when the debate begins in a moment.
0025	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0026	DICKERSON	Before we get started, candidates, here are the rules.
0027	DICKERSON	When we ask you a question, you will have one minute to answer, and 30 seconds more if we ask a followup.
0028	DICKERSON	If you're attacked by another candidate, you get 30 seconds to respond.
0029	DICKERSON	And here's how we keep time.
0030	DICKERSON	After we ask a question, you'll get a green light.
0031	DICKERSON	The yellow light means you have 30 seconds left to finish your answer, and when time is up, the light turns red.
0032	DICKERSON	That means please stop talking.
0033	DICKERSON	If you keep talking, you'll hear this.
0034	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
0035	DICKERSON	You don't want to hear that.
0036	DICKERSON	Joining me in the questioning tonight, my CBS News colleague, chief White House correspondent Major Garrett, and Kimberley Strassel, who is on the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal.
0037	DICKERSON	And you can participate in the debate through our partnership with Twitter.
0038	DICKERSON	Tweet us your questions and comments using the hashtag "#GOPDebate."
0039	DICKERSON	So, let's begin.
0040	DICKERSON	First, the death of Justice Scalia, and the vacancy that leaves on the Supreme Court.
0041	DICKERSON	Mr. Trump, I want to start with you.
0042	DICKERSON	You've said that the president shouldn't nominate anyone in the rest of his term to replace Justice Scalia.
0043	DICKERSON	If you were president and had a chance, with 11 months left to go in your term, wouldn't it be an abdication, to conservatives in particular, not to name a conservative justice with the rest of your term?
0044	TRUMP	Well, I can say this.
0045	TRUMP	If the president, and if I were president now, I would certainly want to try and nominate a justice.
0046	TRUMP	I'm sure that, frankly, I'm absolutely sure that President Obama will try and do it.
0047	TRUMP	I hope that our Senate is going to be able  Mitch, and the entire group, is going to be able to do something about it.
0048	TRUMP	In times of delay, we could have a Diane Sykes, or you could have a Bill Pryor  we have some fantastic people.
0049	TRUMP	But this is a tremendous blow to conservatism.
0050	TRUMP	It's a tremendous blow, frankly, to our country.
0051	DICKERSON	So, just to be clear on this, Mr. Trump, you're O.K.
0052	DICKERSON	with the president nominating somebody ...
0053	TRUMP	...
0054	TRUMP	I think he's going to do it whether or I'm O.K.
0055	TRUMP	with it or not.
0056	TRUMP	I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it.
0057	TRUMP	It's called delay, delay, delay.
0058	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0059	DICKERSON	Governor Kasich, I want to get your thoughts on this.
0060	DICKERSON	Justice Scalia was a real believer, obviously, in the strict word of the Constitution.
0061	DICKERSON	Now, Harry Reid says that a failure to fill his vacancy would be, quote, "shameful abdication of one of the Senate's most essential constitutional responsibilities."
0062	DICKERSON	Where do you come down on this?
0063	KASICH	Well, John, first of all, if I were president, we wouldn't have the divisions in the country we have today.
0064	KASICH	I do want to take a second as we reflected on Judge Scalia, it's amazing  it's not even two minutes after the death of Judge Scalia, nine children here today, their father didn't wake up.
0065	KASICH	His wife, sad, but I just wish we hadn't run so fast into politics.
0066	KASICH	Here's my concern about this.
0067	KASICH	The country is so divided right now, and now we're going to see another partisan fight take place.
0068	KASICH	I really wish the president would think about not nominating somebody.
0069	KASICH	If you were to nominate somebody, let's have him pick somebody that's going to have unanimous approval, and such widespread approval across the country that this could happen without a lot of recrimination.
0070	KASICH	I don't think that's going to happen, and I would like the president just to, for once here, put the country first.
0071	KASICH	We're going to have an election for president very soon, and the people will understand what is at stake in that election.
0072	KASICH	And so I believe the president should not move forward, and I think that we ought to let the next president of the United States decide who is going to run that Supreme Court with a vote by the people of the United...
0073	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
0074	KASICH	...States of America.
0075	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0076	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson.
0077	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson, you, like others, put out a statement after the death was announced, and you said the president should delay.
0078	DICKERSON	You've written a book on the Constitution recently.
0079	DICKERSON	What does the Constitution say about whose duty it is here to act in this kind of a situation?
0080	CARSON	Well, the current Constitution actually doesn't address that particular situation, but the fact of the matter is the Supreme Court, obviously, is a very important part of our governmental system.
0081	CARSON	And when our Constitution was put in place, the average age of death was under 50, and therefore the whole concept of lifetime appointments for Supreme Court judges and federal judges was not considered to be a big deal.
0082	CARSON	Obviously, that has changed, and it's something that probably needs to be looked at pretty carefully at some point.
0083	CARSON	But, we need to start thinking about the divisiveness that is going on in our country.
0084	CARSON	I looked at some of the remarks that people made after finding out that Justice Scalia had died, and they were truly nasty remarks.
0085	CARSON	And that we have managed to get to that position in our country is truly a shame.
0086	CARSON	And we should be thinking about how we could create some healing in this land.
0087	CARSON	But, right now, we're not going to get healing with President Obama.
0088	CARSON	That's very United Nations clear.
0089	CARSON	So, I...
0090	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
0091	CARSON	... fully agree that we should not allow a judge to be appointed during his time.
0092	DICKERSON	Senator Rubio, you're a...
0093	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0094	DICKERSON	Senator Rubio, you're a lawyer.
0095	DICKERSON	Quickly, can you address the issue of whether the Constitution tells us who has the power to appoint Supreme Court justices?
0096	DICKERSON	And then, also, the Senate Republicans last year floated an idea of removing the filibuster for Senate  excuse me, for Supreme Court nominations.
0097	DICKERSON	You seemed open to that.
0098	DICKERSON	What's your feeling on that now?
0099	RUBIO	Well, let me first talk about Justice Scalia.
0100	RUBIO	His loss is tremendous, and obviously our hearts and prayers go out to his family.
0101	RUBIO	He will go down as one of the great justices in the history of this republic.
0102	RUBIO	You talk about someone who defended consistently the original meaning of the Constitution, who understood that the Constitution was not there to be interpreted based on the fads of the moment, but it was there to be interpreted according to its original meaning.
0103	RUBIO	Justice Scalia understood that better than anyone in the history of this republic.
0104	RUBIO	His dissent, for example, on the independent counsel case is a brilliant piece of jurist work.
0105	RUBIO	And, of course, his dissent on Obergefell as well.
0106	RUBIO	No.
0107	RUBIO	2, I do not believe the president should appoint someone.
0108	RUBIO	And it's not unprecedented.
0109	RUBIO	In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice.
0110	RUBIO	And it remind us of this, how important this election is.
0111	RUBIO	Someone on this stage will get to choose the balance of the Supreme Court, and it will begin by filling this vacancy that's there now.
0112	RUBIO	And we need to put people on the bench that understand that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document.
0113	RUBIO	It is to be interpreted as originally meant.
0114	DICKERSON	Quickly, though, on this question...
0115	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0116	DICKERSON	Very quickly, Senator, on this specific question, though.
0117	DICKERSON	You were once in favor of dropping the threshold...
0118	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0119	RUBIO	That's not accurate.
0120	DICKERSON	... majority  you were never in favor of that?
0121	RUBIO	No, I've never  there has been, for example, today, according to the changes Harry Reid made, appellate judges can now be appointed by a simple majority, but not Supreme Court justices.
0122	RUBIO	And I think today you see the wisdom of why we don't want that to change.
0123	RUBIO	Because if that were the case and we were not in charge of the Senate, Harry Reid and Barack Obama would ram down our throat a liberal justice, like the ones Barack Obama has imposed on us already.
0124	DICKERSON	O.K.
0125	DICKERSON	Thank you, Senator.
0126	DICKERSON	Governor Bush, I would like to ask you, conservatives for a long time have felt like that their Republican presidents have picked justices that didn't turn out to be real conservatives.
0127	BUSH	Right.
0128	DICKERSON	Bernie Sanders has said he would have a litmus test.
0129	DICKERSON	He would make sure that he appointed a justice who was going to overturn Citizens United.
0130	DICKERSON	If they can have a litmus test for a nominee, what about you?
0131	DICKERSON	Would you have a litmus test for a nominee?
0132	DICKERSON	And what would it be?
0133	BUSH	Not on specific issues, not at all.
0134	BUSH	I think the next president  if I'm president, I will appoint people  I'll nominate people that have a proven record in the judiciary.
0135	BUSH	The problem in the past has been we have appointed people thinking you can get it through the Senate because they didn't have a record.
0136	BUSH	And the problem is that sometimes we're surprised.
0137	BUSH	The simple fact is the next president needs to appoint someone with a proven conservative record, similar to Justice Scalia, that is a lover of liberty, that believes in limited government, that consistently applied that kind of philosophy, that didn't try to legislator from the bench, that was respectful of the Constitution.
0138	BUSH	And then fight and fight, and fight for that nomination to make sure that that nomination passes.
0139	BUSH	Of course, the president, by the way, has every right to nominate Supreme Court justices.
0140	BUSH	I'm an Article II guy in the Constitution.
0141	BUSH	We're running for the president of the United States.
0142	BUSH	We want a strong executive for sure.
0143	BUSH	But in return for that, there should be a consensus orientation on that nomination, and there's no doubt in my mind that Barack Obama will not have a consensus pick when he submits that person to the Senate.
0144	DICKERSON	Right, so, Senator Cruz, the Constitution...
0145	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0146	DICKERSON	So, Senator Cruz, the Constitution says the president "shall appoint with advice and consent from the Senate," just to clear that up.
0147	DICKERSON	So he has the constitutional power.
0148	DICKERSON	But you don't think he should.
0149	DICKERSON	Where do you set that date if you're president?
0150	DICKERSON	Does it begin in election year, in December, November, September?
0151	DICKERSON	And once you set the date, when you're president, will you abide by that date?
0152	CRUZ	Well, we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year.
0153	CRUZ	And let me say, Justice Scalia...
0154	DICKERSON	Just can I  I'm sorry to interrupt, were any appointed in an election year, or is that just there were 80 years...
0155	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0156	CRUZ	Eighty years of not confirming.
0157	CRUZ	For example, L.B.J.
0158	CRUZ	nominated Abe Fortas.
0159	CRUZ	Fortas did not get confirmed.
0160	CRUZ	He was defeated.
0161	DICKERSON	But Kennedy was confirmed in '88.
0162	CRUZ	No, Kennedy was confirmed in '87...
0163	DICKERSON	He was appointed in '87.
0164	CRUZ	He was appointed in...
0165	DICKERSON	... confirmed in '88.
0166	DICKERSON	That's the question, is it appointing or confirming, what's the difference?
0167	CRUZ	In this case it's both.
0168	CRUZ	But if I could answer the question...
0169	DICKERSON	Sorry, I just want to get the facts straight for the audience.
0170	DICKERSON	But I apologize.
0171	SYSTEM	[ booing and laughter ]
0172	CRUZ	Justice Scalia was a legal giant.
0173	CRUZ	He was somebody that I knew for 20 years.
0174	CRUZ	He was a brilliant man.
0175	CRUZ	He was faithful to the Constitution.
0176	CRUZ	He changed the arc of American legal history.
0177	CRUZ	And I'll tell you, his passing tonight, our prayers are with his family, with his wife, Maureen, who he adored, his nine children, his 36 grandkids.
0178	CRUZ	But it underscores the stakes of this election.
0179	CRUZ	We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states.
0180	CRUZ	We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will reverse the Heller decision, one of Justice Scalia's seminal decisions, that upheld the Second Amendment right to keep and to bear arms.
0181	CRUZ	We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of Americans  and the stakes of this election, for this year, for the Senate, the Senate needs to stand strong and say, "We're not going to give up the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation by allowing Barack Obama to make one more liberal appointee."
0182	CRUZ	And then for the state of South Carolina, one of the most important judgments for the men and women of South Carolina to make is who on this stage has the background, the principle, the character, the judgment and the strength of resolve to nominate and confirm principled constitutionalists to the court?
0183	CRUZ	That will be what I will do if I'm elected president.
0184	DICKERSON	All right.
0185	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0186	DICKERSON	Thank you, Senator Cruz.
0187	DICKERSON	All right, we're going to move on to national security here, and we are going to  I want to read a quote from Secretary Robert Gates, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served for eight year  under eight presidents.
0188	DICKERSON	And this is what he said about Republican candidates, quote, "Part of the concern that I have with the campaign is that the solutions being offered are so simplistic and so at odds with the way the world really works."
0189	DICKERSON	So, in that spirit, we're going to work tonight to be more specific.
0190	DICKERSON	Mr. Trump, I want to start with you.
0191	DICKERSON	You have said as president, you'll get up to speed very quickly.
0192	DICKERSON	You'll know more quickly as president than any of the experts.
0193	DICKERSON	So, you've been elected president.
0194	DICKERSON	It's your first day in the Situation Room.
0195	DICKERSON	What three questions do you ask your national security experts about the world?
0196	TRUMP	What we want to do, when we want to do it, and how hard do we want to hit?
0197	TRUMP	Because we are going to have to hit very, very hard to knock out ISIS.
0198	TRUMP	We're going to also have to learn who our allies are.
0199	TRUMP	We have allies, socalled allies, we're spending billions and billions of dollars supporting people  we have no idea who they are in Syria.
0200	TRUMP	Do we want to stay that route, or do we want to go and make something with Russia?
0201	TRUMP	I hate to say Iran, but with Russia, because we  and the Iran deal is one of the worst deals I have ever seen negotiated in my entire life.
0202	TRUMP	It's a disgrace that this country negotiated that deal.
0203	TRUMP	But very important...
0204	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0205	TRUMP	Not only a disgrace, it's a disgrace and an embarrassment.
0206	TRUMP	But very important, who are we fighting with?
0207	TRUMP	Who are we fighting for?
0208	TRUMP	What are we doing?
0209	TRUMP	We have to rebuild our country.
0210	TRUMP	But we have to  I'm the only one on this stage that said "Do not go into Iraq.
0211	TRUMP	Do not attack Iraq."
0212	TRUMP	Nobody else on this stage said that.
0213	TRUMP	And I said it loud and strong.
0214	TRUMP	And I was in the private sector.
0215	TRUMP	I wasn't a politician, fortunately.
0216	TRUMP	But I said it, and I said it loud and clear, "You'll destabilize the Middle East."
0217	TRUMP	That's exactly what happened.
0218	TRUMP	I also said, by the way, four years ago, three years ago, attack the oil, take the wealth away, attack the oil and keep the oil.
0219	TRUMP	They didn't listen.
0220	TRUMP	They just started that a few months ago.
0221	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0222	DICKERSON	Senator Rubio  just 30 seconds on this question, Senator Rubio.
0223	DICKERSON	Are those the questions you would ask?
0224	RUBIO	No.
0225	RUBIO	I think there are three major threats that you want to immediately get on top of.
0226	RUBIO	No.
0227	RUBIO	1 is, what are we doing in the AsiaPacific region, where both North Korea and China pose threats to the national security of the United States.
0228	RUBIO	No.
0229	RUBIO	2 is, what are we doing in the Middle East with the combination of the SunniShia conflict driven by the Shia arc that Iran is now trying to establish in the Middle East, also the growing threat of ISIS.
0230	RUBIO	And the third is rebuilding and reinvigorating NATO in the European theater, particularly in Central Europe and in Eastern Europe, where Vladimir Putin is now threatening the territory of multiple countries, already controls 20 percent of Georgia and a significant percentage of Ukraine.
0231	DICKERSON	Let me ask you a followup, a full, proper question, then.
0232	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0233	DICKERSON	Violent extremists are operating or active in 40 countries.
0234	DICKERSON	Some 80 countries are in different degrees of instability.
0235	DICKERSON	And so, that's just the crises overseas.
0236	DICKERSON	Barack Obama walked into an economic collapse when he came into office.
0237	DICKERSON	We face international health crises, from Ebola to Zika.
0238	DICKERSON	So, there is a lot of opportunity for crisis, as you have talked about.
0239	DICKERSON	What would you point to in your past to show voters that you've been in a crisis and that you've been tested when that inevitable crisis comes when you're president?
0240	RUBIO	Well, let me tell you what has happened a couple of years ago.
0241	RUBIO	One of the hardest decisions you'll ever make in Congress is when you are asked by the president to authorize the use of force in a conflict, because you are now putting your name, on behalf of the people of your state, behind a military action, where Americans in uniform could lose their life.
0242	RUBIO	So, in 2014, Barack Obama said he would not take military action against Assad unless it was authorized by the Senate, beginning on the Committee of Foreign Relations, where I am one of its members.
0243	RUBIO	And it was hard because you looked at the pictures.
0244	RUBIO	I saw the same images people saw.
0245	RUBIO	I'm the father of children.
0246	RUBIO	I saw the images of these little children  been gassed and poisoned by their own leaders, and we were angry.
0247	RUBIO	Something had to happen, and there was the sense that we needed to seek retribution.
0248	RUBIO	And then I looked at Barack Obama's plan.
0249	RUBIO	Barack Obama's plan, which John Kerry later described as unbelievably small, and I concluded that that attack would not only not help the situation, it would make it actually worse.
0250	RUBIO	It would allow Assad to stand up to the United States of America, survive a strike, stay in power and actually strengthen his grip.
0251	RUBIO	So it was a difficult decision to make, and when we only had a few days to look at and make a decision on it, and I voted against Barack Obama's plan to use force, and it was the right decision.
0252	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson, I want to ask you a question...
0253	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0254	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson, you said you've had more 2 a.m.  2 a.m. phone calls than anybody up on this stage.
0255	DICKERSON	But when those 2 a.m. phone calls came, you operated on a foundation of all of that amazing medical work that you did, all of that learning.
0256	DICKERSON	So if you were to be president, though, you wouldn't have the political foundation that hones those instincts when the 2 a.m. phone call comes.
0257	DICKERSON	So isn't that a liability?
0258	CARSON	No, it isn't.
0259	CARSON	First of all, let me go back to your first question for me.
0260	CARSON	It wasn't phrased as who gets to nominate Supreme Court appointees.
0261	CARSON	Of course that's the president.
0262	CARSON	So I know that there are some leftwing media who would try to make hay on that.
0263	CARSON	Secondly, thank you for including me in the debate.
0264	CARSON	Two questions already.
0265	CARSON	This is great.
0266	CARSON	Now, as far...
0267	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
0268	CARSON	...as far as those 2 a.m. phone calls are concerned, judgment is what is required.
0269	CARSON	And the kinds of things that you come up with are sometimes very, very difficult and very unique.
0270	CARSON	One of the things that I was known for is doing things that have not been done before.
0271	CARSON	So no amount of experience really prepares you to do something that has never been done before.
0272	CARSON	That's where judgment comes in.
0273	CARSON	And that, I think, is a situation that we're in right now, a situation that we have never been in before with the kinds of threats that pose real danger to our nation, and it comes in very handy in those situations.
0274	DICKERSON	Governor Kasich, Russia is being credited...
0275	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0276	DICKERSON	...Russia is being credited with bombing U.S.backed rebels on behalf of Assad in Aleppo and Syria.
0277	DICKERSON	They've also moved into the Crimea, eastern Ukraine.
0278	DICKERSON	You've said you want to punch them in the nose.
0279	DICKERSON	What does that mean?
0280	DICKERSON	What are you going to do?
0281	KASICH	First of all  yes.
0282	KASICH	First of all, look, we have to make it clear to Russia what we expect.
0283	KASICH	We don't have to declare an enemy, rattle a sword or threaten, but we need to make it clear what we expect.
0284	KASICH	No.
0285	KASICH	1 is we will arm the folks in Ukraine who are fighting for their freedom.
0286	KASICH	They deserve it.
0287	KASICH	There will be no ifs, ands or buts about it.
0288	KASICH	Secondly, an attack on NATO, trumped up on any excuse of Russianspeaking people, either in the NATO countries or in Finland or Sweden, is going to be an attack on us.
0289	KASICH	And look, I think we have an opportunity as America to put something really great together again.
0290	KASICH	The Egyptians, the Saudis, the Jordanians, the Gulf states, they all know they're at risk.
0291	KASICH	We need to look into Europe, we look at France, we look at Germany and the migrants.
0292	KASICH	We look at Belgium, we look at Britain.
0293	KASICH	Everybody now is being threatened by radical Islam.
0294	KASICH	We have an opportunity to lead.
0295	KASICH	You know, the fact of the matter is the world is desperate for our leadership.
0296	KASICH	Sometimes they may  they may make a remark here or there that we don't like, but frankly, the world needs us.
0297	KASICH	And we have an opportunity now to assemble a coalition of the civilized people, those who respect civilization, the rights of women, the rights to protest, to be able to reassert our leadership all across this globe again and make sure this century is going to be the best we've ever seen.
0298	DICKERSON	Governor...
0299	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0300	DICKERSON	...Governor Bush.
0301	BUSH	Yes.
0302	DICKERSON	You said defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad.
0303	DICKERSON	But wouldn't that also put us into conflict with Russia, a country that supports Assad?
0304	DICKERSON	So doesn't that mean, effectively, Assad's there to stay?
0305	BUSH	No, it doesn't, and that's the problem.
0306	BUSH	The lack of leadership in this country by Barack Obama, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, thinking that this is a policy that works, this policy of containment with ISIS.
0307	BUSH	It's a complete, unmitigated disaster.
0308	BUSH	And to allow Russia now to have influence in Syria makes it harder, but we need to destroy ISIS and dispose of Assad to create a stable Syria so that the four million refugees aren't a breeding ground for Islamic jihadists.
0309	BUSH	This is the problem.
0310	BUSH	Donald Trump brought up the fact that he would  he'd want to accommodate Russia.
0311	BUSH	Russia is not taking out ISIS.
0312	BUSH	They're  they're attacking our  our  our team, the team that we've been training and the team that we've been supporting.
0313	BUSH	It is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that Russia could be a positive partner in this.
0314	BUSH	They are on the run.
0315	BUSH	They are making  every time we step back, they're on the run.
0316	BUSH	The question that you asked was a really good one about what you would do  what three things would you do.
0317	BUSH	I would restore the military, the sequester needs to be reversed.
0318	BUSH	I would have a strategy to destroy ISIS, and I would immediately create a policy of containment as it relates to Iran's ambitions, and to make it make clear that we are not going to allow for Iran to do what it's doing, which is to move towards a nuclear weapon.
0319	BUSH	Those three things would be the first and foremost things that we need to do...

0335	TRUMP	You got to fight ISIS first.
0336	TRUMP	You fight ISIS first.
0337	TRUMP	Right now you have Russia, you have Iran, you have them with Assad, and you have them with Syria.
0338	TRUMP	You have to knock out ISIS.
0339	TRUMP	They're chopping off heads.
0340	TRUMP	These are animals.

0342	TRUMP	You have to knock them off strong.
0343	TRUMP	You decide what to do after, you can't fight two wars at one time.
0344	TRUMP	If you listen to him, and you listen to some of the folks that I've been listening to, that's why we've been in the Middle East for 15 years, and we haven't won anything.
0345	TRUMP	We've spent $5 trillion dollars in the Middle East with thinking like that.
0346	TRUMP	We've spent $5...

0357	BUSH	The very basic fact is that Vladimir Putin is not going to be an ally of the United States.
0358	BUSH	The whole world knows this.
0359	BUSH	It's a simple, basic fact.

0377	DICKERSON	I've got a question for Senator...
0378	BUSH	...
0379	BUSH	This is coming from a guy who gets his foreign policy from the shows.
0380	TRUMP	... Oh, yeah, yeah...

0389	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0390	DICKERSON	... All right, all right, gentlemen, gentlemen, let's leave it there so I can ask a question of Senator Cruz, who's also running for president.
0391	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
0392	DICKERSON	Senator Cruz, you talked about the first Gulf War as being a kind of model for your focused and determined effort to go after ISIS.
0393	DICKERSON	But there were 700,000 ground troops as a part of that, and you don't have a ground component to your plan.
0394	DICKERSON	Why?
0395	CRUZ	Well, we need to focus on what the objective is, you know?
0396	CRUZ	Your question about the first three questions you would ask in this Situation Room.
0397	CRUZ	I think it is a problem if the president, commander in chief, we've elected does not have the experience and background to understand the threats facing this country coming in on Day 1.
0398	CRUZ	If you look at the threats facing this country, the single gravest threat, national security threat, is the threat of a nuclear Iran.
0399	CRUZ	That's why I've pledged on Day 1 to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal, and anyone that thinks you can negotiate Khamenei does not understand the nature of Khamenei.
0400	CRUZ	When it comes to ISIS, we've got to have a focused objective.
0401	CRUZ	One of the problems of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's foreign policy, and, sadly, too many establishment Republicans in Washington, is they focus on issues unrelated to protecting this country.
0402	CRUZ	They focus on nation building, they focus on toppling governments to promote democracy, and it ends up undermining our national security.
0403	CRUZ	Now, with regard to ISIS, we need a commander in chief that sets the objective we will utterly defeat them because they have declared war.
0404	CRUZ	They've declared a jihad on us.
0405	CRUZ	Now, what do we need...
0406	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
0407	CRUZ	...to carry that out.
0408	CRUZ	We need overwhelming air power, we need to arm the Kurds, who can be our boots on the ground, and if ground troops are necessary, then we should employ them, but it shouldn't be politicians demonstrating political toughness.
0409	CRUZ	It should be military expert judgment carrying out the objectives set out by the commander in chief.
0410	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0411	DICKERSON	Very quickly, 30second followup.
0412	DICKERSON	You've said that, essentially, the Kurds would be the American ground forces in there.
0413	DICKERSON	The criticism that experts have on that is that the Kurds only can work within their territory.
0414	DICKERSON	If they take larger amounts of territory, you have an ethnic war with the Arabs.
0415	DICKERSON	So the Kurds can't really do as much as you seem to be putting on their backs.
0416	CRUZ	We have Kurds in both Iraq and Syria.
0417	CRUZ	They are fighting ISIS right now.
0418	CRUZ	They are winning victories right now.
0419	CRUZ	ISIS is using American military equipment they've seized in Iraq.
0420	CRUZ	And the Obama administration refuses to arm the Kurds, the pesh merga, the fighting forces who have been longtime allies.
0421	CRUZ	We ought to be arming them and letting them fight.
0422	CRUZ	Now, if we need to embed Special Forces to direct our overwhelming air power, if it is required to use ground troops to defeat ISIS, we should use them, but we ought to start with using our incredible air power advantage.
0423	CRUZ	The first Persian Gulf War, we launched 1,100 air attacks a day.
0424	CRUZ	Today, we're launching between 15 and 30.
0425	CRUZ	We're not using the tools we have, and it's because the commander in chief is not focused on defeating the enemy.
0426	DICKERSON	All right.
0427	DICKERSON	Mr. Trump...
0428	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0429	DICKERSON	...On Monday, George W. Bush will campaign in South Carolina for his brother.
0430	DICKERSON	As you've said tonight, and you've often said, the Iraq war and your opposition to it was a sign of your good judgment.
0431	DICKERSON	In 2008, in an interview with Wolf Blitzer, talking about President George W. Bush's conduct of the war, you said you were surprised that Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi didn't try to impeach him.
0432	DICKERSON	You said, quote "Which, personally, I think would have been a wonderful thing."
0433	DICKERSON	When you were asked what you meant by that and you said "For the war, for the war, he lied, he got us into the war with lies."
0434	DICKERSON	Do you still believe President Bush should have been impeached?
0435	TRUMP	First of all, I have to say, as a businessman, I get along with everybody.
0436	TRUMP	I have business all over the world.
0437	SYSTEM	[ booing ]
0438	TRUMP	I know so many of the people in the audience.
0439	TRUMP	And by the way, I'm a selffunder.
0440	TRUMP	I don't have  I have my wife and I have my son.
0441	TRUMP	That's all I have.
0442	TRUMP	I don't have this.
0443	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0444	TRUMP	So let me just tell you, I get along with everybody, which is my obligation to my company, to myself, et cetera.
0445	TRUMP	Obviously, the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake.
0446	TRUMP	All right?
0447	TRUMP	Now, you can take it any way you want, and it took  it took Jeb Bush, if you remember at the beginning of his announcement, when he announced for president, it took him five days.
0448	TRUMP	He went back, it was a mistake, it wasn't a mistake.
0449	TRUMP	It took him five days before his people told him what to say, and he ultimately said, "It was a mistake."
0450	TRUMP	The war in Iraq, we spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives, we don't even have it.
0451	TRUMP	Iran has taken over Iraq, with the secondlargest oil reserves in the world.
0452	TRUMP	Obviously, it was a mistake.
0453	DICKERSON	So...
0454	TRUMP	George Bush made a mistake.
0455	TRUMP	We can make mistakes.
0456	TRUMP	But that one was a beauty.
0457	TRUMP	We should have never been in Iraq.
0458	TRUMP	We have destabilized the Middle East.
0459	DICKERSON	But so I'm going to  so you still think he should be impeached?
0460	BUSH	I think it's my turn, isn't it?
0461	TRUMP	You do whatever you want.
0462	TRUMP	You call it whatever you want.
0463	TRUMP	I want to tell you.
0464	TRUMP	They lied.
0465	TRUMP	They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none.
0466	TRUMP	And they knew there were none.
0467	TRUMP	There were no weapons of mass destruction.
0468	SYSTEM	[ booing ]
0469	DICKERSON	All right.
0470	DICKERSON	O.K.
0471	DICKERSON	All right.
0472	DICKERSON	Governor Bush  when a member on the stage's brother gets attacked...
0473	BUSH	I've got about five or six...
0474	DICKERSON	... the brother gets to respond.
0475	BUSH	Do I get to do it five or six times or just once, responding to that?
0476	TRUMP	I'm being nice.
0477	BUSH	So here's the deal.
0478	BUSH	I'm sick and tired of Barack Obama blaming my brother for all of the problems that he has had.
0479	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0480	BUSH	And, frankly, I could care less about the insults that Donald Trump gives to me.
0481	BUSH	It's blood sport for him.
0482	BUSH	He enjoys it.
0483	BUSH	And I'm glad he's happy about it.
0484	BUSH	But I am sick and tired...
0485	TRUMP	He spent $22 million in...
0486	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0487	BUSH	I am sick and tired of him going after my family.
0488	BUSH	My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind.
0489	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0490	BUSH	And while Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe.
0491	BUSH	And I'm proud of what he did.
0492	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0493	BUSH	And he has had the gall to go after my brother.
0494	TRUMP	The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign, remember that.

0496	BUSH	He has had the gall to go after my mother.
0497	BUSH	Hold on.

0499	BUSH	He has had the gall to go after my mother.
0500	TRUMP	That's not keeping us safe.
0501	BUSH	Look, I won the lottery when I was born 63 years ago, looked up, and I saw my mom.
0502	BUSH	My mom is the strongest woman I know.
0503	TRUMP	She should be running.
0504	BUSH	This is not about my family or his family.
0505	BUSH	This is about the South Carolina families that need someone to be a commander in chief that can lead.
0506	BUSH	I'm that person.
0507	DICKERSON	Governor Kasich, would you weigh in on...
0508	SYSTEM	[ applause ]

0516	DICKERSON	Talk about it.
0517	DICKERSON	Give us your sense of...
0518	KASICH	Oh, well, listen, I think being in Iraq, look, we thought there were weapons of mass destruction.
0519	KASICH	Colin Powell, who is one of the most distinguished generals in modern time, said there were weapons there.
0520	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0521	KASICH	But, but, the fact is we got ourselves in the middle of a civil war.
0522	KASICH	The Sunni, the Shia and the Kurds, never gotten along.
0523	KASICH	In fact, that country was drawn  the borders of that country were drawn after World War I by Westerners that didn't understand what was happening there.
0524	KASICH	The tragedy of it is that we're still embroiled.
0525	KASICH	And, frankly, if there weren't weapons of mass destruction, we should never have gone.
0526	KASICH	I don't believe the United States should involve itself in civil wars.
0527	KASICH	Civil wars are not in our direct interest, and if you  and look, I served on a defense committee for 18 years and was called into the Pentagon after 911 by Secretary Rumsfeld to deal with some of the most serious problems that we faced.
0528	KASICH	The fact is, is that we should go to war when it is our direct interest.
0529	KASICH	We should not be policemen of the world, but when we go, we mean business.
0530	KASICH	We'll do our job.
0531	KASICH	We'll tell our soldiers, our people in the service, take care of your job and then come home once we've accomplished our goals.
0532	KASICH	That's what we need to do.
0533	DICKERSON	Thirty seconds, Senator Rubio.
0534	RUBIO	I just want to say, at least on behalf of me and my family, I thank God all the time it was George W. Bush in the White House on 911 and not Al Gore.
0535	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0536	RUBIO	And you can  I think you can look back in hindsight and say a couple of things, but he kept us safe.
0537	RUBIO	And not only did he keep us safe, but no matter what you want to say about weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was in violation of U.N. resolutions, in open violation, and the world wouldn't do anything about it, and George W. Bush enforced what the international community refused to do.
0538	RUBIO	And again, he kept us safe, and I am forever grateful to what he did for this country.
0539	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0540	TRUMP	How did he keep us safe when the World Trade Center  the World  excuse me.
0541	TRUMP	I lost hundreds of friends.

0543	TRUMP	He kept us safe?
0544	TRUMP	That is not safe.
0545	TRUMP	That is not safe, Marco.
0546	TRUMP	That is not safe.
0547	RUBIO	The World Trade Center came down because Bill Clinton didn't kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill him.
0548	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0549	TRUMP	And George Bush  by the way, George Bush had the chance, also, and he didn't listen to the advice of his C.I.A.
0550	DICKERSON	All right, Dr. Carson, we have a cleansing...
0551	BUSH	Can I just...
0552	DICKERSON	We have a cleansing...
0553	BUSH	I'm not going to invite Donald Trump to the rally in Charleston on Monday afternoon when my brother is coming to speak.
0554	TRUMP	I don't want to go.
0555	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0556	BUSH	I'm rescinding the invitation.
0557	BUSH	I thought you might want to come, but I guess not.
0558	DICKERSON	All right.
0559	DICKERSON	Well, Dr. Carson, I have got a question now for you.
0560	DICKERSON	A moment of pause here.
0561	DICKERSON	You have said, Dr. Carson, that  referring to yourself, that people bought into the idea that, quote, "A nice person can't be tough on terrorists."
0562	DICKERSON	You have called for loosening the rules of engagement for the military, which could lead to more civilian casualties.
0563	DICKERSON	So, explain why those casualties would be acceptable in the fight against ISIS?
0564	CARSON	Well, first of all, let me just address the Iraq question.
0565	CARSON	You know, I was not particularly in favor of us going to war in Iraq, primarily because I have studied, you know, the Middle East, recognizing that those are nations that are ruled by dictators and have been for thousands of years.
0566	CARSON	And when you go in and you remove one of those dictators, unless you have an appropriate plan for replacing them, you're going to have chaos.
0567	CARSON	Now, fortunately, we were able to stabilize the situation, and it was the current administration that turned tail and ran and destabilized the situation.
0568	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0569	CARSON	Now, having said that, in terms of the rules of engagement, I was talking about, you know, Obama has said, you know, we shouldn't bomb tankers, you know, coming out of refineries because there may be people in there, or because the environment may be hurt.
0570	CARSON	You know, that's just asinine thinking.
0571	CARSON	And the fact of the matter is...
0572	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0573	CARSON	You know, we  obviously, you're not going to accomplish all of your goals without some collateral damage.
0574	CARSON	You have to be able to assess what is acceptable and what is not.
0575	DICKERSON	All right, thank you, Dr. Carson.
0576	DICKERSON	We're going to have to take a commercial break here.
0577	DICKERSON	Thank you to all the candidates.
0578	DICKERSON	We'll be right back with CBS News's 2016 debate in Greenville, South Carolina.
0579	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0580	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0581	DICKERSON	We're back with the Republicans who could be president.
0582	DICKERSON	The topic now is money and how the candidates would spend it.
0583	DICKERSON	We'll turn the questioning over to Kimberley Strassel of The Wall Street Journal and Major Garrett of CBS News.
0584	DICKERSON	Kim?
0585	STRASSEL	Mr. Trump.
0586	TRUMP	Yes.
0587	STRASSEL	You have made a lot of promises and you have also  you're the only candidate who has said he would not touch entitlements.
0588	STRASSEL	The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that your ideas would cost an additional $12 trillion to $15 trillion over the next 10 years and that we would have to have annual economic growth of anywhere from 7.7 percent to 9 percent annually to pay for them.
0589	STRASSEL	Are you proposing more than you can actually deliver, at least not without big deficits?
0590	TRUMP	First of all, the  when you say I'm the only candidate, if you listen to the Democrats, they want to do many things to Social Security, and I want to do them on its own merit.
0591	TRUMP	You listen to them, what they want to do to Social Security, none of these folks are getting elected, O.K., whether they can do it or not.
0592	TRUMP	I'm going to save Social Security.
0593	TRUMP	I'm going to bring jobs back from China.
0594	TRUMP	I'm going to bring jobs back from Mexico and from Japan, where they're all  every country throughout the world  now Vietnam, that's the new one.
0595	TRUMP	They are taking our jobs.
0596	TRUMP	They are taking our wealth.
0597	TRUMP	They are taking our base.
0598	TRUMP	And you and I have had this discussion.
0599	TRUMP	We're going to make our economy strong again.
0600	TRUMP	I'm lowering taxes.
0601	TRUMP	We have $2.5 trillion offshore.
0602	TRUMP	We have 2.5 trillion that I think is actually five trillion because the government has no idea when they say 2.5, they have no idea what they're doing or saying, as they've proven very well.
0603	TRUMP	We're going to bring that money back.
0604	TRUMP	You take a look at what happened just this week.
0605	TRUMP	China bought the Chicago Stock Exchange, China, a Chinese company.
0606	TRUMP	Carrier is moving to Mexico, air conditioning company.
0607	TRUMP	Not only the ones I talk about all the time, Nabisco and Ford and  they're all moving out.
0608	TRUMP	We have an economy that last quarter, G.D.P.
0609	TRUMP	didn't grow.
0610	TRUMP	It was flat.
0611	TRUMP	We have to make our economy grow again.
0612	TRUMP	We're dying.
0613	TRUMP	This country is dying.
0614	TRUMP	And our workers are losing their jobs, and you're going...
0615	STRASSEL	But in terms of...
0616	TRUMP	I'm the only one who is going to save Social Security, believe me.
0617	STRASSEL	O.K.
0618	STRASSEL	But how would you actually do that?
0619	STRASSEL	Can I ask you?
0620	STRASSEL	Because right now, Social Security and Medicare...
0621	TRUMP	Because you have tremendous waste.
0622	TRUMP	I'll tell you...
0623	STRASSEL	They take up twothirds of the federal budget, and they're growing.
0624	TRUMP	You have tremendous waste, fraud and abuse.
0625	TRUMP	That we're taking care of.
0626	TRUMP	That we're taking care of.
0627	TRUMP	It's tremendous.
0628	TRUMP	We have in Social Security right now thousands and thousands of people that are over 106 years old.
0629	TRUMP	Now, you know they don't exist.
0630	TRUMP	They don't exist.
0631	TRUMP	There's tremendous waste, fraud and abuse, and we're going to get it.
0632	TRUMP	But we're not going to hurt the people who have been paying into Social Security their whole life and then all of a sudden they're supposed to get less.
0633	TRUMP	We're bringing our jobs back.
0634	TRUMP	We're going to make our economy great again.
0635	GARRETT	Senator Cruz.
0636	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0637	GARRETT	John mentioned this is about dollars and incentives.
0638	GARRETT	We also want to talk about economic growth engagements.
0639	GARRETT	You have proposed a consumption tax, you called it the "back tax."
0640	GARRETT	Some analysts compare it more to an attributed "valueadded tax."
0641	GARRETT	From the perspective from economic growth in building wages, how does that work, and how would you address those longstanding conservative concerns that something approaching the "valueadded tax" would be used to constantly increase those rates to pay for future government spending and become an escalator of taxation, not of growth?
0642	CRUZ	Well, let me say it at the outset that everyone here understands  everyone understands that how  that the middle class has been left behind in the last seven years of the Obama economy, and we've got to bring jobs back.
0643	CRUZ	We've got to get people back to work.
0644	CRUZ	We've got to get wages going up again.
0645	CRUZ	We've got to get people moving from parttime work to fulltime work.
0646	CRUZ	We all agree on that, but it's not going to be solved with magic pixie dust.
0647	CRUZ	It's just going to be solved by declaring into the air, "Let there be jobs."
0648	CRUZ	We actually have to understand the principles that made America great in the first place.
0649	CRUZ	Now, where do you get economic growth?
0650	CRUZ	If you look at cause and effect over our nation's history, every time we lessen the burden of Washington on smallbusiness owners, on job creators, we see incredible economic growth.
0651	CRUZ	You do that through tax reform and regulatory reform.
0652	CRUZ	My tax plan  typical family of four, first $36,000 you earn, you pay nothing in taxes  no income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing.
0653	CRUZ	Above 10 percent, everyone pays the same simple, flat 10 percent income rate.
0654	CRUZ	It's flat and fair.
0655	CRUZ	You can fill out your taxes on a postcard, and we abolish the I.R.S.
0656	CRUZ	If you want to see the postcard, I've got it on my website.
0657	GARRETT	Now, the question  conservatives have sort of this idea conceptually for a long time, but especially on this consumption valueadded tax system.
0658	GARRETT	In Europe, where it exists, it has become an escalator of taxation to feed government spending, and that's why conservatives have long resisted it.
0659	GARRETT	Why and what would you do as president to make sure that doesn't happen?
0660	CRUZ	Now, Major, the business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a VAT.
0661	CRUZ	A VAT in Europe is a sales tax.
0662	CRUZ	The business flat tax is not a sales tax, it is a tax of 16 percent opposed fairly and evenly across the board on all business.
0663	CRUZ	One of the things that's critical is we're doing that in conjunction with abolishing the corporate income tax, with abolishing the Obamacare taxes, with abolishing the payroll taxes, which are the biggest taxes paid by most working Americans, and with abolishing the death tax, which is cruel and unfair.
0664	CRUZ	And you asked about economic growth  the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated a simple flat tax that would produce 4.9 million new jobs, it would increase capital investment by 44 percent and would lift everyone's income by double digits.
0665	CRUZ	That's how you turn the country around, not just hoping and praying for it, but implementing policies that work.
0666	STRASSEL	O.K., I have a question, a related tax question.
0667	STRASSEL	Senator Rubio, you have the highest tax rate of anyone up on the stage in terms of the top tax rates, 35 percent.
0668	STRASSEL	Some economists say, "It would limit its potential to boost economic growth."
0669	STRASSEL	You do that so that you will have more revenue to pay for a tripling of the Child Tax Credit.
0670	STRASSEL	Normally, it's liberals who like to use the tax code to insert social policy.
0671	STRASSEL	Why should conservatives who want to tax adopt the other side's approach?
0672	RUBIO	Well, because I'm influencing social policy  this is their money.
0673	RUBIO	This is the money of parents.
0674	RUBIO	You don't earn the tax credit unless you're working.
0675	RUBIO	That's your money, it doesn't belong to government.
0676	RUBIO	Here's what I don't understand.
0677	RUBIO	If a business takes their money and they invest in the piece of the equipment, they get to write off their taxes.
0678	RUBIO	But if a parent takes money that they have earned to work and invests in their children, they don't?
0679	RUBIO	This makes no sense.
0680	RUBIO	Parenting is the most important job any of us will ever have.
0681	RUBIO	Family formation is the most important thing in society.
0682	RUBIO	So what my tax plan does, is it does create, especially for working families, an additional Child Tax Credit.
0683	RUBIO	So that parents who are working get to keep more of their own money, not the government's money, to invest in their children to go to school, to go to a private school, to buy a new backpack.
0684	RUBIO	Let me tell you, if you're a parent that's struggling, then you know that $50 a month is the difference between a new pair of shoes this month or not getting a new pair of shoes for your kids.
0685	RUBIO	I'm going to have a tax plan that is profamily, because the family is the most important institution in society.
0686	RUBIO	You cannot have a strong country without strong families.
0687	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0688	STRASSEL	Governor Kasich, this on is on size of government.
0689	STRASSEL	In 2013, you pushed through a Medicaid reform in your state over the rejections of many of the Republicans in your state.
0690	STRASSEL	Total enrollment and overall cost of program have gone well beyond what anyone had expected, including yourself.
0691	STRASSEL	How can you argue that this overall growth fits in with conservative ambition to significantly cut back on the size of federal welfare programs?
0692	KASICH	Yeah.
0693	KASICH	Well, first of all, those numbers, incorrect.
0694	KASICH	We are  our Medicaid programs are coming in below cost estimates, and our Medicaid program in the second year grew at 2.5 percent.
0695	KASICH	And Kimberley, let me tell you, when we expand Medicaid and we treat the mentally ill, then they don't live under a bridge or live in a prison, where they cost $22,500 a year.
0696	KASICH	When we take the drug addicted and we treat them in the prisons, we stop the revolving door of people in and out of prisons, and we save $22,500 a year.
0697	KASICH	Guess what else?
0698	KASICH	They get their lives back.
0699	KASICH	And the working poor, they're now getting health care.
0700	KASICH	And you know that about a third of the people who are now getting that health care are people who are suffering very serious illnesses, particularly cancer.
0701	KASICH	So, what I would tell you is, we've gone from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus.
0702	KASICH	We've cut taxes by more than any governor in America by $5 billion.
0703	KASICH	We have grown the number of jobs by 400,000 privatesector jobs since I've been governor.
0704	KASICH	Our credit is strong.
0705	KASICH	Our pensions are strong.
0706	KASICH	And frankly, we leave no one behind.
0707	KASICH	Economic growth is not an end unto itself.
0708	KASICH	We want everyone to rise, and we will make them personally responsible for the help that they get.
0709	KASICH	And that is exactly the program we're driving in Ohio.
0710	KASICH	And, boy, people ought to look at Ohio, because it has got a good formula.

0712	GARRETT	Governor Bush, a question for you  but if you want to jump in, please.
0713	BUSH	I'd like  can I  can I...
0714	GARRETT	Jump in, and then I've got a question for you.
0715	BUSH	Look, I admire the fact that Governor Kasich is supporting spending more money on drug treatment and mental health.
0716	BUSH	I think that's a high priority all across this country, but expanding Obamacare is what we're talking about, and Obamacare's expansion, even though the federal government is paying for the great majority of it, is creating further debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren.
0717	BUSH	We should be fighting Obamacare, repealing Obamacare, replacing it with something totally different.
0718	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0719	BUSH	When I was  as a private citizen, Florida was confronted with the choice.
0720	BUSH	The governor was supportive of doing what John did.
0721	BUSH	So was the Florida Senate.
0722	BUSH	A committed speaker of the House asked me to go as a private citizen to make the case against the expansion.
0723	BUSH	I did, and it wasn't expanded there, just as it wasn't expanded in South Carolina under Governor Haley.
0724	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0725	GARRETT	Real quickly, jump in, because I have got a question for Governor Bush, but jump in.
0726	KASICH	Yeah, let me say a couple of things.
0727	KASICH	First of all, when Jeb was governor, his first four years as governor, he expand  his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine.
0728	KASICH	O.K.?
0729	KASICH	It's just a fact.
0730	KASICH	Now, with Obamacare, I've not only sued the administration, I did not set up an exchange.
0731	KASICH	And he knows that I'm not for Obamacare, never have been.
0732	KASICH	But here's what's interesting about Medicaid.
0733	KASICH	You know who expanded Medicaid five times to try to help the folks and give them opportunity so that you could rise and get a job?
0734	KASICH	President Ronald Reagan.
0735	KASICH	Now, the fact of the matter is, we expanded to get people on their feet, and once they're on their feet, we are giving them the training and the efforts that they need to be able to get work and pull out of that situation.
0736	GARRETT	Understood, Governor Kasich.
0737	KASICH	That's what we're doing in our state.
0738	BUSH	South Carolina  South Carolinians need to know this, because the Cato Institute, which grades governors based on their spending, rank him right at the bottom.
0739	GARRETT	Yeah, Governor Bush, fine.
0740	BUSH	And Governor Haley is ranked at the top.
0741	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0742	GARRETT	Let me get in a question from...
0743	BUSH	No.
0744	BUSH	He mentioned my name.
0745	GARRETT	I understand, I understand.
0746	BUSH	Let me finish, though.
0747	BUSH	No, no, no  hey, wait, wait, wait.
0748	BUSH	Just hold, Major, hold, Major.
0749	BUSH	Hold on, Major.
0750	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0751	BUSH	South Carolinians want to make that, they elect the most conservative governor or candidate that can win.
0752	KASICH	Let me  let's tell you...
0753	GARRETT	I have a question on economic growth, Governor Bush.
0754	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0755	KASICH	Major  Major, we can't  we've got to  look, I have got to correct the record.
0756	KASICH	And the fact of the matter is, we went from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus.
0757	KASICH	We're up 400,000 jobs.
0758	KASICH	Our credit is rock solid.
0759	KASICH	And I don't know...
0760	GARRETT	A
0761	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0762	GARRETT	, Governor.
0763	KASICH	Look, the bottom line is the people of this  of this country and this state want to see everybody rise, and they want to see unity, and I don't want to get into all this fighting tonight, because people are frankly sick of the negative campaigning.
0764	GARRETT	I know, understood.
0765	GARRETT	Governor Bush.
0766	KASICH	And I'm going to stay positive about what I want to do from the...
0767	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0768	GARRETT	Governor Bush, from the perspective, economic growth  viewed from this perspective of economic growth, you have proposed a tax on hedge fund managers.
0769	GARRETT	The Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative tax group you're probably aware of, has said no Republican should be for higher taxes on capital gains.
0770	GARRETT	And many conservatives wonder if this proposal of yours would undermine not only that philosophy, but undercut your projection of 4 percent economic growth annually under your presidency?
0771	BUSH	Of course not.
0772	BUSH	It won't have an impact on hedge funds managers paying ordinary income.
0773	BUSH	In fact, it's not just hedge fund people, but people that are doing  they're in the business of investing other people's money, getting capital gains treatment is not appropriate.
0774	BUSH	They should be paying ordinary income.
0775	BUSH	That's their business.
0776	BUSH	They're grateful to be able to make a lot of money, I'm sure.
0777	BUSH	And what we do is lower the rates.
0778	BUSH	It's not the end of the world that private equity people and hedge fund folks that are, right now, getting capital gains treatment for the income they earn, pay ordinary income like everybody else in this room.
0779	BUSH	That's not a problem at all.
0780	BUSH	What we need to do is reform the tax code to simplify the rates, to shift power away from Washington, D.C. That's what I did as governor of the state of Florida, $19 billion dollars of tax cuts, and it stimulated seven out of the eight years.
0781	BUSH	Florida led the nation in job growth.
0782	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0783	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson, before we go to break, could you give us your sense of this conversation about either Medicaid or economic growth through taxation?
0784	CARSON	Well, first of all, let me just mention on the tax issue.
0785	CARSON	Bencarson.com, go read about it, because my tax plan has been praised by Cato, by Wall Street Journal.
0786	CARSON	Forbes said it is the best, the most progrowth tax plan, and it's based on real fairness for everybody.
0787	CARSON	Starts at the 150 percent poverty level, but even the people below that have to pay something, because everybody has to have skin in the game, and the millions of people can't, you know, talk about what other people have to pay and have no skin in the game.
0788	CARSON	And it deals with corporate tax rate, and makes it the same as everybody else...
0789	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
0790	CARSON	...everybody pays exactly the same.
0791	DICKERSON	Doctor...
0792	CARSON	... And, as far as Medicare and Medicaid, my main goal is to get rid of Obamacare and put the care back in the hands of
0793	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0794	CARSON	...
0795	GARRETT	... Dr. Carson...
0796	DICKERSON	... Dr. Carson, I'm sorry, we have to go to a commercial.
0797	DICKERSON	The free market wants what it wants.
0798	DICKERSON	Back soon with the 2016 Republican debate in Greenville, South Carolina.
0799	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0800	DICKERSON	Welcome back.
0801	DICKERSON	We'll begin the second half of the debate with one of the hottest issues in the Republican campaign, immigration.
0802	DICKERSON	But before I turn it back to Major Garrett and Kim Strassel, I have one question for Mr. Trump.
0803	DICKERSON	Mr. Trump, in the Republican National Committee's Spanishlanguage response to the State of the Union, Congressman DiazBalart said, quote, "It's essential that we find a legislative solution," talking about immigration, "to offer a permanent and humane solution to those who live in the shadows.
0804	DICKERSON	What does that mean to you, "a humane solution to those who live in the shadows"?
0805	TRUMP	I want everybody taken care of, but we have to take care of our people in this country.
0806	TRUMP	We're not taking care of our people.
0807	TRUMP	We have no border.
0808	TRUMP	We have no control.
0809	TRUMP	People are flooding across.
0810	TRUMP	We can't have it.
0811	TRUMP	We either have a border, and I'm very strongly  I'm not proposing.
0812	TRUMP	I will build a wall.
0813	TRUMP	I will build a wall.
0814	TRUMP	Remember this, the wall will be paid for by Mexico.
0815	TRUMP	We are not being treated right.
0816	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0817	TRUMP	We are not being treated properly.
0818	TRUMP	If we don't have borders, if we don't have strength, we don't have a country.
0819	TRUMP	People are flowing across.
0820	TRUMP	We have to take care of our people.
0821	TRUMP	Believe me.
0822	GARRETT	Senator Rubio...
0823	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0824	GARRETT	For the purposes of the lines  lines you would draw legislatively as a president on immigration reform, define amnesty.
0825	RUBIO	Well, first of all, I think amnesty is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that  I've never supported that.
0826	RUBIO	I do not support that.
0827	RUBIO	I think there has to be consequences for violating our immigration laws.
0828	RUBIO	What I think is clear about this issue to begin with is we're not going to be able to make progress on illegal immigration until first, illegal immigration is brought under control.
0829	RUBIO	You go back to 1986, when they legalized three million people and they promised to secure the border.
0830	RUBIO	It didn't happen, and as a result, people have lost trust in the federal government.
0831	RUBIO	It is now clear that the only way to make progress on immigration is not just to pass a law that enforces the law, but actually prove to people that it's working.
0832	RUBIO	They want to see the wall built.
0833	RUBIO	They want to see the additional border agents.
0834	RUBIO	They want to see EVerify.
0835	RUBIO	They want to see an entryexit tracking system.
0836	RUBIO	Forty percent of the people in this country illegally are entering legally and overstaying visas.
0837	RUBIO	And only after all of that is in place, then we'll see what the American people are willing to support on this issue.
0838	RUBIO	I think the American people will be very reasonable, but responsible, about how you handle someone who has been here a long time, who can pass a background check, who pays a fine and starts paying taxes and all they want is a work permit.
0839	RUBIO	But you can't do any of that until you prove to people that illegal immigration is under control once and for all.
0840	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0841	STRASSEL	Senator Cruz.
0842	STRASSEL	Senator Cruz, you have promised to deport illegal aliens.
0843	STRASSEL	You have also promised to reverse President Obama's executive action that gives temporary amnesty to illegals brought here by their parent as children.
0844	STRASSEL	As president, you would have the names and addresses of the some 800,000 of those that have registered under that action.
0845	STRASSEL	Now, you have said that in this country, we shouldn't go door to door, look for illegals, but in this case you would have a list.
0846	STRASSEL	Would you use it?
0847	CRUZ	Well, you know, your question highlights a sharp difference on immigration on this stage.
0848	CRUZ	You know, in a Republican primary, everyone talks tough on immigration.
0849	CRUZ	Everyone is against illegal immigration in a Republican primary.
0850	CRUZ	But as voters, we've been burned over and over again by people that give us a great campaign speech and they don't walk the walk.
0851	CRUZ	There are sharp differences on amnesty.
0852	CRUZ	If you look at the folks on this stage, when Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and establishment Republicans were leading the fight to pass a massive amnesty plan, I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and the American people and led the fight to defeat that amnesty plan.
0853	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0854	STRASSEL	So would you  would you use the addresses?
0855	CRUZ	Now, that moment...
0856	STRASSEL	Would you pick them up?
0857	CRUZ	That moment was what Reagan would call "a time for choosing."
0858	CRUZ	When it comes to deciding which side of the line you're on, the RubioSchumer amnesty plan...
0859	SYSTEM	[ booing ]
0860	CRUZ	...apparently supported by the donor class, which is why Washington supported it.
0861	CRUZ	The RubioSchumer amnesty plan passed the Senate, and it was on the verge of passing the House.
0862	CRUZ	House leadership intended to take it up and pass it with the Democrats overruling most of the Republicans.
0863	CRUZ	And the question for anyone on illegal immigration is, where were you in that fight?
0864	CRUZ	Where did you stand?
0865	CRUZ	You are right.
0866	CRUZ	There is a difference between Senator Rubio and me on this question.
0867	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0868	STRASSEL	Senator Rubio, your reply.
0869	RUBIO	We're going to have to do this again, O.K.?
0870	RUBIO	When that issue was being debated, Ted Cruz, at a committee hearing, very passionately said, I want immigration reform to pass, I want people to be able to come out of the shadows.
0871	RUBIO	And he proposed an amendment that would legalized people here.
0872	RUBIO	Not only that, he proposed doubling the number of green cards.
0873	RUBIO	He proposed a 500 percent increase on guest workers.
0874	RUBIO	Now his position is different.
0875	RUBIO	Now he is a passionate opponent of all those things.
0876	RUBIO	So he either wasn't telling the truth then or he isn't telling the truth now, but to argue he is a purist on immigration is just not true.
0877	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0878	CRUZ	Major, I get a response to that.
0879	GARRETT	Very quickly, Senator Cruz.
0880	STRASSEL	All right.
0881	STRASSEL	Senator Cruz.
0882	STRASSEL	Your response, Senator Cruz.
0883	CRUZ	You know, the lines are very, very clear.
0884	CRUZ	Marco right now supports citizenship for 12 million people here illegally.
0885	CRUZ	I oppose citizenship.
0886	CRUZ	Marco stood on the debate stage and said that.
0887	CRUZ	But I would note not only that  Marco has a long record when it comes to amnesty.
0888	CRUZ	In the state of Florida, as speaker of the house, he supported instate tuition for illegal immigrants.
0889	CRUZ	In addition to that, Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama's illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office.
0890	CRUZ	I have promised to rescind every single illegal executive action, including that one.
0891	SYSTEM	[ applause and booing ]
0892	CRUZ	And on the question...
0893	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0894	RUBIO	Well, first of all, I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision, because he doesn't speak Spanish.
0895	RUBIO	And second of all, the other point that I would make...
0896	SYSTEM	[ in Spanish ]
0897	CRUZ	.
0898	RUBIO	Look, this is a disturbing pattern now, because for a number of weeks now, Ted Cruz has just been telling lies.
0899	RUBIO	He lied about Ben Carson in Iowa.

0901	RUBIO	He lies about Planned Parenthood.
0902	RUBIO	He lies about marriage.
0903	RUBIO	He's lying about all sorts of things.
0904	RUBIO	And now he makes things up.
0905	RUBIO	The bottom line is this is a campaign and people are watching it.
0906	RUBIO	And they see the truth behind all these issues.
0907	RUBIO	And here is the truth, Ted Cruz supported legalizing people that were in this country...
0908	CRUZ	That is simply...
0909	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0910	RUBIO	... and only now does he say...
0911	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0912	CRUZ	That is absolutely false.
0913	CRUZ	What he said is knowingly false.
0914	CRUZ	And I would note, if you want to assess  if you want to assess...
0915	RUBIO	Well, we'll put on our website, marcorubio.com.
0916	RUBIO	We're going to...

0925	GARRETT	Governor Bush, I want to bring this out to a little wider philosophical aspect, if you will.
0926	BUSH	Thank you.
0927	GARRETT	You have said illegal immigrants, quote, "broke the law, but it's not a felony," still quoting you, "it's an act of love, it's an act of commitment to your family."
0928	GARRETT	Mr. Trump has, as you are well aware, denounced that statement over and over.
0929	GARRETT	Do you still believe it?
0930	GARRETT	What does that mean to you?
0931	GARRETT	And how does that inform your approach to immigration reform?
0932	BUSH	Great question.
0933	BUSH	I feel like I have to get into my inner Chris Christie, and point out that the reason why I should be president is listening to two senators talk about arcane amendments to bills that didn't pass.
0934	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0935	BUSH	This is  this is the problem.
0936	BUSH	We need a leader to fix this problem.
0937	BUSH	And I have a detailed plan to do just that, including controlling the border, dealing with the visa overstayers, making sure that we have a path to legal status, not to citizenship, for those that come out from the shadows and pay a fine, learn English, don't commit crimes, work and pay taxes.
0938	BUSH	That is the better approach.
0939	GARRETT	Fundamentally, do you believe this rhetoric is insufficiently compassionate to this issue?
0940	BUSH	The great majority of people that come to this country come because they have no other choice.
0941	BUSH	They want to come to provide for their families.
0942	BUSH	That doesn't mean it's right.
0943	BUSH	That doesn't mean it's right.
0944	BUSH	We should pick who comes to our country.
0945	BUSH	We should control our border.
0946	BUSH	Coming here legally should be a lot easier than coming here illegally.
0947	BUSH	But the motivation, they're not all rapists, as youknowwho said.
0948	BUSH	They're not that.
0949	BUSH	These are people that are coming to provide for their families.
0950	BUSH	And we should show a little more respect for the fact that they're struggling.
0951	BUSH	It doesn't mean we shouldn't be controlling the border.
0952	BUSH	That's exactly what we should be doing.
0953	GARRETT	Mr. Trump...
0954	TRUMP	Look...
0955	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0956	TRUMP	...When I announced that I was running for president on June 16th, illegal immigration wasn't even a subject.

0958	TRUMP	Now, I don't often agree with Marco, and I don't often agree with Ted, but I can in this case.
0959	TRUMP	The weakest person on this stage by far on illegal immigration is Jeb Bush.
0960	TRUMP	They come out of an act of love, whether you like it or not.
0961	TRUMP	He is so weak on illegal immigration it's laughable, and everybody knows it.

1004	TRUMP	Been reported in 10 different news...
1005	GARRETT	... We will leave the moon metaphors to be adjudicated later, I assure you.
1006	GARRETT	Governor Kasich, you said earlier this week in South Carolina, the concept, the idea of deporting 11 million undocumented workers in this country is nuts.
1007	GARRETT	Why is it you are so opposed to that idea?
1008	GARRETT	Senator Cruz has said it's a simple application of existing law.
1009	GARRETT	The application of that is not inhumane, it is just.
1010	GARRETT	Why do you disagree?
1011	KASICH	Before I get to that, this is the ninth or 10th debate.
1012	KASICH	What I've been watching here, this back and forth, and these attacks, some of them are personal.
1013	KASICH	I think we're fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don't stop this.
1014	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1015	KASICH	I mean, the fact is  you know what?
1016	KASICH	I would suggest, why don't we take off all the negative ads and all the negative comments down from television and let us just talk about what we're for, and let's sell that, and the Republican Party will be stronger as a result...

1018	KASICH	... [

1021	KASICH	First of all, I'm for sealing the border, O.K.?
1022	KASICH	And then I'm for a guest worker program.
1023	KASICH	People can come in, work and go back home.
1024	KASICH	We haven't closed the border because special interests, I believe, blocked it.
1025	KASICH	Then, we have 11 and a half million people here.
1026	KASICH	If they have not committed a crime since they've been here, make them pay a fine and some back taxes, and give them a path to legalization, never to citizenship.
1027	KASICH	It is not going to happen that we're going to run around and try to drag 11 and a half million people out of their homes.
1028	KASICH	I'll tell you this.
1029	KASICH	Within the first hundred days, I will send a plan like this to the Congress of the United States, and if I'm president, I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts right now, it will pass.
1030	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
1031	KASICH	That is a reasonable proposal that the people of this country, in my judgment, will support, and so will the bulk of the Congress of the United States.

1033	STRASSEL	Moving subjects.
1034	STRASSEL	Dr. Carson, this week Morgan Stanley agreed to pay a $3.2 billion fine to state and federal authorities for contributing to the mortgage crisis.
1035	STRASSEL	You have a lot of Democrats out saying that we should be jailing more executives, so two questions.
1036	STRASSEL	Should financial executives be held legally responsible for financial crisis, and do you think fines like these are an effective way to deter companies from future behavior like that?
1037	CARSON	Well, first of all, please go to my website, bencarson.com, and read my immigration policy, O.K.?
1038	CARSON	Because it actually makes sense.
1039	CARSON	Now, the  as far as these fines are concerned, you know?
1040	CARSON	Here's the big problem.
1041	CARSON	We've got all these government regulators, and all they're doing is running around looking for people to fine.
1042	CARSON	And we've got 645 different federal agencies and subagencies.
1043	CARSON	Way, way too many, and they don't have anything else to do.
1044	CARSON	I think what we really need to do is start trimming the regulatory agencies rather than going after the people who are trying to increase the viability, economic viability of our society.
1045	CARSON	Now, that doesn't mean there aren't some people out there who are doing bad things.
1046	CARSON	But I'm not sure that the way to solve that problem is by increasing all the regulatory burden.
1047	CARSON	You know, when you consider how much regulations cost us each year, you know?
1048	CARSON	$2 trillion dollars per family, $24,000 per family, that happens to be the same level as the poverty level...
1049	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]
1050	CARSON	... for a family of four.
1051	CARSON	If you want to get rid of poverty, get rid of all the regulations.
1052	DICKERSON	Senator Cruz, I have a question for you.
1053	DICKERSON	Speaker Paul Ryan has made a big commitment to trying to lift the 50 million poor out of poverty.
1054	DICKERSON	Arthur Brooks, who is the president of the American Enterprise Institute, says, quote, "If we are not warriors for the poor every day, free enterprise has no matter."
1055	DICKERSON	How you have been, in your campaign, a warrior for the poor?
1056	CRUZ	I think it is a very important question because the people who have been hurt the most in the Obama economy had been the most vulnerable.
1057	CRUZ	It's been young people.
1058	CRUZ	It's been Hispanics.
1059	CRUZ	It's been AfricanAmericans.
1060	CRUZ	It's been single moms.
1061	CRUZ	We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today in any year since 1977.
1062	CRUZ	And the sad reality is big government, massive taxes, massive regulation, doesn't work.
1063	CRUZ	What we need to do instead is bring back booming economic growth, let  small businesses are the heart of the economy.
1064	CRUZ	Twothirds of all new jobs come from small businesses.
1065	CRUZ	If we want to lift people out of poverty  you know, I think of these issues from the perspective of my dad.
1066	CRUZ	My dad fled Cuba in 1957.
1067	CRUZ	He was just 18.
1068	CRUZ	He couldn't speak English.
1069	CRUZ	He had nothing.
1070	CRUZ	He had $100 in his underwear.
1071	CRUZ	And he washed dishes making 50 cents an hour and paid his way through school.
1072	CRUZ	Today, my dad is a pastor.
1073	CRUZ	He travels the country preaching the gospel.
1074	CRUZ	Now, I think about all of these issues.
1075	CRUZ	How would it impact my dad when he was washing dishes?
1076	CRUZ	If we had Obamacare in place right now, the odds are very high my father would have been laid off, because it's teenaged kids like my dad who have gotten laid off.
1077	CRUZ	If he didn't get laid off, the odds are high he would have had his hours forcibly reduced to 28, 29 hours a week.
1078	CRUZ	We need to lift the burdens on small businesses so you have jobs, and we need welfare reform that gets people off of welfare and back to work.
1079	GARRETT	Mr. Trump  Mr. Trump.
1080	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1081	GARRETT	I was with you in Pendleton, South Carolina, earlier this week at the Rodeo Arena.
1082	GARRETT	It was a bit chilly there.
1083	GARRETT	You promised the crowd, and they rose to their feet, that if Ford or a company like were to move a factory to Mexico, you would try to stop it or threaten them with a 35 percent tax or tariff on every car sold.
1084	TRUMP	Or a tax.
1085	GARRETT	Right.
1086	GARRETT	So my question is, based on your understanding of the presidency, where do you derive that power?
1087	GARRETT	Would you need the consent of Congress to go along?
1088	GARRETT	And do you see the presidency as a perch from which you can cajole andor threaten private industry to do something you think is better for the U.S. economy?
1089	TRUMP	I would build consensus with Congress, and Congress would agree with me.
1090	TRUMP	I'll give you an example, because I don't like the idea of using executive orders like our president.
1091	TRUMP	It is a disaster what he's doing.
1092	TRUMP	I would build consensus, but consensus means you have to work hard.
1093	TRUMP	You have to cajole.
1094	TRUMP	You have to get them into the Oval Office and get them all together, and you have to make deals.
1095	TRUMP	Let me just tell you, I mentioned before, China  big Chinese company bought the Chicago Exchange.
1096	TRUMP	Kerry is moving  and if you saw the people, because they have a video of the announcement that Carrier is moving to Mexico, O.K.
1097	TRUMP	?
1098	TRUMP	Well, I'll tell you what.
1099	TRUMP	I would go right now to Carrier and I would say I am going to work awfully hard.
1100	TRUMP	You're going to make air conditioners now in Mexico.
1101	TRUMP	You're going to get all of these 1,400 people that are being laid off  they're laid off.

1103	TRUMP	They were  it was a very sad situation.
1104	TRUMP	You're going to go to Mexico.
1105	TRUMP	You're going to make air conditioners in Mexico, you're going to put them across our border with no tax.
1106	TRUMP	I'm going to tell them right now, I am going to get consensus from Congress and we're going to tax you when those air conditioners come.
1107	TRUMP	So stay where you are or build in the United States, because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers.

1115	DICKERSON	Mr. Trump, I have a question for you.
1116	DICKERSON	Presidents have to, on the one hand, be firm, but also be flexible.
1117	DICKERSON	You have been flexible and changed your opinion on a number of things, from abortion to Hillary Clinton.
1118	DICKERSON	But you have said, rightly, that it's just like Ronald Reagan, who changed his mind on things.
1119	DICKERSON	But at the same time, you're criticizing Senator Cruz for what you say is a change on immigration.
1120	DICKERSON	He disputes that, of course.
1121	DICKERSON	So, why is your change of opinion make you like Reagan, and when he changes his opinion, it's a huge character flaw?
1122	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1123	TRUMP	John, in life you have flexibility.
1124	TRUMP	You do have flexibility.
1125	TRUMP	When you're fighting wars, you're going one way, you have a plan.
1126	TRUMP	It's a beautiful plan.
1127	TRUMP	It can't lose.
1128	TRUMP	The enemy makes a change, and all of a sudden you have to change.
1129	TRUMP	You have to have flexibility.
1130	TRUMP	In Ronald Reagan, though, in terms of what we're talking about, was the great example.
1131	TRUMP	He was a somewhat liberal Democrat who became a somewhat, pretty strong conservative.
1132	TRUMP	He became  most importantly, he became a great president.
1133	TRUMP	He made many of the changes that I've made  I mean, I've seen as I grew up, I've seen, and as I get older and wiser, and I feel that I am a conservative.
1134	TRUMP	Now, I also feel I'm a commonsense conservative, because some of the views I don't agree with.
1135	TRUMP	And I think a lot of people agree with me, obviously, based on what's happening.
1136	DICKERSON	Which conservative idea don't you agree with?
1137	TRUMP	Well, I think these people always hit me with eminent domain, and frankly, I'm not in love with eminent domain.
1138	TRUMP	But eminent domain is something you need very strongly.
1139	TRUMP	When Jeb had said, "You used eminent domain privately for a parking lot."
1140	TRUMP	It wasn't for a parking lot.
1141	TRUMP	The state of New Jersey  too bad Chris Christie is not here, he could tell you  the state of New Jersey went to build a very large tower that was going to employ thousands of people.
1142	TRUMP	I mean, it was going to really do a big job in terms of economic development.
1143	TRUMP	Now, just so you understand, I got hit very hard.
1144	TRUMP	It's private, it's private eminent domain.
1145	TRUMP	You understand that they took over a stadium in Texas, and they used private eminent domain, but he just found that out after he made the charge.
1146	DICKERSON	All right.
1147	DICKERSON	Governor Bush, I think by "they," he is referring to your brother, these on the hook for your brother.
1148	TRUMP	Yeah.
1149	TRUMP	Well, Jeb wouldn't have known about it.
1150	BUSH	So, there  so, there is all sorts of intrigue about where I disagree with my brother, there would be one right there.
1151	BUSH	You should not use eminent domain for private purposes.
1152	BUSH	A baseball stadium or a parking lot for a limo...
1153	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1154	TRUMP	You shouldn't have used it then, Jeb.
1155	DICKERSON	But that was his brother.
1156	BUSH	It's very different.
1157	BUSH	Transmission lines, pipe lines, bridges and highways.
1158	BUSH	All of that is proper use of imminent domain.
1159	BUSH	Not to take an elderly woman's home to build a parking lot so that highrollers can come from New York City to build casinos in Atlantic City.
1160	STRASSEL	Senator Cruz, you were mentioned in the mix here, your response?
1161	CRUZ	You know, flexibility is a good thing, but it shouldn't  you shouldn't be flexible on core principles.
1162	CRUZ	I like Donald, he is an amazing entertainer, but his policies for most of his life...
1163	TRUMP	Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
1164	CRUZ	For most of his life, his policies have been very, very liberal.
1165	CRUZ	For most of his life, he has described himself as very pro choice and as a supporter of partial birth abortion.
1166	CRUZ	Right now, today, as a candidate, he supports federal taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood.
1167	CRUZ	I disagree with him on that.
1168	CRUZ	That's a matter of principle, and I'll tell you...
1169	TRUMP	You probably are worse than Jeb Bush.
1170	TRUMP	You are single biggest liar.
1171	TRUMP	This guy's lied  let me just tell you, this guy lied about Ben Carson when he took votes away from Ben Carson in Iowa, and he just continues.
1172	TRUMP	Today, we had robocalls saying, "Donald Trump is not going to run in South Carolina," where I'm leading by a lot.
1173	TRUMP	I'm not going to vote for Ted Cruz.
1174	TRUMP	This is the same thing he did to Ben Carson.
1175	TRUMP	This guy will say anything, nasty guy.
1176	TRUMP	Now I know why he doesn't have one endorsement from any of his colleagues.
1177	CRUZ	Don, I need to go on...
1178	TRUMP	He's a nasty guy.
1179	CRUZ	I will say, it is fairly remarkable to see Donald defending Ben after he called, "pathological," and compared him to a child molester.
1180	CRUZ	Both of which were offensive and wrong.
1181	CRUZ	But let me say this  you notice Donald didn't disagree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood.
1182	CRUZ	And Donald has this weird pattern, when you point to his own record, he screams, "Liar, liar, liar."
1183	CRUZ	You want to go...

1191	CRUZ	You can see it out of Donald's own mouth.

1193	CRUZ	You supported it when we were battling over defunding Planned Parenthood.
1194	CRUZ	You went on...
1195	TRUMP	That's a lot of lies.
1196	CRUZ	You said, "Planned Parenthood does wonderful things and we should not defund it."
1197	TRUMP	It does do wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion.
1198	CRUZ	So I'll tell you what...
1199	TRUMP	Excuse me.
1200	TRUMP	Excuse me, there are wonderful things having to do with women's health.
1201	CRUZ	You see, you and I...
1202	TRUMP	But not when it comes to abortion.
1203	CRUZ	Don, the reasoned principle matters.
1204	CRUZ	The reasoned principle matters, sadly was illustrated by the first questions today.

1220	DICKERSON	I understand, you're on deck, governor.
1221	BUSH	Also, he talked about one of my heroes, Ronald Reagan.
1222	BUSH	Ronald Reagan was a liberal maybe in the 1950s.
1223	BUSH	He was a conservative reformed governor for eight years before he became president, and no one should suggest he made an evolution for political purposes.
1224	BUSH	He was a conservative, and he didn't tear down people like Donald Trump is.
1225	BUSH	He tore down the Berlin Wall.

1243	CRUZ	I did not nominate him.
1244	CRUZ	I would not have nominated him.
1245	CRUZ	I would've nominated my former boss Liberman, who was Justice Scalia's first law clerk.
1246	CRUZ	And you know how I know that Donald's Supreme Court justices will be liberals?
1247	CRUZ	Because his entire life, he support liberals from Jimmy Carter, to Hillary Clinton, to John Kerry.

1263	RUBIO	Today, we have antipoverty programs that don't cure poverty.
1264	RUBIO	We don't cure poverty in America.
1265	RUBIO	Our antipoverty programs have become, in some instances, a way of life, a lifestyle.
1266	RUBIO	Now, we do need antipoverty programs, you can't have free enterprise programs without them, but not as a way of life.
1267	RUBIO	And so I have a very specific proposal on this and I don't  in 60 seconds, I can't describe it all, but it basically turns the program over to states.
1268	RUBIO	It allows states to design innovative programs that cure poverty, because I think Nikki Haley will do a better job curing poverty than Barack Obama.
1269	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1270	DICKERSON	Senator, I wanted to ask you, just going back to immigration, in the last debate, you listed your series of accomplishments in the Senate.
1271	DICKERSON	One thing you left off was  was immigration reform.
1272	DICKERSON	Is it the case that in your list of accomplishments you can't mention that?
1273	RUBIO	Well, no.
1274	RUBIO	It's not the case.
1275	RUBIO	It didn't pass, and we haven't solved immigration in this country.
1276	RUBIO	It's still a problem.
1277	RUBIO	It is worse today than it was three years ago, which is worse than it was five years ago.
1278	RUBIO	And it has to be confronted and solved.
1279	RUBIO	But the only way forward on this issue  you asked a question about flexibility.
1280	RUBIO	Let me tell you about that.
1281	RUBIO	One of the things that you need in leadership is the ability to understand that to get things done, you must figure out the way to get it done.
1282	RUBIO	You will not pass comprehensive immigration reform.
1283	RUBIO	People do not trust the federal government.
1284	RUBIO	They want to see the law being enforced.
1285	RUBIO	They want to see illegal immigration come under control.
1286	RUBIO	They want to see that wall.
1287	RUBIO	They want to see EVerify.
1288	RUBIO	They want to see all of these things working, and then they will have a conversation with you about what do you do with people that have been here a long time that are otherwise, you know, not criminals.
1289	RUBIO	But they're not going to do it until you first enforce the law.
1290	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson, I have...
1291	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1292	DICKERSON	...Dr. Carson, I have a question for you.
1293	DICKERSON	Candidates are...
1294	CARSON	Before you ask the question, can I respond to the  you know, they mentioned my name a couple of times.
1295	DICKERSON	All right.
1296	DICKERSON	You have 30 seconds, Doctor.
1297	CARSON	All right.
1298	CARSON	Well, first of all, you know, so many people have said to me, "You need to scream and jump and down  jump up and down like everybody else."
1299	CARSON	Is that really what you want?
1300	CARSON	What we just saw?
1301	CARSON	I don't think so.
1302	CARSON	And you know, I  when I got into this race, I decided to look under the hood of the engine of what runs Washington, D.C., and my first inclination was to run away, but I didn't do it because I'm thinking about our children and the fact that we are the United States of America.
1303	CARSON	And anybody up here is going to be much better than what's going to come on the other side.
1304	CARSON	And what happened tonight with  with Justice Scalia tells you that we cannot afford to lose this election, and we cannot be tearing each other down.
1305	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1306	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson, I  let me ask you a different question.
1307	DICKERSON	When you were  you were the first one, really, to talk about political correctness.
1308	DICKERSON	Everybody now talks about it, but that was really what sparked your  your rise.
1309	DICKERSON	Politicians are often accused of glossing over any hard choices people have to make, just always selling happy, nice things.
1310	DICKERSON	So in the  in the spirit of saying something that might be politically incorrect, tell the voters something that they need to hear but that might be politically incorrect?
1311	CARSON	Well, first of all, I'm not a politician, so I'm never going to become a politician.
1312	CARSON	But here's what  here's what people need to know.
1313	CARSON	People need to know that free college is not  it's a nonstarter.
1314	CARSON	You know, you have to look at our economic situation.
1315	CARSON	We're on the verge of economic collapse and, you know, we're  it's not just the $19 trillion, but it's also the $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities.
1316	CARSON	What we need to think about is, what does that do to the average person?
1317	CARSON	When we have a debt of that nature, it causes the Fed to change their policy, it causes the central bank to keep the  the rates low, and who does does that affect?
1318	CARSON	Mr. Average, who used to go to the bank every Friday and put part of his check in the bank and watch it grow over three decades and be able to retire with a nice nest egg, that's gone.
1319	CARSON	That part of the American dream is gone.
1320	CARSON	All of these things are disappearing, and Bernie Sanders and people like Hillary Clinton blame it on the rich.
1321	CARSON	They say those evil rich people, if we take their money we can solve the problem.
1322	CARSON	It's not the evil rich people.
1323	CARSON	It's the irresponsible, evil government.
1324	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1325	DICKERSON	Governor Kasich.
1326	DICKERSON	Governor Kasich, you've been described as the Democrats' favorite Republican.
1327	DICKERSON	You talked about in New Hampshire, Democrats would come up to you and say, "I hope you win."
1328	DICKERSON	Why will that help you win a Republican nomination?
1329	KASICH	You know, John, I think all people are the same.
1330	KASICH	Look, I did 106 town halls, and I've been doing them left and right here in South Carolina.
1331	KASICH	The first thing we have to do is grow the economy, and I know the formula because I was chairman in Washington when we balanced the budget and created so many jobs, and the same that we've been able to do in Ohio.
1332	KASICH	You need commonsense regulations so small business can flourish, you need lower taxes both on business and individuals, and you need a fiscal plan to be able to get ourselves in a situation where people can predict a little bit about the future when it comes to the fiscal issues.
1333	KASICH	And when you have that formula, combined with work force that's trained, you can explode the economy and create many jobs.
1334	KASICH	I have done it twice, and I want to go back to Washington and do it again.
1335	KASICH	John, the thing is, is I think that there are people now, these bluecollar Democrats  my dad was a bluecollar Democrat  the Democratic Party has left them.
1336	KASICH	When they're arguing about being socialists, they've left  they have lost those bluecollar Democrats.
1337	KASICH	And you know what I think they get out of me  is my sense of what they get out of me, and it's embarrassment about campaigns, you brag about yourself.
1338	KASICH	But I think I'm a uniter, I think people sense it.
1339	KASICH	I think they know I have the experience, and that I'm a man that can give people hope and a sense that they have the opportunity rise.
1340	KASICH	And I'll tell you, I love these bluecollar Democrats, because they're going to vote for us come next fall, promise you that.

1342	DICKERSON	Mr. Trump, let me ask you a question.
1343	DICKERSON	Presidents in both parties say that the one thing you need in your administration is somebody who can tell you you're wrong.
1344	DICKERSON	You don't necessarily seem like somebody who has somebody who tells you you're wrong a lot.
1345	DICKERSON	Can you tell us of an instance where somebody has said, "Donald Trump, you're wrong," and you listened to them?
1346	TRUMP	Well, I would say my wife tells me I'm wrong all the time.
1347	TRUMP	And I listen.
1348	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1349	DICKERSON	About what?
1350	TRUMP	Oh, let me just say  look, I am very open  I hired top people.
1351	TRUMP	I've had great success.
1352	TRUMP	I built a great, great company.
1353	TRUMP	I don't need to do this.
1354	TRUMP	I'm selffunding.
1355	TRUMP	I'm spending a lot of money.
1356	TRUMP	I've spent  like in New Hampshire, I spent $3 million.
1357	TRUMP	Jeb bush spent $44 million.
1358	TRUMP	He came in five, and I came in No.
1359	TRUMP	1.
1360	TRUMP	That's what the country needs, folks.
1361	TRUMP	I spent 3, he spends 42 of their money, of special interest money.
1362	TRUMP	And it's just  this is not going to make  excuse me.
1363	TRUMP	This is not going to make our country great again.
1364	TRUMP	This is not what we need in our country.
1365	TRUMP	We need people that know what the hell they're doing.
1366	TRUMP	And politicians, they're all talk, they're no action.
1367	TRUMP	And that's why people are supporting me.
1368	TRUMP	I do listen to people.
1369	TRUMP	I hire experts.
1370	TRUMP	I hire top, top people.
1371	TRUMP	And I do listen.
1372	TRUMP	And you know what?
1373	TRUMP	Sometimes they're wrong.
1374	TRUMP	You have to know what to do, when to do it.
1375	TRUMP	But sometimes they're wrong.
1376	DICKERSON	Let me  something, in talking to voters that they wish somebody would tell you to cut it out is the profanity.
1377	DICKERSON	What's your reaction to that?
1378	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1379	TRUMP	Well, I'll tell you  over the years, I've made many speeches.
1380	TRUMP	People have asked me, big companies have asked me to make speeches, and friends of mine that run big companies on success.
1381	TRUMP	And occasion, in order to sort of really highlight something, I'll use a profanity.
1382	TRUMP	One of the profanities that I got credited with using, that I didn't use, was a very bad word, two weeks ago, that I never used.
1383	TRUMP	I said, "You."
1384	TRUMP	And everybody said "Oh, he didn't say anything wrong."
1385	TRUMP	But you bleeped it, so everyone thinks I said the  I didn't say anything.
1386	TRUMP	I never said the word.
1387	TRUMP	It is very unfair, that criticism.
1388	TRUMP	Now, I will say this, with all of that being said, I have said I will not do it at all, because if I say a word that's a little bit off color, a little bit, it ends up being a headline.
1389	TRUMP	I will not do it again.
1390	TRUMP	I was a very good student at a great school not using  by the way  not using profanity is very easy.
1391	DICKERSON	All right.
1392	DICKERSON	O.K.
1393	DICKERSON	Governor Bush, I'd like to ask you...
1394	BUSH	Yeah, well, I have got to respond to this.
1395	DICKERSON	Well, can I  how about you respond, and then you can answer the question I'm about to ask you.
1396	BUSH	Sounds like a good plan.
1397	DICKERSON	It'll be...
1398	BUSH	Or you could ask me two questions, so I could get two minutes instead of one.
1399	DICKERSON	If we adjudicate this, the night will be over.
1400	DICKERSON	Governor, in 2012, you said that your father and Ronald Reagan would have a hard time in today's Republican Party, based on their records of trying to find accommodation and finding some degree of common ground.
1401	DICKERSON	Do you still feel that way?
1402	BUSH	I think the dysfunction in Washington is really dangerous, that's what I think.
1403	BUSH	And we need a proven leader that has a record of solving problems, someone who doesn't cut and run someone who could be a commander in chief to unite our country around common purposes someone who doesn't disparage people.
1404	BUSH	Someone that doesn't brag, for example, that he has been bankrupt four times and it was great, because he could use the legal system.
1405	BUSH	Someone...
1406	TRUMP	That's not  let me respond.
1407	TRUMP	That's another lie.
1408	TRUMP	I never went bankrupt!
1409	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1410	DICKERSON	Hold on, Mr. Trump.
1411	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1412	TRUMP	No, but it's another lie.
1413	DICKERSON	Hold on, Mr. Trump.
1414	TRUMP	No, but it's another lie.
1415	TRUMP	This guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
1416	TRUMP	Just a lie.
1417	BUSH	We need someone with a proven record to be able to forge consensus to solve problems.
1418	BUSH	And right now, both Republicans and Democrats in Washington don't get it.
1419	BUSH	People are struggling  63 percent of Americans can't make a $500 car payment.
1420	BUSH	Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
1421	BUSH	And we need someone has a proven record of growing the economy, reforming the things that are broken.
1422	BUSH	And I'm that person.
1423	DICKERSON	O.K., Mr. Trump, your response.
1424	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1425	TRUMP	Let me just tell you.
1426	TRUMP	Jeb goes around saying, just like the biggest business leaders in this country, I've used the laws of the land to chapter  I bought a company, I threw it immediately into a chapter, I made a great deal.
1427	TRUMP	I uses the laws to my benefit, because I run a company.
1428	BUSH	Yeah...
1429	TRUMP	Excuse me, Jeb!
1430	BUSH	Yeah.
1431	TRUMP	I never went bankrupt, never.
1432	TRUMP	Now  but you don't want to say that.
1433	TRUMP	Now, let me just say, I've used it, just like the biggest leaders in the country.
1434	TRUMP	Let me tell you something  Florida.
1435	TRUMP	Florida, he put so much debt on Florida.
1436	TRUMP	You know, we keep saying he's a wonderful governor, wonderful governor.
1437	TRUMP	He put so much debt on Florida, and he increased spending so much that as soon as he got out of office, Florida crashed.
1438	TRUMP	I happened to be there.
1439	TRUMP	It's my second home.
1440	TRUMP	Florida crashed.
1441	TRUMP	He didn't do a good job as governor.
1442	BUSH	Here we go.
1443	TRUMP	And you haven't  excuse me, you haven't heard that.
1444	TRUMP	You listen to the good record in Florida.
1445	TRUMP	You take a look at what happened, as soon as that year ended he got out, Florida crashed.
1446	TRUMP	Too much debt.
1447	TRUMP	He loaded it up with debt, and his spending went through the roof.
1448	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1449	TRUMP	By the way...
1450	DICKERSON	The bells are ringing, sir.
1451	TRUMP	... he was not a good governor.
1452	BUSH	Here's the record.
1453	BUSH	Here's the record.
1454	BUSH	We led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years.
1455	BUSH	When I left there was $9 billion of reserves, 35 percent of general revenue.
1456	BUSH	No state came close to that.
1457	TRUMP	Take a look at your numbers.
1458	BUSH	When I  during my time, we were one of the two states to go to AAA bond rating.
1459	BUSH	We didn't go bankrupt like Trump did and call it success when people are laid off, when vendors don't get paid.
1460	BUSH	That's not success.
1461	BUSH	What we did was create an environment where people had a chance to have income.
1462	BUSH	Personal income during my time went up by 4.4 percent.
1463	TRUMP	Florida went down the tubes right after he got out of office.
1464	BUSH	The government grew by...
1465	TRUMP	Went right down because of what he did to it.
1466	BUSH	... half of that.
1467	DICKERSON	All right.
1468	DICKERSON	Thank you.
1469	DICKERSON	Senator Rubio, I want to ask you a 30second question, no president can...
1470	RUBIO	Thirty seconds.
1471	DICKERSON	No  well, I'll ask the question, you do what you want.
1472	RUBIO	I speak fast.
1473	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1474	DICKERSON	No president can know everything, right?
1475	DICKERSON	So a smart leader knows how to ask questions.
1476	DICKERSON	So if you could talk to any previous president, what's the smart question you would ask about that job that you would want to know?
1477	RUBIO	Well, I think one of the presidents  well, the president I grew up under was Ronald Reagan.
1478	RUBIO	And Reagan had a vision for America's future.
1479	RUBIO	And if you think about what Ronald Reagan inherited, it's not unlike what the next president is going to inherit.
1480	RUBIO	This is the worst president we've had in 35 years, 35 years back would have made it Jimmy Carter.
1481	RUBIO	That's what Ronald Reagan inherited.
1482	RUBIO	And I think the question you would ask is, how did you inspire again the American people to believe in the future?
1483	RUBIO	How did you  what did it take to ensure that the American people, despite all of the difficulties of the time  you know, you look back at that time, the American military was in decline.
1484	RUBIO	Our standing in the world was in decline.
1485	RUBIO	We had hostages being held in Iran.
1486	RUBIO	Our economy was in bad shape.
1487	RUBIO	The American people were scared about the future.
1488	RUBIO	They were scared about what kind of country their children were going to live in and inherit.
1489	RUBIO	And yet somehow Ronald Reagan was able to instill in our nation and in our people a sense of optimism.
1490	RUBIO	And he turned America around because of that vision and ultimately because of that leadership.
1491	RUBIO	I wish Ronald Reagan was still around.
1492	RUBIO	This country needs someone just like that.
1493	RUBIO	And if our next president is even half the president Ronald Reagan was, America is going to be greater than it has ever been.
1494	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1495	DICKERSON	All right.
1496	DICKERSON	That's going to have to be it there, Senator Rubio.
1497	DICKERSON	We have got to go to a break.
1498	DICKERSON	We will be right back with the CBS News Republican debate in Greenville, South Carolina.

1500	DICKERSON	Time now for closing statements.
1501	DICKERSON	You will each have one minute, and we'll begin with Governor Kasich.
1502	KASICH	Well, I want to thank the people of South Carolina.
1503	KASICH	You've been fantastic.
1504	KASICH	And look, what I want you to know is I'm going to send a lot of power, money and influence back to where we all live.
1505	KASICH	But as I've traveled around South Carolina, I've noticed something.
1506	KASICH	You know, it's that people have a sense that you're not going to wait on a president.
1507	KASICH	You know, when I was a kid, we didn't wait on presidents to come to that little bluecollar town and fix things.
1508	KASICH	You know, the Lord made all of us special.
1509	KASICH	The Lord wants us to be connected.
1510	KASICH	I believe we're part of a very big mosaic.
1511	KASICH	And I'll send the power back.
1512	KASICH	And whoever gets elected president here, hopefully will take care of the issue of jobs and wages and Social Security and the border.
1513	KASICH	But the spirit of the America rests in all of us.
1514	KASICH	It's in our guts.
1515	KASICH	It's taking care of our children.
1516	KASICH	It's taking care of the lady next door who just lost her husband.
1517	KASICH	It's fixing the schools where we live and telling kids to stay off drugs.
1518	KASICH	You see, I think what the Lord wants is for to us engage, and in America, the spirit of America doesn't come from the top down.
1519	KASICH	The spirit of America rests in us.
1520	KASICH	And I want to call on everyone in America to double down and realize that you were made special to heal this country and lift it for everyone.
1521	KASICH	Thank you all very much.
1522	KASICH	And I hope I can have your vote in South Carolina.

1524	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson  Dr. Carson, you're next.
1525	CARSON	This is the first generation not expected to do better than their parents.
1526	CARSON	Some people say it's the new normal, but there's nothing normal about it in an exceptional American.
1527	CARSON	I, like you, am a member of we, the people, and we know that our country is heading off the cliff.
1528	CARSON	Joseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down you, have to undermine three things our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality.
1529	CARSON	We, the people, can stop that decline, starting right here in South Carolina.
1530	CARSON	If all the people who say, "I love Ben Carson and his policies, but he can't win," vote for me, not only can we win, but we can turn this thing around.
1531	CARSON	You know, we have this manipulation by the political class and by the media telling us who we're supposed to pick and how we're supposed to live.
1532	CARSON	We, the people, are the only people who will determine that.
1533	CARSON	And if you elect me as your next president, I promise you that you will get somebody who is accountable to everybody and beholden to no one.

1536	DICKERSON	Governor  Governor Bush.
1537	BUSH	Thank you all very much.
1538	BUSH	The next president is going to be confronted with an unforeseen challenge.
1539	BUSH	That's almost certain.
1540	BUSH	It could be a pandemic, a major natural disaster or an attack on our country.
1541	BUSH	The question for South Carolinians and Americans is who do you want to have sitting behind the big desk in the Oval Office?
1542	BUSH	Because that's the question.
1543	BUSH	It's not the things we're talking about today.
1544	BUSH	It's the great challenge that may happen.
1545	BUSH	I believe I will have a steady hand as commander in chief and president of the United States.
1546	BUSH	I will unite this country around common purposes because I did it as governor of the state of Florida.
1547	BUSH	When I was governor, we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months.
1548	BUSH	Our state was on its back.
1549	BUSH	We recovered far faster than what people thought because we led.
1550	BUSH	We want to challenge rather than cutting and running.
1551	BUSH	That's what we need in Washington, D.C. We need someone with a servant's heart that has a backbone, that isn't going to focus on polls and focus groups.
1552	BUSH	The focus will be on the American people to keep them safe and secure.
1553	BUSH	I ask for your vote next Saturday.

1556	STRASSEL	And now, Marco Rubio.
1557	RUBIO	Thank you, and thank you for watching tonight.
1558	RUBIO	This is a difficult time in our country.
1559	RUBIO	Our economy's flat, it's not creating the jobs it once did, and people struggle living paycheck to paycheck.
1560	RUBIO	Our culture's in trouble.
1561	RUBIO	Wrong is considered right and right is considered wrong.
1562	RUBIO	All the things that once held our families together are now under constant assault.
1563	RUBIO	And around the world, America's reputation is in decline.
1564	RUBIO	Our allies don't trust us, our adversaries don't fear us, Iran captures our sailors and parades them before the world on video.
1565	RUBIO	These are difficult times, but 2016 can be a turning point.
1566	RUBIO	That's why I'm running for president, and that's why I'm here today to ask you for your vote.
1567	RUBIO	If you elect me president, we are going to reembrace free enterprise so that everyone can go as far as their talent and their work will take them.
1568	RUBIO	We are going to be a country that says that "life begins at conception and life is worthy of the protection of our laws."
1569	RUBIO	We're going to be a country that says "that marriage is between one man and one woman."
1570	RUBIO	We are going to be a country that says, "The constitution and the rights that it talks about do not come from our president, they come from our creator."
1571	RUBIO	We are going to be loyal to our allies like Israel, not enemies like Iran.
1572	RUBIO	And we will rebuild the U.S. military so no one will there test it.
1573	RUBIO	Vote for me.
1574	RUBIO	I will unify this party.
1575	RUBIO	I will grow it.

1582	CRUZ	Do you want another Washington deal maker who will do business as usual, cut deals with the Democrats, grow government, grow debt and give up our fundamental liberties?
1583	CRUZ	Or do you want a conservative, a proven conservative that will stand and fight with you each and every day?
1584	CRUZ	Listen, repealing Obamacare is not going to be easy.
1585	CRUZ	Passing a simple flat tax that abolishes the I.R.S.
1586	CRUZ	is not going to be easy, but if we stand with the American people, we can do it.
1587	CRUZ	And today, we saw just how great the stakes are.
1588	CRUZ	Two branches of government hang in the balance.
1589	CRUZ	Not just the presidency but the Supreme Court.
1590	CRUZ	If we get this wrong, if we nominate the wrong candidates, the Second Amendment, life, marriage, religious liberty  every one of those hangs in the balance.
1591	CRUZ	My little girls are here.
1592	CRUZ	I don't want to look my daughters in the eyes and say, "We lost their liberties."
1593	CRUZ	Who do you know will defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights?
1594	CRUZ	And as a commander in chief, who do you know will stand up to our enemies as the clam, steady, deliberate, strength to defeat our enemies, to secure our borders and to keep America safe.
1595	DICKERSON	Mr. Trump, your closing statements?

1602	TRUMP	We need a very big change.
1603	TRUMP	We're going to make our country great again.
1604	TRUMP	I say this every night, every day, every afternoon, and it's so true  we don't win anymore.
1605	TRUMP	We don't win with health care, we don't win with ISIS and the military, we don't take care of our vets, we don't care of our borders, we don't win.
1606	TRUMP	We are going to start winning again.
1607	TRUMP	We are not going to be controlled by people that are special interests and lobbyists that everybody here has contributed to.
1608	TRUMP	And you know what, they do exactly what those folks want them to do.
1609	TRUMP	We are going to make our country great, and we're going to do the right thing.
1610	TRUMP	I'm working for you.
1611	TRUMP	I'm not working for anybody else.
