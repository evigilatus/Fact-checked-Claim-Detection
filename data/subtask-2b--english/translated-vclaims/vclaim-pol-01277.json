It was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The readers looking under the heading wouldn't see any story or documents, just a video for about 10 minutes of the Johns show in which an unidentified person, known as \"Kevin in West Virginia,\" said: \"I've already moved to Maryland and had to vote in Maryland for early elections or early voting, and one thing I've seen -- This was in Hegrestown, Maryland. And I don't fully understand how they can do that.\" Jones asks: \"What did you see?\" Kevin answers: \"Well, I'm blind, so I didn't see it. I could hear them say, \"You know, oh! I voted yesterday, but you can rephrase your vote again today. I mean, this is crazy, and I wish I could pull my phone or recorder at the time and get this on the sound or something.\" Then Jones asserts, without providing evidence, that Democrats in Maryland, Texas and \"all\" have been arrested for doing the same thing, plus, \"always Democrats because they don't have morals.\" Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman.

Early voting was conducted through the electronic voter registration database, and anyone attempting to vote twice would be immediately informed. Their only other option, if they insist that they haven't voted yet, would be to cast temporary votes. Duncan said she was not aware of any specific complaints of a double vote in the November 6 elections. In short, InfoWars claims that the vote was forged by Democrats in Maryland on the basis of one anonymous caller's claim that he heard a comment that was made publicly in circumstances where, even if accurately interpreted, no particular political party was involved. Because the prosecution doesn't exist real evidence, we evaluate it with pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01277"}
