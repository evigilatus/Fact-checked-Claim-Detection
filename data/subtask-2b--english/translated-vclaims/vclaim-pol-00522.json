Craig Deeds, a leading voice for mental health reforms, talks about the Virginia Red Science Act, which would allow the confiscation of guns from people who are considered to be a major threat to themselves or others. It is expected that this legislation will be among several draft arms control laws to be submitted to the General Assembly in July in particular, beginning on 9 July. (Joff) Ralph Northam, a democracy, ordered the Legislative Council to meet in the wake of a mass shooting on 31 May at the Virginia Beach civilian centre, which killed 12, in addition to the shooter. Deeds, De-Bath, discussed the next session during an interview on 10 June on the provincial radio talk network of Virginia, \"the so-called Red Flag Bill; it was endorsed by a committee established by President Trump at the federal level, enacted into law in a number of states, and showed that it reduces the number of suicides by firearms.\" Deeds is right that the Trump Committee and the President have passed the Red Flag Act. These laws have been adopted by 15 states and are being considered by many others. What has caught our attention is his claim that the laws have been \"publicized\" to reduce the number of suicides by firearms. We were wondering if he was right. Deeds told us he doesn't remember the source behind his statement. He said, \"Maybe I just heard it; I don't know.\" The maximum risk laws are also called 15 states and the Red Flag Act of the District of Colombia. It allows the police - often family members - to petition the court to order the temporary transfer of firearms from a person who may be dangerous to himself or to other persons. After a specified period of time, the weapon is returned either to the person concerned or the court order is extended. Proponents argue that laws can prevent violent and suicide crimes. It is argued that the laws allow the Government to confiscate firearms in violation of the second amendment. The National Gun Association had opposed the laws for many years, but in 2018 it had changed its position and would retract draft laws if they provided due process and required mental treatment for the person temporarily losing his weapon. In Virginia, the Red Flag Act was defeated in January by a 4.2 vote from a Republican-controlled House of Representatives subcommittee that routinely defeats arms control measures. The bill would have allowed a law enforcement officer to require a judge to consider a person as \"a significant risk of injury to himself or others\" and to order the confiscation of his or her firearm for 14 days. The judge had options to extend the order for 180 days. There was little study on the effectiveness of the Red Flag laws, mainly because they were a recent trend. In general, it is too early to know whether or not the Red Flag laws are working, and the Nebraska Legislature was informed by its research office in the February 2019 report. The majority of Red Flag laws were enacted in 2018; there were only two jurisdictions that applied laws before 2014, allowing little time for thorough study. The Nebraska Legislature decided to defer consideration of the Red Flag Bill until next year. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. By Warren Fisk: 20 January 2021 the studies of the major red states are Connecticut and Indiana, which enacted laws in 1999 and 2005, respectively. The vast majority of seizures in both states were the prevention of potential suicides - 68 per cent in Indiana and some years, up to 80 per cent in Connecticut. Aaron Kivesto, Professor of Psychology at the University of Indianapolis, published a large-scale study in 2018 that found the laws of the Red Flag that were statistically likely to reduce rifle suicides in the two states. It is likely that Indiana experienced 7.5 fewer firearms suicides than it could have been without the law from 2005-2015. Kevistow wrote that statistical analysis of \"proposals\" of the law may have prevented 383 firearms suicides over 10 years and 44 non-gun suicides that can be attributed to the law. The Red Flag Act was enforced by Connecticut during the first eight years, and this measure is likely to have resulted in a 1.6 per cent reduction in rifle suicides from 1999-2007, according to Kifistow. Connecticut has seen stronger results since its enhanced enforcement in response to the 2007 mass shootings at Virginia Tech, which killed 32 students and colleges, as well as the armed man who had been sentenced to mental illness but was still buying weapons. In the period 2007-2015, Connecticut probably experienced 13.7 per cent less gun suicides than would have been illegal. But the results are not a clear general victory in Connecticut, while the number of weapon suicides was less than expected, people may have turned into other ways to kill themselves. Kevistow estimated that 128 firearms suicides were prohibited by law and could \"be attributed\" to 140 unarmed suicides. It is a complication with statistics that the raw number of suicides - with and without weapons - has increased in Connecticut, Indiana and across the United States this century. Suicide rates for every 100,000 people. Kevistow says his analysis suggests that there are more weapons suicides without the Red Flag Act in Connecticut and Indiana. In combining its findings from Connecticut and Indiana, Kivesto concluded that \"these findings suggest that firearms confiscation legislation is linked to meaningful reductions in firearms suicide rates at the population level, with mixed evidence of alternative impact.\" There are other studies in Connecticut and Indiana led by Jeffrey Swanson, a professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at Duke University. Statistically, in both states, one life was saved for every 10 weapons seized. Our verdict, Deeds, said that the Red Flag laws \"were published to reduce the number of firearms suicides.\" The scarce research available, limited to two states, supports Deeds. The Duke &apos; s studies concluded that one life had been saved for every 10 firearms confiscated in Connecticut and Indiana. A study at the University of Indianapolis found that it was statistically likely that the two states would have experienced further weapon suicides if they did not have the law. However, the Deeds claim may require some clarification. The number and rate of suicides - by weapon or other means - have increased in both states and across the nation this century. What studies conclude is that it could have been worse in Connecticut and Indiana without the law. There is another issue: while in Connecticut there were fewer cases of weapon suicides due to law, the University of Indianapolis suggests that the law has caused more than one counterpart to commit suicides in other ways. Because the DID statement needs to be detailed, we estimate that it is mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00522"}
