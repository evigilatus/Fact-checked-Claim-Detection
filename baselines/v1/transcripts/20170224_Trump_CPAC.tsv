0045	Donald Trump	So I just want to thank  but you know my first major speak was at CPAC and  probably five or six years ago.
0046	Donald Trump	First major political speech.
0047	Donald Trump	And you were there.
0048	Donald Trump	And it was  I loved it.
0049	Donald Trump	I loved the people.
0050	Donald Trump	I loved the commotion.
0051	Donald Trump	And then they did these polls were I went through the roof and I wasn't even running, right?
0052	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0053	Donald Trump	But it gave me an idea.
0054	Donald Trump	And I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was happening in the country.
0055	Donald Trump	And I said, "Let's go to it."
0056	Donald Trump	So, it was very exciting.
0057	Donald Trump	I walked the stage on CPAC.
0058	Donald Trump	I'll never forget it, really.
0059	Donald Trump	I had very little notes and even less preparation.
0060	Donald Trump	So when you have practically no notes and no preparation and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, I said, "I think I like this business."
0061	Donald Trump	Read More President Trump Just Boasted About Winning Polls at CPAC. He Lost 6 Times
0062	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0063	Donald Trump	I would've come last year but I was worried that I would be, at that time, too controversial.
0064	Donald Trump	We wanted border security.
0065	Donald Trump	We wanted very, very strong military. We wanted all of the things that we're going to get...
0066	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0067	Donald Trump	... and people consider that controversial but you didn't consider it controversial.

0081	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0082	Donald Trump	... pundits  you're right.
0083	Donald Trump	They had an idea.
0084	Donald Trump	The pundits didn't think we'd win.
0085	Donald Trump	The consultants that suck up all that money  oh, they suck it up.
0086	Donald Trump	They're so good.
0087	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0088	Donald Trump	They're not good at politics, but they're really good at sucking up people's money.
0089	Donald Trump	Especially my opponents, because I kept them down to a minimum.
0090	Donald Trump	But the consultants didn't think we would win.
0091	Donald Trump	But they all underestimated the power of the people You. And the people proved them...
0092	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0093	Donald Trump	... totally wrong.

0098	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0099	Donald Trump	I don't think it'll ever happen again.
0100	Donald Trump	And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news.
0101	Donald Trump	It's fake, phony, fake.
0102	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0103	Donald Trump	A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people.
0104	Donald Trump	And they are.
0105	Donald Trump	They are the enemy of the people.
0106	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0107	Donald Trump	Because they have no sources, they just make 'em up when there are none.
0108	Donald Trump	I saw one story recently where they said, "Nine people have confirmed."
0109	Donald Trump	There're no nine people.
0110	Donald Trump	I don't believe there was one or two people.
0111	Donald Trump	Nine people.
0112	Donald Trump	And I said, "Give me a break."
0113	Donald Trump	Because I know the people, I know who they talk to.
0114	Donald Trump	There were no nine people.
0115	Donald Trump	But they say "nine people."
0116	Donald Trump	And somebody reads it and they think, "Oh, nine people.
0117	Donald Trump	They have nine sources."
0118	Donald Trump	They make up sources.
0119	Donald Trump	They're very dishonest people.
0120	Donald Trump	In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people.
0121	Donald Trump	The fake news.
0122	Donald Trump	They dropped off the word "fake."
0123	Donald Trump	And all of a sudden the story became the media is the enemy.
0124	Donald Trump	They take the word "fake" out.
0125	Donald Trump	And now I'm saying, "Oh no, this is no good."
0126	Donald Trump	But that's the way they are.
0127	Donald Trump	So I'm not against the media, I'm not against the press.
0128	Donald Trump	I don't mind bad stories if I deserve them. And I tell ya, I love good stories, but we don't go...
0129	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0130	Donald Trump	I don't get too many of them.
0131	Donald Trump	But I am only against the fake news, media or press.
0132	Donald Trump	Fake, fake.
0133	Donald Trump	They have to leave that word.
0134	Donald Trump	I'm against the people that make up stories and make up sources.
0135	Donald Trump	They shouldn't be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody's name.
0136	Donald Trump	Let their name be put out there.
0137	Donald Trump	Let their name be put out.
0138	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0139	Donald Trump	A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being.
0140	Donald Trump	Let 'em say it to my face.
0141	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0142	Donald Trump	Let there be no more sources.
0143	Donald Trump	And remember this  and in not  in all cases.
0144	Donald Trump	I mean, I had a story written yesterday about me in Reuters by a very honorable man.
0145	Donald Trump	It was a very fair story.
0146	Donald Trump	There are some great reporters around.
0147	Donald Trump	They're talented, they're honest as the day is long.
0148	Donald Trump	They're great.
0149	Donald Trump	But there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people.
0150	Donald Trump	A tremendous disservice.
0151	Donald Trump	They are very dishonest people.
0152	Donald Trump	And they shouldn't use sources.
0153	Donald Trump	They should put the name of the person.
0154	Donald Trump	You will see stories dry up like you've never seen before.
0155	Donald Trump	So you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story  and I put myself in your position sometimes.
0156	Donald Trump	Because many of you, you're not part of the story.
0157	Donald Trump	And if you're not part of the story, you know, then you, sort of, know  if you are part of the story, you know what they're saying is true or not.
0158	Donald Trump	So when they make it up  and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election polls, polls.
0159	Donald Trump	The polls.
0160	Donald Trump	They come out with these polls and everybody was so surprised.
0161	Donald Trump	Actually, a couple polls got it right.
0162	Donald Trump	I must say Los Angeles Times did a great job, shocking because, you know, they did a great job.
0163	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0164	Donald Trump	And we had a couple of others that were right, but generally speaking, I mean, can tell you the network, somebody said a poll came out.
0165	Donald Trump	And I say, what network is it?
0166	Donald Trump	And they'll say, a certain  let's not even mention names, right?
0167	Donald Trump	Shall we?
0168	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0169	Donald Trump	Well, you have a lot of them.
0170	Donald Trump	Look, the Clinton News Network is one.
0171	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0172	Donald Trump	Totally.
0173	Donald Trump	Take a look.
0174	Donald Trump	Honestly.
0175	Donald Trump	Take a look, honestly.
0176	Donald Trump	Take a look at polls over the last two years.
0177	Donald Trump	Now you'd think they would fire the pollster, right?
0178	Donald Trump	After years and years of getting battered, but I  who knows, maybe they are just bad at polling or maybe they're not legit, but it's one or the other, look at how inaccurate  look at CBS, look at ABC, also, look at NBC, take a look at some of these polls.
0179	Donald Trump	They're so bad, so inaccurate and what that does is it creates a false narrative.
0180	Donald Trump	It creates like this narrative that is just like we're not going to win, people say, I love Trump, but you know, I'm not feeling great today, he can't win, so I won't go and vote.
0181	Donald Trump	I won't go and vote.
0182	Donald Trump	It creates a whole false deal.
0183	Donald Trump	And we have to fight it, folks, we have to fight it.
0184	Donald Trump	They're very smart, they're very cunning and they're very dishonest.
0185	Donald Trump	So just to conclude, I mean, it's a very sensitive topic and they get upset when we expose their false stories.
0186	Donald Trump	They say that we can't criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment, you know, they always bring up the First Amendment.
0187	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0188	Donald Trump	And I love the First Amendment nobody loves it better than me.
0189	Donald Trump	Nobody.
0190	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0191	Donald Trump	I mean, who use its more than I do?
0192	Donald Trump	But the First Amendment gives all of us  it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans, the right to speak our minds freely.
0193	Donald Trump	It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly.
0194	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0195	Donald Trump	And many of these groups are part the large media corporations that have their own agenda and it's not your agenda and it's not the country's agenda, it's their own agenda.
0196	Donald Trump	They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly.
0197	Donald Trump	But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn't tell the truth.
0198	Donald Trump	Doesn't tell the truth.
0199	Donald Trump	So just in finishing, I say it doesn't represent the people, it doesn't tell the never will represent the people, and we're going to do something about it because we have to go out and have to speak our minds and we have to be honest.
0200	Donald Trump	Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before.
0201	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0202	Donald Trump	I'm here fighting for you and I will continue to fight for you.
