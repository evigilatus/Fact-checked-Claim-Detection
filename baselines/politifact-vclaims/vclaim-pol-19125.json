Hospitals Were Packed With COVID-19 Patients, Contrary To Viral Video\u2019s Claims", "text": "A deceptive and widely viewed Facebook video claimed Los Angeles hospitals did not face a recent surge of COVID-19 patients. The footage made the rounds and was believed by Facebook users despite strong evidence to the contrary from health officials and media reports.\nThe anti-mask activist who shot the video made a sweeping conclusion: There are\u00a0 \"absolutely no patients\" at Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital in Los Angeles, according to the video, posted\u00a0on New Year\u2019s Day. The activist also referred to hospital staff as \"useful idiots.\"\u00a0\nA hospital representative rejected the video\u2019s assertions as baseless.\u00a0\nThe footage mostly shows the hospital\u2019s deserted outpatient center. But this is not where COVID-19 patients arrive, as pointed out by some of the comments on the video.\u00a0\nMost patients arrive through separate ambulance and emergency department entrances, said Gwendolyn Driscoll, spokesperson for MLK Jr. Community Hospital.\n\"There is no substance whatsoever to her allegations,\" Driscoll wrote in an email, referring to the activist.\u00a0\nThe hospital is located in a mostly Black and Latino south L.A. neighborhood where many residents are essential workers who are continually exposed to COVID-19. It also serves some unhoused individuals. The hospital is considered among the hardest hit in Southern California, where post-holiday COVID-19 cases have skyrocketed.\u00a0\nIn a striking example, the number of cases in Los Angeles County doubled from 400,000 on Nov. 30 to 800,000 on Jan. 2, according to the county\u2019s public health department. That led to patients overwhelming area hospitals, including an oxygen shortage at five facilities, forcing them to close to all ambulance traffic for several hours.\nThe Facebook video was flagged as part of the social media company\u2019s effort to combat false news and misinformation.

It had been shared 1,000 times and viewed more than 18,000 times as of early this week.\nConverting \u2018Every Nook And Cranny\u2019 To Patient Space\nTo fact check the video\u2019s claim, we relied on statements and data from officials at MLK Jr. Community Hospital, along with other health and emergency service officials. We also reviewed recent news reports, photos and videos showing the impact of the COVID-19 surge on hospitals in the L.A. area.\u00a0\nA Dec. 19 report by CBS News shows patients inside a triage area set up at MLK Jr. Community Hospital\u2019s ambulance bay. Additionally, a KTLA TV news report this week shows a similar tent set up outside the hospital.\u00a0\nA Dec. 29 report by ABC 7 Los Angeles shows footage of patients on gurneys waiting in hallways at an unidentified hospital, while several news clips include footage of ambulances waiting outside emergency rooms with patients still inside.\u00a0\n\"We have converted every conceivable nook and cranny in the hospital into patient care space,\" Dr. Elaine Batchlor, Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital CEO, told ABC News last month. \"We're doing everything that we can.\"\nThe Facebook video shows the both the outpatient center and the main entrance to MLK Jr. Community Hospital. There\u2019s little activity at either location. Driscoll, the hospital spokesperson, said that\u2019s because these \"are not patient areas\" and few COVID-19 patients come in through the main doors.\u00a0\nShe also cited a data analysis showing MLK Jr. Community Hospital had the highest rate of COVID-19 patient volume to hospital bed capacity of any nearby hospital in late December. It shows 97% of its 131 licensed beds were being used by COVID-19 patients the week before Christmas, a higher rate than each of the dozens of other hospitals within 15 miles.\u00a0\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on January 20, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO admits their testing grossly overstates individuals testing positive for COVID.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y.

California hospitals are facing increasingly difficult decisions about which services to postpone amid a crushing load of coronavirus patients.

Specifically, it said there were \"absolutely no patients\" at Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital in south Los Angeles.\nThat claim is a far cry from reality. Video from news reports along with patient data and statements from the hospital all show MLK Jr. Community Hospital, like many in the region, was flooded with patients last month as COVID-19 cases soared.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the Facebook video was filmed at the hospital\u2019s outpatient center, which is not where COVID-19 patients arrive. They come in through separate emergency department and ambulance entrances.\u00a0\nA hospital spokesperson described the claim as groundless.\u00a0\nBased on the evidence, we agree and rate it Pants On Fire.\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19125"}
