The government is responsible for Internet prices and services.", "text": "Net neutrality is the biggest organizational threat to the Internet, according to Sin, Ted Cruz. Cruz went to social media to condemn President Barack Obama's policy in November 10, which was a big step in favour of pure neutrality. Obama said that he wanted \"the strongest possible rules to protect pure neutrality.\" Cruz invited Obamakar's proposal to the Internet on Twitter, and he got more specific in his complaint on Facebook. We wanted to verify the truth if, in fact, net neutrality puts the government in charge of \"setting Internet pricing, conditions of service, and what kinds of products and services can be provided.\" We found Cruz is often talking about a slippery slope. With the rules proposed by Obama, the Federal Communications Commission could theoretically impose regulations on Internet prices and products - but their scope would be limited. In particular, Obama called on the Federal Competition Commission not to regulate Internet prices. For us, Cruz &apos; s statement brought pictures of the officials of the Fair Competition Commission sitting around the table and formulating home-based Internet service plans. This is not what Obama proposes. What is pure neutrality? First, a quick guide to pure neutrality, which is a very complex subject. The New York Times formulated this issue well, comparing it to the difference between electricity and cable television. For electricity, people pay a monthly bill, electricity comes into the house, and they use electricity as they see fit, using whatever electrical devices they want. The same people pay a monthly cable television bill, but the cable company can choose channels to pack the cable. These packages are often built on financial agreements between cable providers and television channels. Proponents of net neutrality believe that Internet service should function like electricity. Consumers pay fees to the Internet service provider (e.g. Comcaste and Ferrison) and have equal access to the entire Internet - every site, large and small - without any interference from the service provider. But this is not possible without some government regulation. The FCC issues the final appeal on how the Government will regulate the Internet, and the agency is in the process of drafting regulations, after a Federal Court of Appeal abolished the rules on the protection of net neutrality of the FCC in January. However, some ISPs do not want this type of government organization. The regulations would prevent Internet service providers from entering into financial arrangements that would give certain websites priority access to Internet users (e.g. cable company arrangements with cable channels). For example, Netflix entered into a financial agreement with Comcast so that the video broadcast site could have better access to customers. The proponents of net neutrality fear that if this trend continues, websites that are able and willing to pay Internet service providers to obtain priority access to consumers will have an unfair advantage over smaller operations or start-ups. In order to stop this trend and protect net neutrality, Obama said that the Fair Competition Commission should \"reclassify\" ISPs as regular carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, i.e. they would be treated as public utility, such as telephone service. At present, the Internet is classified as an \"information service,\" which greatly limits the extent to which the Fair Competition Commission can regulate. However, under the general classification of carriers, ISPs will not be allowed to give advantages to certain websites. Cruz and other critics of Obama &apos; s proposal believe that reclassification would create a lot of red tape for Internet service providers. We asked Cruz's employees to provide evidence to support his claim, and they noticed some potential impact of Obama's purely neutral proposal -- referring to studies that suggest that more regulation of the Internet can harm the economy and kill jobs. \"The President's request to the Fair Competition Commission to designate the Internet as a public facility means that the five non-elected bureaucracies of the Fair Competition Commission will be wise on pricing, conditions of service and the types of products delivered,\" said the spokesman for Cruz Catherine Fraser. \"This changes inexorably an innovative and growing part of our economy to one that must wait for permission for any new ideas.\" On January 17, 2021, President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News, \"He can't say anything (about the riots in the American Capitol Building) because the platforms removed it.\" In theory, Part Two would give the Fair Competition Commission some say on the prices of ISPs. However, Obama urged the FCC to also be patient with price regulation. Bearing in mind is a legal way of choosing not to enforce an unnecessary or irrelevant part of the law. \"I believe that the FCC should reclassify broadband services to consumers under Part II of the Telecommunications Act - while excluding price regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband services,\" Obama said. But let's talk about what would happen if the Fair Competition Commission reclassified ISPs under the second heading without this tolerance, just for kicks. Under Part Two, the Fair Competition Commission may \"identify and describe\" fees. However, this does not mean that the agency will decide which prices should be and compel companies to adhere to them. What may happen is that ISPs will determine their own prices, and that the FCC will intervene if it believes that these prices are \"unfair or unreasonable.\" The idea is that if the service provider is the only operator in a given area, it should not be able to raise the cost of consumption unreasonably, knowing that consumers cannot reach a cheaper option. Even this limited level of price regulation is likely not to be sustainable, as Harold Field, Senior Vice-President of Public Knowledge, an open online advocacy group, said. The Fair Competition Commission does not implement price regulations for other services of Part II, such as mobile phones and landlines, and has encountered problems in defending the price ceiling in court. \"As a practical matter, this is absolutely not going to happen,\" said Field. Brent Scorp, a telecommunications researcher at the Mercatus Centre of George Mason University and opponents of the net neutrality regimes, said he believed that Cruz's statement was fair, because of the authority granted to the Commission by Part Two. However, he agreed that any price regulation was likely to be \"short term\" because of Obama's call for tolerance and precedent with respect to other Part Two services. If the Internet service is reclassified under Part Two, the Fair Competition Commission will have limited authority over products that can be provided by Internet service providers. As with pricing, this does not mean that officials of the Fair Competition Commission will draft the Internet service packages that the service provider has to offer to consumers - and companies continue to do so themselves. However, if the ISP offers a product that gives an undue advantage to certain locations, the FCC can stop it - and the FCC will decide what constitutes an undue advantage. In this case, the \"producer\" will be the Internet service package that involves giving paid priority to particular sites. Most of the experts we spoke with said that this would be - to some extent - government supervision of a particular product. However, supporters of the Obama proposal said that Cruz misrepresented the extent of government control. This is how Field described it: the rules are the kind that make the FCC unable to prevent an ISP from offering a particular product unless that particular product (in which case priority is paid) prevents other firms from obtaining a fair access to that consumer. Ivan Ingstr\u00f6m, Director of Policy of the Technology Defense Engines Group, said that regulations were not about imposing products that the company could provide -- they were about preventing \"collective market abuses.\" The term \"net neutrality\" means that government regulation of products and services \"such as the statement that anti-extortion laws place the Government responsible for determining the types of \"protection services\" that the mafia can provide,\" as Angstrom said. Field noted that even under Part Two, the Internet service provider could find a way to offer priority products paid in any case. As Obama suggested against price regulation, Field said that an Internet service provider could petition the Fair Competition Commission to withstand blocking a particular product. Our government, Cruz, said Obama's net neutral proposal \"makes the Government responsible for determining the pricing of the Internet, the conditions of service and what kinds of products and services can be provided.\" While Obama was theoretically possible, he specifically said that he did not want the Fair Competition Commission to regulate Internet prices, and the Fair Competition Commission usually did not regulate the prices of similar items, such as telephone services. With regard to product supply, the proposal will allow the Federal Regulatory Commission to prevent Internet service providers from prioritizing some websites on other sites. However, Cruz's statement draws a picture of the officials of the Fair Competition Commission sitting around a table to design Internet service packages and prices, which is not what Obama proposes. We're assessing Cruz's claim himself.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07009"}
