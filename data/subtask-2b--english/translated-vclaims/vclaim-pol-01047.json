However, the organization has been extensively scrutinized in recent years with regard to its efforts in emergency response and financial management. The question of fitness affected charity, which amounted to $2.7 billion in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the earthquake in Haiti in 2010 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. One of the popular social media is based on some of these checks, while it is able to spread its own inaccuracy. This post, which has been shared on Facebook more than 242,000 times since April 2018, reads as follows: \"Marsha J. Evans is President and Chief Executive Officer of the United States Red Cross. \u2219 Salary of $651,957 plus expenses. Only 9 cents of every dollar donated to the American Red Cross goes to help those in need.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There are some issues here. First, Marsha J. Evans has not been President and Executive Director of the Red Cross since her resignation in 2005. The current Executive Director - Gail McGovern - does not make this much profit per year. More importantly, there is no evidence that only 9 cents per dollar goes to help those in need. The Executive Director &apos; s salary is derived from an outdated rumor that emerged more than 10 years ago, in one form or another. After starting to participate again in a series of e-mails around 2012, the Red Cross issued a statement addressing it. According to the Charitable Foundation, the base salary of Majoforn was $500,000, which has since joined the organization in 2008. Since the issuance of the statement several years ago, we have considered more recent records and contacted the Organization for updated figures. In the Organization &apos; s 2017 model 990, the latest available model, McGovern was reported to receive a base salary of $500,000, but the total reported compensation amounted to $603,564, which includes bonuses and incentives ($100,000) and other expenses and allowances ($3,564). An additional $18,392 represents its retirement and benefits. \"This is in the middle range for executive directors from large non-profit organizations such as the Red Cross, an organization with a total budget of over $2.7 billion per year,\" said Red Cross spokesman Greta Gustavson for the base salary of $500,000, which she said remained unchanged. McGovern personally has made over $500,000 in charitable donations to the United States Red Cross since becoming CEO in 2008. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. On January 16, 2021, on donations, the mail claims that the Red Cross only uses 9 cents per dollar to help people, which is simply not true. In response to this allegation, Gustavson said that the organization keeps its expenditures low and \"invests in humanitarian services and programmes an average of 91 cents per dollar spent by the United States Red Cross. But this figure of 91 cents has also been questioned. In 2014, ProPublica and NPR challenged in the Red Cross the validity of his claim, which was common at the time, that \"91 cents of every dollar donated\" went to services. According to the analysis carried out by the National Rehabilitation Programme and ProPublica, fund-raising expenditures cost the organization between 14 and 26 cents per dollar contributed. This does not explain the additional overheads. After that report, the Red Cross changed its wording to say, as Gustavson told us, that 91 cents of every dollar \"spends\" goes to humanitarian services and programmes. But NPR and ProPublica claimed that the allegation was also misleading because of billions of Red Cross people spending blood selling to health-care providers: \"From the more than $3 billion spent by the Red Cross last year, journalists Jesse Eisinger and Justin Elliott wrote at the time, \"two thirds were spent not on disaster relief but on blood trade for the group.\" According to the Navegatur charity, which assesses the financial health, accountability and transparency of more than 9,000 charities, the Red Cross spends about 89.3 per cent of its total expenditure on its programmes and services, 4.2 per cent on administrative expenses and 6.4 per cent on fund-raising expenditures. Over the last three financial years, by location, the Red Cross spent 27 cents on fund-raising efforts for each dollar contributed. The fund-raising expenses of the Red Cross also meet the criteria set by non-profit monitors. According to the Alliance of the Wise of the Better Business Bureau, fund-raising expenditures should not exceed 35 per cent of related contributions. Our Facebook article shares an old rumor about the American Red Cross, claiming that Executive Director Marsha Evans is paying $651,957 plus expenses\" and \"only 9 cents per dollar donated\" actually goes to help people in need. Marsha Evans is no longer the Executive Director of the Red Cross, and the current Chief Executive, Gil McGovern, received $603.564 in 2017, with interest, allowances and expenses taking into account. When it comes to the percentage of donated dollars going to help those in need, it is slightly more ambiguous. The organization has long maintained that an average of 91 cents per dollar contributed is spent on humanitarian efforts, but this number has faced challenges before, as various reports estimate that it may be as low as 73 cents per dollar. However, we found no evidence or report that puts this figure below 9 cents, as the letter claims. We assess it wrong.
