No excuses!\"\nThere's *always* a tweet pic.twitter.com/dmrmzoRwP1\u2014 Shaun Usher (@ShaunUsher) February 5, 2018\n\nThe tweet took off, and within 19 hours drew more than 22,000 retweets and 47,000 likes.\nMinutes later, Usher followed up by\u00a0making it clear the tweet\u00a0was a hoax:\n\"Sweet mother of god. Not for one second did I think people would believe that to be genuine.\"\n\"omg it's everywhere. What have I done.\"\n\"siri can i be arrested for making a fake tweet.\"\nSome users on Twitter called on Usher to delete the tweet. He replied:\n\"Many people asking why I haven't taken it down. Literally within minutes of me posting it, it had legs. It was everywhere within about 10mins. I had lost control of it in an instant. Deleting mine--its place of birth--felt wrong & maybe more dangerous?\"\nMany in the Twitterverse seemed to realize it was a hoax and enjoyed the joke:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You just gained a follower. Me. Thanks for the laugh.\"\n\"Does this mean he's NOT getting shot out of a cannon??\" tweeted another with a sad face emoji. \u00a0\n\"We will build a sun cannon, and we will have the sun people pay for it,\" one tweeted, a reference to Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall at the border of Mexico and make Mexico pay for it.\nSome in the twitterverse adopted an investigative tone and noted that the alleged Trump tweet had more than 140 characters, which wasn\u2019t possible in 2015.\nAnother took a scientific approach:\n\"Important question: would one want said president to make it to the sun, or simply impart the amount of inertia required to get something of their mass to the sun? One is much more complex the other and could create many jobs,\" linking to a diagram and math formula for shooting Trump to the sun.\nSome on Twitter appeared to fall for the hoax:\n\"OMG, did the dumb SOB really spell it \u2018Joans\u2019?\"\n\"Is this real?\"\n\"Oops. I fell for it.\"\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise that someone poked fun at\u00a0Trump for the stock market drop after Trump had repeatedly touted gains in the stock market.\nOn Jan. 5, Trump tweeted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average \"jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks, Record fastest 1000 point move in history.\" We rated that statement True, though no president can take full credit for the economy.\nTrump made a comment about stock market records in Nashville days later and again Jan. 26 in a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\nUsher has been critical of Trump in the past. Hours before Usher posted the fake tweet, he bashed Trump over his criticism of the UK health care system. In January, Usher called Trump the \"dumbest sack of meat\" in response to his comments about climate change.\nWe attempted to reach Usher but did not hear back. The White House declined to comment. \u00a0\nWe rate this fake tweet Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/44c62e44-5359-41e0-bc9e-a28a0642e383", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02432"}
