But the liberal media group for analysis says that the party split is alive and good on Fox News. At least in terms of minutes of broadcast time In a post-16 September blog, the group accused Fox News of giving members of the Republican Senate twice as much time as the Democrats during live coverage of the Senate Armed Services Committee session on American politics in Syria and Iraq. There were only two individuals testifying, Minister of Defence Chuck Hagel and Chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey. According to Fox News, \"I borrowed more than 16 minutes of GOP questions, while I offered less than 8 minutes of democratic interrogation,\" media article. We decided to check their accounts, compare Fox News with MSNBC and CNN, We used the subscription service, the critical signal to check the coverage in a minute on the three networks. Here's what we found: The media reporter properly collected minutes. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021 Fox News provided 16 minutes of Republican interrogation, compared to eight minutes of democratic interrogation. Other networks provided more than the raw broadcast of the Fox News hearing, and thus more balanced. The opening statements by President Sin Karl Levin, De-Misch, Vice-President Sin Jim Anhoff, R. Okla and questions by more senators from both parties were included by CNN and MNSNC. We calculated the time of each senator based on the period when he controlled the microphone, not on the length of his lips. The length of their questions did not affect the number. We've approached the nearest accurate mark, so one minute differences in MSNBC and CNN coverage may not reveal much. CNN had about 90 seconds of technical malfunction that was about a minute away from the time of its collapse. Only MSNBC provided continuous coverage, although not from the beginning to the end. The meeting took approximately four hours. Both Fox News and CNN withdrew sometime and returned to the current hearing. Fox News joined the aerial questions from South Carolina Republican Sean Lindsay Graham. The CNN was cut twice, and I joined once again to ask her questions from Missouri's democratic age. Claire Macaskel, and again to hold Graham's question session. Our media issues said that Fox News gave Republican senators twice the time they gave them to the Democrats during the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. They said the Republicans got 16 minutes compared to the eight Democrats. That matches our number. We have also found that other networks have provided more time and more time for the members of the parties. We're assessing the claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07284"}
