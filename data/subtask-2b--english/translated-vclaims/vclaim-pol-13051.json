The agenda of John Kasesh attracted thousands of demonstrators to the Council of State this year. On May 5 - the day when the Ohio House of Representatives under the control of the World Democratic Party approved the budget - he delivered a speech to the Council of State - which focused on the working class and the government policies that damaged it. \"To give an idea of how families wrestle, four out of every 10 school students in Ohio are now eligible for subsidized lunch,\" said Hanwar, Executive Director for Public Policy in Ohio. Statistics are effective because they are easy to understand. Free or low-cost school lunches are directly related to poverty, and 40 per cent seem to be like a large number of Ohio students who qualify for the subsidy. Polyte Fact Ohio decided to consider Hanwar &apos; s claim to see if it had clarified its facts. Before we could reach Hanwar, Internet research produced news reports from this year on subsidized lunch statistics in Ohio. The Columbus message was published on February 13, citing statistics from the Ohio Ministry of Education, stating that four out of every 10 Ohio students receive free lunch or reduced prices through a federal programme for low-income students. We contacted the Ministry of Education for the statistics used in the story. Data received from the National School Lunch Programme, which is part of the United States Department of Agriculture, were delivered by a spokesperson for the Department. The National School Lunch Programme provides cash subsidies to public and private schools throughout the country to provide free and low-priced lunches for eligible children. Data collected in October and released in February show that 825,469 Ohio students received free lunch or at reduced prices from among 1,876,355 students attending Ohio schools participating in the national school lunch programme. Of the students participating in the programme, 716,084 receive free lunches, and 109,385 receive low-price lunches. Based on these figures, about 44 per cent of students in Ohio schools participating in the federal subsidized food programme are eligible for the benefit - which exceeds the 4 per cent to 10 per cent mentioned. But are there schools in Ohio that do not participate in the federally supported food programme? If so, the total percentage of Ohio students receiving free or low-priced lunch can fall to less than 40 per cent. We reviewed the Ministry of Education for the total number of students in the state. There are about 2,042,538 students in Ohio, according to the department. So we brought the new total to our accounts (825,469 students receiving subsidized lunch divided by 2.04 million children) and the result was 40.4 per cent - equal to 4 to 10. So, Hanwar was right to mention the percentage of Ohio's children having subsidized lunch. The statistics were also described as a record. How does that stack up? Similar data from the Ministry of Education were readily available dating back to 2002. Since 2002, the highest percentage of students actually receiving subsidized food was in 2010. In 2009, the second highest participation rate, 42 per cent of students in schools participating in the federal programme received subsidized lunches (compared with 44 per cent in 2010). Hanwar &apos; s speech was immediately about the proportion of children receiving subsidized lunches. With regard to the name of this ratio as a record, neither the Department of Education nor the United States Department of Agriculture provided data showing a higher percentage in the past. We're evaluating the statement right. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38.
