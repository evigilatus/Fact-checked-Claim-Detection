Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) claimed in a Nov. 9, 2020 tweet that jurisdictions representing about 80% of Wisconsin residents have passed resolutions or referendums in support of fair maps.\u00a0\n\"All told, jurisdictions representing about 80% of WI residents have passed referendums or resolutions in favor of fair maps,\" he wrote in the tweet. \"Gerrymandering is an affront to our Democracy, and I will continue to fight for WI leg. maps that reflect the will of the people, not the party in power.\"\u00a0\nIs he right?\nThe background\nIn 2011, maps were drawn behind closed doors. Republican lawmakers and their aides were required to sign nondisclosure agreements in order to look at maps of their own proposed districts before the public could see them.\u00a0\nThe maps prompted a swirl of lawsuits, with Democrats alleging that Assembly districts had been unconstitutionally gerrymandered to give Republicans an advantage.\nIn the end, Democrats ended up dropping the gerrymandering case, according to a June 2019 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that federal courts can\u2019t consider allegations that partisans drew election maps to favor themselves.\u00a0\nDuring the decade, Democrats won back only three Assembly seats, including two during the 2020 elections, according to a Nov. 3, 2020 Journal Sentinel article, and one in 2018, according to an Oct. 29, 2020 PolitiFact report.\u00a0\nEvers, elected in 2018, has called for a nonpartisan commission to look at Census data and draw fair maps. He included the proposal in his first budget, but it was denied. Instead, he created the panel by executive order in 2019, according to a July 2020 article from the Journal Sentinel. His panel bars party officials, lawmakers and former lobbyists from joining it.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, it\u2019s unclear what that will mean in 2021.\nRepublicans in the Legislature have not signed onto the commission idea, so they may pursue maps of their own -- though this time they would need support from Evers, instead of former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican.\nIf the two sides deadlock, the matter would end up in front of a judge.\nIn addition to the action by Evers, various local government bodies have been going on the record in support of \"fair maps.\" They range from Lincoln County to Milwaukee County.\u00a0\nThe wording varies, but generally speaking they ask for the creation of nonpartisan procedure for the preparation of legislative and congressional redistricting plans to increase accountability and transparency.\u00a0\nThese referendums are at the center of Larson\u2019s claim.\nWhen asked for evidence to back Larson\u2019s claim, aide Justin Bielinski noted the senator wasn\u2019t the only one to cite the 80% number -- that Gov. Tony Evers had even done so in the announcement of the People\u2019s Maps Commission. Bielinski also cited information from the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign.\u00a0\nAccording to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonprofit, non-partisan government watchdog group that has tracked gerrymandering, 55 counties have passed either resolutions, referendums or both. Referendums are voted on directly by residents, while resolutions are voted on by county boards.\u00a0\nThe population of those counties adds up to 4.8 million people, according to the group. The state has about 5.8 million residents, based on the latest census data.\nThus, those numbers mean nearly 83% of Wisconsinites are represented by jurisdictions who have signaled support for fair maps.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nLarson said \"jurisdictions representing 80% of Wisconsin residents\" passed referendums or resolutions \"in favor of fair maps.\"\u00a0\nAccording to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, jurisdictions representing about 82% of Wisconsin\u2019s population have approved either a referendum, resolution or both in support of fair maps.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17306"}
