Andrew Cuomo formally signing a state-wide \"stay-at-home\" order on March 20 that banned all non-essential businesses from conducting in-office work and stopped all \"non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason.\"\nYet a photo shared on Facebook April 2 showed an overcrowded NYC subway car along with a caption that seemed almost unbelievable during a time of extreme social distancing:\n\"This is NYC#2 train this afternoon!!!! And their mayor and governor wants to blame trump!!!! Damn what a disgrace!!!! Spread this far and wide!!!!\"\nThe image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

He said subway cars can get overcrowded sometimes due to a train breaking down or a service delay, but he also concluded that crowding on trains was \"not acceptable.\"\n\"I understand people are trying to get somewhere, but no one should be getting on a crowded train,\" de Blasio said. \"Spread out throughout the train. Wait for the next train.\"\nAccording to a report by the New York Times, although overall subway ridership is down 87%, the steepest declines have occurred in richer neighborhoods.\u00a0\nManhattan, which has a median income around $80,000, saw a 75% decrease in ridership, the Times reports, while the Bronx, where the median household income is about $38,000, saw only a 55% decrease.\u00a0\nThe post is off on the date of the photo, but only by a few days; it was taken well into New York\u2019s stay-at-home order.
