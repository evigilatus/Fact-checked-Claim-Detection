He decried \"brutal crackdowns\" by various regimes, saying, \"We have a responsibility to speak boldly for those whose voices are denied by the jackbooted thugs of the tired tyrants of Syria and Iran.\"\nSo in 2011 Ryan used tough language, but was vague what actions were appropriate and when they should be taken.\nComments in 2012\nWe found little else from Ryan regarding Syria until the fall 2012 campaign, when Ryan had been added to the GOP ticket by presidential candidate Mitt Romney. As could be expected, Ryan echoed his running mate\u2019s criticisms of Obama\u2019s approach in Syria.\nAmid reports that Assad might be preparing to use chemical weapons, Obama was asked at an Aug. 19, 2012 news conference \"whether you envision using U.S. military, if simply for nothing else, the safekeeping of the chemical weapons.\"\nObama responded: \"We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus.\" He added: \"We cannot have a situation where chemical or biological weapons are falling into the hands of the wrong people.\"\nMajor media outlets generally agreed that Obama was, directly or indirectly, warning Syria it could face American military intervention.\nIn the October 2012 vice-presidential debate with Joe Biden, Ryan bought into Obama\u2019s \"red line\" rhetoric.\nBut first, he complained fiercely that Obama had dallied while Assad slaughtered tens of thousands of Syrians and al-Qaida had entered the fight.\nRyan said Obama had failed to aid moderate dissident elements in the country, wrongly gave Russian leader Vladimir Putin veto power over U.S. efforts to deal with Syria, and neglected relationships with allies in the region.\nPressed on what Romney-Ryan would do if elected, Ryan said they agreed with Obama\u2019s \"red line\" on chemical weapons.\nAnd Ryan, echoing Romney\u2019s call for a tougher line, put some meat on the bone, endorsing American ground troops in Syria for the limited purpose of securing chemical weapons in the context of a \"red line.\" Ryan emphasized that was the only scenario for U.S. boots on the ground.\nRyan\u2019s comments didn\u2019t tell us much about the nature of any military action in case of a red line violation. But he made clear he was willing to use U.S. troops in Syria to secure chemical weapons.\nComments in 2013\nFast forward to Aug. 21, 2013, almost exactly one year after Obama\u2019s \"red line\" remark.\nOn that day, international chemical weapons inspectors now say, a deadly attack on opposition-held suburbs of Damascus included the use of the nerve agent sarin. The Associated Press reported that the United States and its allies alleged the Syrian government was responsible.\nAfter the attack, Obama threatened missile strikes against Assad, then unexpectedly sought congressional approval for them, and then stepped back when Russian-led diplomatic efforts led to an ongoing United Nations-backed mission to scrap Syria\u2019s capacity to make chemical weapons and destroy its stockpile.\nCritics said Obama\u2019s twists and turns on a military strike undermined the notion of a tough response, and in Syria the delays angered residents and disappointed opposition leaders.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotably, Obama did not propose American troops on the ground.\nNext came Obama\u2019s announcement on Aug. 31, 2012 that he would seek congressional approval for a military strike.\nRyan briefly commented, saying, \"The President has some work to do to recover from his grave missteps in Syria. He needs to clearly demonstrate that the use of military force would strengthen America's security. I want to hear his case to Congress and to the American people.\"\nThen, on Sept. 11, 2013, a day after Obama addressed the nation and with Obama still seeking congressional approval for a strike, Ryan announced his opposition, while the House\u2019s two top GOP leaders backed a strike.\nRyan\u2019s lengthy statement said a lot about why Obama was off track but left us wondering about Ryan\u2019s own views on military intervention.\nAt various points he seemed clearly to suggest Obama\u2019s proposed military strike was too small, calling it a \"feeble\" deterrent and too \"limited\" to degrade chemical-weapons capabilities when a \"firm response\" was needed.\nRyan also repeated his 2012 criticisms that Obama had failed to aid rebels and had deferred to Russia.\nBut at points he appeared to question the wisdom of any strike, saying, \"A military strike could kill innocent civilians and earn the ire of everyone involved\" and \"drop America's standing in the Middle East even further.\" Ryan didn\u2019t rule anything out, saying America must \"carefully weigh all options.\"\nHis statement ended with a proposal for action that did not mention military intervention: \"Instead of the proposals put forth by the President, we should tighten sanctions on Assad's regime and give aid to the moderate elements of the opposition. \"\nAsked to clarify Ryan\u2019s position on military intervention, aide Kevin Seifert told us: \"Paul Ryan\u2019s concerns aren\u2019t limited to \u2018size,\u2019 they are about the strategy.\"\nHe continued: \"It\u2019s the mismatch between the president\u2019s stated objective and the proposed strategy to achieve it.\" Seifert would not say how Ryan would view another proposal for military intervention came before Congress.\nMore comments\nFour days after Ryan put out his September 2013 statement, the \"UpFront with Mike Gousha\" show aired an interview with Ryan in which he expressed deep pessimism about using inspections to get the chemical weapons out.\nGousha cited Ryan\u2019s debate position that agreed with Obama on a \"red line\" and asked him why he had now changed his position. Ryan said he had not changed his position; he just found Obama\u2019s specific proposal to be incoherent.\nGousha followed up: \"Bottom line, do you think we should take military action because Syria used chemical weapons on its people?\"\nRyan, shaking his head from side to side, responded strictly in the context of Obama\u2019s plan: \"No. No, I do not believe he should do this because I don\u2019t think this administration has any game plan for any of the contingencies surrounding it.\"\nFor additional perspective on Ryan, we spoke to Michael O\u2019Hanlon, director of research for the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution, and UCLA history professor and Middle East scholar James Gelvin.\nThey offered differing interpretations of Ryan\u2019s comments, but neither saw a full reversal by the congressman.\nO\u2019Hanlon saw an inconsistency in Ryan rejecting Obama\u2019s plan as too meek while Ryan himself earlier had specifically endorsed nothing more muscular for taking on Assad. Gelvin sees Ryan\u2019s position as opportunistic politically but fairly consistent from a policy standpoint. He believes Ryan is in the foreign-policy camp that says, if we\u2019re going to use force, do it big.\nOur rating\nRyan has said all along he wanted more aggressive help for moderate groups fighting Assad. But here we\u2019re testing whether his position has changed regarding a U.S. military response to Syrian use of chemical weapons.\nWe know that after Obama drew the red line suggesting some sort of military intervention, Ryan endorsed that general idea, then 11 months later rejected Obama\u2019s plan for it.\nBut we don\u2019t see a major reversal of position here -- in part because Ryan\u2019s views on what to do about chemical weapons were ill-defined in 2012 and remain so now.\nIt\u2019s true Ryan rejected Obama\u2019s proposed limited strike once chemical weapon use became reality, but he says he did so because of objections to Obama\u2019s timing, strategy and execution. We found no evidence Ryan had previously backed -- or rejected -- this kind of limited strike.\nAnd he still says military intervention remains an option.\nHis statements contain some inconsistencies, however. In 2012, Ryan said American ground troops would be an appropriate response if a red line was crossed, but his position on that is now unclear because he won\u2019t answer questions about it.\nAnd the September 2013 statement he issued is a model of confusion as opposed to his feisty debate comments.\nIn it, he strongly implied Obama\u2019s strike was too small and not forceful enough, but then threw water on a limited strike because it could kill civilians.\nFor those inconsistencies, we rate this a Half Flip.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08766"}
