The constitution was put in place to protect us from our government. Without it and our bill of rights we would be living in a communist country which is what the communist democrat party wants. They MUST disarm us first get the picture!\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe statement is not authentic and has circulated the internet for years.\nThis quote spiraled out of a comment Biden made during a weapons control forum in 2013, but it has been largely altered and taken out of context.\nA YouTube video posted in 2015 and titled\u00a0\"Biden: no ordinary American cares about his constitutional rights\" has over 31,000 views.

Not true. They say guns like the AR-15 are needed for self-protection and recreation. They are not. There are plenty of ways you can protect yourself and recreate without an AR-15. They say it isn\u2019t about guns. They\u2019re wrong; it is about guns. Let me say at the outset to all the press: No law abiding citizen in the United States of America has any fear that their Constitutional rights will be infringed in any way. None, zero. Look, common sense facts are these assault weapons are unnecessary and dangerous weapons that put our law enforcement personnel at risk\u2026\"\nThe YouTube video tracks back to a February 2013 address Biden gave during a forum held at Western Connecticut State University, about two months after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting.\nSoon after the talk, Breitbart posted a story with the headline \"Biden: No Ordinary American Cares About Their Constitutional Rights, Facebook Questions are Plants.\"\nOur ruling\nA claim\u00a0on Facebook quotes Biden as saying, \"No ordinary American cares about constitutional rights.\"\nThis is a distortion. Biden did say that no law-abiding citizen has any fear that their constitutional rights will be infringed without the protection of an AR-15. But he did not say that \"ordinary Americans\" simply don\u2019t care about their constitutional rights.\nThe quote shared on social media has been altered, exaggerated and taken out of context.\nWe rate this False.\n Share the Facts 2019-05-13 15:17:09 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Quotes Joe Biden as saying \"no ordinary American cares about constitutional rights.\"    Viral Image on the internet     Wednesday, May 8, 2019 2019-05-08    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00655"}
