But the headline and story failed to explain that his interest in those groups were not relevant to the alleged plot laid out in the government\u2019s complaint.\nFBI criminal complaint shows allegations against Jameson\nHere is what happened ahead of the planned incident, according to the FBI criminal complaint filed in California Dec. 22:\nIn September, a confidential source alerted the FBI that Jameson\u2019s Facebook account showed he \"liked\" or \"loved\" pro-ISIS and terrorism posts, such as an image of Santa Claus standing in New York with a box of dynamite.\nJameson, a recent convert to Islam, had expressed support for radical jihadist beliefs and terrorism, including the Oct. 31, 2017, terror attack in New York City in which a driver used a truck to kill eight people.\n\"I\u2019m glad to know we Muslims are finally hitting back,\" Jameson wrote on Facebook.\nIn December an undercover FBI employee began communicating with Jameson, who believed the agent was part of senior leadership in ISIS. Jameson indicated that he wanted to plan an attack similar to the 2015 San Bernardino massacre and the recent New York truck attack.\nJameson named the Pier 39 site in San Francisco as his target because it is a heavily crowded area. He asked the undercover employee to provide ammunition, assault rifle and materials to make explosives.\nA couple of days later, an FBI employee mistakenly called Jameson and he called back the employee\u2019s phone number which had a 202 (Washington, D.C.) area code. Later that day Jameson told the undercover FBI employee he reconsidered the attack.\nOn Dec. 20, law enforcement conducted a search warrant and found an incriminating letter and several guns at Jameson\u2019s home. The letter included one mention of Trump -- a reference to Trump\u2019s recent recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel: \"You\u2019ve allowed Donald J. Trump to give away Al Quds to the Jews.\"\nTwo days later, federal authorities announced that they had charged Jameson, a 26-year-old Modesto truck driver, with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. If convicted, Jameson faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJameson\u2019s family said he was depressed over losing custody of his children and insisted he never talked about violence or being influenced by terrorist groups.\nJameson\u2019s federal public defender Heather E. Williams told PolitiFact that her office will investigate the possibility of an entrapment defense and whether the government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt any attempted criminal act since Jameson ultimately told an FBI undercover employee that he had reconsidered.\n\"In my understanding, the label \u2018antifa\u2019 means \u2018anti-fascist.\u2019 \u00a0If being anti-Trump, anti-fascist tends to show a person is more likely to be a \u2018terrorist\u2019 than not, the FBI must have a very long list of suspicious people,\" she told PolitiFact.\nJameson\u2019s Facebook page\nThe 11-page FBI criminal complaint and the press release from the U.S. Attorney make no mention of Antifa, and the only reference to Trump is the one sentence in the letter seized at Jameson\u2019s home. Mainstream news accounts of the case mentioned the sentence about Trump but nothing about Antifa.\nAntifa broadly describes far-left-leaning militant groups challenging neo-Nazis and white supremacists.\nInfowars drew from an archived version of Jameson\u2019s Facebook that showed he liked four Antifa groups -- three in California and one in Portland. He also liked a few anti-Trump groups, such as the \"Trump resistance movement.\" We noticed that Jameson liked hundreds of groups on Facebook ranging from the political (\"Sassy Socialist Memes\") to food, fashion, TV and sports.\nWe asked spokespersons for the FBI and the U.S. Attorney if the fact that the complaint made no mention of Jameson liking anti-Trump and Antifa means that it was irrelevant from a law enforcement perspective, but authorities declined to answer that question.\nWe posed the same question to a couple of experts on terrorism: Brian Levin at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, and Erin Miller, at the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland.\nLevin said federal authorities include information in the complaint that is relevant to the charge, which in this case was attempting to provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations. ISIS is considered a foreign terrorist organization while Antifa isn\u2019t.\n\"That\u2019s why ISIS \u2018likes\u2019 would be factually and legally relevant and the others would not,\" Levin said. \"The focus of his alleged goals was aligned with ISIS and apparently less so than with the other entities which aren\u2019t designated as foreign terrorist organizations.\"\nHis main interest is clearly ISIS and to suggest otherwise is not wholly accurate, Levin said.\n\"Extremists are not hermetically sealed in freeze-dried containers -- they often dine from buffet of hatred but usually there is one that predominants and that\u2019s what we apparently have here,\" he said.\nThere is a broad spectrum within Antifa, which includes some individuals who have expressed violence. But an abstract embrace of Antifa isn\u2019t illegal.\n\"Like the anti-abortion movement, \u2018Antifa\u2019 is itself an ideological movement,\" Miller said. \"Like any ideological movement, individuals can identify with it. Formal organizations can coalesce within/around it. Either can engage in non-violent or violent efforts to in an attempt promote the ideology/movement.\"\nOur ruling\nInfowars\u2019 headline said, \"Pier 39 terrorist was an anti-Trump antifa supporter.\"\nInfowars drew from the suspect\u2019s Facebook page, which showed he liked a few anti-Trump and Antifa pages as well as hundreds of unrelated groups.\nThe FBI criminal complaint makes no mention of Jameson liking these groups, which indicates that prosecutors believe his liking of these groups didn\u2019t play any role in the attempted terrorist plot.\nWe rate this statement Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5e29d1bc-dc21-4b68-afab-238968e36404", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02559"}
