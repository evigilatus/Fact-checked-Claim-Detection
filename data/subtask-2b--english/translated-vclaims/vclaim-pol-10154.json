Matt Romney's clinging to it. The Republican presidential candidate repeated this during his second debate against Obama at the University of Hofstra on 16 October 2012, in response to a public member &apos; s question about Libya &apos; s attack in September 2012. He said: \"The policies of the President throughout the Middle East began with a round of apology and followed the strategy of leadership from behind, and this strategy is collapsing before our eyes.\" We reviewed the Romney \"Apology\" attack when he used it at the Republican National Congress and in his book 2010 \"No Apology: The Case of American Greatness.\" He wrote that this tour is Obama's way of \"notifying foreign countries and foreign leaders that their hatred of America is something he understands and is at least partly understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all over the world; President Obama's words are like setting fire to them.\" \"In the first nine months of his tenure, President Obama issued apologies and criticisms to America in speeches in France, England, Turkey and Cairo; and at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He apologized for what he considered to be American arrogance, contempt and irony; for imposing solutions, for acting unilaterally, for acting without any regard for others; for treating other countries merely as agents, for unfair interference in the internal affairs of other nations, for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming, and for selectively promoting democracy. An early apology tour? Romney ranks seven separate letters for Obama as apologies in his book. (We have compiled those passages into a separate document.) We have noted that Obama tends to recognize American mistakes or bad impressions, but he has addressed them with praise for American ideals and the need to come together. At the 2009 meeting in France, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States \"has shown arrogance and was reluctant, even ironic.\" But he immediately said that Europe was guilty of \"unharmful\" and \"harmless\" anti-Americans. In a keynote address to the United Nations, Obama said, \"I took office at a time when many people around the world came to look at America with suspicion and mistrust. Part of this is due to misperceptions and misleading information about my country. Part of this is due to opposition to specific policies and to the belief that, on certain crucial issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. This has fuelled an almost lousy American hostility, which has often served as an excuse for collective inaction.\" In a speech in Cairo on relations between the United States and the Islamic world, Obama was about to regret the actions of the United States decades ago in Iran. However, he immediately responded with criticism of Iran. He simply proposed to both countries \"to move forward.\" Throughout those speeches, Obama was more lenient when he spoke of torture and detention at the United States military facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. Obama has often said that the United States must always remain in compliance with its ideals, and for this reason the use of torture by the United States has undoubtedly been banned, and I ordered the closure of the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay early next year. Apologies or diplomacy? We asked many experts in 2010 if Obama had apologized. Here's a summary of their ideas (read more here): Nile Gardner, Foreign Policy Analyst with the Conservative Heritage Foundation, Obama certainly said he apologized. \u2022 Co-author of an analysis on the subject: \"Pack Obama's first 10 apologies: how the President humiliated a superpower.\" Gardiner said, \"Apologizing to your country presents a picture of weakness before both allies and enemies.\" \"It sends a very clear signal that the United States is responsible for some of the major developments on the world stage. This could be used for the benefit of those who wish to undermine the global American leadership.\" \u2022 John Murphy, Professor of Communications at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champagne, studies presidential discourse and political language. Obama had used compromise language for diplomatic purposes, not for an apology. \"It feels so much more to prove reciprocity,\" said Murphy. \"Every side says, well, we didn't do something great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a new start and move on. \"I don't think that's an apology.\" \u2022 Lauren Bloom, a lawyer and business adviser, wrote a book entitled \"The Art of the Apology,\" advising businessmen and individuals on when and how to apologize. She said Obama's words weren't enough to apologize, mostly because he didn't use the word \"sorry\" or the word \"regret.\" \"I think making an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we' should always be there,\" said Bloom. Obama's remarks were truly non-apologizing, and they were not good at work or personal relationships, as Bloom said. The only area in which it can be useful is international diplomacy. \"Goff. Romney's trying to appeal to John Wayne inside to read it, and this has a certain emotional appeal, \"Blume said. \"For the rest of us, assessing the level of human behaviour below perfection is perfectly reasonable.\" \u2022 We spoke with Roda E. Howard-Hassman, a professor of international human rights issues through the website of apologies and political reparations. Many of the apologies contained in the database relate to genocide or slavery. \"The United States says that torture is not an apology, but a statement of intent,\" said Howard Hasman. \"A full apology must recognize that something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sadness or regret and promise not to repeat it.\" In particular, Obama &apos; s speech in Cairo had been a means of reaching out to the Muslim world, not an acknowledgement of error. \"Whether he apologizes or not, he says, \"I respect your community and respect your customs.\" Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that nod of respect, she said. \"But the gesture of respect is not an apology.\" We should note that Obama and Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton apologized to foreign leaders during the latter half of Obama's term - once to Afghan President Harmid Karzai for accidental burning of the Koran, the Bible of Islam, and to Pakistan for the death of Pakistani troops, respectively. But this 2012 and 2011 girls do not fit Romney's claim that Obama's presidency \"started an apology tour.\" Our verdict again, Romney accused Obama of starting his presidency with an apology tour. Our reviews of Obama &apos; s foreign flights and speeches in 2009 showed nothing of this kind. While he criticized past United States actions, such as the practices of torture in Guant\u00e1namo, he did not make a single apology. It is ridiculous to call Obama's foreign visits and remarks \"a round of apologies.\" We're assessing this statement with pants on fire! On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10154"}
