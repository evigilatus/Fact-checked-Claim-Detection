A blog called politicalears.com posted an article stating that the Ice Bucket Challenge was a \"fraud\" because most of the money was being spent on administration and overhead. The unsigned post was picked up widely on social media feeds; that\u2019s where PolitiFact readers noticed it. Several of them asked us to check it out, so we did. (The website has no contact information, so we were unable to reach the person who wrote the post.)\nHere are key excerpts from the Aug. 28 blog post, headlined, \"Ice bucket fraud: ALS Foundation admits that 73% of donations are not used for ALS research.\"\n\"We've been duped. America is filled with fun-loving and caring people. The viral ice bucket challenge has combined both our sense of responsibility to our fellow human with fun. And it has been fun! Who didn't love seeing Sarah Palin doused? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\"But wait? Ice Bucket Challenge donations are nearing $100 MILLION. Where is that money going? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the ALS Foundation, not towards ALS.\n\"Over 73% of all donations raised are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations. Less than 27% is actually used for the purpose we donated for. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\"According to the ECFA, a charitable watchdog, 27% of donations actually making it to the cause they are donated to is unacceptable. In fact, the ECFA won't deem a non-profit as a reliable charity unless at least 80% of donations make it to their intended projects. ...\n\"The ALS Foundation is a terrible organization to send your money. If you decide to take the Ice Bucket Challenge, may I humbly suggest that you select a well-researched charity (on your own, no endorsements here) and send it to them.\"\nThe post reprints a pie chart taken directly from the ALS Association\u2019s website, showing the following breakdown of expenses:\nResearch: $7.2 million (27 percent)\nPatient and community services: $5.1 million (19 percent)\nPublic and professional education: $8.5 million (32 percent)\nFundraising: $3.6 million (14 percent)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministration: $1.9 million (7 percent)\nLet\u2019s start by noting some comparatively minor problems. First, the group in question is the ALS Association, not the \"ALS Foundation,\" as the blog post calls it. Second, the ALS Association hasn\u2019t said anything to \"admit\" the claims asserted in the blog post, as the post\u2019s headline says. In fact, they\u2019ve posted a response to it here.\nNow for the blog post\u2019s biggest mistakes:\n\u2022 \"Over 73% of all donations raised are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations.\"\nNot true. The 73 percent figure appears to come from subtracting everything except for the 27 percent that falls under \"research.\" The charitable way (no pun intended) of viewing the post\u2019s error is that it misread the category headings.\nIf the post had simply said \"research accounts for only 27 percent of the ALS Association\u2019s budget,\" that would be technically correct though still misleading, since the group\u2019s mission statement includes several goals beyond directly sponsoring research. They include raising awareness, serving as a trusted source of information, providing patients with access to support services and advocating for increased funding for research.\nOnce you include \"patient and community services\" and \"public and professional education\" as legitimate spending to advance the group\u2019s stated mission, the percentage spent on items supporting those goals rises to nearly 79 percent.\nBut the blog post actually exacerbated its error by specifically labeling 73 percent of the group\u2019s spending as \"fundraising, overhead, executive salaries and external donations.\" That\u2019s flat wrong.\nWe\u2019ll add that if anyone wants to donate money to the association for research only, they can do that. \"If a donor would like 100% of their donation to go to research, he/she can simply check a box on our online donation form here,\" the association\u2019s website says. \"If a donor already donated and would like to redirect their donation, please email us at [email\u00a0protected].\"\n\u2022 The role of ECFA. The post cites standards by ECFA, the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability, a group founded in 1979 that \"enhances trust in Christ-centered churches and ministries by establishing and applying Seven Standards of Responsible Stewardship to accredited organizations.\" However, when we contacted ECFA, Dan Busby, the group\u2019s president, told PolitiFact that his group does not advance the argument made in the post.\n\"We were very surprised to see the ALS-related report which attributes certain statements to ECFA,\" Dan Busby, the group\u2019s president, told PolitiFact. \"We did not provide any information for the story.\"\nBusby added that, contrary to what the blog post said, his group doesn\u2019t have a \"bright line\" test for a charity\u2019s appropriate spending percentage. \"The data of applicants and members which reflect high overhead expenses are carefully analyzed for propriety,\" he said. \"In addition to considering the financial picture of a potential donee charity, we believe donors should also look at other attributes, including the charity's commitment to effective board governance, financial integrity, and appropriate accountability.\"\nOther groups that analyze charities have given the ALS Association high scores.\nCharity Navigator, for instance, gave the ALS Association a score of four stars out of four for financial standards and transparency and accountability. The association is \"Top Rated\" by Charity Watch,\u00a0is accredited by the Better Business Bureau and is a Guidestar Exchange gold participant.\nOur ruling\nThe blog post said that \"over 73 percent of all donations raised (from the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge) are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations.\" Whether purposely or by incompetence, the anonymous blogger misreported the ALS Association\u2019s figures. In reality, nearly 79 percent of the ALS Association\u2019s expenditures were for purposes that advance its stated mission. Fundraising, overhead and executive salaries account for no more than 21 percent. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07358"}
