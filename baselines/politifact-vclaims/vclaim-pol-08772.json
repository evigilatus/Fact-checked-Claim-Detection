Four of the five bills dealt solidly with fiscal policy -- taxes and the Public Employees Retirement System. The fifth, though, addressed whether local governments could regulate genetically modified crops.\nThe bill was thrown in as something of a bargaining chip. Gov. John Kitzhaber needed Republican support for his other four endeavors, and the GMO bill was one way to reach a compromise. This deal, however, rubbed environmentalists the wrong way. They began calling the bill the \"Oregon Monsanto Protection Act.\"\nOne of the bill\u2019s critics was Rick North, the former project director of the Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility's Campaign For Safe Food. In a piece he wrote for BlueOregon, a liberal political blog, he called out two of the local -- and wholesome sounding -- groups that were big advocates of the legislation.\n\"Oregonians for Food and Shelter and the Oregon Farm Bureau, biotech puppets who have most state Republican legislators in their back pocket, jumped into action,\" he wrote. \"OFS proudly features board members from Monsanto and Syngenta and the Farm Bureau also receives funding from biotech companies.\"\nWe were curious about the board member and funding claims, so we decided to take a look.\nThe first bit, that Oregonians for Food and Shelter has board members from those two leading biotech firms was easy to check. We simply went to the group\u2019s website and found, listed along with 34 other voting members, these two names: Michael Diamond, the director of government affairs for Monsanto, and Danelle Farmer, who was most recently listed as a senior state government relations manager at Syngenta. The names aren\u2019t difficult to find -- and they\u2019re listed along with their corporate affiliations.\nNaturally, we reached out to Oregonians for Food and Shelter to see if they had extra information we might consider. Scott Dahlman, the executive director, said it is unabashedly the group\u2019s position to defend \"the right to responsibly use pesticides and biotechnology.\"\nNext we checked out the Oregon Farm Bureau funding statement.\nWe started by speaking with the bureau\u2019s spokeswoman, Anne Marie Moss. She said it was probably true because the group has a political action committee that accepts donations from any and all groups.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoss stressed, however, that the Farm Bureau is a largely grassroots organization that takes positions based on what county members -- all of whom are required to be involved in agriculture or ranching -- vote to take up on the state level.\n\"We have members on both sides of that issue as well, but it's like a democracy,\" Moss said. \"Majority rules.\"\nGenerally, she said, the group tries to support all sorts of agriculture, whether organic or genetically modified, but often members come down on the side of fewer restrictions. \"We believe in the whole big tent of agriculture, all types are welcome,\" she said. There is already \"a lot of regulation so, as a whole, we try to push back. We don't want our members regulated out of business.\"\nWe took a look at the campaign finance records for ourselves and found that both Monsanto and Syngenta had contributed a significant sum to the group.\nSince 2006, the Oregon Farm Bureau has reported receiving about $440,000 in cash contributions. Of that, Monsanto has contributed $103,500 and Syngenta has given more than $19,000. That means those two companies represent a combined 28 percent of the total reported cash contributions. This year, Monsanto donated $10,500 -- $4,500 in mid-September.\nDuring our conversation, Moss noted that while the money is appreciated, \"Monsanto couldn't come in and give us a command directive.\" Indeed, we found donations from other sources, including individual farms and nurseries.\nFor our final stab at due diligence, we called North to let him know we\u2019d looked into his claims. We asked him why he thought this information was important given that both groups consider themselves to be grassroots. \"I don't know that it's anything more complicated than \u2018Follow the money,\u2019\" he said.\nIn an opinion piece for BlueOregon, North said Oregonians for Food and Shelter \"proudly features board members from Monsanto and Syngenta and the (Oregon) Farm Bureau also receives funding from biotech.\"\nWe\u2019ve checked out both claims and found them to be accurate. We rate this statement True.\nTell us what you think, by heading over to Oregonlive and leaving us a comment.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08772"}
