Here, we\u2019ll take a look at the second part of Trump\u2019s statement: \"The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs.\"\nThis assertion initially caught our eye because we\u2019d never thought of Michigan as one of the premier coal-producing states. Our suspicion was correct: According to the National Mining Association, Michigan is not on the list of 26 states that currently produce any amount of coal.\nMeanwhile, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of workers engaged in any type of mining in Michigan over the last decade has varied between 5,000 and 7,000, making it essentially impossible to have lost 50,000 existing jobs in that sector. And as the Washington Examiner has noted, Michigan has fewer than 20,000 people working in the electricity generation sector today. So the scale of the job losses Trump cites seem, at least at first blush, to be unlikely.\nSo what was Trump trying to say? The prepared version of his speech includes a footnote that points to a news release from the National Mining Association published almost five years ago, on Sept. 7, 2011.\nHere are some excerpts from that news release, which criticized \"Beyond Coal,\" a campaign against coal-fired power plants coordinated by the environmental group the Sierra Club and cited a study the group released:\n\"The destructive impact of the \u2018Beyond Coal\u2019 campaign is most clearly evident in the following 10 states where power plants blocked by the club represent the highest number of potential jobs (construction and permanent) foregone: Illinois (126,612), Texas (122,065), Montana (114,102), Nevada (75,194), Florida (75,055), Ohio (70,371), Colorado (55,620), Michigan (53,587), Oklahoma (42,581) and Kentucky (38,824).\"\nIn response to an inquiry from PolitiFact, Andrew Wheeler, an energy adviser to the Trump campaign, also pointed to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis that found that 10 delayed or canceled projects in Michigan -- most of them coal-fired plants -- would have created 56,000 jobs up front had they been built.\nBetween the 53,000 jobs cited by the National Mining Association and the 56,000 jobs cited by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Wheeler said, \"it is obvious that the \u2018over 50,000 jobs\u2019 cited by Mr. Trump is accurate.\"\nBut just because a campaign is able to footnote a specific number doesn\u2019t mean that the number is meaningful, or as fully contextualized as it ought to be.\nHere are a few important things to know about this number.\n\u2022 The number refers to \"potential\" jobs lost, not actual jobs lost. This is an important point that would not be obvious from the way Trump phrased his statement. By leaving the impression that these were actual jobs lost, Trump\u2019s statistic invites a degree of outrage that isn\u2019t warranted.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there are good reasons to be cautious about future job projections, especially when they have been framed so broadly as to include vendors to the industry, rail transport, ports and machinery manufacturers.\nAny job projections of this sort are subject to rosy estimates -- especially if a group has a vested interest in the issue. In making an argument to the public, all groups will put forward their most favorable case.\nTrey Pollard, the national press secretary for the Sierra Club -- which has its own dog in the fight -- said the number of plants being counted by the mining association are essentially \"the coal industry\u2019s wildest dreams\" -- a reflection of circumstances in which they can build coal plants \"in any community they want to.\"\n\u2022 The number doesn\u2019t reflect that coal is increasingly being replaced by natural gas. Trump\u2019s decision to use this number tells only part of the story of how the electricity sector has been developing.\nIn recent years, according to federal statistics, coal has been losing ground to natural gas and, to a lesser extent, renewable energy when it comes to electricity generation.\nA July 2016 analysis by Sam Evans of the School of Business and Economics at King University in Bristol, Tenn., found that environmental regulation has been a factor in this switch, but a \"secondary\" one.\n\"The recent decline in the generation share of coal, and the concurrent rise in the share of natural gas, was mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices that have made natural gas generation more economically attractive,\" Evans wrote.\n\u2022 This isn\u2019t just about Obama or Clinton. Trump ignores that much of the impetus in Michigan for switching away from coal has come from the state\u2019s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, and from utilities themselves.\nSnyder has generally continued his support for steps to shift away from coal that began under his Democratic predecessor as governor, Jennifer Granholm. In 2015, Snyder said at an energy conference that \"now is the time to look at a long-term transition away from coal,\" adding that because of the state\u2019s natural gas infrastructure, \"we're well positioned to actually have a fair amount of that coal demand go to natural gas.\"\nAnd Gerry Anderson, the chairman and CEO of DTE Energy, an electric utility that serves more than 2 million customers in the state, has written that \"we plan to retire older, less efficient coal plants and build new, cleaner natural gas power plants over the next decade.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said that \"the Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs.\" However, this claim is problematic on several levels.\nWhile the number matches one projection of how many potential jobs could be lost from the blockage of coal-fired plants, there\u2019s a difference between actual jobs lost and potential future jobs lost. And the number cited -- an impossible-to-confirm projection based on broadly construed calculations released by a pro-coal group -- should be taken with a big grain of salt.\nTrump also ignores that market forces, not just environmental regulations, have driven many of the job losses in the coal sector, and he also ignores that Michigan Republican officials and utilities themselves -- not just the Obama administration -- have pushed the switch away from coal. We rate the claim False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5237e30a-995b-4c02-a36c-e160efe29dfa", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04507"}
