The position of Perry has since been deleted, but not before people have harassed the former Governor of Texas in his comments. \"Good morning, Mr. Governor, I am an African prince and I have large quantities of gold at my disposal!\" One user wrote in response. The article, which also mentions Yahoo's tricks of actors like Julia Roberts and Rob Louie, says Instagram has a new rule \"where they can use your pictures.\" \"Don't forget the deadline today!\" It's going on. \"It can be used in court cases in litigation against you. Anything you have ever published becomes public from today until deleted messages or images are not allowed. I'm not giving Instagram or any entities associated with Instagram permission to use pictures, information, messages or ads, both in the past and in the future. With this statement, I give notice to Instagram that it is strictly prohibited to disclose, copy, distribute or take any other action against me on the basis of this description and/or its contents. All members must publish a warrant like this.

In statements to Yahoo and Time, Instagram's spokesman Stephanie Otway said, \"There's no truth to this article.\" In 2016, Facebook addressed an almost identical article that used Facebook instead of Instagram. \"I may have seen an article telling you to copy and paste a notice to keep control of the things you share on Facebook,\" wrote a member of the company's help team. \"Don't believe it. You have your content and you can control how to share it through your privacy settings.\" Through the creation of an Instagram account, users agree with the conditions of employment of the company. \"We don't claim ownership of your content,\" the phrase says, \"but you give us a license to use it.
