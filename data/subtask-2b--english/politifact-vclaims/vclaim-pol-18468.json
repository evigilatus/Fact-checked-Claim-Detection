A video posted on TikTok Nov. 5 shows what appears to be a screenshot of a Facebook post, which said: \"Wanna see 40,000+ votes for Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen magically become votes for Joe Biden? Abra cadabra! Nope. No fraud here.\"\u00a0\nThe Facebook post included two screenshots seemingly taken 12 minutes apart: one claimed to show Pennsylvania results at 56% reporting, the other, results at 59% reporting.\nThe 56% reporting screenshot had these vote counts:\nTrump: 2,158,770\nBiden: 1,571,693\nJorgensen: 89,025\nThe 59% reporting screenshot had these vote counts:\nTrump: 2,286,966\nBiden: 1,674,122\nJorgensen: 46,987\nSo from one screenshot to the other, Jorgensen\u2019s vote count is down 42,038.\nBut the images do not show or prove that those votes became Biden votes.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the screenshots, Biden\u2019s count increased by more than 102,000, not just the 42,038 purportedly taken away from Jorgensen.\nTrump\u2019s count also increased by more than 128,000, yet the social media posts don\u2019t similarly link Jorgensen\u2019s alleged lost votes to Trump.\nWe found no evidence that the screenshots even represent true counts at any point in time. The images are not from Pennsylvania\u2019s official elections page; they match the look of images from Google\u2019s election count, which says it relies on data provided by the Associated Press. We can't verify the authenticity of the images in the social media posts.\nBy 5 p.m. eastern time Nov. 5, results posted by election officials in Pennsylvania showed that Jorgensen had around 74,000 votes, with about 93% of the state\u2019s total votes counted. That tally is less than the amount she supposedly had at 56% reporting.\nPolitiFact reached out to Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of state for more information, but we did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nSocial media posts claimed, \"40,000+ votes for Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen magically become votes for Joe Biden.\"\nWe found no evidence that supports the claim.\nThe posts claimed that by the time Pennsylvania had reported 56% of votes, Jorgensen had 89,000 votes, and that her count declined by 40,000 votes shortly after. The latest information available from Pennsylvania election officials, with about 93% of votes counted, showed that Jorgensen had not yet reached 89,000 votes.\nGiven that Jorgensen did not have those 89,000 votes to begin with, the claim that 40,000 of her votes \"magically\" became Biden\u2019s is baseless. Other data included in the posts also do not prove the claim.\nWe rate the posts False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18468"}
