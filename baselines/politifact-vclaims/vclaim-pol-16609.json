It would also rely on private insurance companies to offer plans, just as they do today through the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program.\n\n\nThe government insurance that would be offered under Clinton's plan would be modeled on traditional Medicare, which has been supported by both political parties.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUwe Reinhardt, a professor of economics at Princeton University, said the Clinton plan relies heavily on private insurance companies to provide coverage.\n\n\n\"If the insurance industry calculates this carefully, they'll make money off it,\" he said.\n\n\nAccording to\n\nDorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary\n\n, socialized medicine is \"a system of medical care regulated and controlled by the government, in which the government assumes responsibility for providing for the health needs and hospital care of the entire population, at no direct cost or at a nominal fee to the individual, by means of subsidies obtained by taxation.\"\n\n\nIt's inaccurate to call Clinton's proposal \"socialized medicine.\" It doesn't meet that definition because the government would not control the system and because of the heavy involvement of private insurance companies \u2014 which could turn a profit from the plan.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16609"}
