He got 'very rich' off 'the only real asset he has: his influence in and access to the Obama White House.' If this is who Obama trusts, can you trust Obama?\"\n\n\nWe\u2019ll leave the question of trust to you. But we figured we would get to the bottom of the ad\u2019s central claim, whether Plouffe took money from a \"joint venture partner\" of an Iranian cellular company.\n\n \u2018Large piles of cash\u2019\n\nPlouffe, who famously managed Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, gave paid speeches around the world before he joined the White House as a senior adviser after the 2010 midterm elections.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecure America Now is the political arm of a similarly named nonprofit that says it supports \"policies that will protect our nation against terrorist infiltration, attack, and capitulation to our enemies.\"\n\nIt has previously accused Obama of softness on Iran, a nation  under U.S. sanctions for supporting terrorism and attempting to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nWe reached out to the group, but didn\u2019t hear back. But the ad itself cites sources.\n\nThe text relies heavily on the words of Glenn Greenwald, a Guardian columnist who used to write for progressive news site Salon. Greenwald wrote in reaction to an Aug. 5, 2012, Washington Post story.\n\nThe Post piece detailed how Plouffe\u2019s 2011 financial disclosure showed he had been paid $100,000 by MTN Nigeria. The White House explained to the Post that Plouffe traveled to Lagos, Nigeria, for two speeches in December 2010, just before he joined the Obama administration as a senior adviser.\n\nThe Nigerian cell phone service provider is part of South African conglomerate MTN Group, which also owns 49 percent of an Iranian subsidiary, MTN Irancell. The South African company offers cell service through subsidiaries in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nGreenwald argued the scandal of the speaking fees wasn\u2019t that they were \"tainted by virtue of a connection to the Evil Persian Regime,\" something that he found \"frivolous and cynical, just part of the ongoing Washington fear-mongering orgy over Iran.\"\n\nRather, he saw them as an example of utterly typical \u2014 though deplorable \u2014 Washington influence-peddling.\n\n\"David Plouffe \u2014 who has spent his entire career working in Washington as a political operative \u2014 has become a very rich man by converting into large piles of cash the only real asset he has: his influence in and access to the Obama White House and the Democratic Party,\" he wrote.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nWe asked Greenwald whether he thought the ad accurately characterized his work.\n\n\"I think the parts about Plouffe are completely accurate,\" he said. \"I think $100,000 for a couple of short speeches is a \u2018large pile of cash\u2019 in anyone's eyes.\"\n\nBut he told us he\u2019s not an expert on the MTN Group \"or what it and its subsidiaries are doing with Iran.\" (And, in fact, for that claim the ad relied on a different source.) Greenwald said he relied on the government sources quoted in the Post article.\n\nThe Post reported that a Treasury undersecretary had told Turkish officials in 2006 that Irancell was \"fully owned\" by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. That wasn\u2019t public knowledge until an infamous release of State Department cables by WikiLeaks in 2010-11.\n\n White House response\n\nWhite House spokesman Eric Schultz called the ad \"a complete distortion of the facts.\"\n\nHe argued, among other things:\n\n\u2022 Plouffe didn\u2019t directly profit from a \"joint venture partner\" of an Iranian company, as the ad said, but from its Nigerian subsidiary.\n\n\u2022 It was misleading to say that the U.S. government described Irancell as \"fully owned\" by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps., because that detail was in an as-yet unreleased State Department cable. Meanwhile, prominent advocacy groups hadn\u2019t directly taken up the issue of MTN Group\u2019s involvement in Iran when Plouffe spoke. That started in 2012.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to note that the ad makes it sound as though Plouffe was paid by MTN Group, when he in fact spoke for MTN Nigeria.\n\nBut about the Revolutionary Guard relationship, we wondered: What could Plouffe (or the lawyer  he\u2019s said to have consulted) have learned about MTN Nigeria and its parent company in 2010?\n\nPlenty, as it turns out.\n\nWe spent a few minutes with subscription news database Nexis. Searching just for \"MTN Group\" for articles published before December 2010, we quickly found a description of the company that mentioned Iran in a November 2010 news release:\n\nLaunched in 1994, the MTN Group is a multinational telecommunications group, operating in 21 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The MTN Group is listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in South Africa under the share code: MTN. As of 30 September 2010 , MTN recorded 134.4 million subscribers across its operations in Afghanistan, Benin, Botswana, Cameroon, Cote dIvoire, Cyprus, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Guinea Republic, Iran, Liberia, Nigeria, Republic of Congo (Congo Brazzaville), Rwanda, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Syria, Uganda, Yemen and Zambia.\n\nWith the same search, we turned up a Business Process Management Journal article describing MTN Irancell\u2019s ownership as \"comprised of two shareholders who are the Iran Electronic Development Company (IEDC) and MTN International (Mauritius) Limited. IEDC currently has two key shareholders: Iran Electronic Industries, known as SAIRAN and Mostazafan Foundation, known as Bonyad.\"\n\nIf Plouffe or his lawyer had run those names through a publicly searchable Treasury database, they would have found that Iran Electronic Industries was under U.S. sanctions for being a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction, known for its role in Iran\u2019s missile program. A Treasury news release in 2008 said it offered \"a diversified range of military products including electro-optics and lasers, communication equipment, telecommunication security equipment, electronic warfare equipment, new and refurbished radar tubes, and missile launchers.\"\n\nSo, an MTN Irancell investor had already been labeled \u2014 that\u2019s right \u2014 a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe Iran connection in hand, a Google search turned up more, such as this 2008 New York Times article about MTN Group\u2019s challenges with U.S. sanctions as it rapidly expanded its Iranian business.\n\nIn other words, quick searches turned up red flags aplenty, well in advance of WikiLeaks\u2019 release or advocacy groups\u2019 publicity.\n\nWe should note these are political, more than legal, red flags \u2014 transactions are prohibited between Americans and blocked companies, but Plouffe wouldn\u2019t run afoul of the law taking money from a separate subsidiary of a company with an Iranian connection.\n\nBut a political issue is precisely what this ad suggests.\n\nAnd even White House press briefings from the summer before Plouffe\u2019s speeches would have tipped him off to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard\u2019s use of front companies and expanding reach into Iran\u2019s economy.\n\nAs the administration announced new Iran sanctions in June 2010, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence Stuart Levey noted the Iranian Revolutionary Guard had \"taken over broad portions of the Iranian economy.\" Meanwhile, he expected Iran would \"scramble to identify workarounds, hiding behind front companies, doctoring wire transfers, falsifying shipping documents.\"\n\n Our ruling\n\nSecure America Now\u2019s ad claims that Plouffe took \"large piles of cash\" from a joint venture partner of a company owned by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard. In reality, he took $100,000 for two speeches from a Nigerian subsidiary of that \"joint venture partner,\" and the Iranian company\u2019s ownership wasn\u2019t yet crystal clear. But there were plenty of red flags, if Plouffe had looked for them, that his speaking trip in retrospect might not look so politically savvy. For example, a key Irancell shareholder was already labeled a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. We rate the ad\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10323"}
