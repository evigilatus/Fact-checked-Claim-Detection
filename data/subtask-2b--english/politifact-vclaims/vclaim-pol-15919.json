John McCain\u2019s proposal to have the government buy and renegotiate what his top adviser later said would be \u201cliterally millions\u201d of mortgages on houses whose values have dropped and whose owners are struggling to keep up with payments.\n\n\nTaxpayers would cover the difference between the original loan and the new one, at a cost the McCain campaign estimated to be at $300-billion.\n\n\n\u201cIs it expensive? Yes,\u201d McCain said during the debate on Oct. 7, 2008. \u201cBut we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we\u2019re never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy. And we\u2019ve got to give some trust and confidence back to America.\u201d\n\n\nIn announcing the plan amid the question-and-answer of a town hall meeting, McCain sought to make clear that this was a bold, new idea all his own: \u201cAnd it\u2019s my proposal, it\u2019s not Sen. Obama\u2019s proposal, it\u2019s not President Bush\u2019s proposal.\u201d\n\n\nThe question is whether or not McCain's proposal is as original as he claims.\n\n\nBut first, some details on the plan.\n\n\n\u201cMechanically, the initiative is very simple,\u201d said Doug Holtz-Eakin, senior policy adviser for the McCain campaign. \u201cA home\u00adowner would initiate the process by calling a mortgage broker or other originator and basically saying, 'I\u2019d like to refinance my home,\u2019 and they would start the underwriting process, verify incomes.\u201d\n\n\nThe government loans would be available to mortgage holders who:\n\n\n\u2022 Live in the home as a primary residence.\n\n\n\u2022 Can prove their creditworthiness (and made a down payment at the time of the purchase).\n\n\nThe FHA would then issue a 30-year fixed rate mortgage at a rate Holtz-Eakin estimated would be \u201cin the low 5 percent\u201d range. Mortgage rates for 30-year fixed home loans are currently about 5.82 percent.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxpayers would pick up the difference between the value of the two loans.\n\n\nWhile at least part of the expense of McCain\u2019s plan would be borne by the recently approved $700-billion bailout plan, the initiative also would tap some of the $300-billion tied to the Housing and Economic Recovery Act passed this summer. That\u2019s a plan that seeks to refinance loans for low- to moderate-income homeowners struggling to pay for homes they bought for more than they are now worth.\n\n\nThe McCain plan outlines a dramatic shift in emphasis for the $700-billion bailout plan. While the bailout contained provisions to allow the Treasury to purchase mortgages directly, the legislation primarily was intended as a means for the government to buy troubled assets from financial institutions that might otherwise fail and that could later be sold when the markets recover.\n\n\nThe hope, said Holtz-Eakin, is that McCain\u2019s \u201cbottom level up\u201d plan will offset the need for some of that $700-billion.\n\n\nWhen McCain announced the plan at the debate, Obama supporters were quick to note that Obama had in previous weeks recommended that the bailout plan include the option of buying individual mortgages. \u201cWe can\u2019t simply bail out Wall Street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are facing foreclosure \u2014 or, for that matter, are seeing their home values decline,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\nMcCain argued, during the debate and afterward, that his proposal is nothing like what Obama talked about. And after hearing details the next day, the Obama campaign agreed with McCain.\n\n\nObama has always supported plans to have the government buy loans at market prices (in other words, the loan companies would have to swallow some loss), said Obama campaign economic policy director Jason Furman. And homeowners would have to share some of the profits should the value of the home rise. But McCain's proposal wouldn't do either of those things. The government would refinance homes at their new, lower value and absorb the loss in propoerty values entirely.\n\n\nOkay, so who's idea is it?\n\n\nCharlie Black, a senior adviser to McCain, told the\n\nNew York Times\n\nthe mortgage renewal idea actually originated with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who borrowed it from a Depression-era New Deal agency, the Home Owner\u2019s Loan Corp.\n\n\nClinton spoke about her plan before Congress on Sept. 18, 2008.\u00a0\"A new government entity like the HOLC with a focus on attacking the source of the problem can serve the purpose of clearing a lot of those toxic mortgage securities from the market,\" Clinton said. \"We know there will not be any semblance of a normal or orderly marketplace until we have found a way to resolve these mortgage securities that are metastasizing in the bottom of our markets. By taking this paper out of the market and quarantining it in this new entity we will be able to give the market breathing room to recover. We will also be able to set the stage for an orderly sale of these securities and in turn allow some of them to recover and actually regain some of their value. Perhaps just as importantly, not only would our financial markets stabilize but so would our housing markets.\"\n\n\nAlthough Clinton did not offer specifics of her plan, she seemed to suggest that it would entail buying mortgages at\u00a0discounted current market rates, and that taxpayers might ultimately turn a profit on them.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's not McCain's plan.\n\n\nSo here's where we stand: It's true\u00a0that terms of the $700-billion bailout plan first initiated by President Bush contains authority for the Treasury to purchase mortgages directly. And it's true that Obama has called for a component of the buyout plan to include direct purchase of mortgages to alleviate homeowners\u00a0struggling to make payments. Finally, it's true that Clinton sketched out a plan last spring that shared some of the goals and traits of McCain's proposal.\n\n\nThe method McCain proposes\u00a0\u2014 buying mortgages at their original value\u00a0and renegotiating\u00a0at the current market value (with taxpayers picking up the difference)\u00a0\u2014 is indeed new. But while McCain can rightly take credit for the details of his proposal, he is by no means alone with the idea of having the federal government buy mortgages directly.
