In the ad, it's called \"option,\" it says, \"Nelson's voice for billions of sloppy spending plans like a bridge to nowhere. Lemox didn't ask for a single mark and pushed for ban all of them.\" We split this claim into two fact checks. In a separate item, we're exploring the claim that \"Nelson sounded billions of wasteful spending like a bridge to nowhere.\" In this item, we will address the second half of the equation, the claim that, \"LeMeieux did not ask for one mark and push for their ban.\" While this is technically true, the contradiction is not as suggested by the black and white declaration. This is why: Lemeux was appointed to the Senate by Florida Goff. Charlie Christ to fill the rest of Sun's retired Mel Martinez. Lemio took office on September 10, 2009, and served until January 3, 2011. Shortly after he took office, Limeaux voted for a handful of credit bills that contained thousands of allocations worth billions of dollars. We're gonna destroy it. On October 15, 2009, LeMieux voted in favour of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations and Related Agencies Bill for fiscal year 2010. According to the report of the Congressional Research Service, the bill contains 2,293 allocations at a cost of $5.7 billion. On 6 October 2009, and 19 December 2009, Limeuux voted in favour of the Ministry of Defence appropriation bills. It covered 1,719 allocations at a cost of $4.2 billion. On 20 October 2009, Limeuux voted in favour of the Ministry of Internal Security Appropriations Bill. It included 192 allocations at a cost of $420 million. On 5 November 2009, Limeo voted in favour of the bill of appropriations on trade, justice, science and related agencies. The invoice included 1,513 allocations at a cost of $781 million. In November 17, Limeo voted in favour of the Military Construction Appropriations and Veterans &apos; Affairs Bill. It included 745 allocations at a cost of $14.5 billion. In other words, LeMieux voted on bills containing billions of dollars in allocations, the same thing that the Nelson Declaration criticized in the preceding sentence. But the ad is written in letters. He's not saying Lemex never voted for a sign, he's saying he never asked for one. That's right, but it's also true that the lines for Florida were already filled in in the credit bills before Lee Meaux took over Martinez. We reviewed the database for fiscal year 2010 compiled by taxpayers for common sense - a group that follows federal allocations - and we found several dozen ad hoc signs at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars requested by Martinez (sometimes requested in conjunction with Nelson et al.) for various Florida projects, which were included in the credit bills for which Lemox voted. We didn't find any evidence that Limeaux tried to remove those marks from Florida. We asked Lemio about those voices by e-mail. \"I never asked for a sign,\" said Limeaux. It became clear to me after my first two months in D.C., and my first seizure bill, that the allocater is the engine that drives the rising spending train. After that experiment, I had a press conference with Cince. Demet, Graham and others pledge not to seek a seal.\" At that press conference, Republican legislators called for a one-year moratorium on all assigned marks. \"Let me tell you why I think strings are a problem,\" said Lemio at the press conference. \"They're not just a problem with the amount of budget they're on, because it's not a huge amount. It's a problem because it's an enabler. \"In my short time here, I've seen that if you're asking for a project and you're returning it to your home country, then when the budget you're getting you on a certain credit document is 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent more than last year, So I haven't done any markings since I was here, and I made a decision last month not to do it for the rest of the time that I'm here, because the nation is in terrible financial distress.\" There is no doubt, therefore, that Limeux was forced to ban the strings, as the ad claims. However, in support of that point, the announcement refers to the vote of Limeo on November 2010, in favour of an amendment that sought to impose a moratorium on allocations during fiscal year 2013. The amendment failed, with 39 senators voting in favour of the amendment (including LeMieux) and 56 opponents. But here's what the ad doesn't say. Nelson also voted for the moratorium. \"Nelson may have voted to ban all leads, but he's still looking for them and he's still supporting them,\" wrote Lemeux to us in an e-mail. \"My voice was honest.\" Also, Lemio said, \"I have signed a pledge not to seek any seal if I have the honour of serving again.\" We contacted Nelson's press office for comment, but we didn't hear anything. Once again, the formulation of the claims contained in the Limeuux Declaration is technically correct. Lemio personally didn't ask for any plans, and he pressed to stop them all. However, we believe that it is a little hypocrisy to invite Lemeux Nelson to vote on a bill that includes billions of dollars of markings (especially the notorious bridge to nowhere). LeMieux also voted on bills that included thousands of allocations worth billions of dollars. With the same logic in the Limeux Declaration, Nelson could include a declaration that Limeux voted for billions in allocations, including any number of hideous pet projects from all over the country that were included in a handful of adoption bills voted for by Limeux in late 2009. Lemio states that he never applied for a personal allocation (while Nelson certainly requested it). But once again, we think it's worth noting that the credit bills that Lemeux voted on were filled with dozens of Florida plans -- which cost hundreds of millions of dollars -- that his Republican predecessor, Martinez requested. Lemio put himself at the forefront of the issue of the re-establishment of the threads, and the adoption in early 2010 of a position calling for a total ban. It may not be true that Nelson found religion on decrees, but Nelson was among half a dozen Democrats in the Senate who also voted for a moratorium on religion. We believe that this is a lot of missing contexts, and we therefore assess the claim half as true. Vern Buchanan showed on April 27, 2010 in an online video. In the past 50 years, the federal government has balanced the budget only five times. Prepared by Aaron Sharokman (May 7, 2010)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13101"}
