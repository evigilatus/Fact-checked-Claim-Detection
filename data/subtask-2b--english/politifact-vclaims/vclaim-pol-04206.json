And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start.\"\nConverting Obamacare to a single-payer program would make it, like Medicare, a federal health insurance program run by the federal government. Currently, Obamacare promotes policies supplied by private insurance companies.\nSome Democrats \u2014 including, at one time, Barack Obama \u2014 pushed for a single-payer system comparable with what other developed countries have. But that turned out to be politically untenable.\nThe result was the Obamacare patchwork of different commercial insurance plans offered in \"marketplaces\" by individual states and the federal government.\nWe contacted the Donald Trump campaign seeking evidence that Clinton and Kaine, in fact, wanted to convert Obamacare into a national health insurance system.\nSpokesman Dan Kowalski pointed us to the health care page on Clinton's website.\nIt indicates \"that she supports a 'public option' for Obamacare,\" Kowalski said. \"A 'public option' is a single-payer-like option for health care delivery.\"\nClinton's website does, indeed, say that she wants a public option. But that would be just one option. Under a single-payer system, the government provides health care for everyone. Clinton's web page makes it clear that there would be other payers as well.\nClinton has consistently said she wants to protect Obamacare from being repealed by the Republicans \u2014 and Trump \u2014 and expand it by protecting consumers from rising health care costs.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer expansion would include tax credits, eliminating the out-of-network hospital charges many plans levy, and reducing prescription drug costs by removing the ban that prevents the federal government from negotiating drug prices and allowing Americans to important their drugs from countries where the prices are dramatically lower.\nOther parts of her proposal were outlined in a 1,500-word commentary in the Sept. 28 New England Journal of Medicine. Trump declined to submit details on his plans.\nWe asked the Trump campaign if they had seen any statements from Clinton or Kaine indicating that converting Obamacare into a single-payer system was their eventual goal.\nKowalski responded that \"Hillary has committed fully to the public option,\" and as evidence he directed us to comments Clinton made in 1994 when she was first lady.\nAt the time, she predicted that if Congress didn't pass health care reform soon, \"I believe, and I may be totally off base on this, but I believe that by the year 2000 we will have a single-payer system. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s a close call politically.\" She earns no Nostradamus points for that one.\nMore to the point, later in her answer Clinton says there are three ways to get universal health coverage, only one of which is a single-payer system. The other two: an employer mandate or an individual mandate, which is how Obamacare works.\nOur ruling\nPence said Clinton and Kaine \"want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program,\" suggesting that they have proposed such a change. They have not. They have promoted a public option, which would be a government-sponsored insurance plan.\nA lot of Democrats, such as Bernie Sanders, would like to go in that direction. But throughout the current campaign, Clinton has consistently resisted that suggestion, saying she would work to prevent the repeal of Obamacare and try to improve on it.\nNo one would be surprised if Clinton pushed for single payer if it became politically practical, but none of her campaign statements are calling for that.\nWe rate Pence's statement Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9c96e957-1429-4062-b0a0-e96538007969", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04206"}
