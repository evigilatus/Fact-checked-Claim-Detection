Of these, only three have the potential of being settled in the November election. ... Nearly 90 percent of all county races will be settled by the time of the Democratic primary\" on March 4, 2014.\nTravis County\u2019s pretty blue, as Thorburn noted and as PolitiFact Texas explored in a recent fact-check of U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett\u2019s claim that its surrounding counties are red (True).\nIs it so blue that most of the county\u2019s votes cast in the Nov. 4 election won\u2019t really decide anything?\nBy email, Thorburn pointed us to the state elections website and said, \"Please realize that I did not say 90 percent of all races that will appear on the November ballot in Travis County (which would include state, multi-county district, and state legislative positions). What I specifically said is county offices, including county judge, commissioners from precincts 2 and 4, several justices of the peace, and several county court at law positions.\"\nThe only assumption he made, Thorburn said, is that no Libertarian or Green Party candidates will win. \"The secretary of state's web site does not include any Libertarian or Green Party candidates who may be nominated by a convention, rather than a primary,\" he said.\nCounty elections official Michelle Parker guided us by phone to a breakdown of races on the county\u2019s election website. Next, from the state secretary\u2019s elections web page of candidates who filed for the primary by the Dec. 9, 2013 deadline, we pulled the Travis County names.\nAfter setting aside the candidates for Congress, governor and other federal or state offices, we came up with 32 candidates running in 19 races and only three Republicans in the lot.\n\n\n\n\nDistrict Judge 201st District Court\n\n\nAmy Clark Meachum\n\n\nDEM\n\n\n\n\nDistrict Judge 250th District Court\n\n\nKarin Crump\n\n\nDEM\n\n\n\n\nDistrict Judge 419th District Court\n\n\nOrlinda Naranjo\n\n\nDEM\n\n\n\n\nCounty Judge\n\n\nAndy Brown\n\n\nDEM\n\n\n\n\nCounty Judge\n\n\nSarah Eckhardt\n\n\nDEM\n\n\n\n\nCounty Judge\n\n\nMike McNamara\n\n\nREP\n\n\n\n\nCounty Court At Law Judge #1\n\n\nTodd Wong\n\n\nDEM\n\n\n\n\nCounty Court At Law Judge #2\n\n\nEric Montgomery Shepperd\n\n\nDEM\n\n\n\n\nCounty Court At Law Judge #3\n\n\nJohn Lipscombe\n\n\nDEM\n\n\n\n\nCounty Court At Law Judge #3\n\n\nPaul Evans\n\n\nDEM\n\n\n\n\nCounty Court At Law Judge #4\n\n\nMike Denton\n\n\nDEM\n\n\n\n\nCounty Court At Law Judge #5\n\n\nNancy Hohengarten\n\n\nDEM\n\n\n\n\nCounty Court At Law Judge #6\n\n\nBrandy Mueller\n\n\nDEM\n\n\n\n\nCounty Court At Law Judge #7\n\n\nElisabeth Earle\n\n\nDEM\n\n\n\n\nCounty Probate Court Judge\n\n\nGuy Herman\n\n\nDEM\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict Clerk\n\n\nVelva L.

Still, 16 out of 19 races for county office lack a Republican candidate, which suggests that 84 percent of the positions will be all but settled once the primaries are over.\nWe rate this statement as Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08324"}
