Leo Berman says Hawaii governor can't find anything that says Obama was born in Hawaii", "text": "CORRECTION, 9:38 a.m.\u00a0 Feb. 27, 2011: Our initial posted article had an incorrect first reference to the fact-checking entity that reviewed the birth certificate aired by Barack Obama's campaign. That research was done by FactCheck.org. The text is correct below.\n\nState Rep. Leo Berman says that his proposed bill to require presidential candidates to show their birth certificates to the Texas secretary of state reflects doubts about President Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace.\n\n\"We don\u2019t think the president was vetted, and it\u2019s just that simple,\" Berman, R-Tyler, is quoted as saying in a Feb. 14 Politico article about similar proposals pending in some other states. \"I read different things that say he was born in Hawaii, and then I read the governor (of Hawaii) can\u2019t find anything that says he was born in Hawaii.\"\n\nA subset of Obama critics, dubbed \"birthers,\" doubt that he is a natural-born U.S. citizen, a requirement to serve as president, and question the validity of his Hawaii birth document. That\u2019s an old claim, shot down by PolitiFact National and FactCheck.org, which concluded that that a document aired by Obama's campaign is authentic. We won\u2019t revisit that question.\n\nStill, Berman\u2019s claim that Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie couldn\u2019t vouch for Obama\u2019s birth in the Aloha State was a new one to us.\n\nWhen we asked Berman about it, he replied: \"I just listen to the news, I don\u2019t write it down. It\u2019s been on several news stations that he (Abercrombie) said he was going to resolve this once and for all and when he tried to ... he couldn\u2019t find anything.\"\n\nBerman\u2019s public comments have previously put him in \"birther\" company.\n\nIn a Nov. 17 Lubbock Avalanche-Journal news article, Berman said his proposal was necessary \"because we have a president whom the American people don\u2019t know whether he was born in Kenya or some other place.\" It\u2019s undisputed, as posted on the White House website, that Obama\u2019s late father was born in Kenya.\n\nBut back to Hawaii: In 2008, in response to questions about Obama\u2019s birthplace, his campaign released a copy of his \"Certification of Live Birth\" from Hawaii and posted it online. The document states that Barack Hussein Obama II was born on at 7:24 p.m. Aug. 4, 1961, in Honolulu to parents Stanley Ann Dunham and Barack Hussein Obama.\n\nBirthers, though, said the posted document was a shortened version of a birth certificate, questioning why the original, \"long form\" documentation of birth was not released.\n\nAccording to a Dec. 24 New York Times news article, Abercrombie, who was elected Hawaii\u2019s governor in November, was angered by the persistent skepticism that Obama was born in the United States and planned to seek ways to release additional proof that his birthplace was Hawaii. \"It\u2019s an insult to his mother and to his father, and I knew his mother and father; they were my friends, and I have an emotional interest in that,\" Abercrombie told the Times.\n\nNext, we searched for the reports that Berman mentioned. Online, we found numerous Web pages with the headline \"Hawaii Governor Can\u2019t Find Obama\u2019s Birth Certificate.\" Many linked to a Jan. 18 article by the conservative WorldNetDaily.com, a locomotive on the birther train, that was based on comments that Abercrombie made to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.\n\nThe WorldNetDaily story begins: \"Abercrombie suggested in an interview published today that a long-form, hospital-generated birth certificate for Barack Obama may not exist within the vital records maintained by the Hawaii Department of Health.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story continues: \"Abercrombie did not report to the newspaper that he or the Hawaii Department of Health had found Obama's long-form, hospital-generated birth certificate. The governor only suggested his investigations to date had identified an unspecified listing or notation of Obama's birth that someone had made in the state archives.\"\n\nIn the Star-Advertiser\u2019s Jan. 18 published interview with Abercrombie, the governor was asked about his plan to release more information regarding Obama's birth certificate. He responded that he wants to use information from the state archives about Obama\u2019s birth. \"This is what our investigation is showing, it actually exists in the archives, written down,\" Abercrombie said.\n\nWe called and e-mailed Abercrombie\u2019s office about this and did not hear back.\n\nMeanwhile, we found another report that Abercrombie couldn\u2019t find proof that Obama was born in Hawaii. On Minnesota\u2019s KQRS-FM radio Jan. 20, Hollywood reporter Mike Evans, claiming to be a longtime friend of Abercrombie\u2019s, said the governor had told him that he had searched \"everywhere\" at Hawaii hospitals and that \"there is no Barack Obama birth certificate in Hawaii. Absolutely no proof at all that he was born in Hawaii.\"\n\nThe same day, Evans made the claim on Austin\u2019s KLBJ-AM.\n\nSix days later, though, FoxNews.com quoted Evans as saying that he had misspoken. According to FoxNews.com, Evans said that he called Abercrombie\u2019s office after reading online reports that the governor couldn\u2019t find Obama\u2019s birth certificate but that Abercrombie did not return his call. \"I haven\u2019t talked to Neil since he\u2019s been governor,\" Evans said.\n\nMeanwhile, The Associated Press reported that Abercrombie\u2019s office had ended its effort to make public more information about Obama\u2019s birth. The story does not say that Abercrombie had failed to find evidence of Obama\u2019s birthplace, but that the state\u2019s attorney general had told the governor that he can't disclose birth documentation without the person's consent. \"There is nothing more that Gov. Abercrombie can do within the law to produce a document,\" Abercrombie spokeswoman Donalyn Dela Cruz said.\n\nWe wondered whether Abercrombie sought Obama\u2019s permission to obtain more proof of his birth. The White House wouldn\u2019t comment, but Abercrombie told CNN on Dec. 27 that \"we haven\u2019t had any of those discussions.\"\n\nPer the authenticity of the document posted online by Obama, our colleagues at PolitiFact National pointed out July 1, 2009, that FactCheck.org, a respected fact-checking unit at the University of Pennsylvania, had traveled to Chicago to examine the document and concluded that it\u2019s legitimate.\n\nJanice Okubo, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Department of Health, told our colleagues that too much was being made of the difference between the so-called \"long\" and \"short\" forms. \"When you request a birth certificate, the one you get looks exactly like the one posted on his site,\" she said. \"That's the birth certificate.\"\n\nAccording to a Nov. 1, 2008, FactCheck.org article, the \"long\" form is created by the hospital while the \"short\" form is printed by the state and draws from a database with less information. FactCheck.org also noted that the state\u2019s birth record request form does not have an option for requesting a long-form birth certificate.\n\nThe Hawaii Health Department maintains a Web page devoted to questions about Obama\u2019s \"vital records.\" It says that copies of vital records \u2014 which pertain to birth, death, marriage, etc. \u2014 can only be obtained by someone with a \"direct and tangible interest\" in the record. However, the public can view \u00a0\"index data\" based on those records in a department office in Honolulu or request it by mail.\n\nThe page says that \"the index data regarding President Obama is: Birth Index // Obama II, Barack Hussein // Male.\"\n\nRewind: Berman didn\u2019t pinpoint where he heard or read that Hawaii\u2019s governor couldn\u2019t find proof of Obama\u2019s birthplace. We combed published reports, finding no proof Abercrombie said that. We rate Berman\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13520"}
