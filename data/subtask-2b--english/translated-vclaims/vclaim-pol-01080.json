Tony Evers to keep his laws off their guns. In fact, some have carried their weapons in public. The purpose of the protest was to challenge possible control measures over the weapons that the new governor might pay, and Thomas Leger said to Poletti Fructte Wisconsin. The introduction of personal firearms allowed individuals to express their rights to open marriage. Of particular concern are the so-called \"red flag\" laws. On the day before the gathering, the Wisconsin Firearms Alliance conveyed its message on the laws to Facebook, saying: \"Governor Evers, Attorney General Josh Cole, and Speaker Robin Voss are demanding \"the looting of red flag weapons\" for Wisconsin!\" The article added: \"This would allow almost anyone to claim to be \"dangerous,\" and law enforcement would confiscate their firearms without any evidence, arrest, indictment, conviction or fair trial at all.\" In January 23, 2019, there were 6,500 shares in this job, about 7,000 loves and 2,000 comments. The Wisconsin Firearms Alliance is a non-profit group that states that it is dedicated to defending and advancing the rights of the Second Amendment to all law-abiding citizens of the state of Wisconsin. Besides Evers, the Democratic Party, the newly elected Attorney General Josh Cole, also the Democratic, and the President of the Robin Vos Assembly, a Republican, mentioned his position. Is the group right that the three \"request\" the Red Flag laws of Wisconsin? That such laws allow for the seizure of weapons with \"no evidence, arrest, indictment, conviction or due process\"? With regard to laws, \"exports of red flag rifles\" refer to provisions allowing officials to take firearms belonging to persons considered to be a threat to themselves or others. Family members or law enforcement officials must ask the judge to temporarily restrict the person &apos; s access to firearms. The term comes from the idea that a person's behavior amounts to \"red flag\" in relation to danger. Since the mass shooting at Mariory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla, in February 2018, a total of 13 states have developed such laws. When asked to support his claim through Facebook, the Wisconsin Firearms Coalition replied: \"The Attorney General's comments were in his opening speech, the Governor came out the next day to support the red flags, and state-wide media report that Robin Voss was willing to consider the idea one or two days later.\" Let us begin with the elected officials. On January 26, 2021, Jim Steinke, in a tweet to the Republicans of the Association, mentioned \"Come to the table\" and was part of a compromise \"Give and Take\" on the Corona virus bill. \u2022 January 27, 2012, Cole, in his inaugural speech on January 7, 2019, called for steps to make schools safer, and mentioned the laws of red science as a way to do so. From the Red Flag Act, he said, \"it will allow law enforcement or family members to go to the judge and ensure that a person who poses a threat to himself or to others is temporarily disarmed.\" In a story published in January 10, 2019 on the WAW-TV site based in Waso, Evers supported Cole's position and quoted it as saying, \"At any time we have the ability to take a firearm from someone who may not be able to deal with a firearm because of various disabilities, we need to investigate it.\" The same article included this line: a speaker at the Assembly said that he was ready to consider the Red Flag Act, but he was concerned about the rights of owners of firearms. But this line, in particular, is far from \"requesting\" that the laws be put in place. The Director of Communications, Vos Kit Bayer, described the speaker as a strong supporter of the second amendment and pointed out that he was \"afraid of robbing anyone's constitutional rights\" when it came to such laws. On January 22, 2019, Voss was more assertive in his response to the title of the State of Evers. \"I promise you: the Republicans will fight for and protect your freedom, against the laws of unnecessary Red Flag weapons,\" he said. Therefore, the claim of the group depends to a large extent on the money with Evers and Cole, but it mischaracterizes the position of Voss. The bigger picture is that there are bigger problems with the main direction of the prosecution -- that the laws allow the confiscation of weapons with \"no evidence, arrest, indictment, conviction or fair trial.\" Adam Winkler, a professor of law and a specialist in constitutional law at the University of California in Los Angeles, said that the laws of the Red Flag required a neutral arbitrator to order the confiscation of individual firearms. Winkler said, \"The judge has to decide that a person is a threat.\" This reduces the central thrust of the claim - that is, there is no oversight. However, affected individuals can temporarily disarm without being able to defend their position by appearing before the court - if the judge finds the concerns raised to be sufficiently serious. After the expiry of the interim period, the judge may review the case. At this stage, the individual usually participates in a hearing. Winkler said that the laws were controversial, partly because of due process concerns. He said: \"You take fundamental rights without participation.\" \"American courts are reluctant to take weapons unless an individual is convicted of a crime.\" Therefore, the content of the claim is exaggerated -- to a large extent -- by the way the laws operate. Our weapons rights group claimed \"Governor Evers, AG Josh Cole, and Speaker Robin Voss are demanding \"the confiscations of the Red Flag gun\" of Wisconsin, which allows for the seizure of guns with \"no evidence, arrest, indictment, conviction or due process at all!\" Although there was some truth in the allegation that Cole and Ivers had clearly expressed their support, the Group was wrong about the Vos position. The prosecution goes beyond the facts when it states that there is no control over any action taken under these laws. Our definition of \"often a liar\" is the phrase \"which contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.\" That fits me right here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01080"}
