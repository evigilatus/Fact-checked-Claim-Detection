Trump told the crowd that Bishop was behind in the race until he visited North Carolina and tweeted about the race.\n\"But the candidate, Dan Bishop, won \u2014 by a lot. He was down by 17, and they had lines a mile long. I mean the lines going into those voting booths were unbelievable,\" Trump said, according to\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s transcript of the speech.\nThis is at least the second time Trump has claimed that Bishop was down 17 points. The first came on the night of the election.\n\"Dan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race. Big Rally last night. Now it looks like he is going to win,\" he\u00a0tweeted.\nPolitiFact looked at publicly available polling, as well as the race results, to see whether Trump was correct about its competitiveness.\nWe couldn\u2019t find any public poll that showed Bishop behind by 17 points, or even double-digits. And we found his description of the election results to be exaggerated.\nWHAT POLLS REPORTED\nThe website FiveThirtyEight tracked some of the\u00a0polling of the district. No public poll had McCready up by 17. The most favorable poll for him had him up five points, and the poll most favorable to Bishop had him up four points.\nA\u00a0Co/Efficient poll\u00a0published three days before the election had McCready up three points. Public Policy Polling, known as\u00a0PPP, conducted a private poll of District 9 residents about two weeks prior to the election. That poll showed Bishop up, said Tom Jensen, the company\u2019s director.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVox, an online news source, conducted a\u00a0similar fact-check\u00a0and couldn\u2019t find a poll to support Trump\u2019s claims, either.\nThe piece of polling that comes close to supporting Trump\u2019s claim was\u00a0tweeted\u00a0by Jim Blaine, a campaign consultant for Bishop. An internal campaign poll showed McCready up 14 percentage points on Bishop.\nBut that poll is an outlier. And details \u2014 such as who conducted the survey, who responded to the survey, the date \u2014 aren\u2019t available to the public.\nPolitiFact contacted Blaine and Samantha Cotten, a regional communications director for Trump\u2019s campaign, but didn\u2019t receive a response by the time this fact check was published online.\nTHE RESULTS\nMost experts considered the race a\u00a0toss-up, a surprise given the district\u2019s history.\n\"While we\u2019ve thought the Republicans were better positioned to win the NC-9 do-over special election \u2014 and that may end up being the case \u2014 the latest data, and the latest circumstances, suggest that the race is close enough that we should make it a Toss-up with less than a week to go until Tuesday\u2019s election,\" Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball,\u00a0wrote on Sept. 5.\nTrump won the district by 12 points in 2016. No Democrat had won the congressional race since 1963, according to the\u00a0Charlotte Observer.\nIt didn\u2019t happen this year either.\nBishop beat McCready by 3,788 votes \u2014 96,573 to 92,785. That breaks down to 50.69% of the vote for Bishop and 48.70% of the vote for McCready, a difference of 1.99 percentage points.\nNot exactly a blowout.\nOUR RULING\nTrump said Bishop was \"down by 17\" points in NC congressional race and then won \"by a lot.\" No public polls came close to supporting Trump\u2019s claim, and the final margin was only 2 percentage points. We rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00076"}
