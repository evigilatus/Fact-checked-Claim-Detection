Denny Hoskins, R-Warrensburg, is sponsoring Senate Bill 44 that would allow people to place bets on the Chiefs, Royals, Cardinals and other sports teams.\nAccording to Hoskins, \"Revenues for the state would include a total of $12.5 to $30.9 million dollars.\" Hoskins has told the estimated revenue amount to several news outlets across Missouri.\nIn that total, he included revenue from sports betting on mobile devices, something not all states with legalized sports betting allow.\nWe wanted to know what supported Hoskins\u2019 statement that his bill would bring up to $31 million in state revenue.\nHow large of an industry is it?\nBecause sports betting has not been legalized in the state, it\u2019s not clear how many people would participate.\n\"It\u2019s a gamble on how many people bet, how much they bet and how often they bet,\" Hoskins said.\n\"The reality is people are going to gamble whether it's legal or not,\" sports betting expert and author of The Predictive Casinos and The Predictive Sports Book, Andrew Pearson said. \"However, centralizing the gambling makes for a better product.\"\nWhen we asked Hoskins about his figures, he directed us to the fiscal note for the bill. Hoskins is a member of the Committee on Legislative Research Oversight Division that drafted the fiscal note.\nTo estimate how much money sports betting would bring in, the committee used data from Mississippi to see how it would translate to Missouri. According to Betting USA, Mississippi houses the third largest betting region in the country, behind Las Vegas and Atlantic City, despite not allowing online sports betting.\nThe fiscal note provided by Hoskins said that Missouri Gaming Commission officials annualized Mississippi's total revenue from sports betting and found the sports betting revenue was 2 percent of its total gaming revenue.\nThe committee assumed that Missouri\u2019s sports betting would also be 2 percent of its gaming revenue. If Missouri includes mobile sports betting, the revenue would more than double. Looking at Mississippi\u2019s projections, the committee anticipates the state would \"bring home\" $13 million, but it did not address the $30.9 million Hoskins estimated.\nOfficials from the Missouri Gaming Commission also estimated this bill would \"increase total state revenue by approximately $13 million annually,\" but did not include the higher number Hoskins estimated.\nBased on the committee\u2019s estimates and the proposed bill, the state would make $6.7 million on fees and $6.3 million in taxes on wagers with a tax rate of 12 percent, plus fees of 2.5 percent \u2014 bringing the total revenue to $13 million for Missouri.\nHowever, the committee estimates that number will drop to $12.7 million every year after because casinos only pay \"initial license fees\" the first time they decide to operate as a sports betting facility.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials from the Department of Revenue also gave an estimate of how much revenue sports betting would bring in to Missouri, assuming online sports betting is legalized, using a study, Economic Impact of Legalized Sports Betting, from Oxford Economics. The American Gaming Association hired Oxford Economics to study the potential economic impacts of legalized sports betting in the US. The DOR used this study to measure the impact for all 50 states. The study takes into account illegal sports betting that is already happening in Missouri, along with how many places in Missouri are available to house sports betting if it\u2019s legalized.\nThis study estimates Missouri would make an estimated $29,319,000 to $36,728,500. These numbers support Hoskins higher-end estimate.\nOther states that allow sports betting\nTheLines has a list of the seven states that currently allow sports betting (but not all allow online sports betting):\n\n\nNevada\n\n\nDelaware\n\n\nNew Jersey\n\n\nMississippi\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\nRhode Island\n\n\nWe took a closer look at Pennsylvania\u2019s experience with sports betting so far to see what state revenue is like there. Pennsylvania is a larger state with a higher tax rate on sports betting.\nAccording to PlayPennsylvania, Pennsylvania residents have spent $71.8 million in about four months. The state\u2019s tax rate is 36 percent, triple the rate proposed in Missouri\nDoug Harbach, Pennsylvania\u2019s Gaming Control Board\u2019s communications director, said that after paying out winning amounts, Pennsylvania has earned $1.9 million in about four months with six places across the state for people to gamble. The fiscal note estimates there will be at least five locations that would allow sports betting.\nHarbach said Pennsylvania\u2019s figures are expected to jump because they \"are working on a launch of online sports wagering. So, these early revenue figures are expected to escalate significantly this year.\"\nHe also said he cannot make a judgment on if Hoskins\u2019 projected figures are reasonable, but suggested looking at Pennsylvania\u2019s figures for an idea.\nIf Pennsylvania\u2019s figures do not jump as Harbach explained, the state would make $5.7 million from sports betting in one year.\nThis experience casts doubt on the estimates from Missouri. Pennsylvania\u2019s population is two times Missouri\u2019s and the tax rate is three times the proposed rate for Missouri, but the total estimates for the first year of sports betting are less than half of Hoskins\u2019.\nOur ruling\nHoskins said, \"Revenues for the state would include a total of $12.5 (million) to $30.9 million dollars,\" if sports betting were allowed in Missouri.\nWhile it is unclear exactly how many people would participate or how much revenue sports betting could bring in, estimates from other states don\u2019t support the higher end of Hoskins\u2019 range. However, calculations including online sports betting do support the higher estimate.\nWe rate this statement as Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00888"}
