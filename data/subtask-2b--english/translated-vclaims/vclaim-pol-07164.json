Jean Shahin highlighted this point when she targeted the Republican Contestant Scott Brown, who supported women &apos; s reproductive rights during his term as Senator of Massachusetts. Its aim was to undermine Brown &apos; s assertion that he was a pro-choice politician. He said an announcement with a female nanny made on October 7, \"In Massachusetts, Scott Brown paid for a law to force women to think about abortion -- forced them to-- The announcement, entitled \"The Power,\" attracted a quick response from Brown. He held a press conference on the same day as the announcement, considering it a lie and a host that he was \"not only insensitive, but also extremely offensive.\" \"I've always been pro-choice, independent Republican and I have a strong record of supporting women's health care,\" said Brown in Derry, N.H., with his wife Gail next to him. Brown asked Shahin to withdraw the announcement, and the next day he launched his own announcement calling the Shaheen commercial \"The Scream Campaign.\" More than ever in this excitingly competing Senate race, this seemed like a job for PolityFact. In order to support, the Declaration and Shahin Campaign referred to the Massachusetts Senate Bill 979, \"Law on Women's Right to Know,\" submitted in 2005. While the bill submitted jointly by Brown and the Republican Michael R. Kenbeck eventually failed, it would have given any woman seeking information about abortion and cost 24 hours to consider the consequences of that decision. (Exceptions are made only in case of medical emergency.) \"The purpose of the Women's Right to Know Act is to ensure that every woman considering abortion has full information about the procedure, the risks, the situation of her unborn child, her alternatives and sufficient time for reflection, thus reducing the possibility of serious or permanent consequences or threatening life because of the medical, emotional and psychological nature.\" Similar laws were proposed and enacted in other states following a Supreme Court decision in 1992 allowing the state of Pennsylvania under its \"Abortion Control Act\" to require women seeking abortion to give their informed consent prior to the procedure, to receive a range of information on abortion and adoption, and to wait 24 hours before abortion. The introduction to the Massachusetts Bill points out that the Supreme Court decision, according to which the state \"has a great interest in ensuring that women seeking abortion have a fully informed choice and a sufficient time to reflect on the information provided, \"to reduce the risk of women choosing abortion, only to discover later, with devastating psychological consequences, that its decision was not fully known. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job.\" As with similar laws proposed and adopted elsewhere, the proposed Massachusetts Act would have required doctors or their representatives to provide women with a lot of information at least 24 hours before the scheduled date of abortion, including names of adoption agencies and contact information for public and private agencies that provide financial and medical support to women throughout pregnancy and after childbirth. Women are also required to receive descriptions of \"the anatomy and physiological characteristics of the unborn child by increases in pregnancy for two weeks from fertilization to full age, including colour photographs.\" If images are not available, \"realistic drawings\" are acceptable. The draft law made it clear that fetus images must be given to women seeking abortion, but did not stop there. It also called for a description of the various methods of abortion and \"physical, psychological and emotional hazards or medical complications normally associated with each method; a description of the physical, psychological and emotional risks or medical complications of pregnancy and childbirth; and a description of the support obligations of the father of the child born alive.\" Before performing an abortion, the doctor or representative must ask the woman whether she has \"watched\" the information and \"gives women the opportunity to contact alternative abortion agencies at this time if they so wish.\" In addition, the woman's signature was required prior to the abortion to give her consent and \"indicates that she has been offered the information described in this section.\" Brown says that the bill was aimed at giving adoption a chance and \"didn't force women to do anything. I will never force women to do anything.\" He has a point. There's no place in the bill where the word \"power\" is used. However, the language of the draft law certainly ensures that women have access to information, ask them if they have \"watched it,\" and at least 24 hours to review them prior to abortion. \"In Massachusetts, Scott Brown pushed for a law to force women to think about abortion -- forcing them -- to look at pictures of sophisticated embryos.\" The measure supported by Brown nine years ago confirmed that women were provided with pictures of mature fetuses, as well as more information. She certainly forced doctors and their representatives to provide such information to women seeking abortion - except in emergency situations - and ensured that women had access to information through both oral questions and signed consent forms. Brown has a point that the bill wouldn't have forced them to look at colored images -- but she did everything else she could do until she got to that line. This statement is precise, but it needs to be clarified, so we often evaluate it correctly.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07164"}
