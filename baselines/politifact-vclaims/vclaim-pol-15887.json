So it was a treat when several readers sent\u00a0us a new e-mail that includes the national anthem\u00a0quote along with some\u00a0other equally ridiculous\u00a0ones. (You can read the\n\nfull e-mail here\n\n.) \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe\u00a0e-mail has\u00a0been\u00a0widely circulated and posted on dozens of blogs because it has a few\u00a0elements that make it look\u00a0authentic. It says that Obama made the remarks \"on Sunday's Televised 'Meet the Press,' \"\u00a0and the account\u00a0appears to be written by Dale Lindsborg of the\n\nWashington Post\n\n. And unless you are a keen student of cola advertising, you might miss the satirical suggestion about the song.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSo let's put the Coke song on the turntable as\u00a0we examine the new e-mail.\n\n\nIt begins, like so many chain e-mails attacking Obama, with a subject line\u00a0that invokes\u00a0patriotism: \"Meet the Press - read this if you're an American.\"\n\n\nIt says the account is \"a narrative taken from Sunday Morning's televised 'Meet the Press', and the author is employed by none other than the Washington Post.\"\n\n\nIt says that on the Sept. 7 show, Obama was asked by \"General Bill Ginn' USAF (ret.)\" why he doesn't follow protocol when the national anthem is played. (That question\u00a0is based on\n\na photograph of Obama\n\nstanding with his hands folded at his waist while Sen. Hillary Clinton and others have their hands over their hearts. It has been misinterpreted in many chain e-mails as an indication that Obama refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance, which we addressed\n\nwith this article\n\n.)\n\n\nDuring the\n\nMeet the Press\n\nappearance, Obama is said to have replied, \"As I've said about the flag pin, I don't want to be perceived as taking sides. . . .There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression. And the anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all. It should be swapped for something less parochial and less bellicose. I like the song 'I'd Like To Teach the World To Sing.' If that were our anthem, then I might salute it.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObama, it says, continued: \"We should consider to reinvent our National Anthem as well as to redesign our Flag to better offer our enemies hope and love. It's my intention, if elected, to disarm America to the level of acceptance to our Middle East Brethren. If we as a Nation of warring people, should conduct ourselves as the nations of Islam, whereas peace prevails. Perhaps a state or period of mutual concord between our governments. When I become President, I will seek a pact or agreement to end hostilities between those who have been at war or in a state of enmity, and a freedom from disquieting oppressive thoughts. We as a Nation have placed upon the nations of Islam an unfair injustice.\"\n\n\nIt then abruptly shifts gears to his comments about his wife Michelle: \"My wife disrespects the Flag for many personal reasons. Together she and I have attended several flag burning ceremonies in the past, many years ago. She has her views and I have mine. Of course now, I have found myself about to become the President of the United States and I have put aside my hatred. I will use my power to bring CHANGE to this Nation, and offer the people a new path of hope. My wife and I look forward to becoming our Country's First Family. Indeed, CHANGE is about to overwhelm the United States of America.\"\n\n\nIt is signed \"Dale Lindsborg, Washington Post.\"\n\n\nIt would be difficult to tally the many, many ways this e-mail is false, but we'll start with the obvious ones. First, Obama was not on\n\nMeet the Press\n\non Sept. 7. The guests were Joe Biden and\n\nNew York Times\n\ncolumnist\u00a0Thomas Friedman. Nor was Gen. Bill Ginn on the show.\n\n\nGinn is indeed a retired Air Force general and not a fan of Obama. In an interview with PolitiFact, Ginn cited Obama's association with Weather Underground co-founder William Ayers, the group ACORN and\u00a0his former pastor, the\u00a0Rev. Jeremiah Wright, as just a few examples why he does not want Obama to\u00a0be president.\n\n\n\n\nBut Ginn said\u00a0the\n\nMeet the Press\n\naccount was fabricated and that he had never spoken to Obama. Ginn said his name might have gotten attached to the e-mail because of a message he sent to a friend expressing concern about\u00a0Obama not putting his hand over his heart during the national anthem.\n\n\n\n\nNeither is Dale Lindsborg a reporter at the\n\nWashington Post\n\n. Anne Kornblut, a\u00a0real political reporter from the\n\nPost\n\n, said in an online chat that she checked the paper's directory and couldn't find anyone by that name.\n\n\nAnd, Obama's quote is fabricated. It seems to be a mashup from at least two sources. The anthem part comes from\u00a0\n\na satirical column\n\npublished on the Web in October 2007 by\u00a0Arizona writer John Semmens that produced the original bogus e-mail that we checked last spring.\n\n\nWe couldn't determine the origin of the part about redesigning the American flag \"to better\u00a0offer our enemies hope and love,\" but a search of the Project Vote Smart database of Obama's speeches indicates he has not uttered the phrase. He also has not made the remark about his wife disrespecting the flag, according to the Vote Smart database.\n\n\nThis chain e-mail, like most that we've checked, is\u00a0false. In fact, it's so ridiculously, maliciously false, that it sets the Truth-O-Meter ablaze. Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15887"}
