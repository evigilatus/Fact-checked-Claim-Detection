The latter two are accurate: Biden said Black Lives Matter protesters would have been treated differently than U.S. Capitol rioters were, and his assessment is supported by several examinations that compared police responses to summer protests for racial justice with the riot. And Biden supports the impeachment trial, which he has said he thinks the Senate can juggle with its usual business.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

In the 2020 election cycle, Restoration PAC spent $18.7 million on communications to oppose Democrats, and $1 million on communications supporting Republicans.\u00a0\n\"Sparked an immigration crisis\"\u00a0\nThe claim that Biden \"sparked an immigration crisis\" draws a connection between his actions and a migrant caravan from Honduras that the Facebook post says \"is moving toward the U.S. border.\"\u00a0\nThe migrants were attempting to flee Honduras, beset for years by poverty and gang violence and now ravaged by COVID-19. The already desperate conditions in the country were worsened by two major hurricanes in November that left many people without jobs or homes.\nBy the time the Facebook post was published, though, the caravan had already dissipated in Guatemala, stopped by roadblocks where Guatemalan forces used tear gas and batons to turn back the group of thousands.\nIt is not uncommon for migration to occur around the time of U.S. elections and transitions of power, NBC News reported, citing spikes in late 2016, early 2017 and 2018 around the time of the midterm elections.\u00a0\nOpponents of Biden\u2019s immigration plans have sought to link his proposals to the caravan\u2019s movement.\nU.S. Rep Ken Buck, R-Colo., tweeted a video on Jan. 20 of the Honduran migrants clashing with Guatemalan soldiers, writing, \"This is what happens when you announce plans to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. Joe Biden\u2019s open borders plan has consequences.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a Biden proposal to provide a route to citizenship for immigrants illegally in the country would apply only to people who were already in the U.S. as of Jan. 1, 2021, to deter migrants from moving toward the U.S. border.\u00a0\n\"Questioned the loyalty of US troops in Washington, D.C.\"\nThe Facebook post\u2019s claim that Biden \"questioned the loyalty of U.S. troops in Washington, D.C.\" does not include examples or specifics.\u00a0\nIt likely is related to the decision to vet all National Guard troops assigned to the city for the inauguration, after concerns about extremism and insider threats. PolitiFact did not find any published comments from Biden or his representatives about the vetting process or the loyalty of the National Guard.\nThe screening resulted in 12 National Guard members being removed from inaugural duties. Two of them had made extremist statements about the event, the Associated Press reported.\n\"This type of vetting often takes place by law enforcement for significant security events,\" said Christopher Miller, the Acting Secretary of Defense under Trump, in a Jan. 18 statement. \"However, in this case the scope of military participation is unique.\"\u00a0\nRegarding the scope, 25,000 members of the National Guard were deployed for Biden\u2019s inauguration, compared with more than 7,000 for Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration.\u00a0\nThe National Guard presence at inaugural events was beefed up following a Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, and the background checks were added after the discovery that ex-military members had participated in the riot.\nNine of the people arrested for participating in the riot were former U.S. military members, ABC News reported. One of the five people who died as a result of the riot was a U.S. Air Force veteran shot by police as she climbed through a window near the House chamber.\nWe contacted Restoration PAC for comment but did not receive a reply.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post attacking Biden\u2019s pre-presidential \"failures\" blamed him for a migrant caravan from Honduras and said he questioned the loyalty of U.S. troops in Washington.\u00a0\nBiden\u2019s proposal to provide a route to citizenship for immigrants is only applicable to people who were already in the U.S. as of Jan. 1, 2021. The caravan that had been headed for the U.S. border disbanded.\nPolitiFact did not find any evidence that Biden questioned the loyalty of U.S. troops in Washington. The decision to vet the National Guard members deployed for the inauguration followed the discovery that ex-military members had participated in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\nWe rate these claims Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19218"}
