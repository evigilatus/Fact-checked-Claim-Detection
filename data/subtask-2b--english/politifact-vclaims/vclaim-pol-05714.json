To streamline our analysis, we focused mostly on these four claims -- that in Japan, \"permanent residency is not given to Muslims,\" the \"propagation of Islam\" is banned, \"one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language,\" and \"Muslims cannot even rent a house.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe heard back from three experts who have experience with the intersection of Japan and Islam, and all three said the graphic is blatantly incorrect.\n\"The chain email is nothing but malicious falsehood,\" said Kumiko Yagi, a professor at the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies Graduate School who has written extensively about Islam and other religions.\nKamada Shigeru, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Tokyo, agreed, saying that all four of the claims we spotlighted are wrong.\nHe said Japan doesn\u2019t discriminate in permanent residency on the basis of religion and that \"propagation\" of Islam is not banned. He added that the Koran or other religious books in Arabic can be imported.\nAs for renting a residence, he said there may be some reluctance among residents of Japan to rent apartments to foreigners as a general rule, but he said there\u2019s no specific animus toward Muslims.\nThese four claims \"are totally unfounded,\" said Glenda S. Roberts, a professor of cultural anthropology and Japanese studies at the graduate school of Asia-Pacific Studies at Waseda University in Tokyo. \"It is disturbing that such an email is circulating,\" she added. \"These claims are simply ridiculous.\"\nOther claims in the graphic are easily debunked.\nFor instance, the graphic claims that \"Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countries.\" Yet a quick visit to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 website shows that Japan has embassies in such countries as Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, plus a permanent representative to the Palestinian Authority.\nMeanwhile, there is nothing in Japanese nationality law that prevents Muslims from becoming naturalized citizens. The requirements concern length of residency, age, a history of \"upright conduct,\" the ability to support oneself and a willingness to give up other nationalities. There is no mention of religion.\nAs for universities not teaching Arabic, we found that the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies does. Classes in Arabic are also taught at the Arabic Islamic Institute in Tokyo.\nLast year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made clear Japan\u2019s respect for people of the Islamic faith during an event with the Islamic diplomatic corps.\n\"I have found that a fundamental aspect of the spirit of Islam is harmony with and love for others,\" Abe said. \"I believe therein lie points of commonality with the Japanese spirit, which is founded on co-existence.\"\nOur ruling\nThe graphic says that in Japan, \"permanent residency is not given to Muslims,\" the \"propagation of Islam\" is banned, \"one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language,\" and \"Muslims cannot even rent a house.\"\nEach of these four statements is incorrect, and the overall point of the graphic -- that Japan keeps itself free from radical Islam by discriminating against all Muslims -- is dramatically off-base.
