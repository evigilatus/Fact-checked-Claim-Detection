John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) regarding what the acting secretary knew about the coronavirus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19. This C-SPAN video shows the full discussion between the two.\u00a0\nKennedy first asked what the worldwide mortality rate for coronavirus is, to which Wolf responded, that it was \"under 2%\" but that he would need to check with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to get the actual figure and that \"it changes daily.\" The Louisiana senator then asked, \"What\u2019s the mortality rate for influenza over, say, the last 10 years in America?\"\nWolf answered: \"It\u2019s also right around that percentage as well. I don\u2019t have that offhand, but it\u2019s right around 2% as well.\"\u00a0\nWe asked the Department of Homeland Security where Wolf\u2019s figure came from.\u00a0\nA DHS spokesperson said in an email, \"As the acting secretary said in his hearing, he did not have that information on hand and refers to Health and Human Services -- the federal agency in charge of the federal government\u2019s coronavirus response.\"\u00a0\nThe comparison of coronavirus to flu in terms of mortality rates seemed like an important mechanism to understanding the growing concern about the reach of coronavirus, so we decided to dig deeper to find out if these statistics hold up. We also asked experts to explain what the numbers mean in terms of risk.\u00a0\nDigging into mortality rate numbers\u00a0\nThe CDC directed us to its online influenza resources and referred us to the World Health Organization for more information on coronavirus.\nChristopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University, helped make sense of some of the figures. He calculated the average, 10-year mortality rate for flu using CDC data and found it was 0.1%. That 0.1% rate is frequently cited among experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\u00a0\nDr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, called it \"sort of the canonical seasonal influenza mortality figure.\"\u00a0\nIt\u2019s important to note, that although this percentage seems like a small number, influenza is responsible for an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 deaths annually.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow, for coronavirus.\u00a0\nAccording to statistics released Feb. 17 by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality rate for coronavirus was 2.3%. That\u2019s based on cases reported through Feb. 11 and calculated by dividing the numbers of coronavirus-related deaths at the time (1,023) by the number of the confirmed cases (44,672) of the coronavirus. (These numbers reflect the information available at the time of the secretary\u2019s testimony.)\nBut this report has limitations, Mores said, including the vague way Chinese officials are defining who has been infected by the coronavirus.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have not been able to understand what precisely has gone on there,\" said Mores. \"They have changed their case definitions multiple times. It\u2019s murky what has gone into the case count and who has gone into being counted on cases.\"\u00a0\nThe WHO said in a press conference Monday that in Wuhan, China, the city where the virus first hit, the mortality rate ranged from 2% to 4%. Officials said that in the rest of China, outside of Wuhan, the mortality rate of coronavirus is 0.7%.\u00a0\nMike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the mortality rate in China has since risen to 0.9%.\u00a0\nRight now he doesn\u2019t see a similarity in the flu mortality rate and the coronavirus mortality rate. \"We don\u2019t have any evidence to that being the case,\" said Osterholm.\u00a0\nMores said U.S. health officials just don\u2019t have enough information to know whether the two mortality rates are similar. Understanding this comparison would offer a means to better understand the severity of the coronavirus. It could also help in educating the public about the novel illness.\n\"Until we can gain our own experience with this virus, it\u2019s going to be pretty squishy. So, all the numbers that you have come across here are within the range of possibility,\" he said. \"Absolutely, the hope is we will end up with something similar to the flu, but we just don\u2019t know yet.\"\u00a0\nMultiple experts told us that the number of coronavirus cases not just in China but worldwide has probably been undercounted because many people with the infection do not suffer serious symptoms and may not seek medical treatment. It is possible that only those who have tested positive are being counted as \"confirmed cases.\"\u00a0\nUntil the case definition is expanded, they said, to include people clinicians think may have COVID-19 but who were not tested for it, then the total estimated number of cases will remain lower than the likely reality. But, if the number of cases widens to include those with mild symptoms who have not been tested, then the mortality rate will go down.\u00a0\nThis is the way mortality rates are calculated for the flu, said Mores. The numbers of flu illnesses and deaths are estimates based not only on positive flu tests, but also on doctors\u2019 suspicions and symptomatic diagnosis.\u00a0\nOne key difference between the flu and the coronavirus illness, Osterholm cautioned, is that, with the flu, the population has a partially built up immunity, whether through receiving flu shots or already having been exposed to the illness.\u00a0\nMores concurred. \"You know, the risk is this: We have a brand-new virus in a completely naive population on Earth, we\u2019re all susceptible to it. Everyone is potentially infectable with this virus,\" he said. \"Even with a high transmission rate and the low case fatality rate, that still becomes a massive number of ill and fatal cases.\"\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nThere are two ways to parse out this claim: First, is it true that the average U.S. mortality rate for flu is 2%?\u00a0\nThat\u2019s not true, according to data from the CDC and exchanges with multiple global health experts. On average, the flu mortality rate during the past 10 years has been 0.1%. In addition, Wolf and a DHS spokesperson admitted that the acting secretary did not have the statistics in front of him when he answered questions at the hearing about the mortality rates.\u00a0\nSecond, is it true the COVID-19 mortality rate is similar to the flu mortality rate?\u00a0\nWolf is also wrong on that account, based on the limited information currently known about the coronavirus. Recent data from the Chinese government set the COVID-19 mortality rate at 2.3%. That\u2019s vastly different from the flu\u2019s mortality rate of 0.1%.\u00a0\nExperts also said that while it\u2019s possible the mortality rate from the new virus could come close to the flu\u2019s mortality rate eventually \u2015 if the case definition of coronavirus is expanded -- it\u2019s too soon to make that assumption with the limited information available.\u00a0\nFor these reasons, we rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18026"}
