Multiple comments on the page congratulate the poster on the photo manipulation, and one commenter asks for a link to the original photograph, to which the poster replies that they can\u2019t find it anymore. The manipulated image also appears on meme websites, including a page of altered mashup images.\nHowever, the notion that marijuana was used for medicinal purposes in the 1800s isn\u2019t wrong. According to PBS, the U.S.-marijuana relationship dates back to the Colonial Era, and it wasn\u2019t until the 1930s that the government started to criminalize the drug:\n\"American production of hemp was encouraged by the government in the 17th century for the production of rope, sails, and clothing. (Marijuana is the mixture of dried, shredded flowers and leaves that comes from the hemp plant.) Domestic production flourished until after the Civil War, when imports and other domestic materials replaced hemp for many purposes. In the late 19th century, marijuana became a popular ingredient in many medicinal products and was sold openly in public pharmacies.\"\nNevertheless, this photo does not appear to be authentic.
