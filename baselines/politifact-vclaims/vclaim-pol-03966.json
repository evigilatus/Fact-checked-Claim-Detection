Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt is accusing his Democratic opponent Jason Kander of trying to manipulate elections while Kander served as Missouri\u2019s secretary of state.\n\"On three occasions, judges had to stop Jason Kander from manipulating elections,\" Blunt's ad said.\u00a0\n\nManipulating elections sounds bad. But as we found, the reality is not nearly as simple\u00a0 as Blunt makes it seem.\n\n\nBallot language\n\n\nThe ad cites three cases from the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals as evidence of the manipulation.\n\n\nThe appellate court decided the most recent of the three in July. It deals with raising Missouri\u2019s current\u00a017-cent cigarette tax, which appears on this November\u2019s ballot as Amendment 3.\n\n\nIn January, Jim Boeving filed suit against Kander and challenged the wording of the measure on the ballot. As the secretary of state, Kander is tasked with crafting the summary statements of ballot measures.\n\n\nThis is the summary statement Kander filed:\n\n\n\"Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to:\n\n\n\nIncrease taxes on cigarettes each year through 2020, at which point this additional tax will total 60 cents per pack of 20;\nCreate a fee paid by cigarette wholesalers of 67 cents per pack of 20 on certain cigarettes\nDeposit funds generated by these taxes and fees into a newly established Early Childhood Health and Education Trust Fund?\"\n\n\n\nThe appellate court determined that the second bullet point of Kander\u2019s statement was misleading. In his language, Kander doesn\u2019t mention that although the fee would begin at 67 cents, it would increase annually by 3 percent or more, depending on the rate of inflation.\n\n\n\"Nothing in the summary statement would . . . alert a voter to this mandatory, perpetual increase,\" the court said in its ruling.\n\n\nThe ad cites another case about ballot language, which was decided in November 2015.\n\n\nThe appeals court reviewed an initiative petition that sought to require in-home service providers receiving reimbursement from the state through MO HealthNet, Missouri\u2019s Medicaid provider, to pay a percentage of their revenue to the workers who provide the services. That compensation would be through wages and benefits.\n\n\nThe court determined Kander\u2019s ballot language to be insufficient because Kander did not reference MO HealthNet by name. The court also said Kander erred because he categorized \"personal care attendants\" as \"employees\" in his language.\n\n\nUnqualified candidate\n\n\nThe third case relates to the qualifications of a state House candidate.\n\n\nIn March 2014, Natalie Vowell filed a declaration with the secretary of state\u2019s office to run as a state House candidate in the 78th District in the August primary election. Kander\u2019s office initially approved the request. But in May, Kander\u2019s office sent a letter to Vowell questioning her ability to run.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Facebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the letter, Kander said voter registration records indicated Vowell had not been a qualified Missouri voter in the two years leading to the election, as required by law. The letter said Vowell would not be on the ballot unless she provided documents proving she was a registered Missouri voter during those two years.\n\n\nVowell filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief and said Kander\u2019s office did not have the authority to evaluate a candidate\u2019s qualifications for office.\n\n\nThe trial court determined that Vowell was indeed ineligible to run for office and dismissed her petition.\n\n\nBut the appellate court said Vowell\u2019s eligibility was irrelevant. Instead, the case was a matter of whether the secretary of state had the authority to investigate the qualifications of candidates. \u00a0\n\n\nThe court said in its ruling that Missouri statutes do not grant the secretary of state the power to investigate.\u00a0\n\n\nKander\u2019s role was ministerial, the court said. He was only responsible for making sure the potential candidate\u2019s \"paperwork is in proper order and was timely filed.\"\n\n\nWas it manipulation?\n\n\nBlunt claims judges had to stop Kander from \"manipulating\" elections.\n\n\n\"Manipulating\" is a strong word, especially when it is used to characterize the nuances and brevity of language the Missouri secretary of state must use to summarize lengthy legislation and constitutional amendments for voters.\n\n\nWe consulted experts who noted that crafting ballot language is part of Kander\u2019s job as the secretary of state.\n\n\nChristopher Elmendorf, a law professor at the University of California Davis, said Kander \"was exercising a governmental function that he had every right to exercise, though he may have \u00a0\u2018crossed the line\u2019 between permissible and misleading ballot titles.\"\n\n\nBut Elmendorf said Kander\u2019s actions \"are very different than accepting bribes, stuffing ballot boxes, or trying to prevent people from voting by threatening them or giving them misleading information about the location of polling places.\"\n\n\nRichard Reuben, an MU law professor, said though it\u2019s possible Kander purposely tried to mislead voters, the court\u2019s rejection of his ballot language \"does not necessarily imply ... malevolent intent.\"\n\n\n\"It would not be surprising for an opposing politician in a close race call to get hyperbolic in calling such error manipulation,\" Reuben said. \"Such is the nature of politics.\"\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nBlunt claimed, \"On three occasions, judges had to stop Jason Kander from manipulating elections.\"\n\n\nThis claim is misleading. Courts did object in three cases to decisions Kander made as secretary of state. But the specifics of those cases are much more nuanced than Blunt lets on. And the claim that Kander tried to manipulate the election is, at best, unproven.\n\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7704484f-90ff-483b-8b6c-11a7b86cc5c4", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03966"}
