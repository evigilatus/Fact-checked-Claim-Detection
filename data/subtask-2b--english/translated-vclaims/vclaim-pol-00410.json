Not really.", "text": "One of the main concerns about Bernie Sanders &apos; medical care plan for all is that the impact of high taxes on their payment will flood any savings they produce. Sanders devoted one speech to Barry and other criticism of replacing the private sector with government health insurance. Saunders at George Washington University on July 17, said: \"The medical care system for all will completely eliminate insurance premiums. No more premiums, no more deductibles, no more joint payments. \"A post-school study has shown that as a nation we will save large amounts of money, and middle-class families will provide $3,000 each year on health-care bills.\" This has attracted our attention, because the last bill on medical care for all has been silent about the taxes needed to pay for it. The Sanders website offers some options, but not a specific proposal, which is important. If taxes replace premiums and other health expenses, the direct tax plan will highlight who will pay a quantity. The Sanders campaign referred to two studies in support of the Sanders point, but neither of them provided strong support in the amount of $3,000 from annual savings. \u2022 One study of tax collection estimates for 2016 based on rates replaced by the Tax Reductions and Jobs Act 2017. \u2022 Another study from 2018 applies only to the state of New York, and has never considered the price of long-term care, an item that costs more than $26.5 billion. Medical care for all will cover long-term care. \u2022 Finally, Sanders believes that a one-time programme would save trillions of dollars in public spending on health care. Reliable studies raise questions about this. American families are spending the basic trade-offs of approximately $980 billion on health care. This includes premiums and anything from the pocket to cover services, deductibles, co-payment and co-insurance. Employers pay another $700 billion. The idea behind medical care for all is to replace all of this with taxes, with most of the people coming. Washington will use tax dollars to pay service providers - from hospitals, to drug manufacturers, to dentists, to care homes, etc. The theory is that costs will be significantly reduced. The decline is due to the elimination of the profits of insurance companies, the creation of greater efficiency and the negotiation of lower prices by the Government. Since total spending on health care amounts to $3.5 trillion, there is a major debate about whether a single payment approach can put pressure on sufficient savings to keep taxes on most households below what they spend today. Study number Unlike today &apos; s 2016 citizens &apos; analysis of tax justice, Sanders provided details on how this plan would be paid for in 2016. There will be an additional 2.2 per cent tax on income; higher taxes and maximum tax cuts on households earning more than $250,000 per year; higher taxes on capital gains and more. At that time, citizens for tax justice, a group that supports lower taxes on middle- and low-income families and higher taxes on the rich, conducted an analysis. An important factor in this regard is that since employers will no longer cover a large portion of their workers &apos; premiums, they will provide about half of these premiums in the form of higher wages. Greater salaries would help to defray the costs of new taxes on workers to pay for the Government &apos; s health plan. Citizens of tax justice stated that 20 per cent of taxpayers - those earning between $39,000 and $62,000 - would see their net income increase by $3,240. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, this estimate applies to old tax rules. Tax expert Gordon Mermin said with the Centre for Urban Innovation Tax Policy that the Tax and Job Reduction Act 2017 changed the tax bills faced by families today. Impacts can go both ways. Some households can see their taxes rising more than before. \"High tax rates proposed in 2016 would raise more money now that current law rates are lower,\" said Mermin. However, income from the well to work may be lower, owing to the ways in which the Tax Act 2017 has already limited some cuts to the rich. In sum: The way people at different income levels will behave is unclear. The 2016 analysis reveals less than in the past. The University of Chicago, Katherine Baker, says: \"The followers will vary dramatically among the workers.\" \"On the Internet, some people will be better off, and some people will be worse off -- gross taxes must rise dramatically.\" The staff of the Citizens' Bureau of Tax Justice told us that they no longer carry out this type of analysis, and the group that took over this work did not analyse the medical care plan for all today. Study number The RAND Study of New York, with New York's estimate of the development of its single payment plan in 2018, has been commissioned by a private institution to assess the impact by policy consultants in Rand. This study found that with a progressive tax scheme, \"health-care payments will decline among most residents and will increase among the higher-income population.\" But this result came with many doubts. In some cases, low-income workers see higher costs. If a small percentage of the higher-income population has ways of avoiding higher taxes, the burden on low- and middle-income people will rise. The total expenditure on health care in about a decade can range from less than 15 per cent to more than 12 per cent. High costs would lead to reduced savings for middle-income families. It is important that RAND Kristin Epner's analyst noted that her estimates had deleted long-term care. In New York, government payments for home care and home care exceed $26 billion. According to the Centre &apos; s study, total health-care costs would increase by at least 2 per cent if they included long-term care. Finally, New York is not like any other state, and it is not an ideal model for the rest of the country. Further studies on both sides of his website, Sanders, refer to a report by researchers from the University of Massachusetts that the provision of medical care for all would significantly reduce spending on health care for middle-income families - i.e., a family that earns $60,000 a year with employer health insurance would provide approximately $1,600. That study included several taxes, including a national sales tax (excluding food, housing and education) and a wealth tax on assets worth over $1 million. That study predicted significant reductions in public spending on health, sufficient to ensure that tax revenues cover costs. However, analysts at the Urban Institute and Emory University warned that former Sanders funding schemes would not provide enough money to cover the price card. Our rule, Sanders, said that multiple studies show that under medical care for all, \"the middle class families will save $3,000 each year.\" Studies do not support it. One is based on outdated 2016 figures, especially when it comes to current tax rates. Another project deals only with the state of New York, excludes the high cost of long-term care and provides a range of possible results. Much depends on actual taxes for fund-raising, and we have no specific suggestion from Sanders. We're assessing Sanders' claim mostly false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00410"}
