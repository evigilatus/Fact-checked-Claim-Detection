(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe video shows what looks like a light-colored helicopter spinning out of control against a brownish, mountainous background before it crashes and bursts into flames and billowing black smoke. Sirens and people can be heard crying. The video is titled: \"Kobe Bryant killed in California crash\" and has the hashtags #ripkobe and #kobebryant.\nBefore comments were turned off on Jan. 27, users criticized the account that posted the video for misrepresenting that it showed the crash that killed Bryant and his daughter, as well as seven others. Some users suggested that the footage showed a helicopter crash in the Grand Canyon.\u00a0\nBut it wasn\u2019t the Jan. 26 crash. Bryant, his daughter and others were flying in his private helicopter when it crashed in Calabasa, Calif. Business Insider reported the helicopter was a Sikorsky S-76B. Credible news photos show the aircraft was black, not a light color like the one in the YouTube video. Images from the crash scene show a foggy, green landscape, not the arid-looking background in the video.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the helicopter went down in a remote hillside. Fog was dense enough that the Los Angeles Police Department grounded its helicopters, according to the paper. The YouTube video, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t show fog. Nor does it match anthis eyewitness account of the crash.\u00a0\nJerry Kocharian told the Los Angeles Times that he was drinking coffee outside when he heard a helicopter struggling overhead.\n\"It [didn\u2019t] sound right and it was real low. I saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out, as it was so foggy,\" he said. According to the Times, the helicopter vanished into a cloud of fog and there was a boom.\u00a0\nWe rate this video Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17642"}
