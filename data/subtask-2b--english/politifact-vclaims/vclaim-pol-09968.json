John Cornyn touts a Texas-tested method to address backlogged veterans\u2019 disability claims, a problem he recently highlighted on Twitter.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2012, the Texas Republican tweeted, \"Veterans' disability claims backlog had doubled during POTUS's first term. He needs to announce a plan to reduce it. ASAP.\"\n\nReducing the Department of Veterans Affairs backlog was one of the campaign promises Barack Obama made in 2008 as he ran for POTUS (president of the United States). PolitiFact rated it a Promise Broken in a Nov. 2, 2012, article that delved into some of the reasons the problem had grown worse.\n\nThe term \"backlog\" is used in this context as shorthand for claims that have gone unaddressed by the government for 125 days involving military veterans\u2019 disability compensation and pensions and compensation for surviving spouses or children of veterans who die because of their military service.\n\nPolitiFact said the nationwide backlog \"nearly doubled from roughly 36 percent in summer 2010 to 65 percent in June 2012,\" due in part to the influx of veterans returning from war in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nTexas\u2019 backlog doubled from July 2010 to July 2012, the Austin American-Statesman reported in a July 16, 2012, news story. And the VA claims office in Waco has both the nation\u2019s longest wait and the nation\u2019s largest backlog, according to an Aug. 14, 2012, Statesman article and Cornyn\u2019s Nov. 12, 2012, opinion column in the Waco Tribune-Herald.\n\nCornyn\u2019s legislation, according to his Nov. 28, 2012, press release, would require the VA to come up with a national plan similar to its recent partnership with the Texas Veterans\u2019 Commission, which assists veterans with their claims individually.\n\nWe asked Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie for details on the senator\u2019s tweet about Obama\u2019s first term, which began Jan. 20, 2009. His second term begins Jan. 21, 2013.\n\nBrandewie emailed us data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Looking at numbers from the department\u2019s weekly reports, Brandewie said, there were 86,687 backlogged claims on Jan. 24, 2009, and 597,636 on Nov. 17, 2012. That, we calculated, is a 589 percent increase.\n\nBut, Brandewie noted, there\u2019s a hitch in those numbers. Before October 2009, he said, the VA considered a claim backlogged if it had gone unaddressed for more than 180 days. Then the department raised the bar. Beginning that month, a claim was backlogged if it had been pending for more than 125 days.\n\nThat meant a lot of claims were immediately reclassified as backlogged. The agency\u2019s Sept. 26, 2009, report has 88,195 claims older than 180 days; the next report, issued Oct. 3, 2009, has 158,290 claims pending for more than 125 days.\n\nWe wondered if 180-day-late claims had doubled on Obama\u2019s watch, but the VA reports stopped including that statistic after the 2009 change. As an alternative, we checked the longest span of days we could get with the 125-day measure -- Oct. 3, 2009 to Nov. 17, 2012. The result: a 278 percent increase.\n\nVeterans\u2019 Affairs spokesman Randy Noller, whom we interviewed by phone, sent us data that matches the numbers Brandewie sent us.\n\nBrandewie also pointed out that the backlog had doubled in another way: as a percentage of the whole. Two years ago, less than a third of all such veterans\u2019 claims were pending. Now, more than two-thirds of all claims are pending.\n\nWhy did the backlog increase so much? Noller told us, \"We\u2019ve got more claims being filed now than ever before.\"\n\nPolitiFact said the VA added staff, but it wasn\u2019t enough to keep up with a sharp increase in claims volume, much less reduce the past backlog.\n\nThe undersecretary for the Veterans Benefits Administration, Allison Hickey, said the volume of claims rose 48 percent from 2008 through 2011 -- from 888,000 to 1.3 million -- in testimony to a U.S. House subcommittee July 18, 2012.\n\nThat\u2019s despite a decline in the number of veterans, which dropped about 6 percent in the same period -- \u00a0from 23.4 million in 2008 to 22.2 million in 2011 by the department\u2019s VetPop estimates and from 23.2 million in 2008 to 21.5 million in 2011 according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nNoller told us \"ten years\u2019 worth of war\" in Iraq and Afghanistan is a large factor.\n\nBecause of advances in technology and tactics, \"more of our people are coming back alive,\" he said, and they report more medical conditions per person than their Vietnam and World War II predecessors.\n\nThose older veterans face additional problems of their own as they age, according to a Sept. 27, 2012, New York Times news story. \"The department is administering pensions for World War II veterans while handling new claims from Vietnam veterans struggling with the multiplying ailments of age,\" the story said.\n\nIn her testimony, Hickey said another major contributor to the backlog pile-up has been claims involving Agent Orange, a herbicide the U.S. sprayed to reduce vegetation providing enemy cover in Vietnam.\n\nThe Aug. 4, 2012, Statesman news story said rules adopted in 2010 made it easier for Vietnam veterans to file claims based on post-traumatic stress disorder and exposure to Agent Orange.\n\nThe Times story said that even though Veterans Affairs \"added nearly 4,000 new workers since 2008, the agency did not keep pace.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nCornyn said the backlog of veterans\u2019 claims doubled in Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nCounting from Jan. 24, 2009, forward yields an increase of 589 percent. This is an overstatement, though, since the government lowered its threshold for declaring a claim as backlogged after Obama became president. Still, the backlog has tripled since the lower threshold was imposed in October 2009.\n\nWe often find fault in claims that assign the responsibility for broad results to a particular officeholder. That\u2019s because many factors are usually at play. In this instance, however, Obama promised to reduce the backlog of claims and PolitiFact recently rated this a promise Broken. In turn, we rate Cornyn\u2019s statement as True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09968"}
