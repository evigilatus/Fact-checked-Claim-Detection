Is the state\u2019s homeless crisis really as severe as Steinberg claimed?\u00a0\nWe set out on a fact check.\u00a0\nOur research\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve looked at Steinberg\u2019s statements on homelessness.\nIn July, during his push for a statewide \u2018right to shelter\u2019 law, we examined his claims about the share of unsheltered homeless people in California compared with New York City \u2014 and on the soaring rate of homeless deaths in two major cities in the state. We found his assertions were generally correct, but needed a few clarifications.\u00a0\nTo verify Steinberg\u2019s statement about 90,000 unsheltered people, we reviewed a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development study called the 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. Housing experts consider it the most comprehensive and current set of estimates for homeless populations nationwide.\u00a0\nReleased in December last year, the report shows California had nearly 130,000 homeless people both sheltered and unsheltered, a tally from a point-in-time count conducted in January 2018. That was the most of any state, far ahead of second-place New York with about 92,000 homeless people. Of course, more people live in California than any other state.\u00a0\nOf California\u2019s total, 89,543 were unsheltered, meaning they were not living in an emergency shelter or similar residence.\u00a0Instead, they were found on the street, in a vehicle or abandoned building.\u00a0\nThis matches Steinberg\u2019s statement.\u00a0\nAt nearly 69 percent, California\u2019s share of unsheltered homeless people was the highest in the nation, the report found. Oregon had the second-highest share at about 62 percent.\u00a0\nSteinberg\u2019s spokesperson said the mayor relied on the HUD report.\u00a0\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia has the nation's highest rate of unsheltered homeless people, according to the 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress.\n\u2018Double digit increases\u2019 in homelessness\nChris Martin, a legislative advocate on homelessness at the nonprofit Housing California, said Steinberg used the best figure available.\u00a0\nHe said a new HUD report is expected in December.\u00a0\nBased on early survey results around the state this year, Martin said he anticipates at least a 10 percent jump in California\u2019s overall homeless population when the report comes out. He did not have an estimate on how the unsheltered population might change.\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s bad,\" Martin said, of the overall totals. \"I\u2019d say most communities around the state are seeing a double-digit increase.\"\u00a0\nMartin pointed to one research group, HUB for Urban Initiatives, that estimates there\u2019s been a nearly 24 percent spike in homelessness statewide from 2017 to 2019.\u00a0\nHe noted that the federal homeless counts represent a snapshot-in-time of a community\u2019s homeless population.\u00a0\n\"We usually estimate that two to three times the point-in-time number are homeless during the course of the year,\" added Sharon Rapport, director of the California State Policy Corporation for Supportive Housing, develops housing policy and makes housing loans.\u00a0\nWhile the federal reports are issued each year, Rapport said the odd year counts are more comprehensive because not every jurisdiction did a survey in 2018. She said she expects the 2019 report to show a larger overall number of homeless people.\u00a0\n\"Despite these flaws, it is the best data we have at this point,\" Rapport added.\nOur rating\nSacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg recently claimed \"90,000 Californians are unsheltered and homeless.\"\u00a0\nHe relied on the federal government\u2019s 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. It\u00a0uses data from point-in-time counts, but it is considered the best and most current set of estimates for homeless populations nationwide.\u00a0\nIt backs up the mayor\u2019s claim, showing California had nearly 130,000 homeless individuals in 2018, of which nearly 90,000 were unsheltered.\u00a0\nWe rated Steinberg\u2019s statement True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16846"}
