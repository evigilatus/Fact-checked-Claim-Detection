Recently, members of the MS-13 gang called for the assassination of NYPD officers so that the gang could quote, \"Recover the streets.\" They got it wrong. We're the ones getting the streets back. We're getting them out of our country in the thousands, \"Tramb said May 15. \"Every week we make new records - we also have a \"hunting and release\" program. It is called that we arrest them and release them in the country from which they returned, and we take them out. Or put them in jail.\" There are an estimated 10,000 MS-13 members in the United States. Not all of them are immigrants. Some are American citizens who cannot be deported. However, we questioned Trump's claim that members of the MS-13 gang were being deported \"in thousands.\" We found thousands of gang members deported to one of Rambeh's honors. However, it is unclear how many of them were members of the MS-13 gang, because United States customs and immigration law enforcement does not track deportations because of specific gang affiliations. An expert on gangs and criminal justice said that there was a lengthy process between the arrest and deportation of a member of the gang. You may not realize that, but as a non-profit news organization, we rely on you and answer you. Your support has a direct bearing on our ability to report objectively on issues of concern to us. They donated to our spring campaign. My record as telling the facts is important! The deportation data are not unique to MS-13 ICE data that do not track gang-specific deportations, but the agency specifically targets MS-13 members for arrest and deportation on the basis of violations of their immigration, as stated by Matthew Burke, the Agency &apos; s spokesperson. Burke said that 5,396 gang members had been deported in fiscal year 2017 (which included about four months from the Obama administration, which ran from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017). From 1 October 2017 to 16 December 2017 (the latest available data), 1,082 gang members were deported. It is impossible to determine the number of members of the MS-13 gang. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" There are other data indicating the efforts of the Trump Department to deport members of the MS-13 gang, but this does not necessarily support Tramp &apos; s claim. In fiscal year 2017, the Institute &apos; s Internal Security Investigation Division arrested approximately 800 MS-13 gang members. Burke said that 405 MS-13 gang members had been arrested by the Institute &apos; s Investigations Division, citing data for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. \"The time taken to remove a certified gang member may vary depending on whether the alien has commenced deportation proceedings; whether the alien has a final expulsion order; or whether the alien has pending criminal charges in a domestic jurisdiction,\" Burke said. It is unlikely that all members of the MS-13 gang arrested in 2017 were actually deported, owing to the time it took to remove a person after his arrest, as said by Jura Liab, an anthropologist and assistant professor at the Loskin School of Public Affairs of the University of California, which is researching gangs and criminal justice. \"Most MS-13 members I know have been arrested are being held in court pending trial,\" said Lip. \"The process is long\" Our Governor Trump of the MS-13 gang said, \"We'll get them out of our country in thousands.\" It is difficult to determine the number of MS-13 members who have been deported under the Trump administration, because immigration officials do not dismantle deportation data according to gang affiliation. At least 1,200 members of the MS-13 gang were arrested from 1 October 2016, until the end of Trump &apos; s first calendar year. The time between arrest and deportation varies depending on the situation, but the expert told us that the process is lengthy. The Trump statement contains an element of right, but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong.
