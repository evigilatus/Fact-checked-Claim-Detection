Mitt Romney sought to contrast health care in his state with that in Texas, the home state of a rival, Gov. Rick Perry. One of the yardsticks he used was how many children are uninsured in each state.\n\n\"We have less than 1 percent of our kids that are uninsured\" in Massachusetts, said Romney, who signed a law designed to get uninsured residents covered. \"You have a million kids uninsured in Texas. A million kids.\"\n\nWe decided to check Romney\u2019s math.\n\nWe turned to the statehealthfacts.org website, assembled by the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent research organization specializing in health care policy. The most recent state-by-state figures available are for the period 2008-09.\n\nFor Massachusetts, there were 51,400 uninsured children (that is, birth to 18), or 3 percent. (Of those with insurance, 65 percent got it from an employer and 29 percent got it from Medicaid.)\n\nThis means that Romney\u2019s number is overly rosy -- he said less than 1 percent, when the percentage is actually three times higher.\n\nTo be fair, Massachusetts still had the lowest percentage of uninsured children in the nation. And it did a whole lot better than Texas.\n\nTexas had 1,303,000 children without insurance over the same period, or 18 percent. (Of those with insurance, 42 percent got it from an employer, 35 percent got it from Medicaid, 3 percent from an individually purchased plan, and 2 percent from other public plans.) Texas' rate is the highest in the nation.\n\nSo for Texas, Romney was accurate. He even undercounted a bit.\n\nThe Romney campaign pointed to a report published by the Massachusetts state government that found that \"virtually all Massachusetts children had health insurance coverage in 2010 (99.8 percent). The uninsured rate for Massachusetts children fell from 1.9 percent in 2009 to 0.2 percent in 2010.\"\n\nHowever, the report did not address uninsured children in Texas, and we prefer to compare states using a study with equivalent methodologies if one is available, and in this case, we\u2019re sticking with the Kaiser report\u2019s numbers.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRomney said that \"less than 1 percent\" of Massachusetts kids are uninsured, when in fact the best available number is 3 percent. But that\u2019s still the lowest in the nation. Meanwhile, he actually underestimated the number of uninsured children in Texas when he said there were a million. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
