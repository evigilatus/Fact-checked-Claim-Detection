However, some of the objections to the Republican proposal in Wisconsin have denounced its transfer to medical care. On.org, a pro-left political group, Ryan said that the 46-year-old program was cancelled in 10 years. We have ruled that the allegation is false, partly because the current beneficiaries of medical care will continue to receive traditional medical care even after 10 years. But as we have noted, Ryan's plan would radically change medical care. As of 2022, medical care no longer directly helps to pay for doctor visits, hospital care and other medically prescribed services and drugs. Instead, future participants in the medical care system will choose a special insurance plan, and the medical care system - through so-called premium support payments or vouchers - will help pay for insurance costs. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan group studying health-care policy, noted that in the days following the issuance of the Ryan budget plan, three national surveys found that Americans were divided on this change. At the same time, Tom Petri, President of the United States, R-Wisconsin, was conducting his annual voter survey. In his April 2011 newsletter, the member of Congress of the Lac Foundation asked the residents of the sixth district, north and west of Milwaukee: \"One of the recommendations made by the President's Debt Commission was to convert the medical care system from a government-run insurance programme to a system in which participants in the medical care programme would be given a voucher to purchase insurance in the private market. Will you support such a change?\" This left us with this question: Did a committee established by a democratic president recommend the same comprehensive change in the medical care system that was part of the budget of the House of Representatives? The debt committee mentioned in Petri &apos; s question - the National Committee on Financial Responsibility and Reform - was established by an executive order issued by Obama in February 2010. The 18-member team was composed of Ryan, who was appointed by the Republican leaders of the House of Representatives. The Commission was mandated to make recommendations to balance the federal budget, excluding interest payments on debt, by 2015. The recommendations were contained in a report issued in December 2010. That was the question raised by Petri when he said that the Committee had recommended a voucher programme for medical care. The word coupon appears only once in the 66-page report of the Committee, as part of recommendation 3.3.13.\" The recommendation addressed the health benefits of federal employees and the health insurance programme for federal employees and retirees. The Committee stated that insurance should be a premium or voucher support programme. Federal retirees can use their coupon to pay part of the medical care premium. However, this is for a limited group of federal and retired staff. This does not mean converting all medical care into a voucher program. If that recommendation had been made, it would undoubtedly have given rise to the same criticism as the Republican Plan. The report of the Committee noted that two members of the Committee - Ryan and Alice Rivlin, Director of the Bureau of Management and Budget, led by President Bill Clinton - had proposed the conversion of medical care into a voucher system. The Committee was of the view that such a system \"had a great promise of cost control, but also carried serious potential risks.\" The Committee suggested that, should it make its recommendation to make health insurance for federal employees and retirees a premium or voucher support programme, \"this experience would be useful in considering a premium support programme for medical care.\" Therefore, the Chairman &apos; s Committee recommended that a voucher programme be piloted with federal and retired staff and that, based on the results, it be determined whether it would be tested with medical care. After contacting Petri's office on May 6, 2011, Neil Wright's spokesman said that the statement in the question concerning the foundational medical care survey was incorrect. The question should have stated that the Chairman's Committee \"discussed,\" rather than recommending, had made medical care a voucher programme. Also after our invitation, this note was added to the electronic version of the survey question on the Petri web site: \"Correct: The above question is somewhat misleading. Rather than saying that the recommendation \"shall be made\" by the Chairman's Debt Committee, the question should read that this recommendation is \"discussed\" by the Chairman's Debt Committee. Wright told us that when Petri's office distributes the results of the survey, a note will be inserted \"indicates that a problem with this question has been brought to us,\" as well as \"additional information that explains how the question should have been formulated.\" Wright also said that the survey had been reviewed by the Congressional Postal Standards Committee, also known as the Franking Commission, and that \"not Republicans nor the Commission's democratic officials had noticed anything objectionable\" or my party. Turning to \"The Truth or Meter,\" in the voter survey, Congressman Tom Petri said that a committee set up by the Democratic President had recommended that the medical care programme be made a voucher programme. The Committee did not make this recommendation and Petri acknowledged that the wording in its survey was incorrect. We're assessing his statement wrong.
