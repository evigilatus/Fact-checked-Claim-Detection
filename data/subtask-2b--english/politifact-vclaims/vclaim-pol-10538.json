But it did not carry a $1 trillion price tag at the time.\n\nThe 2009 estimate was $787 billion and later revised to $814 billion.\n\nInterest costs on additional debt will bring it over $1 trillion, but Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said it\u2019s somewhat misleading to pin that figure on Baldwin.\n\nSo the ad is a bit shaky on the big picture.\n\nLight bulbs\n\nNow let\u2019s try to shed some light on the claim of a wasteful $800,000 in stimulus funds to \"replace light bulbs.\"\n\nCrossroads GPS pointed us to a November 9, 2011, online story by\nWITI-TV (Channel 6) in Milwaukee that focused on stimulus-funded projects that, in the words of the story, weren\u2019t \"exactly stimulating much of anything.\"\n\nThe story said the U.S. Department of Energy had \"showered\" the city of Racine with nearly $800,000 in stimulus money, which Racine used to replace street lights with energy efficient LED lights. But, the story said, only one unemployed electrician was needed to install the lights.\n\nSo, while the ad leaves the impression these are ordinary light bulbs, that\u2019s far from the case.\n\nAs in many other U.S. cities, the Racine money came through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program. At least 30 cities asked for more than $104 million in federal stimulus funds to help them change to LED (light-emitting diodes), replacing high-pressure sodium lights, USA Today reported in March 2009.\n\nRacine\u2019s total grant was $795,000, but not all of it was for the street lights. A good chunk of it -- about $194,000 -- was for energy audits of homes and loans to residents who wanted to save money through weatherization and other energy-saving changes. Another $79,500 was for administration.\n\nA total of $521,500 was for the new LED lights, with about half for street lights and half for city government buildings, according to Kathleen Fischer, the city\u2019s assistant finance director.\n\nSo the Crossroads ad is off on the $800,000 claim as well.\n\nThe installation did only result in enough work for one full-time electrician, according to Racine Mayor John Dickert.\n\nBut there are a couple other aspects to this.\n\nFirst, Racine is saving 59 percent on energy costs thanks to the lights. That is projected to amount to about $40,000 a year.\n\n\"It was money well spent,\" said Mark Yehlen, commissioner of Public Works. \"We have realized significant savings.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s more, one of the primary suppliers of LED lights for the Racine project was a Racine-area company, Ruud Lighting, that builds the lights.\n\nRuud has expanded and added jobs while winning contracts to supply LED lights all over the United States to municipalities -- many of them using the federal stimulus dollars flowing through the Department of Energy\u2019s block grant program.\n\n\"BetaLED, a division of Ruud Lighting, Inc., is seeing a healthy boost in business as cities tap into their Recovery Act funds...\", a Department of Energy news release said in April 2010.\n\n\nWhen Ruud was purchased by Cree Inc. in 2011 and announced job-expansion plans, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker praised the company and said Ruud would be eligible for up to $4 million in state tax credits.\n\nFor years, many of the LED conversions involved lights mostly made in Asia, though the lights often were assembled in the United States, PolitiFact National and FactCheck.org found in previous fact checks. That was because the Energy Department initially felt insufficient components were available domestically.\n\nRuud has won some contracts because it uses more American-made parts than other companies, according to news coverage in Pittsburgh, where it also won work, though not through stimulus funding.\n\n\"These ads are really disappointing,\" said Dickert, the Racine mayor. \"They are only telling half the story, if that.\"\n\nOur rating\n\nCrossroads GPS charges that Baldwin voted for wasteful spending through a \"$1 trillion stimulus\" plan, specifically citing \"$800,000 to replace light bulbs.\"\n\nOn both counts, the numbers are too high. While only one job was created to complete the project, city officials say it will save city taxpayers money every year and a growing local company got a big chunk of the contract to make the lights. They are in the midst of a hiring effort and have won stimulus-funded work all over the country.\n\nThere\u2019s an element of truth in that federal stimulus money went to buy light bulbs, but overall we rate the claim Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10538"}
