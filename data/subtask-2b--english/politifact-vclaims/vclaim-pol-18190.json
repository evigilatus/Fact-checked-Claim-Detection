A man with a British accent narrates.\n\"Use as much natural vitamin C as possible to strengthen the immune system,\" he says during the nearly 2-minute video. \"Slices of lemon in a cup of hot water can save your life. The hot lemon can kill the proliferation of this virus in our bodies!\"\nThe narrator identifies himself as \"Jiao Shenme Minzi from China, a researcher at the Faculty of Medical Science, Zanjan University.\" He goes on to say that \"warm lemons can have the same beneficial effects as medicines\" and their juice \"destroys the virus and cures the flu.\" As evidence, the narrator credits a \"Professor Chen Horin, CEO of the Beijing Military Hospital.\"\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook Messenger)\nWe\u2019ve fact-checked several chain messages about the coronavirus, as well as bogus cures, on apps like iMessage, Snapchat and WhatsApp. So we looked into this one, too.\nThere is no evidence that drinking hot lemon juice kills COVID-19. Health officials have debunked the hoax, and a similar version has been shared in India and Italy.\nThere are a couple of things wrong with the video right off the bat.\nFirst, the narrator claims to be based in China. But Zanjan University is in Iran. We found no evidence that the university has anyone on its medical faculty named Jiao Shenme Minzi, at least not as of September 2017, when its webpage says it was last updated. In fact, \"Jiao Shenme Minzi\" is one letter off from \"jiao shenme mingzi,\" a popular phonetic pronunciation of a phrase used in Chinese when asking someone for their name.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, there is no evidence that vitamin C is effective against COVID-19. We rated a similar claim False in February.\nThird, we could find no trace of a researcher named Chen Horin. The name has been used for similar hoaxes in the past.\nThe Messenger video comes from Marian Gorban, the owner of MrHealthyChannel, an alternative health channel on YouTube with more than 21,000 subscribers. One of his most popular videos claims you can lose weight quickly by drinking ginger syrup.\u00a0\nRELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself\nGorban, whose Facebook profile says he lives in Romania, also claims to be an expert in search engine optimization. We reached out to him for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nOn its website, the World Health Organization says that, while it recommends eating plenty of fruits and vegetables to stay healthy, there is no scientific evidence that lemon treats or prevents COVID-19 infection. To prevent coronavirus infection, officials advise people to regularly wash their hands, avoid touching their face, disinfect surfaces in their homes daily and avoid people who are sick.\nAs of now, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19. But according to the Mayo Clinic, patients can alleviate symptoms \u2014 including cough, shortness of breath and fever \u2014 with cough medicine, pain and fever relievers, rest, and fluids.\nThe chain message is inaccurate. We rate it False.\nIf you receive a chain message that you want us to fact-check, send a screenshot to [email\u00a0protected].", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18190"}
