General Assembly:", "title": "Donald Trump is flawed about threats to religious freedom.", "text": "In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump focused on trade, Iran and North Korea. However, it also dealt with the protection of the rights of homosexuals, the ownership of arms and freedom of religion. The status of the United States Trump as a pillar of religious tolerance speaks of the \"non-total American obligation\" to protect religious freedom. \"It's hard to believe, but 80% of the world's population lives in countries where religious freedom is in great danger or even totally banned,\" said Tramp 24 September 24. \"We want and support religious freedom for all.\" There is some content of Tramp statistics, but it depends on the broadest definition of threats to religion. How wide is it? Well, in the baseline analysis, the United States listed itself as having a high ranking for one type of intolerance and ended up in the same category as Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Let's empty the number. The business group rings 80% in the summary of the Foundation for Religious Freedom and Business, an organization that promotes interfaith understanding and aims to show business leaders that \"religious freedom is good for business.\" This group looked at countries with high levels of government restrictions or deep-rooted social hostility to religion and populations. The country list was received from the Pew Research Centre, a reliable source of data. \"Pew Research Centre data show that the number of people living in countries with high religious and aggressive restrictions has reached nearly six billion, or 78.5% of the world's total population in 2017,,\" wrote the chairman of the group in a presentation. The math is correct, and it supports Trump's claim. However, a closer look at the Pew study shows why a dose of caution is applied. The Pew Study conducted by the Pew Research Centre considered the most recent survey of religious restrictions to two types of problems: government action, and actions taken by individuals or groups, which are called social hostility. Jeremy Parker of the Institute of Religious Freedom, a group defending religious freedom, told us that when interpreting the results, \"the extra look is required.\" \"while the total population of these countries is 6.3 billion, restrictions may not affect these people equally,\" said Parker. In particular, in the area of social hostility, a handful of poor actors are required to place a country on a list of relatively low-ranking States. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, the report found that 52 out of 198 countries had very high or very high levels of government debt restrictions. In the worst cases, people were arrested or detained by government officials for reasons of their faith. The greatest perpetrators were China, Iran, Malaysia and Syria, and countries such as Russia and Indonesia ranked first tenth. The analysis of Pew had a separate arrangement for social hostility. These include harassment of women for clothing, religious violence by organized groups and hate crimes committed by individuals. These efforts can take place beyond the best efforts of Governments to stop them. Fifty-six countries have been classified as countries experiencing high or very high social hostilities. India was at the summit, followed by Egypt, Iraq and Syria. With growing tensions in Europe associated with refugees, Germany, Italy and Denmark have also emerged. But so did the United States. She received higher degrees because of incidents such as the 2017 rally united right in Charlottesville, Fa, where the marchers were cheering \"the Jews will not replace us,\" and a fatal stab in Portland, Or. When a man yelled anti-Muslim remarks to two women, one of them was wearing the veil. While Trump urged other countries to match the commitment of the United States, his statistics included the United States and other States with a tradition of protecting religious rights. In combining lists of governmental restrictions and social hostility, the report concluded that at least 83 States ranked high in one State or another. The total population is approximately 6 billion, of which the United States population is a part. This is the source of 80% of the number that Trump mentioned. Sean Casey, Director of the Berkeley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown University, said that 80% of the figures distorted Pew's report. \"The president is looking for an interesting number that says that religious intolerance is on fire,\" said Casey. \"and look at the data and it's not true.\" Parker warned that a few countries had a significant impact. \"Because a few large countries are included in this - India, China, Indonesia, etc. The population share is very high compared to the rough number of countries.\" Anna Schiller, speaking on behalf of Pew, said that the center contains many variables but does not classify them according to severity or importance. \"We leave it to our readers to form their own opinion based on our analysis,\" said Schiller. Our Governor Trump said that 80% of the world's population lives in countries where religious freedom is in great danger or banned altogether. In the end, this is based on the list of countries that are considered by an independent group with high or very high levels of governmental or social intolerance towards certain religions. However, basic data erase many laws and procedures, some of which are more repressive than others. Like many other Western democracies, the United States appears on a single list. There is no simple way to learn about the experience of religious minorities. The figure of 80 per cent is impressive, but the experts we have reached have agreed that it overestimates the impact of religious intolerance recognized by the Government and society on most people living in those countries.
