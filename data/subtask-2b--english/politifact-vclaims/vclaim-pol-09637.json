Those sentencing laws have led to longer sentences and high prison populations, along with exploding taxpayer costs. Efforts are currently under way to dial back the laws and give the courts some flexibility on mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nBut some officials, such as Paul Howard, the district attorney for Fulton County, which includes the city of Atlanta, want to keep the strict sentencing rules and touts their benefits.\n\n\"In Atlanta, since 1994 when the \u2018Seven Deadly Sins\u2019 took effect, the violent crime rate has dropped 62 percent,\" Howard said last month in an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nCrime numbers are always a wily topic, and the data can be manipulated in various ways to elicit a desired response. PolitiFact Georgia decided to see whether Howard\u2019s claim was on target.\n\nThe DA\u2019s support of the mandatory minimums is based on his criticism of sentencing disparities. \"Black defendants are at least 30 percent more likely to be in prison for the same crime,\" Howard said in the AJC article. \"Whenever judges are allowed to sentence at their discretion, the disparity increases.\"\n\nOne of the best ways to avoid racial disparities is to make the sentences the same, he said.\n\nUnder then-Gov. Zell Miller, sentencing revisions were approved that implemented sentences of 10 years with no parole for committing one of the \"seven deadly sins,\" which included rape, armed robbery, kidnapping, aggravated child molestation, aggravated sodomy and aggravated sexual battery. A second conviction mandates a life sentence without parole. \n\nHoward provided PolitiFact Georgia with two charts showing Atlanta\u2019s crime rate from 1994 to 2010. The data was derived from the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reports, according to Howard\u2019s office.\n\nThe FBI data show that the category of violent crime includes four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes are defined as those offenses that involve force or threat of force.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reports, published annually, are compiled from data voluntarily provided by police departments. About 92 percent of U.S. police departments report their data, said James Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University. \n\nFor Atlanta, the FBI data showed:\n\n1994: population, 411,204\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 violent crimes: 14,684\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 violent crime rate: 3,571\n2010: population,420,003\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 violent crimes: 5,749\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 violent crime rate: 1,368.8\n\nWith slight rounding, the decrease in the crime rate - the number of incidents per every 100,000 residents -- was 62 percent. We ran the FBI numbers for an additional year and found that through 2011, the decrease in the violent crime rate was slightly less, at about 60 percent. \n\nIn the past decade, Atlanta\u2019s population estimates have differed from those issued by the U.S. Census Bureau, which revised the city\u2019s population downward. Howard uses the higher population figures for from 2001 to 2009. But his claim involves the crime rate between two specific years, 1994 and 2010, and his population figures match those census figures used by the FBI. The difference has no impact on his claim. Using the revised lower population for 2009, for example, would have changed the decrease in the violent crime rate to 57 percent.\n\nCriminology experts we talked to agreed that the portion of Howard\u2019s statement about the decreased crime rate was true, but that the question lies with causality.\n\n\"It\u2019s certainly possible that the increase in sentencing has played a role, but you can\u2019t without a lot of confidence say that that is the full reason why crime rates have changed,\" said Douglas Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University who has extensively studied the issue. Berman opposes mandatory sentencing.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also notable that violent crime rates dropped not just in Atlanta, but in other places across the country, including places without mandatory sentencing, said Robert Friedmann, a professor emeritus of criminal justice at Georgia State University. \n\nGBI crime data show that from 1994 to 2010 the crime rate for violent crimes decreased in the state by 36.7 percent. And through 2011 the rate decreased 40.5 percent.\n\nNationwide, violent and property crimes decreased for the fifth straight year, according to the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Report for 2011. In 2010, the number of violent crimes in the country dropped to the lowest rate in nearly 40 years.\n\nSo does Howard prove his case?\n\nThe Fulton district attorney supports strict mandatory minimum sentencing. One of his arguments is the notable 62 percent decrease in violent crimes in the two decades since the sentences have been in place. \n\nFBI data support his claim. The violent crime rate from 1994 to 2010 did indeed drop 62 percent; and through 2011, the decrease in the violent crime rate was about 60 percent. On just the numbers, Howard is correct. But criminology and law experts say it is almost impossible to tie the decrease directly to this one issue of mandatory minimum sentencing.\n\nHoward\u2019s numbers are accurate, but his statement needs additional information. We rated his statement Mostly True.\n\nStaff writer Karishma Mehrotra contributed to this article.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09637"}
