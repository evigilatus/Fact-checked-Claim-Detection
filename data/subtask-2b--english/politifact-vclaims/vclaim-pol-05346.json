Today, it is a sprawling compound of over 400 buildings housing about 3,200 beds.\nThose numbers clearly mean a lot to management because on the hospital\u2019s website, right under its name, is the statement \"The world\u2019s third-biggest hospital, in South Africa.\"\nThat\u2019s not quite right, according to our colleagues at Africa Check.\nChris Hani Baragwanath Hospital says it trails only West China Hospital, affiliated with Sichuan University in the city of Chengdu, with about 4,300 beds, and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, which lists about 9,000 beds.\nBut Africa Check found an additional hospital that edges out the Soweto health center. The Clinical Centre of Serbia in Belgrade has 3,470 beds available.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital ranks at least fourth, not third. It\u2019s actually not even a close fourth because repairs and renovations have trimmed the number of beds open right now. A hospital spokesman told Africa Check that a more accurate current total is 2,888.\nFor the curious, New York Presbyterian has 2,328 beds, Florida Hospital Orlando has 2,247 beds and the Hospital das Clinicas with the University of Sao Paulo Medical School has 2,200 beds.\nOur ruling\nAdministrators of the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, Johannesburg, said theirs is the third-largest in the world. Today, the hospital has 2,888 useable beds. A hospital in Belgrade, Serbia, has 3,470.\nThe Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital is large, but not as large as it believes.
