A research associate there had written a post called \"Oregon\u2019s Minimum Wage Prices Teens Out.\" Here\u2019s a fuller explanation from the website:\n\n\"Oregon\u2019s unemployment among high school graduates aged 18 to 20 tops the national charts, with a rise of more than 300% from 2008 to 2011. This gigantic leap dwarfs the U.S. unemployment rate for the same demographic, which only shows an increase of around 30%.\" (Cascade later revised the claim to reflect a 200 percent increase.)\n\nHow could we find out if this was all true? Does Oregon top the national charts? Was the increase in Oregon really that much worse than the national increase? And what about the underlying point: That Oregon\u2019s minimum wage was to blame? The original post contained no links and -- more significantly -- no unemployment numbers, so we had little to go on. We put in a call to Cascade.\n\nA little background here for those unfamiliar with opposition to Oregon\u2019s minimum wage. Oregon has the second highest-minimum wage among states, $8.80 this year, second only to Washington, at $9.04. What really annoys critics is that the wage automatically goes up every Jan. 1, as it is indexed to inflation. Voters approved the automatic indexing in 2002. Restaurants and small businesses hate it and argue that a high minimum wage hurts teen employment.\n\nSo it makes sense that Cascade, which sides with free market principles, is among those critics. We spoke with Steve Buckstein, the group\u2019s senior policy analyst. In doing so, Buckstein corrected the original write-up to reflect a 219 percent increase, and not a 300 percent increase, in Oregon\u2019s 18-20 unemployment rate. He said the general argument still stands.\n\n\"We have a very high minimum wage, and it makes it harder for teens and unskilled workers to get jobs,\" Buckstein said.\n\nBasic starting point: What are his numbers and where did he get them? Cascade turned to the Employment Policies Institute, a business-backed Washington, D.C., group that also dislikes the minimum wage. The institute even runs a website called MinimumWage.com.\n\nMichael Saltsman, a research fellow there, used Current Population Survey figures (which are compiled by the U.S. Census and used by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) to figure out unemployment for high school graduates 18 to 20.\n\nHere are the numbers: In 2008, unemployment in Oregon was 11.1 percent. By 2011, it was 35.4 percent. That is a 219 percent increase. The U.S average was 18.3 percent in 2008 and 24.5 percent in 2011. That is a 34 percent increase.\n\nWe were struck by two things in the data: The high 35 percent rate in Oregon in 2011, but also the low 11 percent rate in 2008. We were doing better than the national average five years ago. Obviously if we go from lower-than-average to higher-than-average, we\u2019re going to get a larger-than-usual increase. That made us see the 200 percent increase in a new light.\n\nWe then checked with the Oregon Center for Public Policy, another local think tank, but on the other side of the issue. Executive director Chuck Sheketoff suggested we try the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, which, unlike the Employment Policies Institute, supports raising the minimum wage.\n\nEconomic analyst David Cooper shared his unemployment rates for the same age group, also using Current Population Survey figures. And you know what we found? The unemployment figures were different -- lower, generally, all around -- but the rates of increase were about the same.\n\nIn 2008, unemployment for high school graduates 18-20 years old in Oregon was 8.3 percent, compared with 13.4 percent nationally. In 2011, Oregon unemployment had grown to 25.4 percent, compared with 18.4 percent nationally. Those figures correspond with a 206 percent increase in Oregon, and 37 percent nationally.\n\nAgain, Oregon was doing better than the national average, before we did worse in 2011.\n\n(Cooper also argues youth unemployment jumped dramatically \"across the entire country, and particularly in the Pacific Northwest\" between 2008 and 2011. The increase in Washington was 85 percent and in Idaho, 83 percent. Again, Oregon had lower unemployment than both states in 2008 but ended with slightly higher rates in 2011, which made the increase more dramatic.)\n\nWe checked with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which provides the official unemployment figures, and Oregon\u2019s Employment Department. We\u2019ll spare you more numbers. Both agencies showed the same trend, albeit for slightly different age groups, education levels and years.\n\nClearly, the numbers went up. Is any of this tied to Oregon\u2019s indexed minimum wage? People disagree on this. Obviously when employers are shedding jobs, they\u2019re not hiring. And when they do start hiring, they often hire more experienced adults. There\u2019s no question the recession has hit teens and other young workers hard.\n\nBut Nick Beleiciks, state employment economist, offers a different take on how unemployment intersects with a high minimum wage. Data show that teens in Oregon are more likely to look for work than teens across the country, he said. That\u2019s called a participation rate.\n\n\"Oregon has a higher participation rate and that could have to do with the higher minimum wage and because of that higher participation rate, we do have a higher unemployment rate among teenagers,\" he said.\n\nBuckstein argues that the high unemployment rate has to do with younger workers looking for jobs in a limited market, and not getting those jobs because they\u2019re losing out to more experienced workers. Of course, neither explanation addresses why our rates were lower than the U.S. average in 2008, which was after Oregon voters approved indexing the minimum wage to inflation in 2002.\n\nWe won\u2019t rule on that argument. We\u2019re sticking to the numbers. In case you\u2019ve forgotten them, here\u2019s a nifty table for easy review:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nCascade 2008\n\nCascade 2011\n\npercent increase\n\nEco Policy 2008\n\nEco Policy 2011\n\npercent increase\n\n\n\nOregon\n\n11.1\n\n35.4\n\n219 %\n\n8.3\n\n25.4\n\n206 %\n\n\n\nU.S.\n\n18.3\n\n24.5\n\n34 %\n\n13.4\n\n18.4\n\n37 %\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe rates of increase cited by Cascade Policy are correct, as measured by its numbers and the numbers of an ideologically different institute. We will give Cascade a pass on the original increase cited because, in this context, the difference between 219 percent and 300 percent doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nThe problem we have is we don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to use the national average to highlight the apparently horrible nature of Oregon unemployment, without noting the actual unemployment figures. In every data set we checked, Oregon\u2019s youth unemployment in 2008 was lower than the national average. Of course, the rate of increase will be higher when the starting point is lower.\n\nWe think the actual unemployment rates are an important missing detail that should be considered when looking at increases.
