Many of those claims involved Dominion Voting Systems, which makes election software and hardware.\u00a0\nNow, another unfounded claim about the company is circulating online.\u00a0\n\"The White House is freaking out after Myanmar military arrests political leaders for election fraud in their November 8 elections,\" one Facebook post said. \"Myanmar used Dominion Voting Systems.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nSearching online, including reviewing news stories about the election and military ouster, we found no evidence to support that claim.\u00a0\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Dominion told PolitiFact: \"This is a completely false claim. Dominion systems have never been used in Myanmar at any time.\"\u00a0\nThat\u2019s corroborated by a report on the 2020 election in Myanmar, which doesn\u2019t mention Dominion or any electronic voting system. Voters used paper ballots, folding them to ensure secrecy before dropping them in the ballot box.\u00a0\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19063"}
