Sanders a Civil War hero was a parody site\u2019s story", "text": "A story that said President Donald Trump praised Kentucky Fried Chicken\u2019s founder for saving Civil War troops from starvation at Valley Forge flunks the truth test.\nLet\u2019s do our own history lesson here: A May 2, 2017, post at TheRedShtick.com carried the headline, \"Donald Trump praises Colonel Sanders for his service in the Civil War.\" The story was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to combat fake news.\nThe story played off a controversial comment Trump made on May 1 about former President Andrew Jackson, whom Trump readily admires. \u00a0\nDuring an interview on Sirius XM\u2019s P.O.T.U.S. channel, Trump told the Washington Examiner's Salena Zito, \"I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later you wouldn't have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart. He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, 'There's no reason for this.' \"\nTrump drew criticism for the incident because his words neglect the fact that Jackson was a slave owner.\nTheRedShtick.com used an excerpt from a May 1 New York Times story about the flap, then went off on its own invented tangent.\nThe post said Trump told their intern, Dave Robicheaux, that Col. Harland Sanders, the founder of the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant chain, was a \"tremendous Civil War hero.\" \u00a0\n\"Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter,\" the post read.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Robicheaux attempted to explain to Trump that Col. Sanders was born 25 years after the end of the war, that The Donald seemed to be confusing the food incident with a Biblical story about Jesus feeding the multitudes, and that Valley Forge was neither an encampment nor a battle site during the Civil War.\"\nIt should be pretty obvious that this story is more than a bit contrived, starting with the name of the post\u2019s author, Manny Schewitz. (For the record, Trump does like the occasional KFC bucket.)\nPeople coming to the story would certainly realize the post is fake if\u00a0they visited the web pages\u2019 About Us section. It says TheRedShtick.com is \"a bold and engaging source of satire and irreverent humor.\" It said the site is a digital descendant of the defunct Red Shtick Magazine, formerly \"the only print satirical publication in Louisiana\u2019s capital city\" of Baton Rouge (French for Red Stick). The print magazine ended in 2012, the site said.\nThere is a RedShtickMagazine.com, that carries similar graphics to TheRedShtick.com, but the two sites post different content. The magazine site appears to carry unrelated, intermittent blog posts about Thailand-centric issues and events, as far as we can tell.\nNeither site makes its registration information public, but TheRedShtick.com publisher Jeremy White told us the publication once used the magazine\u2019s domain name, but gave it up after going digital.\nAs for the Sanders story, White said that it should be obvious that it\u2019s fabricated, but these days satire can be difficult to distinguish from reality.\n\"We earnestly endeavor to distinguish ourselves from peddlers of fake news \u2014 devoid of any real humor or any attempt to speak truth to power \u2014 who publish their fiction under the guise of satire,\" White said. \"They only muddy our national discourse in the pursuit of easy clicks.\"\nEither way, Facebook readers should flag TheRedShtick.com as a satirical website and avoid it as a news source.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-23 21:03:31 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Donald Trump praises Colonel Sanders for his service in the Civil War.\"    TheRedShtick.com website   in an Internet post Tuesday, May 2, 2017 2017-05-02    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03278"}
