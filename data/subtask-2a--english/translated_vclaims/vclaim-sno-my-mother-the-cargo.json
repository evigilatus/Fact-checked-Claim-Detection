The surviving members of the family put their body on the rack of the car, covered it with cloth, and continue to work. When you reach the nearest town, the family stops for coffee and food, leaving the remains of Grandma tied to the roof shelf. They return to the parking lot to find their car - and their dead relative - has disappeared."}
