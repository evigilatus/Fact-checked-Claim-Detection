Chris Christie says the New Jersey budget doubled property tax credits and had no new tax increases for the second consecutive year", "text": "Gov. Chris Christie recently took the budget battle to the airwaves, touting his $29.7 billion spending plan for fiscal year 2012 as a model of fiscal responsibility.\n\nIn a radio spot sponsored by the New Jersey Republican State Committee, Christie said the budget \"doubled property tax credits for seniors and middle class New Jerseyans\" and included \"no tax increases for any New Jersey family for the second year in a row.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey found that the new budget is projected to double the average Homestead property tax credit. The question of tax increases is not as clear-cut, however: the state\u2019s major tax rates have stayed the same, but tax credit programs, including Homestead, were reduced last year.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s tackle the Homestead credits.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A Republican Party spokesman cited the Homestead program to back up the governor\u2019s claim.\n\nAccording to a budget analysis by the state\u2019s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, Christie is right that Homestead credits are set to double under the state budget for fiscal 2012.\n\nThe fiscal 2012 budget increased funding for the Homestead program from $268.2 million in fiscal 2011 to $458 million.\n\nAccording to OLS, the \"$189.8 million funding increase is slated to pay for a doubling in (fiscal) 2012 of homestead credits beneficiaries received in (fiscal) 2011.\"\n\nThe analysis, citing estimates from the governor\u2019s office, said the average credit for 938,500 homeowners would increase to $476 in fiscal 2012 from $238 in fiscal 2011, when credits were cut significantly.\n\nSo, Christie technically doubled credits in fiscal 2012. However, the average Homestead benefit would still be less than half of the $1,035 average in fiscal 2010, according to OLS estimates.\n\nAlso, in fiscal 2012, Christie is maintaining the eligibility requirements for homeowners set by his predecessor -- up to $150,000 in income for senior and disabled homeowners and up to $75,000 in income for all other homeowners.\n\nBut the fiscal 2011 reduction in the Homestead credits work against the governor\u2019s argument that there have been no tax increases for two consecutive years.\n\nIt is true that the rates for the state\u2019s three major taxes -- gross income, sales and corporation business -- have not increased under Christie.\n\nBut it\u2019s also true that the state has reduced funding for some tax credits, which could leave people with less money to offset their tax bills.\n\nBetween fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, the state reduced funding for the Homestead and senior freeze programs as well as the State Earned Income Tax Credit. Individuals can receive the earned income tax credits even if they don\u2019t owe taxes. Senior freeze provides additional property tax relief for senior citizens and the disabled.\n\nFour experts with different political persuasions and a Rutgers University professor told us that cutting one or all of those payments could be considered tax increases.\n\nJosh Barro, a fellow at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute, said a reduction in the earned income tax credit was not a tax hike, because it\u2019s a welfare payment through the tax code. But reducing the property tax credits could be considered tax increases, since they\u2019re meant to offset property tax burdens, Barro said.\n\nCurtis Dubay, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said a reduction in the earned income tax credit could force a recipient to pay more taxes if his credit still falls short. For example, an individual may owe $1,000 in income taxes and then receive a credit for $800, but still owe $200 in taxes, Dubay said.\n\nBut Alan Berube of the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program said in an email that a reduction would affect earned income tax credit recipients with no remaining income tax liability. \"For all, it will increase their total tax bill when you consider all state and local taxes together (i.e, not just income taxes),\" he wrote.\n\nAndrew Pratt, a spokesman for the state Treasury Department, argued in a series of emails that the earned income tax credit is just a payment to low-income individuals, not a tax break. Pratt pointed out that nearly 75 percent of recipients in 2010 did not owe income taxes.\n\nIndividuals don\u2019t have to file income tax returns if they earn less than $10,000 annually for single filers or less than $20,000 for married couples filing jointly.\n\nPratt added, \"The Senior Freeze and Homestead credits are payments from the Treasury. You cannot classify a reduction or a freeze in the payment or eligibility as a tax increase, unless you are doing so to score political points.\"\n\nLet\u2019s recap:\n\nChristie said in a radio ad that the fiscal 2012 budget doubles property tax credits and includes no tax increases for the second consecutive year.\n\nThe governor\u2019s right about the property tax credits being doubled, even though they\u2019ll remain below the fiscal 2010 average. It\u2019s true that the rates for the state\u2019s three major taxes have remained the same.\n\nBut three tax credit programs were reduced in fiscal 2011, and several experts said at least one of those reductions could represent a tax hike.\n\nWe rate the statement Half True.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12690"}
