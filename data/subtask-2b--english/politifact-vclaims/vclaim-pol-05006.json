Coloradans will decide whether to create the giant system when they vote on Amendment 69 in the November election.\n\"Supporters estimate ColoradoCare would have $38 billion in annual revenues,\" the report states.\n\"If it were a private company, ColoradoCare would rank about 80th in the Fortune 500, just behind New York Life Insurance and ahead of well\u00ad-known companies such as American Express, 21st Century Fox, 3M, Sears, Nike and McDonald's.\"\nNeed more perspective? Colorado's annual state budget is $25.7 billion.\nWe examined the statement that ColoradoCare\u2019s projected revenues would be $38 billion and overshadow huge corporates. We found that the number is right in theory, but it depends on the federal government signing off on a first-of-its-kind health system for Colorado.\nHow ColoradoCare would work\nFirst, here\u2019s how ColoradoCare would work.\nIf approved by voters, Colorado would be the first state to have a health care system where every resident has coverage financed by taxes instead of private insurance premiums, according to the Colorado Health Institute report.\nThe institute estimates that 83 percent of Colorado\u2019s population -- about 4.4 million people -- would be eligible for primary health insurance coverage through ColoradoCare. The remaining 17 percent of residents would continue to be covered by federal programs, including Medicare and the Veterans Administration.\nPeople would still choose their own health care providers, but ColoradoCare would pay the bills. Members would not have to pay an annual deductible, but they would have co-pays.\nThe system would be controlled by a powerful 21-member board, elected by the system\u2019s members in seven districts across the state. The governor and legislature would have no role, except to select an interim board until elections were held. \u00a0\nAn economic analysis by supporters says ColoradoCare would produce a net savings of $4.5 billion for residents and businesses by eliminating private insurance profits, streamlining paperwork and more efficiently delivering services. Opponents say the proposed amendment will be costly, it won't impact rising health care costs and it will hamper the state\u2019s ability to attract and retain medical providers.\nThe ColoradoCareYes campaign confirmed the proposed nonprofit health system is projected to have $38 billion in annual revenues.\nAbout $25 billion would come from state taxes. Employers would pay 6.67 percent in payroll taxes and employees would contribute 3.33 percent, for a total of 10 percent of the payroll. Self-employed people would pay 10 percent of their net income.\nThe projected $25 billion in tax revenues have been independently confirmed by an economist at the Colorado Legislative Council, which provided a revenue impact report to the state board that reviews the language and legality of an initiative's ballot title and summary.\nFor the rest of its annual revenues, supporters say ColoradoCare would apply for waivers from the federal government, so that ColoradoCare takes over the state roles and funding for Medicaid ($10.8 billion) and the Affordable Care Act ($700 million). Out-of-pocket costs for medical care and dental care would each provide an estimated $1 billion.\nBut\u00a0experts said obtaining the federal waivers is a challenging process -- and there\u2019s no certainty of success.\nBeginning on Jan. 1, states can apply for a federal waiver to create innovative, alternative health care programs that would take the place of the Affordable Care Act -- while staying true to its goals. ColoradoCare would have to pass a rigorous federal review, showing it would deliver coverage that's at least as comprehensive and affordable as the so-called Obamacare program, while covering the same amount of people. ColoradoCare would have to stay \"revenue neutral\" and not cost more than the existing federal program.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal waivers, funding \u2018not a sure thing\u2019\nWhat are the chances of obtaining the waivers and the federal funds that go with them?\n\"Definitely, I would say it\u2019s not a sure thing,\" said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who specializes in health care reform, an issue she worked on for both the administrations of President Barack Obama and President Bill Clinton.\nYet, if approved by voters, ColoradoCare would be among the first states to seek an Affordable Care Act (ACA) waiver and bring \"the most far-reaching health care reform in any state since the ACA,\" according to the Colorado Health Institute report.\n\"There's advantages for being the first one in the door. It lets you kind of establish the framework for the debate that's going follow,\" Pollitz said.\nMedicaid waivers aren\u2019t automatic, either, though several states, including Colorado, have received the so-called 1115 waivers -- named for a Section 1115 of the Social Security Act\n\"1115 waivers require a lot of work and back-and-forth between the state and the federal government and compliance with a number of criteria, including budget neutrality,\" said Elisabeth Arenales, the health care program director for the Colorado Center on Law and Policy. The center\u00a0hasn't reviewed or taken a position on Amendment 69.\n\"States have to be careful in how they negotiate those waivers because they're essentially locked into a spending contract, and they need to be very mindful that they're both not costing the federal government any additional money but also that their projections of state spending are accurate,\" Arenales said.\u00a0\nThe ballot initiative\u2019s language makes it clear that getting the waivers are a do-or-die matter for ColoradoCare. No waivers means no program.\nUnder the heading \"Termination of ColoradoCare\u2019s Operations,\" the initiative states: \"If the board determines that ColoradoCare has not received the waivers, exemptions, and agreements from the federal government sufficient for its fiscally sound operation, the board shall: (a) shut down operations and return unused funds; (b) notify the governor of the State of Colorado of ColoradoCare's inability to function.\"\nColoradoCareYES campaign spokesman Owen Perkins acknowledged the waivers\u2019 critical importance.\n\"ColoradoCare doesn't move forward without that,\" he said. But, at the same time, he said it should be reassuring to Colorado voters that health care system couldn\u2019t launch until it passes a high bar set by the federal government.\n\"I think everybody in Colorado should be thankful that there is that vigorous standard,\" Perkins said. \"That ensures that we can't go into this willy-nilly. It could pass with a 75-percent vote and everything look perfect, but if it doesn't receive that waiver, it's not going to happen.\" \u00a0\nHe stressed that the architects of ColoradoCare have done their homework.\nThe Colorado Health Institute is accurate in saying, given ColoradoCare\u2019s projected $38 billion in revenues, if it were a private company is would rank about 80th on the Fortune 500 just behind New York Life Insurance ($38.7 billion in revenues). It\u2019s revenues would be larger than American Express \u00a0($35.9 billion), Twenty-First Century Fox ($31.86 billion), 3M ($31.82 billion), Sears ($31.2 billion), Nike ($27.8 billion) and McDonald\u2019s ($27.4 billion).\nOn paper, the ColoradoCareYES campaign\u2019s projected state tax and federal funding revenues add up to $38 billion.\nOur ruling\nThe Colorado Health Institute analysis said the Colorado universal health care system would have a projected $38 billion in revenues, larger than major corporations.\nThe numbers seem to add up if everything with ColoradoCare goes according to its supporters\u2019 plans. The revenues would be larger than some big companies.\u00a0However, the health care plan\u00a0has a make-or-break need to obtain federal waivers that would allow it to assume the roles of state Medicaid and Affordable Care Act programs. No waivers means no deal.\nThe statement is accurate but needs additional information.
