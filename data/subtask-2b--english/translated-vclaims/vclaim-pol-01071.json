The comment says: \"Frozen to death 15 displaced persons have already been found in Chicago\" and asks users to prepare their blessings. It's brutally cold in the Midwest, and there's no doubt that this weather event that broke the record carries a high risk. To date, eight deaths have been reported as the powerful storm moves through the United States. However, there is no evidence of the alleged death of 15 displaced persons, and the tragic picture is in fact from a winter event in 2013 in Canada. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim appeared to have arisen on Twitter on 27 January, two days before the cold explosion in the city. However, more than 2200 times have been rewrited. We found one reported death in the Chicago region relating to the polar vortex, a man beaten and killed by an ice plow. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021 until January 2021, and there were at least seven other deaths associated with the severe cold explosion. They're all tragic. However, none of these deaths were among the homeless in Chicago. In fact, it occurred in several states. The deaths include a couple who died in a car accident on an ice road in Indiana; a man who was found in front of his neighbour &apos; s house in Michigan; the body of another man who was discovered in Wisconsin garage; and a student from Iowa University who was found abroad in the middle of the night. The accompanying picture was not taken in Chicago and not this year. In the picture, the homeless person actually sleeps on the Toronto pier on January 22, 2013, when temperatures dropped to -25 degrees. It was highlighted in the Canadian implementation of the National Bulletin. A search for the reverse image shows that the image was later uploaded to other websites as of February 2013. The city of Chicago has taken measures to get people out of the streets and turn schools, libraries and other buildings into centres of global warming. As temperatures decreased, a shelter for displaced persons in Chicago received some 800 homeless men, women and children seeking asylum - more than triple its capacity, according to local news reports. And one anonymous donor offered to pay hotel bills to about 70 homeless people. Our social media article says that 15 homeless people died in Chicago because of the recent cold. While there have been multiple deaths associated with weather events, none of these deaths have so far been reported from any displaced persons from the Chicago region. In addition, the image of the homeless person appearing in the article is six years old, taken in Canada. We assess it wrong.
