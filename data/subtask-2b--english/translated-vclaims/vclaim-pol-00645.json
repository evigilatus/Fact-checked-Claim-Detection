I urge @USA Sec Sony Perdu to withdraw the proposal.\" Nineteen per cent of the world &apos; s population is dependent on the South Pacific National Programme of Action, but the proposed changes will require food assistance from those struggling to find stable employment while doing nothing to help them to work permanently.

At the same time, according to the Census Bureau, the population of the State in 2015 is estimated at 1,805,832. This works for 17.4% of the state's population, or slightly less than the 19% figure Manchen mentioned. Manchen said our governor, \"19% of WVians depend on SNAP, but the proposed changes will take food assistance from those struggling to find a stable job while doing nothing to help them get a permanent job.
