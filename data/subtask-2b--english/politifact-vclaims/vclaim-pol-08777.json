The high school dropout rate is over 50 percent.\"\nThose statistics offer a troubling view of the city and while there\u2019s some accuracy to the claims, they leave out critical details.\nLet\u2019s first address violent crime, then go to unemployment and education.\nLonegan campaign spokesman Will Gattenby said in an e-mail that the violent crime claim is based on numbers from the FBI\u2019s annual detailed report on crime statistics known as the Uniform Crime Report. Lonegan\u2019s camp compared UCR data from 2005 and 2012.\nThe FBI\u2019s UCR defines violent crime in four categories: murder and nonnegligent homicide; forcible rape; robbery; and aggravated assault.\nThe number of violent crime offenses in Newark last year totaled 3,219. The 2005 total was 2,821.\nJames Allen, Booker\u2019s communications director, said it would be \"a fair benchmark\" to use 2006 to measure violent crime since James, also a Democrat, left office that year and Booker succeeded him on July 1, 2006.\nThe results are the same, though. When compared with 2012 UCR data, overall violent crime is up, as Lonegan claims, but he fails to note that offenses in three categories have fallen: homicides and manslaughters, rapes, and aggravated assaults.\nHere's a look at Newark's violent crime statistics, according to the data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report:\n\n\n\nYEAR\nPOPULATION\n\nVIOLENT CRIME TOTAL\n\n\nMURDER/NON-NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE\n\nFORCIBLE RAPE\nROBBERY\nAGGRAVATED ASSAULT\n\n\n\n\n2005\n281,063\n2,821\n97\n83\n1,250\n1,391\n\n\n2006\n280,877\n2,839\n105\n87\n1,288\n1,359\n\n\n2012\n278,906\n3,219\n95\n55\n1,976\n1,093\n\n\n\nSources: FBI website, Crime In The United States (Uniform Crime Report), 2005, 2006, 2012\nRobberies are driving that category's increase, according to Allen, who said the stealing of iPhones and smartphones represents a significant number of those crimes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While the rise of smartphones over the last five years has made them increasingly prevalent targets for robberies, the generic UCR classification of \u2018violent crime\u2019 \u00a0gives equal weight to a smartphone robbery and a first-degree murder -- despite the vastly different nature and frequency of those crimes,\" Allen said in an e-mail.\nNext, unemployment.\nNewark\u2019s unemployment rate has largely been stuck between 14 percent and 16 percent for much of Booker\u2019s tenure as mayor, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that Booker\u2019s tenure also bookends the recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. BLS data shows a sharp uptick in the city\u2019s unemployment rate during the recession and after it ended.\nComparatively, Newark\u2019s unemployment measured as a percent change is lower than unemployment increases for the state and nation, according to BLS data.\nFinally, let\u2019s look at Newark\u2019s dropout rate, which Lonegan said exceeds 50 percent.\n\"The number of students who start 9th grade and graduate within four years via HSPA is 32.2%,\" Gattenby told us.\nThat methodology has been cited by Gov. Chris Christie, who has claimed multiple times that the graduation rate for an incoming Newark freshman who finishes high school in four years is 23 percent.\nThe Truth-O-Meter handed Christie a Pants on Fire for repeating the claim. Like Christie, Lonegan looks only at one group of students -\u2013 those who graduate by passing the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA), a state standardized test. But there are other routes to graduation, including the Alternative High School Assessment. Also, some students are exempt from testing.\nIn total, 55 percent of students graduated from Newark\u2019s high schools in four years, according to data from the 2009-2010 school year, PolitiFact New Jersey determined in January 2012.\nJarrad Toussant, Booker\u2019s senior education adviser, told us that the district\u2019s graduation rate for June 2012 was 68 percent. The remaining 32 percent either graduated after more than four years or dropped out, he said.\nThe Newark School District, which Toussant said tracks dropout data, did not respond to our request for comment.\nOur ruling\nLonegan said, \"Violent crime is up since the last year of Sharpe James\u2019 administration. This year it\u2019s higher. \u2026 The unemployment rate is almost 15 percent. The high school dropout rate is over 50 percent.\"\nOverall violent crime is up whether measured from 2005 or 2006 to 2012, but the increase is skewed by a sharp uptick in robberies, according to UCR statistics. Violent crime is down in other categories.\nUnemployment during Booker\u2019s tenure has hovered between 14 percent and 16 percent, but the impact of the recession on those figures can\u2019t be disregarded.\nLonegan\u2019s claim about Newark dropouts is based on students who graduate following a standardized testing route, but that doesn\u2019t consider all of the district\u2019s high schoolers. There are other routes to graduation.\nEach claim has a varying degree of accuracy to it, but each claim also leaves out important details and context. That\u2019s why we rate the overall claim Half True.\nTo comment on this article, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08777"}
