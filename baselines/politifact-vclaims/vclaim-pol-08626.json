Nathan Deal\u2019s re-election chances will largely rest on how voters view his economic stewardship of the state.\nAs political strategist James Carville once famously said about the biggest issue of the 1992 presidential race: \"It\u2019s the economy, stupid.\"\nSo it was no surprise that Deal held a campaign rally-type event to announce that Site Selection magazine rated Georgia as the best state to do business.\nA top adviser to one of Deal\u2019s opponent, though, said Georgians should not be too impressed.\n\"Georgia has lost 14 percent of its jobs paying more than $50,000 a year and added 15 percent to its Medicaid rolls during the recovery,\" said Michael Mule\u2019, an adviser to the gubernatorial campaign of Dalton Mayor David Pennington.\nWe decided to do some fact checking to see whether Mule\u2019 is correct.\nMule\u2019 sent us a report to back up the first part of his claim and an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article to support the latter half of his statement.\nFirst, let\u2019s examine the latter part of his claim.\nIn September, the AJC reported that a record 1.8 million Georgians are enrolled in Medicaid and PeachCare, the state\u2019s child health insurance program. The AJC also reported that Georgia\u2019s Medicaid and PeachCare rolls had increased 15 percent since June 2009, or about 240,000 additional people, according to a review of state Department of Community Health data.\nSince Mule\u2019 mentioned Medicaid, and not PeachCare, we asked the DCH for specific data about Medicaid enrollment. In June 2009, there were approximately 1.36 million Medicaid recipients in the state. As of June 2013, the number of Medicaid recipients increased to nearly 1.59 million Georgians. That\u2019s a 16.7 percent increase, according to DCH figures.\nOn that part of the claim, Mule\u2019 is correct. Now back to the job-loss portion of his claim.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia State University\u2019s Fiscal Research Center released a report in December that examined the job climate in all of Georgia\u2019s counties between 2000 and 2009. The report classified premium jobs as those that paid more than $50,000 a year.\n\"The state of Georgia experienced a decline in both premium (-13.59 percent) and low-paying (-2.74 percent) jobs over the last decade,\" the report said.\nThe study defined low-paying jobs as those with an annual salary of less than $35,000.\nMule\u2019 was correct about the 14 percent decrease, but there was something that confused us. As we noted, the report studied 2000 through 2009. Federal economists say the recovery began in June 2009.\nState and federal labor officials say they do not have data detailing the percentage of Georgians making $50,000 or less since 2009.\nWe followed up with Mule\u2019 since his statement suggested he was referring to the number of Georgians earning more than $50,000 since the recovery. \u00a0\u00a0\n\"The Medicaid link I sent you explicitly shows that figure was \u2018during the recovery.\u2019 Perhaps inserting a comma separating the two statistics would have dismissed any confusion on your end,\" he said via email.\nTo sum up, Mule\u2019, in an attempt to curb the credit Deal is claiming over the report, claimed \"Georgia has lost 14 percent of its jobs paying more than $50,000 a year and added 15 percent to its Medicaid rolls during the recovery.\"\nHis claim is partially based on accurate numbers. He is correct about the Medicaid numbers.\nBut his statement also leaves the impression Mule\u2019 was saying Georgia has lost 14 percent of its jobs paying more than $50,000 since the recovery began. PolitiFact Georgia could not find anything to back up this part of his statement.\nAnd we think it would take more than a comma to clear that up.\nOverall, his statement is partially accurate. But it takes things out of context when read as a whole. That\u2019s our definition of Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08626"}
