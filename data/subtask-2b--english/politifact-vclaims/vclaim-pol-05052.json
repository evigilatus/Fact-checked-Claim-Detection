Rick Scott's claim about $1 billion in tax cuts needs some background", "text": "Despite lawmakers virtually ignoring his budget wish list during the 2016 legislative session, Gov. Rick Scott is boasting about fulfilling a campaign promise to cut taxes by $1 billion in his second term.\nScott took credit for the fiscal feat both before and after signing the Legislature\u2019s wide-ranging tax-cut package, HB 7099. \"Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes,\" an April 13, 2016, press release from the governor\u2019s office read.\nScott had pledged to hit the billion-dollar mark in tax reductions during his successful 2014 re-election campaign, mostly by giving breaks to businesses and limiting property tax growth. In his March 15 press release announcing his intention to sign the Legislature\u2019s budget, Scott said he\u2019d kept his promise with $1.2 billion in tax cuts over the first two years of his second term.\nScott has repeated this claim several times in one form or another. But have taxes really gone down by more than $1 billion in two years, like he says? It depends on how you look at what the Legislature has done, but the changes haven\u2019t happened the way Scott wanted.\nTallying the taxes\nWhen we asked Scott\u2019s office to break down their budget math for us, they pointed to a chart in their March 15 press release, without further detail:\n\nWe were able to verify the figures from Scott\u2019s office based on changes passed by the Legislature the last two years. The Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research compiles an annual list of how much tax revenue will be affected by bills passed during that year\u2019s legislative session (these can change as the fiscal picture becomes clearer). The House also analyzed HB 7099 to estimate how much the bill would change tax receipts.\nCell phone & TV tax cut: In 2015, the Legislature passed a 1.73 percentage point reduction in the state\u2019s communications services tax, a charge on consumer cell phone, cable and satellite bills. That amounted to a $21 annual reduction on a $100 monthly cell phone and cable bill. Scott had wanted to cut the tax by $120 million, something we\u2019d rated a Promise Kept on our Scott-O-Meter. \u00a0\nProperty tax reduction: This one is tricky, because it\u2019s more of a tax shift than a tax cut. Scott also is taking credit for a solution he didn\u2019t want.\nDuring the 2016 session, the House and Senate agreed to increase per-pupil education spending for K-12 students, something Scott had wanted.\nScott initially wanted the bump in education funding paid almost entirely through higher local property tax collections, not with general revenue. (Scott had previously proposed limiting property tax increases with a constitutional amendment, a campaign promise he has so far ignored.)\nHigher property values meant that collections would increase whether lawmakers raised the key millage rate for local property tax dollars for schools or kept it the same. Instead, the Legislature cut the local rate and paid for the $428 million difference they needed with general tax revenue.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegislators mostly referred to this as \"tax relief,\" and not a tax cut. We\u2019ve rated a similar statement Mostly True, because the change altered future collections, instead of cutting current collections. Property owners, however, are still shielded from a tax hike.\nSenate Appropriations Chairman Tom Lee, R-Brandon, told the Tampa Bay Times that if you include this revenue swap, Scott \"technically\" had reached $1 billion in tax cuts. But that\u2019s dependent on Scott accepting a plan he opposed. The Legislature has to revisit education funding every year, too, so this will no doubt change.\nBack to school sales tax holiday: Scott counts these breaks from sales tax on school supplies as a cut. These aren\u2019t permanent cuts, because the Legislature has to approve whether there will be sales tax holidays each year.\nHis figures do jibe with state estimates. The totals are different, in part, because the 2015 holiday was 10 days long, while the 2016 holiday will only be three days long. The terms of exempt items also differs between the two years.\nManufacturing machinery and equipment: Getting rid of this tax was another Scott promise, going back to his first term. The sales tax originally was cut back with a limited exemption in 2012, but the following year was suspended by legislators for three years. Starting in 2014, the tax would not apply through April 30, 2017. Scott pushed to make the suspension permanent and in 2016, the Legislature agreed. The Scott-O-Meter rated this a Promise Kept.\nCollege textbooks: Scott proposed making college textbooks exempt from sales tax, suggesting it would save the average student about $60 per year. The Legislature agreed to the exemption for the 2015-16 fiscal year, but it was not renewed in the 2016 session.\nOther tax cuts: Scott\u2019s office did not include specific dollar figures for other tax breaks, fee changes and provisions that went down over the last two years.\nIn 2015, the Legislature removed sales taxes on gun club membership fees, put a $60,000 cap on taxes for board repairs, and gave businesses tax credits for pollution cleanup and research, among other measures. For 2016, legislators gave veterans\u2019 organizations an exemption on food and drink sales taxes, phased out an asphalt tax over three years for government projects, and tinkered with taxes on cruise ship alcohol and tobacco sales, pear cider, and aviation fuel, among other changes.\nThat\u2019s just a sample of the tax changes over the last two years that Scott\u2019s office counted. The figures are in the ballpark and add up somewhere north of $1 billion. Whether he can take credit for the total is a tougher question.\nExperts have told us that counting on things like tax credits and sales tax holidays means consumers have to spend money first before enjoying any benefits. Many of these changes also are temporary or narrowly focused. And remember that local governments may have to raise taxes to account for a change in revenue.\nMeanwhile, the Legislature has balked at several tax changes Scott has wanted, including eliminating the state\u2019s corporate income tax \u2014 a major Scott request in 2016 that would have cost the state $770 million annually \u2014 and phasing out the sales tax on commercial leases.\nOur ruling\nScott said, \"Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes.\"\nThe figures are pretty accurate compared to state estimates for tax changes during 2015 and 2016. But there\u2019s some question whether you can really consider all of the measures tax cuts. While some of the alterations are permanent, many of them are temporary exemptions or target very specific beneficiaries. Scott also has to ignore some of his earlier proposals and count a plan for education funding that is the opposite of what he wanted to top the $1 billion mark.\nThe statement is accurate but needs some clarification. We rate it Mostly True.\n      Share The Facts  Rick ScottFlorida governor     \"Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes.\"  in a press release \u2013 Wednesday, April 13, 2016  ShareRead more   Embed", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05052"}
