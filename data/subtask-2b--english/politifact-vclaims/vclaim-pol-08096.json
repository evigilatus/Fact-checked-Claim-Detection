We didn\u2019t quite anticipate a conversation about clean water with Matt Damon.\nOr a startling statistic worth fact-checking. How do you like them apples? (Sorry, we couldn\u2019t resist.)\nDamon appeared on ABC\u2019s This Week to discuss the serious issue of clean water scarcity in developing countries, a plight he has personally sought to impact through the charity he co-founded, Water.org.\n\"Every 20 seconds, a child dies because they lack access to clean water and sanitation,\" Damon said. \"Every 20 seconds, three kids every minute somewhere on planet Earth. Not here. Our kids aren't going to die from diarrhea. That's just an inconvenience to us in the West. But it is a stark, terrifying reality to billions of people on the planet.\"\nOne child dying every 20 seconds amounts to 4,320 deaths every day, or roughly 1.5 million deaths a year. It\u2019s a jarring statistic, but is it accurate? We decided to investigate.\nWe reached out to Water.org to see if they had source material to back up Damon\u2019s stat. We didn\u2019t hear back.\nBut we did find the number on their website. There, the organization put the figure at one death every 21 seconds.\nWater.org cited research from UNICEF and the World Health Organization, and a report released by the two agencies in 2009. It paints a pretty stark picture of the issue.\nDue to poor sanitation conditions in much of the developing world, millions of people are risking their health virtually every time they take a sip of water. Infection in the intestinal tract from tainted water often leads to diarrhea, defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day. It can last days or weeks, and if persistent can cause death due to fluid loss. Young children are especially at risk because of their weaker immune systems.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, there are 2.5 billion (yes, that\u2019s billion with a \"b\") cases of diarrhea every year in children under the age of five. It\u2019s the second leading cause of child deaths in the world after pneumonia, taking the lives \"more young children than AIDS, malaria and measles combined,\" it says. Half the cases are in South Asia and Africa.\nJust how many lives does it take? The report put the total at 1.5 million. Water.org on their website acknowledged that this statistic \u2013 deaths from diarrhea among children under five \u2013 is the number they used to claim a death every 20 seconds.\nSo that\u2019s where the figure comes from.\nBut it\u2019s outdated, we found.\nThe report came out in 2009, but it was referencing World Health Organization statistics from 2004. There has actually been considerable adavancement since then, in part because of an international effort to improve sanitation and hygiene awareness in developing countries.\nMore recently, the World Health Organization has estimated deaths from diarrhea have fallen to about 760,000 a year, half of what it was less than a decade ago. UNICEF has cited the newer statistic as well, as does the Center for Disease Control in the United States.\nThat would mean a child dies every 40 seconds from water-related illness. Still a harrowing statistic, but not quite what Damon said.\nOur ruling\nDamon said, \"Every 20 seconds, a child dies because they lack access to clean water and sanitation.\" The Bourne series star appears to be using an outdated statistic in his ABC appearance that claimed 1.5 million deaths from diarrhea caused by tainted water. More recent reports put the number at about 760,000 deaths a year.\nThat said, Damon is accurately highlighting a little-known problem to an American audience. The statement ignores subsequent improvements but does not give viewers a different impression of the seriousness of the issue.
