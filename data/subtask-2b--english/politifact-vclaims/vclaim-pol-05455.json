Rob Portman, a Republican, for embracing the agreement as U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush while criticizing the auto bailout.\n\"With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a \u2018proven success,\u2019 \" the post says. \"With 160,000 auto jobs saved, Portman called the auto rescue a \u2018lousy deal.\u2019 \"\n\nThe attack about lost jobs from NAFTA sounded a lot like\u00a0an attack PolitiFact Ohio\u00a0checked out in the 2010 governor\u2019s race against Republican John Kasich. Strickland\u2019s campaign blamed NAFTA for a loss of 49,000 jobs to Mexico and 91,000 to China. (Kasich, of course, won the gubernatorial election and is now running for president. And Strickland\u2019s claim rated\u00a0False.)\nWe wanted to know if NAFTA really killed a net 320,000 Ohio manufacturing jobs.\nNAFTA took effect Jan. 1, 1994, with the intent to smooth importing and exporting between Canada, the United States and Mexico. The deal is a big issue in Ohio, home to unions that are typically among NAFTA\u2019s fiercest critics. Unions argue that trade deals like NAFTA send American jobs overseas.\nPortman indeed called NAFTA a \"proven success\" when he was the U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush in a 2006 news\u00a0release. The news release didn\u2019t say anything about lost jobs, though, so we kept digging. \u00a0\nStrickland campaign spokesman David Bergstein confirmed that they sourced their data from the Washington-based think tank\u00a0Public Citizen, founded by activist and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader.\u00a0The data behind their findings, accessed Aug. 11, 2015, come partly from another left-leaning think tank, the\u00a0Economic Policy Institute, and the nonpartisan, federal\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLee Fisher\n\n\nstated on July 12, 2010 in a campaign statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRob Portman\u2019s \"plan to tax, slash and privatize\" Social Security \"would devastate Ohioans.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Stephen Koff \u2022 July 28, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the report, Public Citizen claims, \"Ohio has endured a net loss of more than 323,000 manufacturing jobs \u2013 one out of every three \u2013 since the 1994 NAFTA and the World Trade Organization agreements took effect.\" (The group has since reduced the figure of 323,000 jobs lost to 307,000\u00a0in a revised version.)\nBut then, the report acknowledges that only some of those lost jobs are directly tied to overseas trade. \"More than 139,000 specific Ohio jobs have been certified under the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program as lost to offshoring or imports since NAFTA,\" the report says. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program, part of the Department of Labor, provides federal aid to manufacturers who can prove that they lost revenue due to import policies like NAFTA.\nSubtracting the TAA-certified number of net jobs lost due to trade agreements -- 139,000 -- from the original figure of 323,000 jobs, leaves 184,000 jobs that were lost for reasons the report doesn\u2019t, or can\u2019t, explain.\nIn fact, one of the sources cited in the Public Citizen report, the BLS, reports that in the first quarter of 2004, 10 years after NAFTA went into effect, just 4,633 of 239,361 private sector non-farm layoffs can be \"associated with movement of work outside of the country.\"\nEconomists say that other factors \u2013 say, a global economic downturn rivaling the Great Depression \u2013 also contribute to job losses. Ohio\u2019s dip in employment was part of a nationwide trend from 2008 to 2011, when unemployment doubled from 5 to 10 percent.\nTom Sutton, political science professor at Baldwin Wallace University, says that Wall Street has much more to do with the recession and associated job losses than NAFTA. Unemployment surged \"largely due to the collapse of financial markets following the failure of risky bundled mortgage investments.\"\nEconomists have also noted that shifts in employment in sectors like manufacturing or agriculture could also be attributed to technological breakthroughs that created jobs in some sectors and cost jobs in others, like when machines replace humans on the assembly line.\nIn other words, the effects of NAFTA can\u2019t be measured without considering all the other forces pushing and pulling the state\u2019s economy. So noted the Congressional Research Service in its 2004 report about\u00a0NAFTA 10 years out, which concludes, \"NAFTA had little or no impact on aggregate employment.\"\nOur ruling\nStrickland said, \"With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a \u2018proven success.\u2019 \"\nThe implication that NAFTA is solely responsible is a gross oversimplification of a very complex economic phenomenon. Just as one politician\u2019s four-year term can\u2019t be the sole cause of over a quarter-million lost jobs, the NAFTA trade deal isn\u2019t wholly to blame either. We rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/30400ee4-9c39-4d56-9f80-da4d5c23ec3d", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05455"}
