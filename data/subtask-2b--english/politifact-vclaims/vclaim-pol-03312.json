Later that day, Clapper directly contradicted Trump\u2019s claim in a TV interview.\nHere\u2019s why Trump\u2019s take is misleading.\nTrump mischaracterizes Clapper\u2019s statement\nTrump appears to be referring to Clapper\u2019s statement in a Meet The Press interview March 5 that he had no knowledge of improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\nTwo months earlier, Clapper\u2019s office released a report that expressed with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered with the U.S. presidential election in favor of Trump. As Clapper stated in his interview, however, the report did not include evidence of collusion. Chuck Todd of NBC asked him about that.\nTodd: \"Does intelligence exist that can definitively answer the following question, whether there were improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials?\"\nClapper: \"We did not include any evidence in our report, and I say, \u2018our,\u2019 that's NSA, FBI and CIA, with my office, the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything, that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report.\"\nTodd: \"I understand that. But does it exist?\"\nClapper: \"Not to my knowledge.\"\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.,\u00a0quoted Clapper\u2019s exchange on Meet The Press in a May 8 Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and asked if it was still accurate. Clapper responded, \"It is.\"\nThat prompted Trump to issue the following tweet:\nDirector Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is \"no evidence\" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017\n\nIn his May 12 tweet, Trump referenced the judgment of \"virtually everyone else\" with knowledge.\nBut some officials with knowledge of the FBI\u2019s Russia probe have publicly declined to say there\u2019s no evidence of collusion, citing ongoing investigations.\nDuring a March 20 hearing on Russian interference in 2016 election, recently ousted FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Admiral\u00a0Mike Rogers refused to comment when asked specifically about whether the Trump campaign cooperated with Moscow.\nBut when asked in general terms about whether or not any evidence exists, Comey explained that a case of this nature would have to reach a certain evidentiary threshold, and be considered high priority, before the bureau launched an investigation.\nComey described the standard as, \"a credible allegation of wrongdoing or reasonable basis to believe that an American may be acting as an agent of a foreign power.\" He added the central focus of the investigation would also have to align with \"threats that the FBI is trying to prioritize (under) limited resources.\"\nClapper: 'I don\u2019t know if there was collusion or not'\nAsked about Trump\u2019s tweet in a May 12 interview on MSNBC, Clapper explained that the director of national intelligence position would not necessarily offer a vantage point into FBI evidence.\nClapper said that in his more than six years as DNI, he regularly deferred to the FBI when a counterintelligence investigation could possibly morph into a criminal investigation.\n\"That was certainly the practice I followed here,\" he said of the FBI\u2019s ongoing Russia investigation. \"So it\u2019s not surprising or abnormal that I would not have known about the investigation, or even more importantly, the content of that investigation.\n\"So I don\u2019t know if there was collusion or not,\" added Clapper, who resigned at the end of President Barack Obama\u2019s term.\nLater in the interview, Clapper was asked if he agrees with Trump that the Russian investigation is a \"witch hunt,\" to which he replied, \"I don\u2019t believe it is.\"\nInstead, Clapper compared it to a \"dark cloud\" that would continue to linger until the investigation is complete.\n\"What needs to happen here is to clear this cloud that\u2019s hanging over the administration, over the president, the White House,\" he said. \"It would be in everyone\u2019s best interest to get to the bottom of this.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?\"\nSome of the public statements by those with knowledge of the FBI investigation do not support Trump\u2019s claim that \"virtually everyone\" privy to the probe says there\u2019s no evidence of collusion. While Comey has not described specific evidence, he has confirmed that sufficient credible information exists for the FBI to consider the Russia probe a high enough priority to warrant an investigation.\nAs for Clapper\u2019s statement, it\u2019s apparent Trump has twisted the former DNI\u2019s words to make it appear as if he\u2019s ruled out the possibility that evidence exists showing the Trump campaign colluded with Russian interlopers during the 2016 election. But Clapper\u2019s statement was that he had no knowledge of collusion -- not that collusion didn\u2019t occur. Clapper has since stated that his capacity as DNI would not necessarily give him the kind of access to the FBI investigation that one would need in order to determine whether or not evidence of collusion exists.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-12 21:21:41 UTC   Politifact    4 1 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly False  Says James Clapper \"and virtually everyone else\" said \"there is no collusion\" in the Russia investigation findings    Donald Trump President   Twitter Friday, May 12, 2017 2017-05-12    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03312"}
