Recently, she made a bold statement on women in the working world. \nIn a Sept. 18 speech at a roundtable on women's economic security in Washington, she said women make up two-thirds of minimum wage workers.\nThe former secretary of state went on to claim those women are left \"at the mercy of employers.\" \n\"Without equal pay, without flexibility or predictability at work, without access to quality, affordable childcare, without (the) ability to take a day off if your child or aging parent is sick, without paid family or medical leave,\" Clinton said. \"This woman is really on the brink.\" \nWe wondered if her figures were right. Could women really make up that large a share of minimum wage workers? \nA look at the numbers \nWe contacted the Clinton campaign, and it pointed to a report published by the National Women's Law Center in May 2015 for a bulk of its evidence. The report presents highlights and statistical tables describing minimum wage workers in 2014. \nThe report found that women represent close to but not quite two-thirds of minimum wage workers across the country, and at least half of minimum wage workers in every state. The center looked at unpublished U.S. Labor Department data for all wage and salary workers for 2014. \nEstimates from the study put 1.9 million women workers at or below minimum wage out of 2.9 million total \u2013 about 62.7 percent \u2013 age 16 and older. \nThis represents an increase of 0.4 percent from 62.3 in 2013, the report said.\nWhen we went to the department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics to verify the figures for ourselves, we found out that only 59 percent of workers actually making the federal minimum wage are women. That\u2019s because some workers, like those who earn tips, can legally be paid a lower wage. \nClinton has stressed her proposals would also result in a raise for those tipped workers \u2013 such as restaurant servers and bartenders. \n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Women hold nearly three-quarters of the jobs that are reliant on tips,\" she said. \nIn addition, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour would leave a single mother below the poverty line. While 29 states and the District of Columbia currently have higher minimum wages, the center found that in every one of those states, the minimum wage leaves a full-time worker with two children near or below the poverty level. \nBut what does it mean? \nEconomists say the claim raises another question: Who will benefit if the minimum wage is increased? \nData from the liberal Economic Policy Institute, show that 55.9 percent of those who would receive a raise under Clinton\u2019s proposal are women. That\u2019s a solid majority, but well below two-thirds.\nChris Tilly, director of the UCLA Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, said that makes Clinton\u2019s statement misleading.\nUniversity of Iowa Associate Professor of Political Science Timothy Hagle said that Clinton\u2019s claim may fall under campaign hyperbole.\nHe said the data used by the Clinton campaign is filled with qualifiers, such as \"about\" and \"nearly,\" that make it difficult to check concrete calculations.\n\"(The law center report) gives Clinton a bit of an out in that she can inflate her comment based on this data,\" Hagle said. \"Rather than that of some other entity.\"\nOur ruling \nClinton said, \"Women hold two-thirds of minimum wage jobs.\" \nHer campaign referred us to a credible May 2015 study that supports her claim. According to the study, 62.7 percent of minimum wage workers age 16 and older are women. \u00a0That\u2019s almost, but not quite, two thirds.\nIn addition, that study ignored complexities like minimum wage workers in places that have a higher wage already and who would benefit from changes relating to tips.\nClinton is largely on point with her numbers.
