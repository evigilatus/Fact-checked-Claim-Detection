Michelle Nan describes democracy as a problem-solving and consensus-building solution from her leadership at points of light, a non-profit volunteer group. The Republican Party David Birdo highlights his assumption of the post of Executive Director with 500 Fortune Corporations for the expertise needed to address the problems of the free market in Washington. In her first round of ads, Nan aims to sharpen this distinction by criticizing her opponent's experience. The announcement says: \"In Georgia, Birdo shut down the factories and transferred jobs to China.\" Since the winner of the Senate race would help determine the party that would control the Congress, Politi Fakt Georgia decided to dig into the claim. In order to do so, we have to jump back to a time of Internet connection and grammatical music at the top of the graphs. This was in 1992 when Birdo was appointed Senior Vice-President of Sarah Lee. Polyte Fact told the company that he had been sent to Hong Kong for two years to increase manufacturing and contracts in Asia. \"I've been sent to Asia to open those markets to Sarah Lee, and we did,\" said Birdo. \"This was the company's direction at the time.\" The effort by Birdo to open the area to Sarah Lee was successful, as was the company at the time. Sarah Lee was founded in 1939 as a food processing and distribution company. Her code name came from the purchase of Sarah Lee's kitchens in 1956, a Chicago bakery known as his cheese pie. Roy Barnes mentioned on May 21, 2010 in an advertising campaign when Roy Barnes was governor, \"Georgia created 235,000 jobs.\" \u2022 4 June 2010 in the early 1990s, however, Sara Lee expanded around the world and in other industries with the purchase of Hans and trained leather goods, among other things. Over the first three years of the contract, the company quickly boasted more quickly, with a focus on foreign companies and other well-known brands such as Blitx Underwear, yet investors began to question the company &apos; s broad vision. The result was the first of several major restructuring and demobilization plans in 1994, the last of which was Birdo with Sara Lee. The 1994 reform resulted in the abolition of 9,900 jobs worldwide, while the \"establishment of production and distribution facilities worldwide\" according to the SEC files. The victims included 540 jobs in clothing factories in Cartersville, Mildgeville and Ritesville. A fourth factory in Georgia in Midway was also closed, although the number of lost jobs was not deployed. The annual Sara Lee report of 1994 does not detail the number of 144,900 employees who were local or foreign. However, a statement issued by the company at that time stated that most of the jobs that had been abolished were in European operations. The annual report notes the success of the company in manufacturing and sales in Asia, particularly in China, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong, which is now part of China. \"David Birdo says he's the best candidate because he spent his career in the real world, but in many stops along the way, he seemed to thrive while the people who worked for him With all the indicators, outsourcing efforts in Sara Lee have had that effect. The company expanded its manufacture and sale in Asia, while closing facilities elsewhere, including Georgia. In his capacity as Senior Vice-President, Birdo had only a limited contribution to make in this direction. However, he carried out Sarah Lee &apos; s efforts, which were commended by the company in its annual report to the federal regulatory bodies. Nun &apos; s claim was carefully worded as stating that Birdo, not the candidate himself, was closing Georgia &apos; s factories at a time when it was adding jobs in Asia. News reports and company files support the claim We appreciate Nan's claim.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07350"}
