The project has also received a limited supply of federal dollars.\nIncreasingly, however, the California High-Speed Rail Authority has looked to the private sector for help. This summer, the authority asked businesses to offer financial advice and ideas on how to make the venture more efficient. It allowed the authority to gauge private investment interest.\nMore than 30 companies responded. None pledged any funds, though the rail authority\u2019s solicitation said it was asking only for advice, not money.\nSoon after, Assemblyman Jim Patterson, R-Fresno, told the LA Times in a November news article: The rail authority has \"failed to disclose huge cost overruns and after they boasted private firms were interested in funding this project, we now know these firms are unwilling to put up any private money.\"\nWe decided to focus on his claim that the private sector is \"unwilling to put up any private money.\"\nHe\u2019s made similar statements elsewhere, including to a TV news station in Fresno.\n\nKSEE TV Fresno\u00a0interview with Assemblyman Jim Patterson, Nov. 1, 2015\n\u00a0\nWas Patterson right? Did the responses amount to corporations writing off the bullet train as a bad investment?\nWe decided to check the facts.\nOur research\nFirst stop: A look at the role the private sector was expected to play when Californians voted for the high-speed rail network in 2008.\nDan Richard, chairman of the rail authority, told us this month that the authority originally envisioned private funds paying about one-third of the project\u2019s cost. It\u2019s expected companies would invest their own capital to build, operate and maintain large portions of it -- once an initial government-funded Merced-to-Burbank segment opened in 2022 and showed strong ridership and revenue.\nLanguage in the ballot measure approved by voters requires the authority to seek private funds to cover the project\u2019s cost, though it does not specify what percentage.\nRichard said the state still plans on private funds covering about one-third of the cost. Connecting the network from San Francisco to Los Angeles depends on it, he added.\nRichard also recently said opening the initial operating segment in 2022 could be delayed. The project broke ground in January in Fresno.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s really no question about interest from the private sector,\" Richard added. \"The only question is when that money comes in.\"\nChallenges ahead\nThe rail project continues to face numerous legal and financial challenges and has lost voter support in recent years. Cost projections have seesawed from $33 billion to nearly $100 billion, and most recently to $68 billion.\nPatterson\u2019s statement about a lack of private funds raises a key concern. Responses from many private firms mirrored those by Madrid-based Acciona. It said it was \"concerned about the financial market capacity to raise the required capital\" unless the project\u2019s contracts are broken into smaller pieces.\nMany also said they need a revenue guarantee from the state to reduce their investment risk. That\u2019s prohibited by the law voters passed in 2008, though Richard has said such guarantees won\u2019t be necessary once the project can demonstrate strong ridership.\nThe proposed rail network would be one of California\u2019s largest ever public works project, and the first high-speed rail system in the United States.\nEarly stages\nStill, rail authority leaders, members of the private sector and the head of the project\u2019s oversight panel all said it\u2019s much too early to conclude the private sector has given up on high-speed rail.\n\"We\u2019re only at that very first stage where the authority has asked for expressions of interest, not (funding) proposals,\" said Stephen Polechronis, a senior vice president at AECOM, one of the private firms that responded to the rail authority\u2019s request for advice.\nMichael Cahill of Siemens Industry, another firm that responded, told the Sacramento Bee recently: \"We didn\u2019t propose anything concrete in terms of private money going in, because there wasn\u2019t an opportunity to do that. Which doesn\u2019t mean we wouldn\u2019t be interested. Quite the opposite.\" The company confirmed those comments, but declined our request to elaborate.\nNo one is saying the private sector will soon jump onboard with gobs of cash. They are waiting and watching to see if the rail authority can successfully start the project and eliminate financial risks, said Louis Thompson, chairman of the California High Speed Rail Peer Review Group, an independent oversight group that issues reports to the Legislature on the project.\n\"What the private sector has said,\" added Thompson, a retired federal rail administrator, \"is that it is not willing to take many of the risks that the project would entail as of now.\"\nThompson said the claim by Patterson, the Fresno lawmaker, about the private sector being unwilling to fund the project \"isn\u2019t strictly correct.\"\nA spokeswoman for Patterson said the lawmaker stands behind the statement. She pointed to recent news articles that outline private sector concerns with the project.\nOur ruling\nAssemblyman Jim Patterson said this month: \"We now know these firms are unwilling to put up any private money.\" He was referring to the more than 30 companies that submitted financial advice to the rail authority, without offering any funding.\nMany of those companies identified financial concerns, including the need to reduce the size of the project\u2019s contracts and guarantee revenue. But Patterson does not mention that the rail authority\u2019s request was for advice, not money. And we simply don\u2019t \"know\" how willing those companies will be once a formal funding request is made.\nSome of the firms that responded, along with rail authority leaders and the head of the project\u2019s independent oversight panel, all said it\u2019s too early to conclude the private sector has given up on the project. Patterson\u2019s statement implies they already have.\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.\u00a0\n\nMOSTLY FALSE\u00a0\u2013 The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\u00a0\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05692"}
