That's basically true.", "text": "In the lead-up to a storming meeting of the Group of Seven from advanced industrialized nations, President Donald Trump addressed a specific trade policy of the host country of the meeting, Canada. In fact, he tweeted four times over four days, culminating in a gossip about \"the trade of fools.\" Objective: Canadian trade barriers on imported milk. On June 8, Trump tweeted, \"Canada charges the U.S. 270% tariff on dairy products! They didn't tell you that, did they? That's not fair to our farmers!\" These are the other three tweets. Canada imposes a 270% tariff on dairy products on the United States! They didn't tell you that, did they? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) June 8, 2018 has a point of view, although he ignored some important contexts. The White House did not respond to the request for comment. For decades, Canada has been protecting its dairy industry, creating trade barriers that limit foreign competition and lead to higher prices for Canadian consumers. While this has raised long-standing complaints on the part of the United States and other exporters, definitions have remained in place, partly because there is a strong Albanian lobby that Canadian politicians hated to oppose. After reaching a small fixed share of United States exports, Canada imposes a tariff on any dairy products coming into the country, with a slightly different level depending on the specific product. For example, liquid milk is 241 per cent, cheese is 245.5 per cent, ice cream is 277 per cent, cream is 292.5 per cent, butter is 298.5 per cent. The experts said that Trump's tweet was a reasonable medium-term estimate, and given the magnitude of these definitions, \"Trap's complaints are in fact well founded,\" said Monroe Eagles, Director of Canadian Studies at New York-Buffalo State University. This was not news, as Dan Trefler said, a professor at the Rutman School of Management at the University of Toronto. \"Did the tariff rise over time or become more restrictive over the past few decades? No, \"Trifler said. Not all news was bleak for the United States on the Canadian Albanian Front. In recent years, dairy producers in the United States have used technological advances to exploit a profitable gap in Canadian commercial law. They started to separate milk into parts of it, creating so-called \"polluted milk.\" These are high in protein and easy to use to make cheese and yogurt. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, since this product did not exist when the last negotiations were completed, it falls outside the list of high-tariff products. So in recent years, American producers have sold a large amount of salted milk to Canada, without customs duties. Canada is the second largest market for American dairy exports after Mexico. Between 2013 and 2016, United States exports from \"milk proteins\" to Canada increased from Can$ 78 million to $129 million. The United States accounted for two thirds of all Canadian imports of this type. Thanks to these exports, the United States has already recorded a significant trade surplus with Canada in dairy products in recent years. In 2016, the United States exported $631.6 million in dairy products to Canada, compared with only $113 million in Canadian dairy exports to the United States (these figures are in United States dollars). Part of the reason for the low levels of Canadian dairy exports is that the World Trade Organization (WTO) has ruled that Canada provides effective support to its dairy producers, making exports more difficult. This U.S. trade surplus \" certainly helped balance any pain caused by Canada's total dairy exemptions,\" the eagles said. Despite these complaints, the United States has long accepted Canada &apos; s high tariffs as a price for wider access to the Canadian market. Similarly, the United States has protected some of the goods it produces for export. \"In recent multilateral negotiations, Canada agreed to set its tariffs on dairy and poultry at high levels, but agreed to do so, as the United States did on products such as peanuts, tobacco and sugar,\" said Michael Hart, a trade policy specialist at Carlton University in Canada. \"As good as these agreements are, the level of protection of some agricultural products remains outrageous, but legal. If Trump wants to cut them down, he has to negotiate.\" There had recently been a change in Canadian policy, which said that Canadian Albanian interests had resisted a policy that encouraged the use of local sources of milk for high-protein materials. In 2017, United States exports of milk protein to Canada fell by about half. The change in Canadian policy on voltage milk \"is a project concern for dairy exporters in the United States,\" said Monica de Paul, a senior colleague at the Peterson Institute of International Economics. In the end, neither side has fully clean hands on this issue. \"In view of local political concerns and the strength of agricultural pressure groups in Canada and the United States, there is nothing like free trade just as now in agriculture,\" said Ross Burkhart, a political scientist specializing in relations between the United States and Canada at Boise State University. \"Each country can refer to the protection of each other if they wish.\" On Twitter, Trump wrote: \"Canada charges the United States a 270% tariff on dairy products! They didn't tell you that, did they? That's not fair to our farmers!\" This figure is a reasonable estimate of the definitions of dairy in Canada, which is high by any standard. However, the United States has recently achieved a large trade surplus with Canada in dairy products, driven by strong businesses in a milk product that has not been affected by high tariffs. Trump also ignores the fact that the United States imposes its own trade barriers on some American manufactured products. The statement is essentially precise, but it needs to be clarified, so we often evaluate it correctly.
