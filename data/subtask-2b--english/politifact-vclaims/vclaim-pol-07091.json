Nathan Deal has accused Democratic challenger Jason Carter of lacking the political chops for the job.\nDuring two recent debates, Deal asked Carter why he never assumed even minor leadership roles as a state senator or sponsored a successful bill in his tenure under the Gold Dome.\n\"You\u2019ve been in the (state) Senate since I\u2019ve been governor, and you\u2019ve never passed a bill,\" Deal said in the Oct. 7 debate at the Georgia National Fair. \"Why would anybody decide you have the leadership skills needed to lead this state?\"\nPolitiFact decided to delve deeper into Deal\u2019s claim that Carter never passed a bill.\nCarter, an attorney and a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, was elected in May 2010 to replace state Sen. David Adelman of Atlanta, who resigned to become the U.S. ambassador to Singapore.\nA few months later, Deal, a longtime congressman, was elected to succeed Sonny Perdue, Georgia\u2019s first Republican governor since Reconstruction.\nNow, Carter, 39, is hoping to unseat Deal, 72, in the Nov. 4 general election. A loss for Deal would be a major upset for Republicans who have been solidly in control at the Capitol for about a decade.\nBut what about the governor\u2019s claim?\nA search of the Georgia General Assembly\u2019s records shows Deal is correct.\nIn four years in the state Senate, Carter was primary sponsor of 11 bills, more than half dealing with the popular HOPE scholarship or other education issues. None of the bills became law and only one cleared the state Senate.\nBut is it a sign that he was an ineffective lawmaker?\nThere\u2019s no proof of that.\nDemocrats are in the minority in the General Assembly and so are rarely able to pass legislation. (The same was true for Republicans until, starting with Perdue, the state took a 180-degree turn politically.)\nSteve Anthony, a lecturer in the political science department at Georgia State University, said it\u2019s \"common\" that the party with an absolute majority banishes the minority to near irrelevance.\nHe should know. He was the longtime chief of staff to Tom Murphy, a Democrat who at the time was the nation\u2019s longest-serving state House speaker.\n\"Many Republicans would say they are doing just what Tom Murphy used to do to them,\" Anthony said. \"It\u2019s a game. It\u2019s what\u2019s done in politics, at least on the state level.\"\nThere\u2019s one more point to consider: getting a bill passed and signed is not all that easy, regardless of party.\nIn the 2011 and 2012 legislative sessions, members of the House and Senate introduced 2,514 bills. Of those, only 774 passed, and 757 became law.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the successful bills emerge from the leadership, Anthony said.\nThat leaves the bulk of rank-and-file lawmakers, including Carter, to end up as co-sponsors to legislation.\nCo-sponsoring is the act of a lawmaker attaching his or her name to a pending proposal to show support or backing.\nAnd in that capacity, Carter found some success. The Atlanta Democrat co-sponsored 21 bills that became law, records show.\nIn some cases, members of the minority party co-sponsor bills that are their idea but require a member from the party in charge to be the official sponsor to get the measure passed.\nWhether a lawmaker has been a bill\u2019s co-sponsor can be a serious question for voters.\nBut, to Deal\u2019s point, snagging co-sponsors often has little to no impact on whether a bill gets passed.\nCase in point: State Rep. Mark Hatfield got 93 of the 180 members in the House to co-sponsor his 2011 proposal that would force presidential and vice presidential candidates to prove their citizenship before landing on the Georgia ballot.\nThe bill, inspired by the \"birther\" movement, which believes President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, ultimately lost more than 25 of those backers and failed to move to a floor vote.\nThere have recently been high-profile exceptions to the significance of co-sponsors, such as Deal\u2019s effort to revamp the HOPE scholarship program with House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, an Atlanta Democrat.\nFew Democrats are able to earn that sort of recognition.\nMore common, Anthony said, would be a tactic long used when a good idea surfaces.\nIf the proposal is from the opposition, the majority hijacks the idea and makes some changes to qualify it as a new bill \u2013 and takes the credit.\nCarter, a staunch critic of changes Deal made to the HOPE scholarship program, says that happened to him in 2013. He was concerned that tech school students were being hurt by a decision to raise the GPA requirement for HOPE recipients from a 2.0 to a 3.0.\nHe and a House Democrat introduced separate bills to return to the lower GPA requirement. Their bills went nowhere. But their idea caught on and emerged in an almost identical and successful bill with a Republican as chief sponsor.\n\"It's definitely harder to pass a bill in the minority. It takes time and it takes working with the opposition -- something that younger legislators probably haven't accomplished yet,\" said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University.\nDeal, he said, is trying to say something about Carter\u2019s relative youth and inexperience.\"You just got here, and already you want to be governor?\"\nOur conclusion: Deal is right. Jason Carter hasn\u2019t been the chief author of a bill that\u2019s made it through the General Assembly. But that\u2019s a fate most out-of-power Democrats face, as did Republicans in the decades they were in the same boat. That\u2019s context the reader needs.\nWe rate the statement as Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07091"}
