Recent reports have assisted him in the \"Karavan scandal,\" where one of the headlines describes allegations that Aurourc is illegally using campaign resources to assist Honduran migrants. \"Mr. O'Rourke's open border - who called for amnesty - has staff who are helping the convoy coming to our border,\" reads a story published in Patriot Journal in November. \"The money collected to help Aurourke elect is used to finance immigrants. This clearly violates the campaign's funding laws.\" This story was highlighted as part of Facebook &apos; s efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The crowd data show that they were shared on Facebook more than 16,000 times on election day. On its website, there is no contact information on Patriot Journal, and the bulletin did not immediately respond to Facebook requesting further information on its story. However, it appears that her claim stems from a video on YouTube in November by the Veritas project, an organization that makes hidden videos of its objectives, including media organizations. (Patrio's video magazine has been incorporated into its story.) A 24-minute video entitled: \"No one needs to know: Peto's campaign seems to be illegally spending money on foreign vehicle supplies,\" shows segments of campaign staff talking about buying food and riding cars for immigrants. \"For me, I can ignore the rules,\" says the field manager near the beginning. \"I don't mind breaking the rules and I can defend any situation.\" \"Don't ever repeat this, but, for example, if we say we're buying food for the campaign event, like Halloween, because there's a blocked walk coming on Halloween,\" a field organizer goes on record saying a few moments later. When Veritas' secret project employee says, \"I know we're using some campaign resources to help immigrants as if I didn't want anyone to get in trouble though, and I didn't want them to ask me any questions about people who use resources,\" O'Rourke's campaign manager says, \"Don't worry.\" Then James O'Keefe, the conservative activist behind the Veritas project, shows the El Paso newspaper to explain to the viewers what videos mean. \"The videos you're about to see show the Bitto campaign workers and his employees along the way to his campaign manager, Jody Casey, who knowingly uses the campaign's resources and funds to help support illegal foreigners entering the United States, some of whom are from the immigration convoy,\" says O'Keefe. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in the Facebook newspaper Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. He says, \"Some of them have already arrived here and are delivering them as if they were very close to Missouri.\" == sync, corrected by elderman == (Misuri is the name of a street in El Paso.) The employee says the immigrants are the Hondurans. In response to an e-mail seeking further information on the allegations, the Orrick campaign transmitted this statement from Nov 2: \"Ted Cruz has shamedly suggested that the Beto Campaign for Texas used campaign dollars to finance a convoy still hundreds of miles from the United States-Mexico border.\" The campaign also referred to the Polyte Fact newspaper for two news stories in the Texas Tribune and the El Paso Times. Tribeon's story, published online Nov 2, reports that the campaign says that employees \"take it on themselves\" recently to use campaign funds to donate supplies to El Paso is not profitable. The campaign said that contributions, totalling less than $300, would be \"appropriately communicated\" to the Federal Electoral Commission, according to the story. According to the Aurourke campaign, employees were responding to an irrelevant situation where the Federal Government left more than 100 immigrants seeking asylum at a bus station in the centre of El Paso, Tribion reports. The El Paso Times reported in November 2 that Chris Evans, campaign spokesman, said that employees used prepaid credit cards to purchase \"Proscriptions, diapers, water, fruit and granola bars\" and donated them to the advertising house, a non-profit institution that supports migrants. But it is not illegal to donate campaign funds to a non-profit person as long as the parties adhere to this rule: the organization cannot compensate the candidate - if it will ever do so - before using or spending the contribution in full, according to the Federal Electoral Commission. In other words, a donation cannot benefit the candidate personally. Tripion also spoke to the campaign finance expert, Paul S. Ryan, with the government watch group on the common cause. He told the publication that unless contributions were improperly reported to the Federal Electoral Commission, they did not violate any laws. So that's what we know: although the campaign worker talks in the video about helping Honduran immigrants, describing them as members of the convoy of immigrants who recently arrived in El Paso, the convoy was hundreds of miles from Nov 5. According to the campaign, employees used funds to assist immigrants seeking asylum in the United States. The pronunciation house, where the campaign reported that the goods had been donated, assisted families released from federal detention centres after checking their background and fingerprints, according to El Paso Times. However, although \"employees show awareness that what they do is inappropriate, or at least can be seen as inappropriate,\" the campaign does not appear to be contrary to the law unless they fail to properly report their contributions to the Federal Electoral Commission. We classify this term as wrong.
