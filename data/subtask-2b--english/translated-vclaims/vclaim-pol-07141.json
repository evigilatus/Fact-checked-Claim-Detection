At some point in the debate, Ernest compared \"Washington, D.C., roads\" with \"Iowa's values.\" She referred to \"the records of failure coming from this administration, and followers like Congressman Braly, as opposed to our values in Iowa and the way we've been running business for the past four years. With the supporters of the Good, (Republican Government) Terry Brannstadt, we've implemented a strong economic policy here in Iowa -- lower taxes, reduced job systems, and a balanced budget, Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States, while at the national level, real wages have declined over the past eight years that Congressman Braley has been there by 2.7 per cent.\" But we wondered: Is her statistical comparison between Iowa and the United States correct? We've had a good look. (Ernest's query campaign did not respond.) Iowa has the fourth fastest personal income growing in the United States. In the first part of the claim, Ernest has a point, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is the official source of the Federal Government &apos; s personal income data. In the last quarter of the year, for which data are currently available - the second quarter of 2014 - personal income in Iowa increased by 2.4 per cent compared to the previous quarter in Iowa. Only three states grew faster - Nebraska (2.7 per cent), North Dakota (2.7 per cent) and Idaho (2.5 per cent). However, some context diminishes the importance of this achievement. The statistics for these short periods of time tend to be \"foggy\" -- that is, the numbers fluctuate a lot. For example, let's look at the quadratic statistics before increasing the 2.4 percent. Moving back a quarter, personal income growth in Iowa was 0.6 percent, 0.5 percent, 1.0 percent, 0.0 percent, and -0.2 percent. This paints a very different picture of personal income growth in Iowa. To effectively detect real trends, you need to study a longer period of time. Let's take a look at how Iowa works for periods of the whole year instead of quarters. Between the full year 2012 and the full year 2013, Iowa experienced the highest 18 per cent change in personal income between the 50 states, which is slightly weaker than the fourth-level termination of Ernest. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy: January 20, 2021, Iowa was worse between 2011 and 2012, when the country ranked 43rd at the national level. This is also a completely different picture from the one that I drew in the debate. At the national level, real wages have declined over the past eight years... by 2.7 per cent. Not if you look at the average weekly earnings of full-time and paid workers. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, the average national weekly wage in 2013 - the last full year available - was $776, from $671 in 2008. As soon as the 2006 inflation figure was adjusted in dollars in 2013, it worked to be $775.37 -- basically there was no change at all between 2006 and 2013. This is almost the same if I adjust inflation data for 2005 - there is no significant change in average weekly income between 2005 and 2013. \"What I always say when writing about wage developments, at least after the number of working Americans began to rise again in 2010, is that real wages are essentially fixed,\" said Gary Bertellis, an economist with the Brookings Institution. At the same time, the comparison offered by Ernest - which represents strong growth in the state of Iowa in the midst of the national recession - is flawed for two reasons. \u2022 Compared with two different statistics. Personal income and real wages are not the same. Real wages are an element of personal income, but they are not the only ones. It is derived from separate data sources and uses very different methodologies. \u2022 Compared to two different periods of time. You simply can't compare the last quarter to the last eight years and get a meaningful contradiction. It's a comparison of apples and oranges. This is all being said, Ernest has a point of view: real wages have grown faster in Iowa over the past eight years and then at the national level. If the clock starts in 2005, real wages in Iowa have increased by 1.6 per cent by 2013, and if the clock starts in 2006, it has increased by 1.8 per cent by 2013. She also has the point that the stagnation of real income growth over eight years is nothing to be proud of, even if she puts too much blame on this situation on Berley. \u2022 (Groups of factors constituting the economy beyond just one member of the minority party in Congress). Governor Ernest said that \"Iowa has the fourth fastest growing personal income in the United States, while real wages have declined nationally over the past eight years that Congressman Braley has been there by 2.7 per cent.\" The state of Iowa was the fourth largest at the national level in the growth of personal income, but only for the last quarter, and when compared to the previous quarter, this high rate seems statistically abnormal. At the same time, she was mistaken that real wages had fallen by 2.7 per cent over the past eight years, although she had the view that the state of Iowa had achieved somewhat better results in that regard than the nation as a whole. The Ernest comparison between Iowa's economy and the nation's economy is also questionable because it seems to compare quarterly data for one census with eight years of a different census. Economists say this isn't the right way. The allegation contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, so it is often wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07141"}
