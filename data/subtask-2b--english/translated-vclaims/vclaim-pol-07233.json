One of Wisconsin attacked on 26 September 2014, less than six weeks before the democratic elections between Walker and Mary Burke. The Madison-based group began publishing the following news: \"In a reform plan for ethics,\" Scott Walker proposed while running for governor, promising that he would not accept contributions from the date of his inauguration until the signing of the State budget. \"A review of Governor Walker's campaign funding records by Won Wisconsin now shows that for each budget I introduced between January and the date of the signing of the budget into law, approximately $5.6 million of 54,000 contributions were raised.\" Our walk-O-Meter follows 65 Walker promises made during the 2010 Governor's campaign. But not like the one you described, Wen Wisconsin now. Did we miss one? No. In fact, eight years ago, it became clear that the pledge was part of the ethics reform plan Walker issued during his short term in 2006 to nominate GOP as Governor. To say that the ethics of the government is \"one of the greatest challenges to the democracy of Wisconsin,\" Walker pledged in this race not to accept any contributions for the campaign from January 2007 until the signing of the State budget. But Walker pulled out before the initial election, deferred to Congress at Mark Greene, who lost to Jim Doyle, the Democratic Governor of the general election. On January 10, 2021, in a television interview, \"It takes a long time on election day to download those cards, which is why we have 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. to throw the ballot papers at Milwaukee.\" \u2022 On January 15, 2012, Walker ran again to the post of Governor in 2010 and won. But we don't know any campaign promises during that campaign, like the one that Won Wisconsin has just mentioned. When we presented this to Scott Ross, the Executive Director of the group, he said that the 2006 Walker promise \"was never rejected in subsequent campaigns.\" Walker had reversed the 2006 pledge to accept substantial contributions for the electoral campaign while working on the State budget. But the promise of a campaign from a failed tour does not automatically go to the next campaign. One of Wisconsin now ignores the fact that Walker's old promise specifically stated that it applied to the 2007 budget period. The Panel calculated the figures for the 2011 and 2013 budget periods. :: Records from the State Government Accountability Board show that the Walker campaign received more than $6 million during budget preparation periods: $2.51 million from January 2011, the month of its opening, until June 2011, when its first government budget was signed; and $3.52 million from January to June 2013, the period during which it and the legislature took over its second budget. However, this verification of the facts is considered controversial, as Walker was not elected on this promise. Our assessment of Wen Wisconsin now said that Walker was elected governor on the promise not to take campaign donations \"from his inauguration to the signing of the state budget,\" but he broke the promise to take approximately $5.6 million as donations. Walker promised to do so during his failed Governor's campaign in 2006, noting specifically that the period will begin in January 3, 2007. But he did not do it again during his success in 2010. We're assessing the allegation wrong. To comment on this item, go to the biennial Malawi web page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07233"}
