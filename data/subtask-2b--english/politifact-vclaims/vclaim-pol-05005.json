Pat McCrory took shots at critics of North Carolina\u2019s controversial new law, commonly known as HB2, during a morning radio appearance May 3 on The John Boy and Billy Big Show.\nThe law banned transgender people from using the bathroom of the gender they identify as, banned cities from enacting their own minimum wages or LGBT-friendly discrimination laws and got rid of anyone\u2019s ability to file a discrimination lawsuit in state court.\nIt was widely panned by progressive politicians as well as entertainers, some of whom even canceled shows in the Tar Heel State.\nOn the show McCrory, with encouragement from John Boy and Billy, went through a laundry list of critics he said were mistaken or hypocritical.\nThe show\u2019s titular hosts \u2013 two down-home comedians with a conservative bent \u2013 are based in Charlotte and are broadcast in the morning rush hour throughout the country, primarily on rock stations.\nSo it was no surprise that Bruce Springsteen\u2019s name was brought up \u2013 although it was McCrory, not the hosts, who broached the subject of the rocker who is arguably the biggest name to have canceled a show in North Carolina over the new law.\n\"Some things are more important than a rock show, and this fight against prejudice and bigotry \u2013 which is happening as I write \u2013 is one of them,\" Springsteen wrote April 8 in announcing the decision to cancel his April 10 show.\nMcCrory, however, implied that perhaps The Boss doesn\u2019t command the\u00a0adoration he once did \u2013 and that his cancellation was actually a ploy to avoid the embarrassing optics of a half-empty concert.\n\"I love Bruce Springsteen,\" McCrory said. \"I love his music. But he canceled a concert in Greensboro. By the way, they only had 8,000 tickets sold, with all respect. Hmm. But Bruce doesn\u2019t mention that. They didn\u2019t get the ticket sales they wanted.\"\nThat got a hearty laugh from everyone on set, and McCrory later repeated that 8,000 number.\nWhere'd he hear that?\nHere at PolitiFact North Carolina, we\u2019ve seen our fair share of videos from Springsteen\u2019s live shows (mostly to marvel at Nils Lofgren\u2019s guitar solos). The crowds are always sizeable, if not sold out. We would be quite surprised if Springsteen had sold only half the tickets to his Greensboro show just two days before the concert.\nThe Greensboro Coliseum, where he had been scheduled to play, can seat more than 20,000 people. Stadium officials said the capacity for the Springsteen concert was actually about 16,000 due to stage and seating logistics.\nSo that 8,000 number, if true, would say a lot about Springsteen \u2013 especially keeping in mind that the Coliseum tracks attendance for all of its shows, and Bruuuuuuuuuuuce has two of the 20 largest crowds in stadium history.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut those were years ago, in 2002 and 2009. Is McCrory right that North Carolinians in 2016 don\u2019t care much for the Jersey rocker\u2019s music, much less his liberal views? Was he really only using a convenient political stance to cover up embarrassing sales numbers?\nNo, according to the Greensboro Coliseum.\nAndrew Brown, the arena\u2019s PR director, told us Springsteen had sold more than 15,000 tickets.\n\"No idea where 8,000 may have come from,\" Brown said, adding that there were fewer than 100 tickets left when Springsteen canceled with two days\u2019 notice.\n\"It\u2019s safe to say it would have sold out,\" he said.\nLike Brown, we also have no idea where the 8,000 number came from. McCrory\u2019s campaign hasn\u2019t responded to our questions, but we\u2019ll update this if we hear back.\nThe Greensboro Coliseum previously reported that Springsteen\u2019s cancellation cost it $100,000.\nPearl Jam, Ringo Starr, Demi Lovato/Nick Jonas and Ani DiFranco have also canceled, while such acts as Jimmy Buffett, Beyonce and Mumford & Sons have played but spoken out against the law from on stage or in written statements.\nAs for Springsteen, the more-than-15,000-tickets number is the same figure the coliseum reported immediately after the cancellation, which was weeks before McCrory questioned the attendance. We appreciate the consistency, which keeps us from dancing in the dark to try to figure out the truth.\nOur ruling\nMcCrory was way off on\u00a0the number of tickets sold, which was widely reported before his radio appearance. What's more, he used that incorrect number to suggest\u00a0that was why Springsteen canceled. In fact,\u00a0the arena said the show was on the verge of selling out, not half empty.\nThat\u2019s not just false \u2013 ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, it\u2019s on fire.\u00a0Pants on Fire!\nUPDATE: McCrory apologizes\nThe night after our fact-check went up, we heard back from Pat McCrory\u2019s office about his claim that only 8,000 tickets had been sold.\nAlthough he\u2019s standing by another claim he made \u2013 that he loves Springsteen\u2019s music \u2013 McCrory admitted he was wrong about the sales figure and that it was the reason for the cancellation.\n\"The governor apologizes for using the wrong number,\" wrote his spokesman, Josh Ellis, in an email to PolitiFact North Carolina. \"It\u2019s too bad Bruce Springsteen actually canceled on nearly 15,000 people at the last minute. Regardless, the governor is still keeping his Springsteen albums despite their political disagreements.\"\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8810b36b-ac00-4caf-bcc4-42e9dba89087", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05005"}
