We rated his statement Mostly True.\nTen months later, Amar (also known as Amardeep) stepped into an even more public role, announcing plans to run in 2014 against eight-term U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate. \u00a0\nKaleka, a 35-year-old Democrat and documentary filmmaker, was interviewed about his planned candidacy on the Oct. 20, 2013 edition of \"Upfront with Mike Gousha,\" a public affairs program on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee.\nWhen Gousha asked Kaleka what he would say to people who might view him as a one-dimensional candidate focused on guns, Kaleka turned the conversation to the economy.\n\"I mean, gun legislation is just one of the many things that are holding us down economically. A number of other things, immigration reform, the economic disparity that we\u2019re experiencing, has to do with our thoughts and models that we\u2019ve had in place for now, well over two decades,\" he said.\n\"I mean, the Midwest is a great example of how we\u2019re losing so many factories and manufacturing jobs and agricultural jobs. For example, we used to be called America's Dairyland. Now, California is called America's Dairyland. We sent them fresh water, and we sold it to them. Ultimately, we didn't get anything in exchange. We lost a bunch of jobs, a bunch of farmland.\"\nIt\u2019s been two decades since California eclipsed Wisconsin in milk production, although Wisconsin still calls itself America\u2019s Dairyland.\nBut we\u2019ve never heard that Wisconsin had sold fresh water to California to boost their dairy industry -- and lost jobs and farmland in the process.\nWouldn\u2019t there have been a titanic hue and cry if that had ever happened?\nBig ideas\nTo be sure, there have been some grandiose proposals to sell Great Lakes water to faraway places.\nIn 1998, a Canadian company actually obtained a permit from Ontario to ship fresh water by tankers from Lake Superior to Asia. But after a backlash in Canada and the United States, the permit was canceled two weeks later.\nIn 2007, Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Richardson raised the possibility of exporting Great Lakes water to the Southwest, calling for a national water policy and saying \"states like Wisconsin are awash in water.\" But less than two weeks after Richardson\u2019s comments rattled Midwest politicians, his campaign issued a statement saying Richardson \"in no way proposes federal transfers of water from one region of the nation to the other.\"\nThe following year, the eight Great Lakes states reached agreement on the Great Lakes Compact, which bans Great Lakes water from being \"diverted,\" or piped out of the basin, with a few exceptions, such as the possible sale of Lake Michigan water from Oak Creek to another Milwaukee suburb, Waukesha, which is under consideration. Even then, Waukesha would have to return 100 percent of the water by volume to the lake by discharging treated wastewater to the Root River in Franklin.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven with the compact, officials remain wary of outsiders coveting Great Lakes water, said Tim Eder, executive director of the Great Lakes Commission, an interstate agency that promotes the development, use and conservation of water in the Great Lakes basin.\nSo, was there a Wisconsin sale of fresh water to California before the 2008 compact?\n\"No way. It's really simple,\" Eder said of Kaleka\u2019s claim. \"He\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s getting his information, but it\u2019s not based in fact.\"\nTwo other experts -- Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources water use section chief Eric Ebersberger, and Peter Annin, managing director of the University of Notre Dame Environmental Change Initiative, which does research on water resources -- were also dumbfounded and emphatic: No water sale to California has ever occurred.\nAnd if it never occurred, it certainly didn\u2019t boost the dairy industry there, or mean lost jobs or farmland here.\nIndeed, federal figures show that in 2012, Wisconsin produced 27.2 billion pounds of milk, a record for the state, and led the nation by producing 2.79 billion pounds of cheese.\nSaid Annin, author of \"The Great Lakes Water Wars\": \"I\u2019m not aware of any instance where the State of Wisconsin, or anybody in the state of Wisconsin, sold water to California. There\u2019ve been a lot of weird proposals, but they\u2019ve never actually happened.\"\nWe also checked with the federal Mississippi River Commission, which assured us that water from the Mississippi River was never sold to California.\nKaleka, meanwhile, told us he meant to say \"we thought about sending them fresh water.\"\nHe added: \"I'm going to have to take my hit on this. It was a sloppy response to a very big problem of local and national economics.\"\nBut on even that he is off. None of the information Kaleka provided us indicates that Wisconsin even considered selling water to California.\nAnd we could find no record of it.\nOur rating\nKaleka said Wisconsin sold fresh water to California and \"lost a bunch of jobs (and) a bunch of farmland.\"\nThere\u2019s no evidence of such a water sale, something that would have made for countless front-page stories, let alone it leading to a loss of jobs and farmland in Wisconsin.\nThe statement is false and ridiculous: Pants on Fire.\nYou can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel's web site.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08699"}
