Cheating took place at some 40 schools, she said, but an investigative report on the scandal implicated only a small percentage of the district\u2019s educators. \u00a0\n\n\"95 percent of the teachers and the principals are not implicated in the report at all,\" Franklin told reporter Jennifer Leslie on Saturday. \"There are 3,000 teachers and principals, and this report says that about 5 percent were involved in this.\"\n\nOnly 5 percent? What about investigators\u2019 conclusion that the cheating was \"widespread\"?\n\nPolitiFact Georgia hunted for answers.\n\nThe report, released July 5, found that cheating took place on the Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests, or CRCT, a set of standardized tests administered across Georgia. Typically given in first through eighth grade, they\u2019re designed to determine how well students meet state curriculum standards.\n\nThe report implicated 178 educators, including 38 principals, in the cheating scandal. Investigators confirmed cheating in 44 of 56 schools they examined. Time magazine called it \"likely the largest cheating scandal in U.S. history to date.\"\n\nWe contacted Franklin, who told us in a voice mail that the numbers she used in the TV interview were from news accounts, but did not give specifics.\n\nThe Truth-O-Meter soldiered on. PolitiFact Georgia used an internal Atlanta Journal-Constitution database, state and federal data, and information from APS\u2019 website to check Franklin\u2019s claim. \u00a0\n\nAccording to the AJC\u2019s database and state and federal figures, there are some 4,000 educators in the district, which means that about 5 percent of the district\u2019s educators were implicated.\n\nFranklin\u2019s arithmetic is correct, but we noticed some holes in her approach. \u00a0\n\nFranklin\u2019s calculation includes high school educators, but the CRCT is given only to students in grades 1 through 8. Also, Franklin\u2019s number lumps teachers with principals and does not consider the number of schools involved.\n\nWe took these factors into account and made our own calculations. They led us to very different conclusions.\n\nCheating may have been limited among the rank and file, but the numbers show it was commonplace among school leadership.\n\nSome 2,370 teachers handle students in grades 1 through 8, according to AJC\u2019s database. The report implicated 140 of them, or about 6 percent. \u00a0\n\nPrincipals are a different story. A recent APS list shows 70 of them at the district\u2019s elementary and middle schools. Thirty-eight of them were implicated, or 54 percent.\n\nInvestigators found cheating in 44 out of 70 elementary and middle schools, which amounts to 63 percent. \u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that a top cheating investigator warned Monday that the true percentage of educators involved is very likely higher than the numbers in the report suggest. A \"wall of silence\" among school employees made it difficult to identify all of those involved, former Attorney General Mike Bowers said.\n\nThis news makes Franklin\u2019s claim that only a small percent of educators were implicated \"at all\" appear too clear-cut.\n\nSo, how do we rule?\n\nThe arithmetic behind the number Franklin uses in her claim that \"95 percent of teachers and principals are not implicated . . . at all\" is accurate.\n\nBut the impression she gives -- that if you put the cheating in perspective, only a small percent of the district is tainted -- ignores crucial context. More than half of the district\u2019s middle and elementary school principals were implicated, and cheating took place at nearly two-thirds of APS schools.\n\nThese percentages may be lower than the true number of cheaters.\n\nFranklin cherry-picked a number that supported her point, leaving out important details and taking things out of context. Her claim therefore meets PolitiFact\u2019s definition of Half True.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12743"}
