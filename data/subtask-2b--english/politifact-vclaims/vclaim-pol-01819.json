Tim Kaine took aim at Republican Corey Stewart\u2019s support for former Senate candidate Roy Moore, who lost an Alabama special election after facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\"In December of 2017, the Prince William board of supervisors had a meeting ... you skipped that meeting to go campaign in Alabama for Roy Moore to be a U.S. senator,\" Kaine said at the July 21 debate, noting that the meeting covered topics such as zoning and the opioid crisis.\nSeveral minutes later, after Stewart dodged Kaine\u2019s original question, Kaine added: \"You haven't disavowed Roy Moore's name yet.\"\nStewart, the at-large chair of Prince William County\u2019s board of supervisors, has battled frequent criticism for his history with the far right. He has since renounced some activists with whom he previously associated, but he has not been shy about supporting estranged figures in his party, so we decided to see whether Kaine\u2019s claim checked out.\nStewart\u2019s absence\nOn Dec. 12, 2017, the Prince William County board of supervisors met to consider, among other things, an increase in spending on the county\u2019s substance-abuse treatment programs.\nStewart was not present at that meeting. He was on the campaign trail in Alabama with Moore, carrying out a plan he announced two days earlier in a news release, according to local reports.\nStewart also detailed his visit to Alabama in a Facebook live video. He said he planned to fly to Atlanta, and drive a rental car to Montgomery in order to show support for Moore, who he said was a fellow \"anti-establishment, pro-Trump candidate.\"\n\"If you\u2019re wondering, why am I going down to Alabama, why is it important, and that is because we\u2019re all in this together, folks, we\u2019re all in this together,\" Stewart said. \"It is the establishment Republicans who are together colluding with Democrats, with liberals, and they\u2019re trying to take out every single anti-establishment, pro-Trump candidate.\"\n\"I\u2019m going down there to support him,\" Stewart added. \"Next year, when the establishment comes after me \u2026 I\u2019m hoping, of course, that I will get his help as well.\"\nStewart later tweeted a photo taken at the Moore rally in Alabama. \"With @UofAlabama students at the @MooreSenate rally! #MAGA #DrainTheSwamp,\" he wrote.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.
