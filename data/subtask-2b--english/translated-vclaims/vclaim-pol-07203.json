In a 30-second spot entitled \"Strange thoughts,\" the American Giffords Group of Responsible Solutions confirms that Garcia has different views from the majority of New Hampshire's population. Marelinda Garcia has some weird ideas. Most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage. Garcia's against it. Most people support ensuring that women receive equal pay for equal work. Garcia is also opposed to this. Garcia is even opposed to closing the gap that allows dangerous criminals to acquire a weapon without checking their past. The Ghanaian people of the State deserve to lead the general sense, not Mari Linda Garcia.\" Polyte Fact New Hampshire decided to verify the record of those claims. In this item, we will verify Garcia &apos; s position on the increase of the minimum wage. Garcia, state representative, challenges the current American Republic, Anne McLane Custer, democracy, to the second county seat of Congress. The Americans revealed for solutions responsible for the announcement in September, just as they stopped broadcasting a controversial television commercial that accused the Congressional candidate in Arizona of contradicting legislation aimed at preventing convicted stalkers from buying weapons. On the screen, New Hampshire's announcement cites a survey of WMU television from February, which found three quarters of New Hampshire residents supporting the raising of the minimum wage to $9 an hour. This supports the claim of the Declaration, although it should be noted that the federal proposal supported by President Barack Obama and other Democrats would lead him up to $10.10 an hour. At the time of the ballot, the New Hampshire Legislature was considering a bill (HB1403) to increase the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.25 in 2015 and to $9 in 2016. The survey conducted by the Survey Centre of the University of New Hampshire found that 59 per cent of the population strongly supported the increase and another 17 per cent supported it to some extent. 8% strongly opposed him and 5% somewhat opposed him. Another 11% were neutral or did not know enough to say it, according to WMU. New Hampshire is the only state among its neighbours that has no pay above the federal minimum of $7.25 and has a minimum wage in any state of New England. The minimum wage is $8.73 per hour in Vermont, $8 in Massachusetts and $7.50 in Maine. It is one of 18 states with the same minimum wage as the federal minimum of $7.25, according to the National Congress of State Legislatures. After about a month of voting, the New Hampshire House of Representatives voted to increase the state minimum wage by a vote of 173-118. The legislators voted mostly on party lines, with five Democrats voting against him and four Republicans voting against him. We reviewed the registration call to see how Garcia voted, but on three consecutive votes on March 12, 2014, concerning the minimum wage bill, Garcia did not vote. Subsequently, in May, the Republican-controlled State Senate killed the bill, together with all 13 Republicans who voted against it and 11 Democrats who voted for it, a process in which Garcia played no official role. A previous legislative battle over the minimum wage in New Hampshire also sheds light on Garcia &apos; s record. In the comments made during the adoption of the 2011 budget of the city of Milwaukee, Michael Murphy stated on November 5, 2010 that \"Mikon and Milwaukee have the highest income inequality in the country.\" In 2011, the New Hampshire Legislative Council, comprising the majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives and the Senate, passed the State Minimum Wage Deleting Bill, which means that the minimum wage in the state will be the federal minimum. At that time, the minimum wage in New Hampshire was $7.25 per hour, the same federal amount, but critics said that the bill was aimed at keeping the minimum wage in the state as low as possible. In the House of Representatives, Garcia was one of 236 lawmakers to vote in favour of the bill, HB133. After passing through the State Senate, Jove. John Lynch objected to this measure. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate exceeded Lynch &apos; s veto power, and Garcia was one of 261 members of the House of Representatives to vote in favour of bypassing the Governor. Although there was no record of Garcia voting on the increase in the minimum wage in 2014 in New Hampshire, it took a clear position on the 2011 law linking the state minimum wage to the federal level. As further evidence of Garcia's opposition to raising the minimum wage, the announcement mentions an article from The Heel, a newspaper covering Congress, that Garcia is opposed to raising the minimum wage. That article, published on June 9, presented Garcia -- and then considered him vulnerable in the presidential presidential election against State X. Gary Lambert -- to a national audience. The article reviews its record as a state legislator and indicates how some figures in the institution of the General Democratic Party feared that Garcia would be seen as too conservative in a general electoral race. The article quotes Garcia, in an interview in March, that while a superficial increase in the minimum wage seemed to be a \"good idea,\" it would not \"in fact help anyone much more\" and could in fact hurt. \"In fact, they have negative consequences in many areas. It was one of them, if we try to encourage people to increase their own education so that they do not have to remain in a lower-paid job anymore, thereby raising [the minimum wage] to reduce the incentive to do so.\" Garcia's position has not changed since. In an e-mail addressed to Politifakt New Hampshire, Kenny Cunningham, Director of the Garcia Political and Communications Campaign, promoted this position. \"A decent minimum wage for all from Washington, D.C., is counterproductive. The economists agree that this will increase unemployment, especially among adolescents, as Keningham has said. Instead, Maryland wants to lower the highest tax rates of United States companies in the world and curb job creation regulations. Our liberal American governor's declaration of responsible solutions says that most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage, but Marilinda Garcia opposes it. The polls that began when the New Hampshire Legislature was considering raising the state minimum wage showed that the majority of the population surveyed supported an increase in the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.25 and, ultimately, to $9 per hour. Garcia recorded criticism of attempts to raise the minimum wage, stating that its effects could be \"inverse to productivity\" and could lead to \"negative consequences.\" She also made several votes in 2011 that effectively kept the minimum wage in the State the lowest in the region. The claim requires minor clarification. As support to assert that \"most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage,\" the poll quoted a referendum asking the population for a minimum wage of $9. It is not clear whether the population will support the rise to the highest level of $10.10, as the President and the Democrats of Congress are seeking to do. Anyway, we're mostly assessing the claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07203"}
