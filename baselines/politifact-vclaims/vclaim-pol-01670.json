Pritzker.\"", "truth_label": "barely-true", "date": "stated on August 24, 2018 in a TV ad:", "title": "Pritzker claims Rauner misquoted newspapers to lie about him. That\u2019s a stretch.", "text": "It\u2019s a common tactic for campaign advertising to highlight selective snippets from newspapers and other media in an attempt to pump an air of credibility into claims and attacks.\nThat time-worn formula is at the center of a recent TV ad by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner that quotes from several papers about Democratic challenger J.B. Pritzker, including one from Rockford that declares \"the main thing Pritzker wants to do is raise taxes.\"\nNow Pritzker is punching back with his own TV ad that accuses Rauner of distorting the quotes he is appropriating. \"When you\u2019re a failure, you lie,\" a narrator says in the Pritzker spot. \"Bruce Rauner is intentionally misquoting newspapers to lie about J.B. Pritzker.\"\nThe dueling ads go down a rabbit hole of election-year politics where there\u2019s now an argument about the argument. Rauner\u2019s ad clearly takes liberties in seeking to paint Pritzker with a broad brush as an advocate of sweeping tax hikes.\nBut Pritzker claims Rauner goes far beyond that by straying into outright fabrication. That\u2019s a provocative charge that invites a closer look.\nCritical context\n\"The main thing Pritzker wants to do is raise taxes,\" the first quotation in Rauner\u2019s ad reads, attributed to the Rockford Register Star.\n\"An immediate increase in the current 4.95 percent flat tax rate,\" the second line goes on, this time from the Champaign News-Gazette.\n\"A short-term plan and a long-term plan to increase income taxes,\" the next line reads, also from the News-Gazette.\nSeven quotations later, the ad concludes with its sole original line: \"J.B. Pritzker and Mike Madigan. Higher taxes. More corruption.\"\nWe checked the entire string of cited articles and located the quoted lines in all of them. So it\u2019s clear Rauner isn\u2019t pulling words out of thin air.\nWhen we asked Pritzker\u2019s campaign to explain how Rauner erred, spokesman Jason Rubin wrote in an email that the ad \"misquotes articles by repeating lines out of context and in a way that misrepresents J.B.\u2019s vision for putting Illinois back on track.\"\nFor support, Rubin pointed to passages in some of the same articles cited by Rauner that nod to Pritzker\u2019s very different view of his tax stance.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPritzker has said, and the articles point out, that he wants to amend the Illinois Constitution so the state\u2019s current flat-rate income tax can be replaced with a graduated income tax allowing for higher rates on the wealthy \u2014 how much, he won\u2019t say. Any such effort would take several years to accomplish, so in the interim Pritzker also says he would raise the current 4.95 percent flat-tax rate but offset the increased cost for low and middle-income taxpayers with expanded exemptions and deductions.\nIt\u2019s a complicated scenario, and Rauner\u2019s ad ignores all the nuance by suggesting Pritzker seeks to raise taxes across the board.\nThat said, the Rauner ad is packed with sweeping condemnations of Pritzker\u2019s tax plan \u2014 among them that it \"would punish many Illinoisans\" \u2014 ripped accurately from editorials that unambiguously criticize the Democrat.\nAs we\u2019ve pointed out before, implementing a graduated income tax would not necessarily mean raising taxes on the middle class, despite what Rauner and some of his editorial sources contend. But that doesn\u2019t mean the governor is inaccurately quoting others who make that argument.\nPot, meet kettle\nPritzker would be on firmer ground had he merely accused Rauner of taking liberties. But there\u2019s a big difference between strategically selecting advantageous lines and putting words in someone\u2019s mouth.\nAnd if Pritzker is going to call Rauner out for cherry-picking, it\u2019s also relevant to note that Pritzker does the same in his own response ad.\nIt takes Rauner to task for failing to point out that a Rockford Register Star opinion column he references also mentions Pritzker\u2019s argument that he \"only wants to raise taxes on wealthy people.\" But the overall tenor of the Rockford piece clearly takes a skeptical view of Pritzker\u2019s tax plan, likely why Rauner chose to highlight it in the first place.\nKent Redfield, a state campaign expert at the University of Illinois\u2019 Institute of Government & Public Affairs, called \"misquoting\" a poor word choice on Pritzker\u2019s part.\n\"It isn\u2019t that Rauner has lied,\" Redfield said. \"One isn\u2019t misquoting and the other quoting accurately. They\u2019re both selectively choosing things that reinforce and lend journalistic credibility to their argument.\"\nOur ruling\nPritzker\u2019s ad says Rauner \"is misquoting newspapers\" to lie about him.\nRauner\u2019s ad selectively quotes from newspapers \u2014 mostly editorials \u2014 to reinforce a disputed narrative that Pritzker is out to broadly hike taxes on Illinoisans.\nIn doing so, Rauner leaves out a key point acknowledged in the articles that his ad cites: Pritzker says he only wants to raise taxes on wealthier individuals. The Democrat\u2019s campaign argues this means Rauner\u2019s ad is \"misquoting\" those articles by taking them out of context.\nBut most of the ad\u2019s driving excerpts come from editorials or opinion columns that share Rauner\u2019s dim view of Pritzker\u2019s tax policies. The position advanced by Rauner\u2019s ad clearly matches the harsher editorials that frame it.\nWhile Pritzker\u2019s statement contains an element of truth, it ignores this critical fact. We rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01670"}
