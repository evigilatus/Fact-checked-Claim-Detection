0001	Obama	Of course, a great education isn't all we need in this new economy.
0002	Obama	We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security.
0003	Obama	After all, it's not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting in this chamber.
0004	Obama	For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher.
0005	Obama	Americans understand that at some point in their careers, they may have to retool and retrain.
0006	Obama	But they shouldn't lose what they've already worked so hard to build.
0007	Obama	That's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever we shouldn't weaken them, we should strengthen them.
0008	Obama	And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.
0009	Obama	That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about.
0010	Obama	It's about filling the gaps in employerbased care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we'll still have coverage.
0011	Obama	Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far.
0012	Obama	Health care inflation has slowed.
0013	Obama	And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.
0014	Obama	Now, I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon.
0015	Obama	But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security.
0016	Obama	Say a hardworking American loses his job  we shouldn't just make sure he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him.
0017	Obama	If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills.
0018	Obama	And even if he's going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him.
0019	Obama	That's the way we make the new economy work better for everyone.
0020	Obama	I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty.
0021	Obama	America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, and I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for lowincome workers without kids.
0022	Obama	But there are other areas where it's been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years  namely what role the government should play in making sure the system's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations.
0023	Obama	And here, the American people have a choice to make.
0024	Obama	I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy.
0025	Obama	I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and there's red tape that needs to be cut.
0026	Obama	But after years of record corporate profits, working families won't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everyone else or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered.
0027	Obama	Food Stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis recklessness on Wall Street did.
0028	Obama	Immigrants aren't the reason wages haven't gone up enough those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over longterm returns.
0029	Obama	It's sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.
0030	Obama	In this new economy, workers and startups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less.
0031	Obama	The rules should work for them.
0032	Obama	And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses who've figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best practices across America.
0033	Obama	In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.
0034	Obama	This brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a country how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?
0035	Obama	Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny Sputnik was up there.
0036	Obama	We didn't argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget.
0037	Obama	We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.
0038	Obama	That spirit of discovery is in our DNA.
0039	Obama	We're Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver.
0040	Obama	We're Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride.
0041	Obama	We're every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world.
0042	Obama	And over the past seven years, we've nurtured that spirit.
0043	Obama	We've protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and lowincome Americans online.
0044	Obama	We've launched nextgeneration manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.
0045	Obama	But we can do so much more.
0046	Obama	Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer.
0047	Obama	Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they've had in over a decade.
0048	Obama	Tonight, I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done.
0049	Obama	And because he's gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years, I'm putting Joe in charge of Mission Control.
0050	Obama	For the loved ones we've all lost, for the family we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.
0051	Obama	Medical research is critical.
0052	Obama	We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.
0053	Obama	Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it.
0054	Obama	You'll be pretty lonely, because you'll be debating our military, most of America's business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it's a problem and intend to solve it.
0055	Obama	But even if the planet wasn't at stake even if 2014 wasn't the warmest year on record  until 2015 turned out even hotter  why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?
0056	Obama	Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history.
0057	Obama	Here are the results.
0058	Obama	In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power.
0059	Obama	On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal  in jobs that pay better than average.
0060	Obama	We're taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy  something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support.
0061	Obama	Meanwhile, we've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.
0062	Obama	Gas under two bucks a gallon ain't bad, either.
0063	Obama	Now we've got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy.
0064	Obama	Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future  especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels.
0065	Obama	That's why I'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.
0066	Obama	That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21 st century transportation system.
0067	Obama	None of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo.
0068	Obama	But the jobs we'll create, the money we'll save, and the planet we'll preserve  that's the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.
0069	Obama	Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world.
0070	Obama	And that's why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nationbuild everywhere there's a problem.
0071	Obama	I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air.
0072	Obama	Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.
0073	Obama	The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.
0074	Obama	Period.
0075	Obama	It's not even close.
0076	Obama	We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.
0077	Obama	Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world.
0078	Obama	No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that's the path to ruin.
0079	Obama	Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead  they call us.
0080	Obama	As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time.
0081	Obama	But that's not because of diminished American strength or some looming superpower.
0082	Obama	In today's world, we're threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states.
0083	Obama	The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia.
0084	Obama	Economic headwinds blow from a Chinese economy in transition.
0085	Obama	Even as their economy contracts, Russia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria  states they see slipping away from their orbit.
0086	Obama	And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.
0087	Obama	It's up to us to help remake that system.
0088	Obama	And that means we have to set priorities.
0089	Obama	Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.
0090	Obama	Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today's world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage.
0091	Obama	They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country they undermine our allies.
0092	Obama	But as we focus on destroying ISIL, overthetop claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.
0093	Obama	Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped.
0094	Obama	But they do not threaten our national existence.
0095	Obama	That's the story ISIL wants to tell that's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.
0096	Obama	We don't need to build them up to show that we're serious, nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world's largest religions.
0097	Obama	We just need to call them what they are  killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.
0098	Obama	That's exactly what we are doing.
0099	Obama	For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL's financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology.
0100	Obama	With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their weapons.
0101	Obama	We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.
0102	Obama	If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of military force against ISIL.
0103	Obama	Take a vote.
0104	Obama	But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them.
0105	Obama	If you doubt America's commitment  or mine  to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden.
0106	Obama	Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell.
0107	Obama	When you come after Americans, we go after you.
0108	Obama	It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.
0109	Obama	Our foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can't stop there.
0110	Obama	For even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world  in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia.
0111	Obama	Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks others will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees.
0112	Obama	The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians.
0113	Obama	That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage.
0114	Obama	We also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis.
0115	Obama	That's not leadership that's a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us.
0116	Obama	It's the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq  and we should have learned it by now.
0117	Obama	Fortunately, there's a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power.
0118	Obama	It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.
0119	Obama	That's our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we're partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.
0120	Obama	That's why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nucleararmed Iran.
0121	Obama	As we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.
0122	Obama	That's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa.
0123	Obama	Our military, our doctors, and our development workers set up the platform that allowed other countries to join us in stamping out that epidemic.
0124	Obama	That's how we forged a TransPacific Partnership to open markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia.
0125	Obama	It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America, and supports more good jobs.
0126	Obama	With TPP, China doesn't set the rules in that region, we do.
0127	Obama	You want to show our strength in this century?
0128	Obama	Approve this agreement.
0129	Obama	Give us the tools to enforce it.
0130	Obama	Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America.
0131	Obama	That's why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people.
0132	Obama	You want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere?
0133	Obama	Recognize that the Cold War is over.
0134	Obama	Lift the embargo.
0135	Obama	American leadership in the 21 st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world  except when we kill terrorists or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling.
0136	Obama	Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right.
0137	Obama	It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not charity.
0138	Obama	When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change  that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our children.
0139	Obama	When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decadeslong war, that strengthens the international order we depend upon.
0140	Obama	When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, that prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores.
0141	Obama	Right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIVAIDS, and we have the capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria  something I'll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.
0142	Obama	That's strength.
0143	Obama	That's leadership.
0144	Obama	And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example.
0145	Obama	That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo it's expensive, it's unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.
0146	Obama	That's why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion.
0147	Obama	This isn't a matter of political correctness.
0148	Obama	It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong.
0149	Obama	The world respects us not just for our arsenal it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.
0150	Obama	His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that "to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place."
0151	Obama	When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn't make us safer.
0152	Obama	That's not telling it like it is.
0153	Obama	It's just wrong.
0154	Obama	It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.
0155	Obama	It makes it harder to achieve our goals.
0156	Obama	And it betrays who we are as a country.
0157	Obama	We the People.
0158	Obama	Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we've come to recognize mean all the people, not just some words that insist we rise and fall together.
0159	Obama	That brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing I want to say tonight.
0160	Obama	The future we want  opportunity and security for our families a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids  all that is within our reach.
0161	Obama	But it will only happen if we work together.
0162	Obama	It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates.
0163	Obama	It will only happen if we fix our politics.
0164	Obama	A better politics doesn't mean we have to agree on everything.
0165	Obama	This is a big country, with different regions and attitudes and interests.
0166	Obama	That's one of our strengths, too.
0167	Obama	Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.
0168	Obama	But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens.
0169	Obama	It doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic.
0170	Obama	Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us.
0171	Obama	Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention.
0172	Obama	Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn't matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest.
0173	Obama	Too many Americans feel that way right now.
0174	Obama	It's one of the few regrets of my presidency  that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.
0175	Obama	There's no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.
0176	Obama	But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task  or any President's  alone.
0177	Obama	There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who would like to see more cooperation, a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the demands of getting elected.
0178	Obama	I know you've told me.
0179	Obama	And if we want a better politics, it's not enough to just change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President we have to change the system to reflect our better selves.
0180	Obama	We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around.
0181	Obama	We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families and hidden interests can't bankroll our elections  and if our existing approach to campaign finance can't pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution.
0182	Obama	We've got to make voting easier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now.
0183	Obama	And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do.
0184	Obama	But I can't do these things on my own.
0185	Obama	Changes in our political process  in not just who gets elected but how they get elected  that will only happen when the American people demand it.
0186	Obama	It will depend on you.
0187	Obama	That's what's meant by a government of, by, and for the people.
0188	Obama	What I'm asking for is hard.
0189	Obama	It's easier to be cynical to accept that change isn't possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don't matter.
0190	Obama	But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future.
0191	Obama	Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure.
0192	Obama	As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.
0193	Obama	We can't afford to go down that path.
0194	Obama	It won't deliver the economy we want, or the security we want, but most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.
0195	Obama	So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen.
0196	Obama	To vote.
0197	Obama	To speak out.
0198	Obama	To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us.
0199	Obama	To stay active in our public life so it reflects the goodness and decency and optimism that I see in the American people every single day.
0200	Obama	It won't be easy.
0201	Obama	Our brand of democracy is hard.
0202	Obama	But I can promise that a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I'll be right there with you as a citizen  inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that have helped America travel so far.
0203	Obama	Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed.
0204	Obama	Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word  voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.
0205	Obama	They're out there, those voices.
0206	Obama	They don't get a lot of attention, nor do they seek it, but they are busy doing the work this country needs doing.
0207	Obama	I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours.
0208	Obama	I see you.
0209	Obama	I know you're there.
0210	Obama	You're the reason why I have such incredible confidence in our future.
0211	Obama	Because I see your quiet, sturdy citizenship all the time.
0212	Obama	I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages to keep him on board.
0213	Obama	I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease.
0214	Obama	I see it in the American who served his time, and dreams of starting over  and the business owner who gives him that second chance.
0215	Obama	The protester determined to prove that justice matters, and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.
0216	Obama	I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him 'til he can run a marathon, and the community that lines up to cheer him on.
0217	Obama	It's the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he's been taught.
0218	Obama	I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to the new citizen who casts his for the first time the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.
0219	Obama	That's the America I know.
0220	Obama	That's the country we love.
0221	Obama	Cleareyed.
0222	Obama	Bighearted.
0223	Obama	Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.
0224	Obama	That's what makes me so hopeful about our future.
0225	Obama	Because of you.
0226	Obama	I believe in you.
0227	Obama	That's why I stand here confident that the State of our Union is strong.
0228	Obama	Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
