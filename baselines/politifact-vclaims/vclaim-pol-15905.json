The credit would be $2,500 per person, or $5,000 for couples.\n\n\nIn the debate, Obama got some things right about McCain's policy. Critics of McCain's policy do indeed worry that it will discourage employers from offering health care without lowering premiums for everyone.\n\n\nBut Obama oversimplified drastically when he said, \"By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000. So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.\"\n\n\nTo explain why this statement is problematic, let's get into more details about McCain's policy.\n\n\nMost Americans who have health insurance, about 71 percent, get it through their employer. Usually, the premiums are split so that the employer pays part and the employee pays part. Typically, the employer pays at least half, and often more.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

The exemption makes employer-provided health insurance more attractive to both workers and employers.\n\n\nMcCain wants to encourage greater competition for health insurance as a way to reduce premiums. His idea is that people should be able to go out on the open market and buy their own health insurance, and not be pushed into an employer-provided insurance plan by tax incentives.\n\n\nSo under McCain's plan, the tax exemption for employer-provided health insurance would disappear, and people would get a tax credit\u00a0 to spend on any health insurance they wish. They might choose to use their employer's plan and use the tax credit to offset the new tax on the benefit, or they might go off and buy insurance on their own.\n\n\nIt's a complex switcheroo, but there's ample evidence to show that the plan would be a wash for most workers. Keep in mind the current benefit is not worth $12,000, which is the cost of the average family plan; the benefit is\n\nthe taxes\n\non the part of that $12,000 that the employer pays. So if the employer picks up $8,000 of a $12,000 policy, the current benefit is the\n\ntaxes a worker would pay\n\non $8,000.\n\n\nThe McCain campaign says only workers with \"gold-plated\" health programs would do worse with the new credit. An independent analysis from the nonpartisan Urban Institute confirms that: \"In general, lower-income people with health insurance would receive benefits from the credit that would be well in excess of the value that they receive from today\u2019s tax exemption. The gains are much smaller for higher-income people.\"\n\n\nObama's numbers are wrong. McCain's health plan does not replace a $12,000 policy with a $5,000 credit. It replaces\n\nthe taxes on part of that amount\n\nwith a tax credit. We rate Obama's statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15905"}
