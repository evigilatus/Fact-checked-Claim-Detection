He said don't listen to rhetoric. High gas prices. A rising national debt. High unemployment. Forty-seven million people on food stamps, Cain said. \"That's 14 million more than when he took over the current concern of the White House.\" Uh, food stamps? Your official writers (Georgia) are wondering: What about the Republicans in Georgia and the food stamps recently? Last week, another state presidential competitor, Newt Jingerick, said that Obama deserves to be called \"the most successful head of food stamps in American history\" because \"47 million Americans on food stamps.\" We ruled Jingrich's statement half correct. Most of the time, Jingerick got his facts straight away, but they were over-magnified than they were to blame. Cain, a former host of a radio talk show and director of the Godfather's pizza program, had urged the crowd in his gathering to look at the facts. Georgia is happy to force it. Food stamps, officially known as the Supplementary Food Assistance Programme, or SNAP, provide vouchers to some low-income Americans for the purchase of groceries. The most recent data show that some 44.2 million people received the benefits of the South Pacific National Action Programme in February, the latest available data. Cain's numbers aren't exactly accurate, but they're close. The number of beneficiaries has reached 44 million since December, which means that its estimates are very high by approximately 7 per cent. The number of beneficiaries has increased every month since Obama took office, despite signs of improvement in the economy. According to historical data, the number of February appears to be the highest in any month since the establishment of the programme in 1969. Obama took office in January 2009. In that month, nearly 32 million people received NAP benefits. This means that the number of beneficiaries of food stamps has increased by some 12.2 million since the beginning of its administration. Cain put the increase on 14 million, which is about 15 percent very high. Once again, he's close, but he's not quite right. Whether Obama deserves to be blamed for the increase is much less clear. The rise in food stamps is a direct result of the great recession, which began more than a year before Obama took office. The conservatives and liberals agree that Obama inherited a troubled economy. Whether the use of SNAP would be less if Republicans won the presidency is impossible to know. The number of beneficiaries of the food stamp under President George W. Bush has increased due to policies that have expanded eligibility for the programme and more active efforts to make Americans eligible to apply for benefits. These policies remained in place during the Obama era. Another difficult reason to blame is that there is usually a difference between the start of the recovery of the wider economy and when the use of the South Pacific National Action Programme is reduced. Monthly growth has slowed over the past three months, and can begin to decline within one or two months. Kane's accusation against Obama was not as severe as that of Jingrik, but he blamed the use of the food stamp on the President's feet. Therefore, we are often giving the presidential candidate a reality.
