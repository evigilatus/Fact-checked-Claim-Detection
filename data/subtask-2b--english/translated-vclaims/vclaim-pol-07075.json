For Madre, Kentucky, Republican Sun, Randball is the poster child of a distinct party contradiction. \"Ebola points to why we need a fully funded government,\" Moder's books. \"When there is no direct threat of disease, government agencies like the CDC look like bureaucratic waste. When Rand Paul introduced the \"Tia Party Budget\" in 2011, it included a significant reduction in the CDC, and there is almost no explanation as to how this will affect his mission. In this verification of the truth, we are considering whether Paul proposed \"big pieces\" in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Moder wrote a blog on Paul's budget in 2011. At that time, Moder asked how the CDC could accomplish its mission if it cut its budget, as Paul wanted, by $1.165 billion. We went back to Paul's original budget documents. One of the reports published in January 2011 called for a reduction of $1.165 billion referred to by Moder. Paul then developed a more complete budget plan in May 2011. The budget of the CDC will be reduced by 20 per cent of fiscal year 2008 levels. Depending on whether it includes special funds for the evaluation of federal health programmes, Congress allocated between $6.049 billion and $6.375 billion to the Centre for Disease Control in fiscal year 2008. Rand &apos; s 20 per cent reduction is therefore either $1.209 billion or $1.275 billion in reductions. This is slightly beyond what Moder described. In his plan, Paul wrote, \"The Centre often mentions in media reports that highlight their high places of residence. For example, in 2005, the CDC established a 106 million-dollar conference centre, full of large plasma television screens. They also spent tens of millions of dollars on the latest anti-gravity seats for staff, as well as luxury furniture. Taxpayers are no longer able to afford the luxury working atmosphere of the CDC.\" This budget plan continues to be posted on Randpol 2016.com, the site of Paul &apos; s re-election to the Senate. Brian Darling, Paul &apos; s spokesman, agreed that the Senator had proposed such reductions in the past, but said that funding and the ability to combat Ebola did not necessarily go hand in hand. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021 \"If you look closely at the CDC budget, there's money wasted on projects unrelated to disease prevention,\" said Darling. At that time, Darling noted that Congress was at least supportive of the CDC, such as the Obama administration. Darling said that Congress had allocated $6.9 billion in a comprehensive spending bill to the CDC, an increase of $240 million over what the Department had requested. Another $88 million for Ebola was highlighted by Darling in an ongoing draft resolution adopted in September. However, neither procedure undermined Moder's point of view, and Paul voted against both measures. It is important to remember that these bills have been paid through many government agencies, not just the CDC. Sometimes reasonable people can argue about whether the pieces are \"big\" or not. In this case, Paul called himself a \"dangerous\" piece in the 2011 opinion article he wrote for the Wall Street Journal. Paul wrote: \"It is not surprising that my proposal is welcome and questionable in Washington, where serious spending cuts are rare.\" \"But it's a modest proposition when measured by the size of our growing debt.\" In 2011, Paul proposed to reduce the budget of the CDC by $1.165 billion. Budget documents confirm that. In fact, Paul's most detailed budget in that year would have reduced CDC spending by a little more, about $1.2 billion. While the Senate approved two broad spending measures for the funding of the CDC in 2014, Paul voted against these measures. We're assessing the claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07075"}
