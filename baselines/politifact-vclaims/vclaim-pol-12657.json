He was scornful of a proposal by Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to raise the debt limit.\n\n\"Harry Reid\u2019s plan is basically giving the president a blank check, giving him what he wants, a blind increase of the debt ceiling to spend the money the way he wants,\" Cantor said during a July 26 interview on Fox News.\n\nWe wondered whether Reid\u2019s plan really would present President Barack Obama a blank check -- a claim repeatedly made by Cantor and Boehner. \u00a0\n\nFirst, a little background. Reid\u2019s proposal would raise the debt ceiling by $2.7 trillion, enough to last until 2013. Boehner\u2019s two-step plan\u00a0would allow the limit to increase by $900 billion now and force Obama to seek a second hike before next year\u2019s elections.\n\nBoth proposals claim to cut spending by $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Neither plan seeks a tax increase. Boehner would require Congress to vote on a balanced budget amendment; Reid would not.\n\nWe asked asked Megan Whittemore, Cantor\u2019s deputy press secretary, to explain the majority leader\u2019s factual basis for calling Reid\u2019s plan \"a blank check\" for Obama.\n\n\"We are confident that your readers will understand the common meaning of the metaphor of a `blank check,\u2019\" she e-mailed back to us. \"However, to help you along we first turn to About.com in the grammar section where you will find the following helpful.\"\n\nWhittemore pasted in a three-paragraph definition that began, \"A figure of speech is a rhetorical device that achieves a special effect by using words in distinctive ways.\" It said, among other things, that sometimes people rely on \"hyperbole to emphasize a point (`I\u2019m starving!\u2019).\"\n\nShe also sent us two definitions of \"blank check.\" One, by Dictionary.com, defines it as \"unrestricted authority; a free hand.\"\u00a0\u00a0Another, by Wikipedia, says blank check \"in the figurative or metaphoric sense, is used (especially in politics) to describe a situation in which an agreement had been made that is open-ended or vague, and therefore subject to abuse.\"\n\nWhittemore noted that Boehner\u2019s two-step plan would require Congress to hit spending-cut goals before Obama could ask Congress for the second increase in the debt. That, Republicans say, would put more pressure on Washington to reduce spending than Reid\u2019s proposal, which would allow a larger, longer-lasting hike in the debt cap.\n\nWe ran Cantor\u2019s \"blank check\" analogy by four Washington policy analysts who are closely watching the debt ceiling debate. They were all perplexed by the statement and pointed out a simple reason why Reid\u2019s plan would not give Obama carte blanche: Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress can appropriate money.\n\n\"Congress has to authorize new spending and changes in taxation,\" said Norman J. Ornstein, a political scientist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"The president can sign or veto those bills. He can\u2019t do anything without congressional authority.\"\n\nOrnstein added, \"Cantor is being totally, deliberately misleading.\"\n\nSteve Ellis, vice-president of the non-partisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, had a similar take. \"Rep. Cantor\u2019s comment isn\u2019t really correct,\" he said.\n\nWe were also given a second reason why Cantor\u2019s statement is inaccurate: Raising the debt limit will pay for past obligations made by the U.S. government, not new ones.\n\n\"The need to raise the debt limit is a factor of past spending and tax decision (in addition to the recent economic downturn) enacted by previous congresses and presidents pushing borrowing needs up,\" said Jason Peuquet, an analyst with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road, budget-hawk group.\n\nLet\u2019s review:\n\nCantor said Senate Majority Leader Reid\u2019s proposal to raise the debt ceiling would be \"basically giving the president a blank check, giving him what he wants, a blind increase of the debt ceiling to spend the money the way he wants.\"\n\nA number of policy analysts told us Cantor\u2019s statement is simply incorrect. Only Congress can appropriate money. Obama can only spend what he\u2019s given. Reid\u2019s plan does not change that constitutional requirement.\n\nCantor\u2019s office failed to provide a single fact to back the Republican\u2019s contention that Reid\u2019s proposal would give the president a free hand in spending. Cantor\u2019s spokeswoman said he was speaking metaphorically and people understand that. We find that logic hard to accept, particularly at a time of great public divide when the financial integrity of the nation is at stake.\n\nWe rate Cantor\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12657"}
