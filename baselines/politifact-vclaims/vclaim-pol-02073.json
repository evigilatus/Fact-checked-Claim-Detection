We are the ones who are taking back the streets. We are getting them out of our country by the thousands,\" Trump said May 15. \"Every week we're setting new records on \u2014 we have a \u2018catch and release\u2019 program, too. It\u2019s called we catch them and we release them in the country they came back from, we are getting them out. Or we are putting them in prison.\"\nThere are an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. Not all are immigrants. Some are U.S. citizens who can\u2019t be deported.\nStill, we wondered about Trump\u2019s claim that MS-13 gang members are being deported \"by the thousands.\"\nWe found that thousands of gang members have been deported under Trump\u2019s administration. However, it\u2019s unclear how many of them were MS-13 gang members, because U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement does not track removals by specific gang affiliation. An expert who researches gangs and criminal justice said there is a lengthy process between a gang member\u2019s arrest and deportation.\n\nYou may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization,\u00a0we depend on \u2014 and answer to \u2014 you.

Go on the record as saying facts matter!\n\nRemovals data does not single out MS-13\nICE does not track gang removals by specific gang, but the agency does specifically target MS-13 members for arrest and removal on the basis of their immigration violations, said Matthew Bourke, a spokesman for the agency.\nBourke said 5,396 gang members were removed in fiscal year 2017 (which includes about four months of the Obama administration, running from Oct. 1, 2016 through Sept. 30, 2017).\nFrom Oct. 1, 2017 through Dec. 16, 2017 (the latest data available), 1,082 gang members were removed.\nIt\u2019s impossible to determine how many of them were MS-13 gang members.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is other data indicating the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to deport MS-13 gang members, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily support Trump\u2019s claim.\nICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations division arrested nearly 800 MS-13 gang members in fiscal year 2017.\u00a0\nICE\u2019s investigations division arrested 405 MS-13 gang members, Bourke said, citing first-quarter data for fiscal year 2018.\n\"The time it takes to remove a validated gang member can vary depending on whether the alien has started removal proceedings; whether the alien has a final order of removal; or whether the alien has pending criminal charges in a local jurisdiction,\" Bourke said.\nIt\u2019s unlikely that all of the MS-13 gang members arrested in 2017 were already deported, because of the time required to remove someone after an arrest, said Jorja Leap, an anthropologist and adjunct professor at UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs who researches gangs and criminal justice.\n\"Most members of MS-13 that I know that have been arrested are being held in court pending trial,\" Leap said. \"The process is lengthy.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said of MS-13 gang members, \"We are getting them out of our country by the thousands.\"\nIt\u2019s difficult to determine how many MS-13 members have been deported under Trump\u2019s administration, because immigration officials don\u2019t break down deportation data by gang affiliation.\u00a0\nAt least 1,200 MS-13 gang members were arrested from Oct. 1, 2016, through the end of Trump\u2019s first calendar year. The time between an arrest and deportation varies per case, but an expert told us the process is lengthy.\nTrump\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
