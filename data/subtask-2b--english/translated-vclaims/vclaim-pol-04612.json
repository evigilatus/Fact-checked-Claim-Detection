However, comedian Ken Jung and former economist at the White House, Austin Golsby, referred to apparent hypocrisy in a funny or dead video presented at the National Democratic Conference: many Trump-marked products produced abroad. The video starts with Jeong complimenting Trump's work: \"Yes, you're making things here!\" Julsby, who served in President Barack Obama's administration, then replied, \"He didn't do it.\" Golsby and Jung then pass a series of brand-marked products - T-shirts, necklaces, allowances, sleeves, vodka and glass - to see where they were made. In the end, angry Jeong said, \"So Austin, if that's your real name, Donald Trump says he's going to take jobs back to America.\" That's a very clever note, Ken. We decided to go over the Trump product list and check out the \"made\" signs. We have found many products through the Trump web site, which contains a page for the Donald G. We then explored the country in terms of origin for each country. Claim: Tramp T-shirts made in Bangladesh. We found tramp shirts on the Amazon made in Bangladesh and China, as well as some simply listed as \"import.\" Claim: Trump Neck in China. We saw the sign \"made in China\" on Trump's tie for sale on eBay. The claim: Tramp is prosecuted in Mexico. In fact, we found a large number of tramp suits on the Amazon made in the United States. But we also found one made in India and China. We couldn't immediately find an example of a suit made in Mexico for sale, but Trump admitted that he made some of his clothes there. Facebook was published on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook video showing the man upset because he was added to the no-fly list to break into the Capitol. By Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021 (updated: after we published this fact check, Clinton's campaign sent us an example of someone who posted a photo on Facebook of Tramp's suit with a sign \"made in Mexico.\" Claim: Trump buttons made in China. We found some sleeve buttons made in China and others listed as imported. Claim: Tramp Vodka, Netherlands. Yeah, vodka tramp was dripped there, according to online liquor vendors. Claim: Tramp Crystal Barwayr is made in Slovenia. The Slovenian Glass Producer Sticklarna Rogaska partner with Trump to sell his products in his name in the United States. Trump's wife is also from Slovenia, prompting Jeong to scream in her name: Holly Melania! But not all Trump products are manufactured abroad. In verifying previous facts, we found the Trump Brand, Cologne, the natural Trump spring water and the Trump wine all made in the United States. If you're wondering, some Trump products are also manufactured in the United States, including a baseball hat \"make America great again,\" which is made in California. We gave pants on the October fire classification to an allegation by Twitter users that hats were made in China. It should also be noted that 97 percent of all clothes sold in the United States are manufactured abroad, according to the American Clothing and Shoes Association. Our funny or deadly video said that tramp shirts are made in Bangladesh, tramp suits in Mexico, vodka trumps in the Netherlands, Brat Crystal Trump in Slovenia and his sleeves and ties in China. We found examples of all these manufactured products in these two countries, Jeong and Golsby, except for a case in Mexico. However, we have found suits made in other countries, and there are examples of other Trump products made in Mexico. Some of the suits, in fact, are made in the United States. We're mostly assessing this claim right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e4ca60a0-598b-41f7-b7d2-2fed1838e7fb", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04612"}
