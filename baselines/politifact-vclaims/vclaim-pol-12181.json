Scott Walker is taking a pay raise while freezing salaries for state employees", "text": "The reaction to Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s state employee pay plan, which calls for no pay raises for state workers for the next two years, fell along party lines.\n\nRepublicans said it was a measure of continued tough economic times and tight budgets. Democrats and union leaders complained the pay freeze came on the heels of legislation passed by Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature that requires state workers to pay more for the health insurance and pensions.\n\nSome left-wing bloggers found even more reason for outrage.\n\nThey said that while the average state worker was being hit again, others -- including Walker -- weren\u2019t sharing the pain.\n\nOf course, Walker is the guy who as Milwaukee County executive liked to tout the fact he was giving back some of his salary. And as governor likes to note he\u2019s so frugal he brings a brown bag lunch to work. Nothing stirs up bloggers quite like the smell of hypocrisy in the morning.\n\nThe Cognitive Dissidence blog said this:\n\n\"It is noted that Walker is giving himself a $7,500 raise. Not only is he being overly generous to himself, but he is also lavishing the love on some of his top henchmen like Becky Kleefisch, J.B. Van Hollen and Mike Huebsch.\"\n\nAnother blog, Uppity Wisconsin, made a similar claim, saying Walker \"clearly thinks the hard-working, ultra-efficient, super-effective guy who's Wisconsin governor (that would be him, as defined by him) deserves a significant pay raise -- a 5.4 percent raise.\"\n\nThere were more examples, as the claim was picked up by other bloggers. Some reporters even contacted the governor\u2019s office to ask about the issue. Residents called the governor\u2019s office to register their complaints. And we received numerous emails -- from both sides -- urging us to sort it out.\n\nSo did the governor\u2019s compensation plan -- scheduled to take effect in January -- pad his own salary?\n\nWalker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the state\u2019s largest employee\u2019s union was to blame for spreading the misinformation. Marty Beil, executive director of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, AFSCME Council 24, issued a news release Oct. 28, 2011 that criticized Walker for taking a higher salary than his predecessor -- but that was after the blog posts and the initial outrage.\n\nSo we\u2019ll focus on the bloggers\u2019 pay raise claims.\n\nThe bloggers all cite this 184-page document which outlines Walker\u2019s overall compensation plan for state workers. It includes a chart (page 67) showing the salaries for the state\u2019s constitutional officers, such as state treasurer, secretary of state, attorney general and, of course, governor.\n\nFor each, an \"incumbent\u2019s salary\" as of July 5, 2009, is shown, with a line through it and another line shows the new pay rate as of Jan. 1, 2012.\n\nIn the case of the governor, the salary of $137,092 is shown with a line through it. The salary to take effect next year is listed as $144,423.\n\nA raise, right?\n\nThat\u2019s how the bloggers interpreted the chart.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how pay for elected officials is set. The state constitution bars elected officials from increasing their own pay. That\u2019s why changes are set before elections and always take effect in the future, when the new officials are in place.\n\nSo, Walker\u2019s pay was determined before Walker ever took office, according to state Legislative Reference Bureau.\n\nIndeed, the higher salaries were proposed by Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle\u2019s administration and approved by state lawmakers back in 2008. Under that measure, Walker is already being paid $144,423 and that salary will remain in effect -- with no change -- during the four-year term. The other constitutional officers will also receive flat pay.\n\nSo what of the chart that the bloggers referenced?\n\n\"We\u2019ve been getting a lot of confusion on this,\" said Tim Lundquist, a communications officer for the state Department of Administration, who pointed to the Office of State Employment Relations.\n\n\"The OSER people say this is the way it has to be drafted,\u2019\" Lundquist said.\n\nGreg Gracz, head of the employment relations office, tried to clarify matters with a memo Oct. 27 that said: \"No increases for rates for office for constitutional officers are proposed.\"\n\nBut his attempt with a chart to clear up the matter is equally misleading -- and incorrect.\n\nThat new chart shows the governor\u2019s pay under a column titled \"effective July 5, 2009\" as $144,423. It shows the same pay under another column, effective Jan. 1, 2012. That suggests to the average reader (or blogger) that Gov. Jim Doyle was paid that amount. He wasn\u2019t. The pay raise took effect when Walker took office.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nBloggers dug into the pay plan proposed by Walker and found what sure looked like the ultimate hypocrisy: the governor giving himself a raise while freezing state workers pay for two years.\n\nThe document they cited makes it look like there\u2019s a raise coming, but there is not. Elected officials cannot increase their own pay. A quick look at the Blue Book or a phone call to the Legislative Reference Bureau would have told them that. So there\u2019s no pay raise for Walker, or the lieutenant governor, state treasurer, secretary of state, and attorney general.\n\nAlthough the confusion is understandable because of a sloppy and confusing state compensation document (and an equally poor followup memo), it muddles things for residents.\n\nHere\u2019s the clearest answer possible: The claim is False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12181"}
