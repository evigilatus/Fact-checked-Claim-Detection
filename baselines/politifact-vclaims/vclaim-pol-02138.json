Experts told us this is common in politics, though the practice has come under criticism.\nCampaign fund-shifting\nRomney\u2019s failure to reach the White House in 2008 and 2012 is not without a silver lining. It elevated Romney\u2019s public stature, gave him staying power in Republican politics and left him with a substantial \u2014 and flexible \u2014 bankroll.\nCampaign finance rules have long allowed a candidate to hold on to surplus campaign funds indefinitely, said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at the group Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group.\nUnder the Federal Election Campaign Act and Federal Election Commission rules, candidates can also make unlimited transfers of funds between campaigns, Holman said.\n\"It happens all the time,\" said Michael J. Malbin, the executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a campaign finance policy think tank. \"House members take their bankrolls to run for the Senate, senators to run for president. As long as the money was raised for a federal office under federal contribution limits, it's okay.\"\nHolman argued just because the practice is widespread doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fair. He said the policy can create an uneven playing field and permits candidates to use funds in a way that\u2019s contrary to donors\u2019 intentions.\n\"A donor may have supported Romney\u2019s presidential campaign against the Democratic nominee, but not support Romney\u2019s new campaign for Senate in the primary or general election,\" Holman said. \"Yet, under the law, Romney has the authority to use those donors\u2019 funds without getting their approval.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
