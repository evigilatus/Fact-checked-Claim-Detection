No.", "text": ":: During the CNN Municipal Hall, the Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris answered a participant &apos; s question about how she would \"require the playground and empower the working woman\" if she won the presidency. Harris replied that it would encourage the amendment of equal rights and ensure that people fully understood the realities of the economy. Special attention was paid to workers with minimum wages. \"On average, women are paid 77 per cent for the dollar. And then if you look at African and Latin American women, even less, and do the same job. You're looking at the fact that we have a real fight in this country about the minimum wage and the need to increase the minimum wage. We should understand that the minimum wage is the minimum standard of living, but the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, an average of $15,000 per year, and the majority of women work at the minimum wage.\" One aspect of Harris' answer was problematic -- the part where she said that gender, racial and ethnic differences in wages were comparisons of \"doing the same job.\" As we have often noted, wage gaps are not calculated on the basis of apples to abrasions compared to the same jobs. Instead, it reflects the gross remuneration of all jobs occupied by men and women, which means that gender-based patterns in job selection - whether because of discrimination or voluntary choices - play a role in creating a wage gap. But here we're going to focus on a separate part of Harris' response -- the part where she said that \"the majority of women are lower paid workers.\" That's not true. According to the data of the Federal Office of Labour Statistics for 2017, the minimum wage or less was paid to 1,824,000 Americans. There are few exceptions to the Federal Minimum Wage Act, as is the case for students and workers who receive ex gratia payments. Of this group of minimum wage workers, 678,000 were men and 1,146,000 were women. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 20 January 2021, in 2017, the economy as a whole worked for some 72 million women, i.e. 1.6 per cent of all female workers were paid at or below the minimum wage. It is therefore wrong to say that \"the majority of women are lower paid workers.\" When we contacted Harris' campaign, Ian Sams' spokesman described it as a \"slipper on live TV.\" It meant that the majority of the minimum wage workers are women.\" That statement would be accurate. Using the figures mentioned above, women accounted for approximately 63 per cent of the lowest wage workers - a clear majority. In fact, we used to assess a similar statement that it was true. As evidence that it was an accident, Sams sent us several other examples of Harris using the talking point more accurately. However, Polyte Fruitte &apos; s policy is to evaluate the statement made at the forefront because the commentary has been seen by a large number of people. Our verdict, Harris, said, \"The majority of women are underpaid workers.\" This is not true; lower-paid workers in fact represent a very small proportion of all working women. Harris said she meant to say that most of the minimum wage workers are women, and that's the case -- 63% of the women. We're assessing her statement at the wrong CNN City Hall.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00724"}
