Marcy Kaptur is a big booster of her congressional district. During a May 17 appearance on C-SPAN, Kaptur described the reconfigured area that she\u2019ll represent if she wins her race against Republican Samuel \"Joe the Plumber\" Wurzelbacher as \"the crown jewels of Ohio.\"\n\nTo illustrate the area\u2019s industrial prowess, \u00a0Kaptur discussed how she enjoys pulling her car over beside the railroad tracks in Toledo and watching all the flatbeds go by, full of steel coils, bar steel and other metals bound for auto plants or gas drilling facilities elsewhere in Ohio.\n\nOne of Kaptur\u2019s boasts about the area\u2019s manufacturing accomplishments got PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s attention.\n\n\"The region I represent, both currently and in the future, has more automotive plants than the entire state of California,\" Kaptur said.\n\nCould the slice of Ohio that Kaptur now represents, as well as the new district that stretches along Lake Erie between Toledo and Cleveland, really have more auto plants than the nation\u2019s most populous state?\n\nGetting the answer was be easier than we thought.\n\nIt turns out that California no longer has any auto plants. The last car one - a joint venture between Toyota and General Motors in Fremont - closed in 2010. The Los Angeles Times said the plant\u2019s closure marked the \"the end of large-scale auto manufacturing in California, which over the years boasted a dozen or more plants building vehicles ranging from Studebakers to Camaro muscle cars.\" \u00a0\n\nToyota made Corollas cars and Tacoma pickup trucks at the plant in Fremont, while GM made Pontiac Vibes.\n\nGM dropped its portion of the plant in its bankruptcy. Then Toyota scrapped its portion. At the time, the United Auto Workers union criticized Toyota for the decision, saying it was dumping the plant because it was the company\u2019s only unionized facility in the United States.\n\nTesla Motors wants to \u00a0reopen that factory to manufacture its all-electric Model S sedan, but hasn\u2019t yet done so.\n\nThe district that Kaptur currently represents has four auto plants, according to her spokesman, Steve Fought: Chrysler\u2019s Toledo Supplier Park and Toledo North plants, \u00a0GM\u2019s Toledo Transmission plant, and KBI\u2019s bearing plant \u00a0in Sandusky. The new Ninth District will have three more: Ford\u2019s Brook Park Engine Plant, \u00a0Ford\u2019s Avon Lake plant, and GM\u2019s Parma Metal Center.\n\nThe number of auto plants in Kaptur\u2019s current and new congressional districts both exceed the number of auto plants in California - zero.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, Kaptur\u2019s claim rates True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11019"}
