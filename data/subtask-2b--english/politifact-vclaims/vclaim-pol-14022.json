Bob McDonnell says.\n\nDuring an Election Day interview, MSNBC \u00a0host Joe Scarborough hailed McDonnell as the \"Elvis\" of the job creation message that moved voters this fall. \"You started this in 2009 before anyone got this,\" Scarborough told the governor, referring to McDonnell\u2019s pledge to create jobs during his successful campaign last year.\n\nMcDonnell replied that since taking office in January, \"we\u2019ve been able to create about 60,000 net new jobs\" in Virginia.\n\nWe had two questions about McDonnell\u2019s statement: Is his number right; and how much credit does the governor deserve for any upswing in Virginia employment since he took office?\n\nWe first checked the claim of \"about 60,000 net new jobs.\" Stacey Johnson, McDonnell\u2019s press secretary, said the number came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nOur next call went to the office of Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, who heads McDonnell\u2019s jobs team. Randy Marcus, Bolling\u2019s chief of staff, compiles the job-creation figures for the administration. Marcus said he takes the most current BLS monthly figure for non-farm jobs in Virginia. Then he subtracts the number of non-farm jobs in Virginia in February, McDonnell\u2019s first full month in office. The remainder is what the administration considers to be Virginia\u2019s net job gain under McDonnell. It includes full and part-time jobs in the public and private sectors.\n\nWe ran the computation, based on the latest BLS numbers that had been posted more than a week before McDonnell\u2019s appearance on MSNBC. Here\u2019s our result:\n\nVirginia Workers, Sept. 2010 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03,637,200\nVirginia Workers, Feb. 2010 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03,581,800\nNet job gain under McDonnell \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a055,400\n\nThe governor\u2019s claim of creating about 60,000 new jobs was a tad inflated, but certainly in the ballpark.\n\nIn July, McDonnell claimed 71,500 new Virginia jobs had been created since he took office. We checked those numbers and found them dead on. Much of the job loss since then was caused by the layoff of federal census workers and the slowing of construction.\n\nMcDonnell also said on MSNBC that only Texas has gained more jobs than Virginia since February. He\u2019s right, according to BLS statistics. Texas has added 128,800 jobs since February.\n\nVirginia has experienced a 1.55 percent increase in jobs since February. That ranks sixth. The District of Columbia leads everyone with 2.38 percent growth.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at McDonnell\u2019s statement \"we\u2019ve\" created about 60,000 jobs. It suggests the new slots are the result of his administration\u2019s actions.\n\n\"It\u2019s not unique to the Governor, but it bothers me how all politicians take credit for creating jobs,\" said John Knapp, senior economist for the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at The University of Virginia. \"Barack Obama is not president of the economy and Bob McDonnell is not governor of the economy. Of course, what they do can have a marginal affect on things, but there are many other elements involved in creating jobs.\"\n\nKnapp added that state policies affect job creation development over the long run. \"But as year or two out, new state policies are not going to have a major impact on the economy.\"\n\nDuring recent decades, an array of prominent publications have consistently rated Virginia in the top handful of business-friendly states, noting the Commonwealth\u2019s low tax rates, \u00a0and laws barring compulsory union membership.\n\nJohnson said it is not McDonnell\u2019s intention to claim credit for all new jobs under his watch. \"It\u2019s a cumulative effort,\" she said. \"It\u2019s the private sector that creates jobs; government can merely help set a conducive climate.\"\n\nJohnson said that when McDonnell said \"we\u2019ve\" created about 60,000 net new jobs, \"he was referring to Virginia.\"\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that this February -- the month McDonnell uses as the starting benchmark for his administration\u2019s job efforts -- Virginia\u2019s unemployment rate was 7.2 percent, the highest in 28 years. The unemployment rate in September dipped to 6.8 percent, ranking Virginia as the eighth lowest state.\n\nThe national unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in February and 9.6 percent in September.\n\nThe vast majority of new Virginia jobs since February fell into one of three broad categories: leisure and hospitality; professional and business services; or trade, transportation and utilities.\n\nMcDonnell, a Republican, has been praised by legislators from both political parties for aggressively recruiting new businesses. \u00a0Over the first nine months of his administration -- starting in February, as the governor prefers -- the state has announced 186 business development deals promising 12,249 new jobs, according to statistics kept by the Virginia Economic Development Partnership.\n\nIn comparison, the state announced \u00a0213 development deals promising 11,656 new jobs during the final nine months of Gov. Tim Kaine\u2019s term, ending in January.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know how many how many of the jobs promised in state economic development announcements actually translate into employment gains recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many of the jobs are speculative and depend on construction and expansion of plants before people are hired.\n\nSo let\u2019s review.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the governor wants credit for the new jobs created in Virginia since February. But many factors beyond a governor\u2019s purview influence employment figures and Virginia has benefited a strong business climate for decades. Some of the jobs filled since McDonnell took office were no doubt spawned by economic developments deals announced Kaine. It\u2019s impossible to assign full credit to anyone.\n\nRegardless of credit, have \"about 60,000 net new jobs\" been created in Virginia since February? It depends how you measure \"about.\" The correct number at\u00a0 the time was 55,400. The governor was a little bit off, but he wasn\u2019t blowing smoke.\n\nFor that reason, we rate his claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14022"}
