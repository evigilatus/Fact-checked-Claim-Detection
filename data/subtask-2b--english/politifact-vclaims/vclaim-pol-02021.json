We have to break up families.\"\nBut there is no law that mandates separating children from their parents. Trump\u2019s own administration devised a policy to that effect.\nSo what is Trump talking about?\nWhenever parents are charged with a federal misdemeanor (entry without inspection in this case), or awaiting trial, they are placed in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Children cannot go to jail, so they are transferred to the custody of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement. They are then placed with relatives, juvenile detention centers or foster care. That\u2019s a longstanding Homeland Security policy, DHS told us.\nBefore the Trump administration, immigrants entering illegally as families were rarely prosecuted, said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute. Instead, immigrants were held in family detention centers until they were sent to appear before an immigration court or deported.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions\u00a0announced on April 6 the Homeland Security Department would now be referring all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for prosecution. Facing criminal charges, parents would go to detention centers, leaving their children unaccompanied.\nIt\u2019s the decision to prosecute parents that is causing the separations.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That\u2019s a choice they have made that\u2019s largely different from what other administrations have done,\" said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law.\nWhen we asked for evidence of policies separating families, the White House referred us to items determining what happens to unaccompanied immigrant minors. But none of the children in question would be deemed unaccompanied if the Trump administration did not decide to prosecute their parents.\nThe 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement, for example, calls for the release of unaccompanied minors to family members or sponsors who can care for them as their immigration case is resolved. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which Trump has wrongly called \"a Democrat rule,\" determines that unaccompanied minors be transferred to Health and Human Services\u00a0custody.\nThe White House argued such policies encourage parents to send their children into the United States, knowing they will be promptly released.\n\"The cruel and inhumane open borders policies of the Democratic Party are responsible for encouraging mass illegal migration, enabling horrendous child smuggling, and releasing violent MS-13 gang members into American communities,\" White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in an emailed statement.\nThe Trump administration may believe that Democrats are responsible for policies that encourage illegal border crossing, but we found no law mandating that children be separated from their parents.\nOur ruling\nTrump said a \"horrible law\" requires that children be separated from their parents \"once they cross the Border into the U.S.\"\nThere is no such law. The Homeland Security Department\u2019s longstanding policy is to separate children from their custodians when they are referred for criminal prosecution. Trump\u2019s administration has decided to prosecute all illegal crossings. Families were rarely prosecuted under previous administrations.\nWe rate this statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-05-29 21:32:28 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  A \"horrible law\" requires that children be separated from their parents \"once they cross the Border into the U.S.\"    Donald Trump President of the United States https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1000375761604370434   In a tweet Saturday, May 26, 2018 2018-05-26    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02021"}
