The Democrats allege Milne is spending corporate funds \"in service of boosting his name recognition for political gains.\"\n\"Advertisements for Mr. Milne\u2019s travel company allow Milne to illegally use corporate funds and skirt around campaign finance laws to boost his name recognition for political gain,\" party officials said in a statement.\nThe television ad featuring Milne does not make a reference to his political candidacy. In the advertisement, Milne says he hopes the Covid-19 pandemic will soon subside, and that a \"brighter day is on the horizon.\"\n\"When you are ready to travel again, we're right here, ready to help, just as we've been since 1975,\" Milne says.\nBut the Democratic Party charges that Milne's ad doesn't focus on his business, but his personal story.\u00a0\n\"It's in fact kind of a bio narrative that you would put in a campaign ad, so that's where the concern lies,\" R. Christopher Di Mezzo, a spokesperson for the party, said in an interview.\nThe current ad does not highlight Milne's backstory. But in 2016, when he was running for U.S. Senate, Milne also appeared in ads for his company, which mentioned that his parents founded the company in the 1970s.\nIs running and appearing in ads for his company while seeking the lieutenant governor's office really an illegal use of corporate funds, as the Democrats claim?\nThe Democratic Party pointed to federal and state campaign finance laws to back up their claim.\u00a0\nState law defines an \"electioneering communication\" as one that clearly refers to a candidate for office, and either supports, or opposes that candidate. Federal law has a similar definition: candidates and corporations must report expenditures that promote the election of candidates.\u00a0\nBut campaign finance experts said that just because Milne appears in ads for his company while running for office at the same time doesn\u2019t mean he is running afoul of the law.\u00a0\nBrian Porto, a professor at Vermont Law School who specializes in election law, said that after reviewing state statutes, he can\u2019t find \"clear evidence of a violation.\"\n\"He may be using \u2018corporate funds\u2019 from his company, but using your company's funds to promote your company's product -- in this case, travel services -- is perfectly legal,\" Porto said.\n\"Admittedly, Mr. Milne appears in the ads, but their purpose is to promote his company, not him,\" Porto said, adding he didn\u2019t see how the ads \"intend to promote [Milne\u2019s] candidacy.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n\nstated on October 1, 2018 in a speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"99 percent inequality.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Lola Duffort \u2022 October 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the viewer didn't already know that Milne was a candidate, she certainly wouldn't learn from the ad that he was a candidate,\" he said.\u00a0\nPorto noted that the advertisements could \"boost his general name recognition\" and suggested that an \"ethical compromise\" would be for Milne to not appear in them until after the election.\u00a0\nThe Vermont Secretary of State\u2019s Office referred to state elections statutes and declined to comment.\n\u00a0\nBurlington attorney and longtime Progressive John Franco, who has represented Vermont political candidates in campaign finance cases, called the Democrats' claim that the ads were an illegal use of corporate money \"BS.\"\nFranco said that he doesn't doubt that Milne might be trying to use the ads for a political advantage. But that doesn't mean he\u2019s violating the law. \u00a0\n\"I have no doubt that that's what's going on. But is it a campaign finance violation? No,\" Franco said. \"This complaint by the Democrats doesn't even meet the straight face test. There's nothing about this ad that's a campaign ad. It just isn't.\"\nJared Carter, a constitutional law professor at Vermont Law School, echoed that Milne may be running the ads to increase his name recognition. But he said Milne -- who has advertised his business for years in print, on radio and television -- is still engaging in \"protected commercial speech that is not connected to his campaign.\"\n\"So to say that Scott can't advertise the business that carries his name because he happens to be running for lieutenant governor, at least from a constitutional perspective, sounds dubious,\" Carter said. The ads never mention Milne\u2019s campaign, he noted.\u00a0\n\"It's virtually impossible, at least under their interpretation it would seem, for him to be able to advertise his business while also running for lieutenant governor,\" he added. \"So I think on the surface that's how it strikes me, as probably not with a lot of merit.\"\nMilne declined an interview request. In an email he said: \"Our ads are perfectly appropriate and will continue running their planned schedules.\"\nBrendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a campaign finance watchdog group, said questions about whether candidates seeking office can appear in ads for their businesses frequently come up at the federal level.\u00a0\nFischer said these cases rarely present a \"super clear line\" between an advertisement \"that does not constitute a federal electioneering in communication and an ad that could be construed as promoting the person's candidacy.\" He said Milne\u2019s ad occupied this \"gray area.\"\u00a0\nFischer said Milne opened the door to questions being raised by mentioning a \"pressing public, or political issue,\" referring to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0\n\"The connection between the content of the ad to sort of pressing political issues, and the naming of the candidate himself could be factors that would be considered,\" Fischer said.\u00a0\nDISCLOSURE: Milne Travel is an underwriter with VTDigger.\u00a0\nOur verdict\nThe Vermont Democratic Party said \"Advertisements for Mr. Milne\u2019s travel company allow Milne to illegally use corporate funds.\"\u00a0\nWhile Milne\u2019s ads may have the effect of boosting his name recognition, there is no support for the VDP\u2019s claim that the ads are illegal.\nDemocrats could and do argue that Milne is \"skirting\" the law by appearing in his company\u2019s advertisements while he is seeking public office.\n\u00a0\nBut legal experts say that unless the advertisements refer to Milne\u2019s candidacy, they would not violate Vermont campaign finance laws.\nWe rate the VDP\u2019s statement false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17669"}
