In a black-and-white video, Everlern is shocked to discover that his car was heisted after he left the keys inside while he walked into a convenience store.\nWe wondered if the situation in St. Petersburg can actually be this bad.\nLo and behold, it\u2019s worse.\nOut of the 551 cars stolen so far this year, 460 of them had keys either in the ignition or elsewhere in the vehicle, Police Chief Chuck Harmon said. That\u2019s 83.4 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I were a car thief, I\u2019d move to St. Petersburg,\" said Frank Scafidi, spokesman for the National Insurance Crime Bureau, when told of the numbers. Scafidi said the percentage might be a \"high-water mark\" in the country.\nOver the past several years, car technology has made vehicles harder to steal with screwdrivers and other tools. Many new cars have transponder keys, which means someone can\u2019t unlock or start the car unless the key fob is close to the vehicle. As a result, St. Petersburg has seen a 70 percent drop in auto thefts over the past decade, Harmon said.\nAs a result, people leaving their keys in their cars has become an increasing source of car thefts in the city. The thefts are crimes of opportunity, so 96 percent of cars are recovered later where the thief ran out of gas. Most area offenders are not trying to bring cars to chop shops or resell high-end models. People are just capitalizing on careless driver mistakes.\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 40 to 50 percent of auto thefts nationwide are due to keys in the car.\nJust lock your cars, people. As Harmon said, \"It\u2019s not rocket science.\"\nOne other note: It\u2019s technically illegal to leave your car unattended and running. So not only do you run the risk of having your car stolen, the police could issue you a ticket.\nOur ruling\nFoster said that 60 percent of car thefts occur because the owner left keys inside the vehicle. In St. Petersburg this year, it\u2019s actually 83.4 percent. An expert said that might be tops in the country.\nThe specific number aside, Foster\u2019s point that many auto thefts can easily be avoided is 100 percent on the mark.
