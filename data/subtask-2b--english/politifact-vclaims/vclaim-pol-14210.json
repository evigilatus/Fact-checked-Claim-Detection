It would have applied to pharmacists and other health care providers, but it did not become law.\n\nThe bill would have:\n\n\nExpanded the definition of employment discrimination. Specifically, it would have prohibited discriminating against a health care provider who refused, based on moral or religious grounds, to participate in certain medical procedures or health care-related activities.\n\n\n\nProhibited state regulatory agencies from disciplining a health care provider who made such a refusal.\n\n\nAsked to respond to the Planned Parenthood Advocates flier, Jill Bader, spokeswoman for Walker\u2019s gubernatorial campaign, said it was \"completely false\" that the bill had anything to do with birth control.\n\nBut news stories at the time described how Walker\u2019s bill targeted RU-486, an abortion pill, and the \"morning-after\" pill, which prevents a pregnancy. The articles also told how the proposal could have allowed pharmacists to refuse to dispense most other forms of birth control.\n\n\"Could\" and \"most\" are the operative words.\n\nBut both Harrington and Matt Sande of Pro-Life Wisconsin say the protections for pharmacists in Walker\u2019s bill would have applied to the dispensing of all types of birth control.\n\nBack to the claim about Walker.\n\nThe claim does not address pills or devices, but rather how pharmacists would have been allowed to function had the bill become law.\n\nPlanned Parenthood says flatly: Pharmacists would have been able to block women from getting birth control.\n\nIn truth, the effects would have been more limited.\n\nAn individual pharmacist could have refused to fill a particular birth control prescription. But women could have gotten the prescription filled by another pharmacist, perhaps at the same counter, or at another pharmacy. In many places, that might have amounted to an inconvenience, though in areas with few pharmacies, a refusal by one pharmacist could have created a bigger burden.\n\nAs for the 2010 race, both candidates have given their views on the issue: Barrett says he opposes efforts to allow pharmacists to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions; Walker says he supports allowing pharmacists to refuse to fill emergency contraception prescriptions on moral grounds.\n\nThe claim by Planned Parenthood is still off the mark.\n\nIn an effort to paint Walker as extreme, the group\u2019s lobbying arm says in a direct mail piece that Walker \"tried to pass a law to allow pharmacists to block women\u2019s access to birth control.\" That bill might have made it more difficult for some women to get contraceptives at some pharmacies, depending on who was on duty. But words matter -- the possible narrowing of access to birth control in some cases isn\u2019t the same as blocking it in all cases.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe rate the claim as Barely True.\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
