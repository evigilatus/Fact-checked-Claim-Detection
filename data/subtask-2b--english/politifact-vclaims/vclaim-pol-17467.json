In 2019, the administration added $16 billion.\nThat\u2019s a total of $28 billion in direct aid, which won\u2019t need to be repaid.\nThe GM bailout was different in both size and structure.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Palin\n\n\nstated on September 3, 2008 in a speech at the Republican Nationention in St. Paul, Minn.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Robert Farley \u2022 September 3, 2008\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObama and General Motors\nFiguring out the cost of GM\u2019s rescue is complex. The auto industry bailout effort began before Obama took office with a pair of emergency loans from President George W. Bush\u2019s administration for GM and Chrysler through the Troubled Asset Relief Program. With hundreds of thousands of jobs at stake, the new Obama administration in 2009 stepped forward with more TARP assistance, including critical debtor-in-possession financing to usher GM through bankruptcy.\u00a0\nWith much of its debt converted to stock during those proceedings, the U.S. Treasury emerged with a 60% ownership stake in the reorganized company, which went public again in November 2010. By the time GM sold all of its shares in 2013, the taxpayers had lost $11.2 billion on the bailout.\nIn all, the Bush and Obama administrations invested about $50 billion of TARP money into GM. But ultimately, only $6.7 billion was in loans, which GM repaid, with interest and five years ahead of schedule.\u00a0\nThe goal of the government investment \"was never to make a profit, but to help save the American auto industry, and by any measure that effort was successful,\" a U.S. Treasury Department spokesman said at the time.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claimed: \"Trump\u2019s farmer bailout is now twice the size of Obama\u2019s GM bailout. The big difference is GM paid their bailout back \u2014 with interest.\"\nThe Trump administration\u2019s assistance to farmers who have been hurt in the trade war with China is $28 billion \u2014 about half the size of the Treasury\u2019s $50 billion bailout of General Motors, not twice the size.\nOnly $6.7 billion of the bailout ended up as loans, which GM did pay back. But in the end, the government lost $11.2 billion in the bailout. Farmers are not expected to repay their aid.\nFor a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17467"}
