Rick Scott at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 11, 2012. As evidence for his claim, he cited the state\u2019s unemployment rate.\n\n\"In my first year in office, unemployment has dropped more than 2 percentage points, down from 12 percent to 9.9 percent, the second-largest drop in the nation,\" Scott said.\n\nWe wanted to know if Scott had his numbers right, particularly on whether Florida has seen the second-largest drop in the nation.\n\nWe should note that it\u2019s too early to say whether Scott should get credit for putting Florida\u2019s economy on the road to recovery. In the speech, he\u2019s clearly claiming some credit, but we\u2019ve examined Scott\u2019s campaign promise to create 700,000 jobs, and -- for a variety of reasons -- we\u2019ve rated it Stalled.\n\nHere, we\u2019re looking only at Scott\u2019s numerical claim, that unemployment is down during his first year in office, and that it\u2019s the second-largest drop in the country.\n\nTo check his claim, we turned to the U.S. Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nIn December 2010, the month before Scott took office, the unemployment rate was 12 percent. In December 2011, the most recent month for which statistics were available, the unemployment rate was 9.9 percent.\n\nSo unemployment dropped 2.1 percent.\n\nThe BLS also ranks states based on how much unemployment has fallen. Sure enough, Florida was in second place in December 2011, right behind Nevada, which dropped 2.3 percentage points, from 14.9 percent to 12.6 percent.\n\nWe should note that Florida\u2019s rate has dropped the second-most because the state\u2019s unemployment rate has been one of the highest in the nation. And even with the 2.1 percentage point decrease, Florida still has the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country. (Nevada is No. 1.)\n\nThat mitigates the significance of Scott's claim but not the veracity of it. We rate his statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11599"}
