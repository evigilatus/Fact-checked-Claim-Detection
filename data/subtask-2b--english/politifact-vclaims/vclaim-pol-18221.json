New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has made urgent calls for more ventilators to cope with a rising number of hospitalizations in his state due to coronavirus.\n\"All the predictions say you could have an apex needing 140,000 beds and about 40,000 ventilators,\" Cuomo told reporters March 27, citing estimates by Weill Cornell Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and McKinsey & Co.\nAnthony Fauci, a leading infectious-disease specialist who is on the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force, told CNN, \"There are a lot of different calculations. My experience, I tend to believe Gov. Cuomo.\"\u00a0\nThe exchange between Trump and Alcindor came during a March 29 Rose Garden press conference. It unfolded this way:\nAlcindor: \"You've said repeatedly that you think that some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don't actually need. You said New York might need \u2014\"\nTrump: \"I didn\u2019t say that.\"\nAlcindor: \"\u2014 might not need 30,000.\"\nTrump: \"I didn\u2019t say that.\"\nAlcindor: \"You said it on Sean Hannity\u2019s, Fox News.\"\nTrump: \"I didn\u2019t say \u2014 come on. Come on.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exchange continued, with Trump at one point telling Alcindor, \"Be nice. Don\u2019t be threatening.\" He later cut her off before she was able to ask her second question, although another reporter subsequently handed her the microphone so that she could ask it.\nHere, we\u2019ll look at the substance of the dispute between Trump and Alcindor. Which of them was right about what he said during a March 26 phone interview on Hannity\u2019s show on Fox News?\u00a0\nAlcindor was.\nWhen we looked at Trump\u2019s interview with Hannity, we found two portions in which Trump addressed this question.\nHere\u2019s the first:\n\n\"Gov. Cuomo and others that say we want, you know, 30,000 of them (ventilators). 30,000! All right. Think of this. You know, you go to hospitals, they'll have one in a hospital. And now, all of a sudden everybody's asking for these vast numbers.\"\n\nLater, Hannity picked up on this theme. Hannity said he was \"kind of angry at Andrew Cuomo. I had a great \u2014 I had him on radio for 40 minutes, great conversation. I grew up in \u2014 I was born and raised in New York. And then it's, \u2018I need 30,000 ventilators.\u2019 And I'm like OK, it really \u2014 it was annoying me.\"\nTrump subsequently echoed this sentiment.\n\n\"New York is a bigger deal. But it's going to go also. But I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be. I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you're going to major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. And now, all of a sudden, they're saying, can we order 30,000 ventilators?\"\n\nSo, contrary to Trump\u2019s repeated denials during the press conference, this passage clearly shows that the president told Hannity that he feels the numbers of ventilators being requested by governors, including Cuomo, are higher than what\u2019s needed.\nOur ruling\nTrump told Alcindor that \"I didn\u2019t say that\" some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don't actually need.\nThat\u2019s directly refuted by Trump\u2019s comments during Hannity\u2019s show, in which he said, \"I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be. I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.\"\nWe rate the statement Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18221"}
