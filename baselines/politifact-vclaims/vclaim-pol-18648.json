Around the 15:20 mark of the CNBC interview, a similar line can be seen on the neck of journalist John Harwood, who was interviewing Biden in a pub (remember, it\u2019s pre-pandemic). As Biden speaks and moves around in his seat, the line of the shadow also changes.\u00a0\nThe beginning of the CNBC interview also includes an opening montage that\u2019s been edited out of the version posted on YouTube. It shows Biden mingling with other patrons and, away from whatever lighting was shining on Biden during the interview, the shadow isn\u2019t there.\u00a0\nThere is no evidence that someone wearing a Biden mask has given interviews to the media pretending to be the presidential nominee.\u00a0\nWe rate these posts Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18648"}
