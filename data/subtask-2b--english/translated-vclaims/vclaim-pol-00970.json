But is it true that Wisconsin drivers have the biggest headache on the highway in the Midwest? Craig Thompson, nominated by Goof. Tony Evers to lead the Department of Transport, believed: On 20 February 2019, Thompson testified before the Senate Transport Committee, saying that \"by all standards\" the Wisconsin transport system \"regresses,\" according to a report by the Associated Press Agency. How bad is it? Referring to the report of the Office of Legislative Audit, he said that the state of highways in Wisconsin among neighbouring States was \"not only the worst, but even worse, with a margin of separation.\" Is he right? Let us move quickly to road finance issues. Thompson led the Wisconsin Transport Development Association, an organization representing road builders and local governments, among others. It has long been called for an increase in the income of transport projects. The organization was behind the campaign \"Just Fix it,\" which during the 2018 elections led to more road spending. Some considered this effort to be an effort against the Government of the Republic. (Scott Walker) \u2219 (Thomson) said that lifting the gas tax or increasing licence plates registration fees would be necessary to find a long-term solution for road projects. The majority leader of the Senate, Scott Fitzgerald, R-Jonao, said that Thompson's road-building ties were harassing some members of his group who believed that the Department of Defense was already spending a lot. Tell the senators that the budget will give priority to the rehabilitation of existing roads and infrastructure before addressing new projects. \"We still need an additional 360-400 million dollars in the biennium just to maintain the current level of state highway status\" said Thompson at the Senate session, according to the report of Radio Wisconsin General. \"This does not begin with the reconstruction of the interstate system, which still needs to happen or assist local government units.\" When asked to support the Thompson Statement by the Office of the Ombudsman-Designate, he referred to a report issued by the Office of Legislative Audit in January 2017. The report details the state of highways in the Midwest as measured by the international roughing index. The highway gauge is a measure of the pavement condition required by the Federal Highway Administration. This is the only measure used by all states, and therefore the only way to compare apples and apples with the condition of the pier, as the Thompson office said. In 2009, the State Department of Transport began using the index, developed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The Department uses this catalogue to assist in the identification of future highway projects and necessary maintenance. The latest information was available at the 2014 audit of the Office of Legislative Audit. On January 10, 2021, in a television interview, \"It takes a long time on election day to download those cards, which is why we have 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. to throw the ballot papers at Milwaukee.\" \u2022 January 15, 2012, the report shows that only 32.2 percent of the highways in Wisconsin were rated in good condition. * Michigan 73.8% * Illinois 66.1% * Minnesota 64.6% * Iowa 55.3% in fact, the other states of the Middle West were also much higher than Wisconsin. For example, Indiana and Ohio each had at least 75 percent of their methods in good condition. In the United States in general, 63.4 per cent of highways are classified in good condition. While the report is the most recent available report, it should be noted that it is based on information for 2014 and that the picture may have changed since then in other States. Another measure provides some perspective on the rate of roads within the State. In an article on September 18, 2018, the Cap Times noted that another report, \"Transfer Wisconsin by Numbers,\" found that 55 per cent of the main roads in Wisconsin that had been maintained had a pier that was in poor condition and 19 per cent in medium condition. The report was compiled by the National Group for Research in Non-Profit Transport, using the 2016 data provided annually by the Ministry of Transport to the Federal Highway Administration in its analysis of road conditions and pavement. The report says that Milwaukee is the worst, with a poorly estimated pier on 54% of the city's main roads. In Madison, 49 percent of the roads have a pier in bad condition. The company estimated that a Meloukee driver spent $944 on vehicle repair and maintenance due to road quality, while a Madison driver spent approximately $910. Our assessment of Thompson said among neighbouring countries, the state of the Wisconsin highways was \"not only the worst, but worse through the margin of the gap.\" A report by the Office of Legislative Audit found that only 32.2 per cent of the highways in Wisconsin were in good condition, much lower than those in neighbouring states, Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota. All these states have at least 55 per cent of highways in good condition. So, the claim is accurate -- although the data, their history is good. Our definition is often true that the statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information, and this puts Thompson in the driver's seat with his claim.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00970"}
