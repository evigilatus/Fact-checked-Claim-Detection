This is what the rumors of viral social media claim. The rumors, which spread for years, say lines around different parts of the cup actually set specific measurements. This allegation has recently re-emerged on Facebook, over 2,700 shares, over 1,000 reactions and hundreds of comments in just a few days. The article says, \"I was today's age when I found out that these lines are actually measurements! Who knew?\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the original Solo Cup lines are very close to the graphs (which have since been redesigned) were not intended to measure. According to Margo Boraji, the contact manager of Dart Wainer, the parent company of Solo Cups, the lines on the signature cup were a meaningful part of the design, but for a variety of reasons. The design of the first Sulu was very deliberate. When SOLO designed the Iconian Red Cup in 1976, each detail served a purpose and still does to this day, \"Borage wrote in the e-mail. \"The wrapped edge makes it easier to sip your drink, but also prevents a pile of SOLO cups from staying together. The crowded base makes the trophy more solid and less likely to crack. And those extra lines keep your fingers from slipping while you carry the cup. So while the lines were not intended for measurement, they were a very meaningful part of the design.\" The fact-finding leaflets mentioned in Facebook on January 11, 2021 in an article in Facebook by Nancy Belosi are no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021 this special article in Facebook does not mention alcohol, but there is a common difference in rumors that the minimum is 1 ounce of wine, the middle line is 5 ounces of wine, and the upper line is 1 12 ounces of beer. Borage told Bolivi Fuckett that the lines on the original Solo Cobb are about 1, 5 and 12 ounces, but that means something different for everyone. For some, it means they'll be held responsible at their next rear gate. For others, this means a safer grip while they drink the grill at BBQ. And for our little fans, that means they can stack and unpack our glasses in a pyramid without sticking to each other. Soon after the rumors began in 2012, Solo published a theatre drawing on her Facebook page that reveals the \"real\" use of lines on the original company's trophy. \"What is the real use of the lines on the original Solo Cup?\" They wrote in the mail. \"To measure chocolate drinks, of course! These are some fun suggestions from us, but we want to know your suggestions. Hang down!\" Our rule was an old trick that reappeared on social media, claiming that the lines on the original Solo cup were created to determine specific measurements. While measurements were not quite stopped, setting the specific lines on the original Solo Cup had several objects, such as improved capture, stacking, and dwarfing.
