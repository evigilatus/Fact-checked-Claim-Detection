Tony Evers and Republican legislative leaders are back at the drawing table after months without speaking to each other in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.\nEvers met with Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and incoming Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu on Nov. 20, 2020, to discuss the governor\u2019s proposed COVID-19 relief package. The meeting came days after Vos held a news conference to discuss \"new legislative initiatives.\"\nThe talking and jockeying comes as the state\u2019s case counts continue to rise, with daily deaths topping 100 for the first time on Nov. 24, 2020.\nIn a Nov. 22, 2020, interview with WKOW, Vos expressed a desire to find common ground with the governor and put politics behind them. But his comments took a partisan tone as he shifted the blame for months of inaction away from Republicans.\u00a0\n\"We passed one of the first (COVID-19) bills in the entire country, empowering Gov. Evers to act,\" he said.\u00a0\nIs Vos\u2019 recounting of history correct?\nOne of the first?\nEvers signed a COVID-19 relief package on April 15, 2020, the day it reached his desk and 14 days after Republicans first began drafting legislation and weeks after the governor offered his own proposal to legislative leaders.\u00a0\nBy then, many other states had already begun tackling the pandemic.\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 36 states and territories had adopted or enacted 174 COVID-19-related measures by April 14. Nearly 60 were resolutions that didn\u2019t carry the weight of law but handled legislative housekeeping and, in Alabama, urged residents to bump fists instead of shaking hands.\u00a0\nThe remainder were bills that governed the pandemic response in the respective states.\nAlaska and Massachusetts changed rules around unemployment benefits. New Jersey banned evictions during public health emergencies. Minnesota and Vermont enacted comprehensive response packages. Several legislatures moved money around to manage the pandemic, while others addressed specific issues such as student meals, price gouging and coverage for telehealth services.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVos spokeswoman Kit Beyer pointed to the database as evidence for the speaker\u2019s claim, but in reality, it undermines his position.\u00a0\u00a0\nEmpowering Evers\nThe rest of Vos\u2019 claim suggests the COVID-19 relief package empowered Evers to act.\n\"The legislation gave the governor broad authority to respond to the coronavirus and ensured that Wisconsin received more federal dollars, especially in the areas of unemployment insurance and health care (Medicaid) funding,\" Beyer said.\nBut this too is off base.\nThe relief package did facilitate the transfer of CARES Act funds, allowing the state to capture additional federal Medicaid dollars. But $25 million in federal funding for unemployment went out the window because lawmakers didn\u2019t pass a piece of legislation quickly enough.\nWhat\u2019s more, state statute already granted Evers the authority to declare public health emergencies, issue orders and distribute $2 billion in federal dollars without the legislature\u2019s approval. The relief bill didn\u2019t do any of that.\nOur ruling\nIn a recent interview, Vos claimed \"we passed one of the first (COVID-19) bills in the entire country, empowering Gov. Evers to act.\"\nThis is wrong on both fronts.\u00a0\nWisconsin lagged behind many other states in passing COVID-19 legislation, to the point where lawmakers lost out on federal aid for unemployment. And Evers\u2019 ability to manage health emergencies came from state law already in place when the pandemic hit.\nWe rate Vos\u2019 claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18576"}
