The Republican Party of Florida, on behalf of Brandes, is attacking McLaughlan, a professor of political science at the University of South Florida - St. Petersburg, in a case where voters are subject to most attention -- their governors. In a television commercial launched at the Tampa Bay Market on September 22, 2014, Brands suggested that McLaughlan wanted to break down with Orthodox Florida through government income tax support. A similar claim was made by postmarks sent to voter homes. The ad -- who shows the actors who pretend to be students being tested by a teacher -- says, \"McLauchlan was part of a group supporting the imposition of a state income tax on Floridaans.\" He goes on to say, \"McLauchlan: personal bankruptcy and a new State income tax.\" Indicting an opponent of his desire to raise taxes is the 101st political campaign, but is Maclachlan really connected to people who want to tax Floridans at state level? :: The unfortunate facts of McLaughlan &apos; s response to the announcement the day after he appeared, issued a press release calling it a \"bad attack\" using \"unproven lies.\" \"I disagree, I will always oppose, and I have always opposed the State income tax,\" I declared. The declaration also mentions her personal bankruptcy, which blames McLaughlan for paying high health insurance premiums and performing surgery when she was a graduate student in the 1990s. She said that the debt was excessive, even after becoming an employee, so she applied for bankruptcy 16 years ago. She says she's fixed her credit since then and she's free of debt. So where did Brands and Gob get the state's income tax idea? If you look at the beautiful printing, he reads that Mclauchlan \"has served on the Board of Directors of the Association of Women Voters.\" The ad uses its campaign site as a source. As a non-partisan political organization, the Association of Women Voters itself has focused on the development of informed policy positions and voter participation. They do not support candidates, and members of any political party may join them. The spokesman for McLaughlan explained that she was currently a member of the board of directors of the St. Petersburg branch from 2009-11, and that she was working mostly on voter registration initiatives. It also ran the candidates &apos; forums between 2011 and 2013. The Florida Chapter of the Group stated its position on this issue in its most recent guide on policy positions: \"The Union supports the adoption of a State personal income tax as part of a balanced and equitable tax structure.\" The booklet indicates that this position was recently reviewed in 1991, although since a study conducted in 1966-67, it has been argued that a State-wide source of funding \"will be both equitable and generate sufficient income is a personal income tax.\" In 2017, under the Tax Act 2017, \"persons receiving less than $75,000 will raise their taxes in 2021 and every two years thereafter until 2027.\" However, it is not accurate to say the \"support\" group, because while the Federation examined the case and found a proper alternative to income tax, it does not press for change or pay it as part of a legislative agenda. They provide views on policy issues, but do not propose processes for changing laws. We asked the Brands campaign to explain their argument. They referred to the requirements of some members on the website of the St. Pete Branch: First, that members of the local chapter are also part of the State and national organizations, and that the group is \"open to all who participate in the mission, principles and policies of the Association of Women Voters.\" Second, the site says members can't contradict the group. \"When an association (local, state or national) takes a position on a case, members may not identify themselves as members of the association in expressing publicly an opinion contrary to the position of the association,\" reads the site. The President of the Association of Women Voters of Florida Deirdre McNab said that this did not mean that members could not differ, but could not contradict the positions of the Association as spokesperson for the organization, such as serving as a member of the Governing Council. If a member of the board of directors of any branch decides to run for political office, he or she must resign from the board, although he or she may remain in the association. McNab said: \"There is no requirement for members to agree to every position taken by the Association,\" noting that the Brands campaign misunderstands the guidelines they cited. \"We have local union presidents speaking on behalf of the union, but we encourage our members to think about what they want to think.\" McNab said that the tax had not been studied since the 1990s. She felt that most economists agreed to a State-wide income tax that was much more equitable than the State &apos; s current policies, relying disproportionately on sales taxes, retrogressive taxes, and property taxes. (Nan Rich claimed earlier this year that Florida had the third most regressive tax structure in the country, an allegation that we considered to be mostly true. McNab said that the issue was not raised in any case because the State Constitution contained provisions prohibiting the imposition of an income tax. Doris Weatherford, a writer, a woman historian and a member of the Association met with MacLaughlan through her campaign, says that the group does not actively support government income tax. The Association has taken only an informed position on a policy position, as it has done with countless other issues. \"In the case of income tax, the position is that this is the most just way, but we didn't work on it,\" said Weatherford. \"It's been 25 years since it was part of the platform, but even then, he hasn't said we're gonna work for it, and it's still not.\" Our verdict said McLaughlan was part of a group supporting a government income tax on Floridian. This is an extension. The group was the Florida Women Voters &apos; Association, which concluded -- almost a quarter of a century ago -- that government income tax would be a more equitable way of collecting revenue for State programmes. The group has not struggled to achieve this goal (or even reconsider its position for years) and McLaughlan, as a member of the group, is not obliged to adopt a position on this issue. It denies that it supports this. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07206"}
