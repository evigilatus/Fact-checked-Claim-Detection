We are the No. 1 producer of firs, pines and spruce, beating out all other states in providing the scented, festive trees that grace many homes this season.\n\nPerhaps in honor of that distinction, U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley helped pushed a resolution claiming the first full week of December 2011 as \"National Christmas Tree Week.\" The resolution notes that there are close to 15,000 farms growing Christmas trees in the United States and that there are roughly 100,000 people employed in the real tree industry.\n\nThe resolution also states that Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states.\n\nApparently, this is a common statistic repeated in Christmas tree fun facts around the country. But we had to think about it. Are there really Christmas tree farms in tropical Hawaii? What about in sunny New Mexico?\n\nThe claim kind of made sense -- where else would people living in those states get their trees? -- but we had to check. \u00a0\n\n\"Well, it's one of those things I \u2018know, but can't technically verify,\u2019\" said Rick Dungey of the National Christmas Tree Association, a trade group for real farm-grown trees. He directed us to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which conducts a census survey of farms every five years, the most recent in 2007.\n\nOregon led with 6.8 million trees harvested in 2007, out of 17.4 million nationwide. Alaska, Nevada and Wyoming were at the bottom, with zero cut trees harvested. So maybe Oregon\u2019s junior senator had his facts wrong?\n\nWe called Catherine Howard, publisher of Christmas Trees Magazine, a trade publication for growers. She said she didn\u2019t know whether there are tree farms in all 50 states, but she suspects there may not be many -- or any -- growers in the Dakotas or in Montana.\n\n\"You never hear about them; they're just not involved,\" she said. \"And, probably, I'm guessing Arizona and New Mexico... it's very hard to grow Christmas trees in the Southwest.\" \u00a0\n\nSo now we\u2019d stumbled upon new states that may lack tree farms, but nothing definite yet. We continued sleuthing.\n\nThere are several websites where you can find a place in your state to buy fresh cut trees. The National Christmas Tree Association did not list any members in Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota or Alaska. But of course, the sites are not comprehensive.\n\nWe plugged Alaska into the Christmas Tree Farm Network, and we found Bob Smith -- owner of Bob Smith\u2019s Minnesota Christmas Trees in Anchorage. That\u2019s right. Alaskans have flocked to him since 1962 to buy Balsam firs and Scotch pines from Minnesota.\n\nSmith said he didn\u2019t know of any tree farms in Alaska, either, but there may be a small tree farmer he\u2019s missed. Anyway, why are Christmas trees hard to grow in Alaska? It takes a long time, he said. \"The ground never gets that warm. They get a lot of daylight in the summer, but they never get that warm.\"\n\nNext, we turned to the dry Southwest where we found several listings for cut holiday trees in Arizona. Mast-Roth Farms looked promising. We found the store online and learned that the family behind Mast-Roth has proudly \"been bringing highest-quality Oregon Christmas Trees to the greater Phoenix area for over 30 years.\"\n\nWell, so much for locally grown in Phoenix. But then again, where else are Oregon Christmas trees to go? We\u2019re not expected to consume one third of the country\u2019s cut holiday trees, are we?\n\nFinally, we received a call from Alex Minchenkov, public affairs specialist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s National Agricultural Statistics Service. He confirmed that as of 2009 there were no cut Christmas tree farms in Wyoming or North Dakota. Utah was near the bottom of the list with two tree farm operations. The numbers, he acknowledged, may not include small-scale farmers.\n\nWhich brings us to our final point. Even though Merkley\u2019s resolution highlights commercial Christmas tree farms, his statement honors the tree itself. And people in Alaska, Arizona and Nevada can always get a permit and cut their own tree from a forest.\n\nMerkley spokesman Jamal Raad points out exactly that: \"The resolution says Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states, not that there are Christmas tree farms in all 50 states, which may or may not be true.\"\n\nWe could downgrade Merkley for his statement, because we\u2019re not sure there are tree farms in all 50 states, and the resolution emphsizes commercial tree farms. But that would be so Grinch-like. Instead, we rule the statement True. Christmas trees grow in all 50 states, and they bring a lot of joy to families in the United States.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to OregonLive to comment.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11896"}
