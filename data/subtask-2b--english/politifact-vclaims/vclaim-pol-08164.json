ChangeAustin.org said in its Feb. 26, 2014, email blast that Eckhardt, who served as the Precinct 2 county commissioner from 2007 through May 2013 before resigning to run for judge, \"refused to take her own pay increases repeatedly.\"\nBy email, a founder of the group, Brian Rodgers, said that he knew Eckhardt did so because he closely observed the commissioners court during her time there.\nGenevieve Van Cleve, a consultant to Eckhardt\u2019s campaign, suggested we asked Leslie Browder, who manages budget and planning for the county, about Eckhardt\u2019s pay-raise history.\nBy email, Browder sent us a chart showing each commissioner\u2019s salary since 2007 plus several county public-notice advertisements related to pay raises approved by the commissioners court during Eckhardt\u2019s tenure.\nEckhardt, who won re-election in 2010, had her annual pay bump up twice in her tenure. According to the chart, her salary went from $83,716 to $86,646 in October 2008 and to $88,812 as of two years later through her resignation in 2013.\nOver the period, according to the chart, the commissioners court approved four pay raises for the four commissioners. If Eckhardt\u2019s salary had risen along with that of two colleagues who similarly started at $83,716, Precinct 1 Commissioner Ron Davis and Precinct 4 Commissioner Margaret Gomez, it would have been $98,463 as of October 2013, nearly $10,000 more than it was.\nBut Eckhardt didn't always say no to higher pay.\nThe chart and the public-notice ads, which appeared in the Austin Chronicle, indicate that Eckhardt completely declined a raise in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2013. However, Eckhardt accepted percentage increases equal to the percentage increases approved for all the commissioners as of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2011, though she did not sign off on catching up to the highest commissioner salaries.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowder confirmed that analysis.\nEckhardt\u2019s pay actually varied a bit more, though we didn\u2019t spot anything indicating she slipped in a pay raise extra. A chart and other documents emailed to us by the county auditor, Nicki Riley, show that Eckhardt\u2019s annual pay in her years as a commissioner bounced from $83,716 to $90,109 to $79,890 and then $88,812.\nSome of this variation ties to the the auditor\u2019s chart covering calendar years, combining different fiscal years, which begin in October. Also, Eckhardt told us by phone, she was mistakenly paid more than she wanted to receive in fiscal 2009. She said that she subsequently repaid the county to keep her pay through the fiscal year at $86,646. Van Cleve emailed us a copy of a Sept. 3, 2010, memo from Eckhardt to Charles Vaughn, then the county\u2019s payroll manager, \u00a0stating: \"I was paid $90,108.76 in FY09 although my advertised salary was ($)86,646. I therefore include the enclosed check for the difference of $3,462.76 written to the county.\"\nPer her past pay, Eckhardt otherwise deferred to Browder.\nOur ruling\nChangeAustin.org said that as a Travis County commissioner, Eckhardt \"refused to take her own pay increases repeatedly.\"\nIn two fiscal years, 2008 and 2013, Eckhardt completely declined pay raises, while in fiscal 2009 and 2011, she accepted percentage raises equal to the percentage hikes approved for all commissioners, though Eckhardt's pay did not catch up to the highest level she could have reached.\nWe see this claim as partly accurate and rate it Half True.\n\nHalf True \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08164"}
