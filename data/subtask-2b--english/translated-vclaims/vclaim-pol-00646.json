Texas took out more of the Confederate effects than the other states.", "text": "Following several outstanding efforts to remove the features and other symbols associated with the Confederation from cities throughout Texas, the Senate approved a bill that would limit the ability of State agencies, cities, districts and public universities to remove or change these monuments. Mr. Brandon Creighton, author of the draft law, said that it was important for people to remember the history of their nation and State - good and evil. \"Every month, I see a new story about a historic monument destroyed or removed,\" said from the Senate Hall on Tuesday. \"It's happening all over the country, and Texas actually drives the number of traces that have been removed. The 1663 Senate Bill will protect all traces.\" It may be true that Texas is leading in the number of traces removed, but it is also true that he was among the states with most of the Confederate symbols at first. The deportations began after Charleston Erin Wilson, a Critton spokesman, said that the information came from an article in Austin American - a statesman who said that Texas had removed more federal symbols than any other state since 2015. The story cited a report prepared by the Poverty Law Centre of the South that considered the rise in local efforts to remove the monuments and monuments associated with the Confederation after a white gunman had shot and killed nine people in a black church in Charleston, S.S., in 2015. According to the study, at one time 32 states in the State had federal symbols on display in public places. Only Kansas and Massachusetts, each with one symbol, removed all public memorials in honour of the Confederation. The Centre calls for the removal of the antiquities and symbols of the Federation from public places. The report, originally published in 2016 but constantly updated, found that between June 2015 and last February 114 federal symbols were removed throughout the country, including monuments, flags, names of many schools and roads. However, the Creighton claim has not been limited to removals since 2015, so we have considered all the removals recorded by the Southern Poverty Law Center in a data set facing the public with the clearances dating back to 1880. In Texas, 34 codes linked to the Confederation were listed and removed, about 27% of all these codes were removed throughout the country. This 34 represents about 14% of 240 union symbols registered in Texas before any removal - the second largest number of symbols in any state in the nation. Virginia is the only country with more Confederate codes than Texas: it had 262 before the removal of 15, all in the years following the shooting in Charleston. On January 22, 2021, in a tweet, Joe Biden said, \"more operational operations have been issued than anyone in such a short period of time, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone else.\" \"Texas is the clear leader of all the states of America that removed the Confederate monuments from the public lands,\" said Kimberly Allen, spokesman for the Center. Texans removed 9 of the 76 Confederate-related monuments (these figures are included in the total number of symbols explored above) - about 19 per cent of all monuments removed at the national level. Before any clearances occurred, three states had more than Texas: Georgia with 117 (3 since removed), Virginia with 111 (1 removed) and North Carolina with 100 removed. Texas has also removed a larger share of state-wide milestones from almost every other state, with some exceptions. Texas removed about 12% of its federal profile across the state. Given the states with at least 10 effects to begin with, only two removed a larger share of their features: Florida and Missouri. They both removed about 19% of their tracks. Florida had 31, Missouri had 13. In some \"removals,\" at least two schools with Confederate-related names on the law centre list were marked \"degradation,\" although the schools were closed for reasons unrelated to their names. The Fort Davis High School was closed in 2014 and the Robert E. Lee Primary School in Marshall was closed in 2017, when the province consolidated its primary education into three new schools. Allen said that the list was intended to track the symbols that still existed on public land, so it covered all decodes in the study, regardless of the reason. Allen said in an e-mail: \"The SPLC does not treat the nature of the removal in our schedule, just whether the code is active or removed.\" \"This ensures that we keep an accurate and up-to-date record of the Confederate symbols on public land.\" It should also be noted that at least one symbol in Texas was inaccurately described as active, when it was already removed in 2014: Robert E. Lee Rudd in El Paso, renamed Buffalo Solier Rud. However, the list of the legal status of the fight against poverty in the South is the most comprehensive one that has been compiled from the symbols found in the Confederation and removed from it in public places. Our judgment said, \"Texas is actually leading to the number of traces removed.\" The Creighton claim was based on an active study by the Southern Poverty Law Center of the commemorative monuments, monuments and other symbols of the Confederation that were removed or are still in existence. The study showed that Texas, which is among the states with the most Confederate symbols to begin with, has removed more symbols and landmarks than any of the 32 states with such symbols. We're assessing this claim right. The truth is - the statement is accurate and nothing important is missing.
