To combat this problem, Congress approved a program and NASA scientists spent a decade and over $165 million developing a pen that writes at zero gravity, upside down, on almost any surface and at temperatures ranging from less than freezing to more than 300 Celsius. The Russians used your tax pencil back in April. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the prosecution presents a good story, it has been dismantled several times. According to NASA, both American astronauts and Soviet astronauts used pencils in their first space missions. In fact, NASA requested 34 mechanical pens from Houston Camera Engineering for the Gemini Project, the second human space flight programme in 1965 and 1966. However, the total cost was $4,382.50 - or $128.89 - for the pencil. This was followed by a public protest, and NASA began to look for a cheaper option for future flights. (Nassa also became particularly cautious about allowing the entry of flammable objects such as pencils after a fire in 1967 on the Apollo 1 test mission, resulting in the death of three astronauts.) Fisher and his company, Fisher Penn, designed a pen that would work better in space. On January 10, 2021, the company sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he adhere to the proven democratic playbook.\" However, none of these funds came from NASA or Congress, according to multiple sources, including NASA and Fisher, now called Fisher Space Penn. In 1965, Fisher obtained the patent for the space pen, which used a compressed ink cartridge and could be written upside down, underwater, in other liquids and at maximum temperatures ranging from minus 50 degrees F to 400 degrees F. Because of the earlier controversy, however, NASA reports in its own account that it was \"hesitating in its approach.\" After a series of tests, NASA managers agreed to equip astronauts with an anti-gravity Fisher pen, and in 1967, the Space Agency purchased about 400 pens at $6 per unit. In 1969, the Soviet Union also purchased 100 Fisher pens and 1,000 ink cartridges for use on its Soyuz space flight. According to Santvik American, in the end NASA and the Soviet Space Agency bought pens at $2.39 per pen. In the 50 years that followed, both American astronauts and Soviet/Russian astronauts continued to use Fisher pens. Our ancient legend that NASA and Congress spent more than $165 million to develop the space pen while the Russians simply used pencils. At first, both space programmes used pencils. In the end, they both started using Fisher's space pen, which was developed and funded with private funds, not government funds. We're assessing this story wrong.
