Rick Scott. Christ was supported by the Family Planning Organization (despite his mixed record of abortion in the past), he pledged to press for equal pay for women, and is now attacking Scott's record of funding rape crisis centres. Christ also received support from democratic women, such as the Republic of the United States of America, Louis Frankle, and D-West Palm Beach. Frankel recently wrote an e-mail campaign fundraiser attacking Scott, which was e-mailed by Christ's campaign. \"If Rick Scott wins, the next four years will be difficult for Floridaans,\" said Frankel in an e-mail on September 12, host, \"finally closed down 30 women's health care centres throughout the state.\" This allegation called for a thorough examination of the O-Meter Fact Sheet -- and soon we diagnosed the heart of the problem in Frankel's words. :: Women &apos; s health-care centres with which we have contacted Frankel and Christ &apos; s campaign. Neither of them was able to provide evidence for closed health care centres. Christ's campaign admitted that the statement was wrong. \"This should have been as follows: \"The funding has been reduced to 30 rape crisis centres throughout the state,\" said Christ Brendan Gilvillen's campaign spokesman. This response was sent to us by Frankel Magda Sarkic's spokesman: \"The issue here is not about the wording of the e-mail. It's about Rick Scott denying Florida women and more specifically victims of sexual violence the health care they need and deserve.\" The statement that Scott shut down 30 women &apos; s health centres is therefore entirely wrong. We then decided to look into what happened to finance the rape crisis centres under Scott's rule. The State finances rape crisis centres through various vessels of money. It is part of the Trust Fund for Rape Crisis, which comes from fines imposed on persons accused of criminal offences. Since not all the defendants paid what they owed, lawyers sought an additional flow of dollars from the legislature. For several years, the programmes have shared a recurrent amount from the Attorney General &apos; s Office, and in some years additional funds have been approved by the Legislative Council and the Governor. Based on our interviews with women defenders and government officials, here's the US dollar amount that went to rape crisis centres across the state: legislative cycle: Other Public Revenue Fund** - Christ $400 million 2008 - Christ $400 million 2008 - Christ $2 million 2009 - Christ $250,000 \u2022 26 January, $2,2201 million, 2010-Kristen $250 million, $0.8 million, 2011-Scott $250 million, $0.8 million, 2012-Scott $500,000, after Scott reversed $1.5 million approved by the Legislature, 2013-Scott $500 million, $2.5 million, 2014, Scott $500 million, $1.3 million, so why did Scott reverse $1.5 million in 2012, and then approve $2.5 million in 2013 and again in 2014? In 2012, Scott &apos; s veto during his sexual assault awareness month generated some scrutiny. The Huffington Post quoted Scott's spokesman at the time, Lynn Wright. \"This new funding of $1.5 million could have been a duplication, since, as a nation, we are already funding sexual violence programmes,\" Wright said. \"There was no information indicating that any needs in this area had not already been met.\" Representatives of the Florida Council for Combating Sexual Violence said that State officials had met after the exercise of the veto, Jennifer Dright, Executive Director of the Non-Profit Group. \"There were a number of people in the legislature who spoke to the Governor's Office about the need, and in 2013 there was a recommended budget.\" \"We were not in any recommendation from the Governor for funding even the Government. Scott recommended $2.5 million in 2013.\" A Scott campaign spokesman cited a statement made by Dritt in 2013 commending Scott &apos; s recommendation of $2.5 million. Dright said: \"This takeover will make a difference in the lives of the citizens of Florida, and we are grateful for his commitment.\" The increase in funds allowed some centres to recruit additional staff, which helped to reduce waiting lists and expand services. For example, the Nancy J. Cotterman Center in Broward used the $255,000 in new funds over two years to recruit a full-time crisis intervention specialist, a part-time crisis intervention adviser and an expanded outreach to communities, including hospitals. Dritt said that Scott &apos; s veto did not close any of the 30 rape crisis centres in 2012. Two centres have since lost the certification certificate and one centre has chosen to abandon it, while a new centre has been added, bringing the current total to 28. Our judgment in an e-mail fundraiser sent by Christ's campaign, Frankel wrote that Scott \"closed 30 women's health centres around the state.\" Christ's campaign said that the e-mail should have said that Scott cut money for rape crisis centres, but even this smaller allegation is not accurate. More importantly, the statement that Scott shut down 30 health centres is totally wrong. We're assessing this allegation pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07287"}
