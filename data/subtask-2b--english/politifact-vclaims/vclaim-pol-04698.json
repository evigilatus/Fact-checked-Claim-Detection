His campaign pointed us to research the VA released on July 7 in advance of the agency\u2019s planned publication this month of its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides.\nThe VA examined about 55 million veterans records from 1979 through 2014. It found that in 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, that 7,403 veterans took their own lives, or an average of about 20 veterans a day.\nThe count updates a much-cited VA estimate that an average of 22 veterans killed themselves each day in 2010. The VA always acknowledged that this old study was limited, because it was based on veterans living in only 21 states. Notably absent were California and Texas - two states with very high veteran populations.\nThe new figure of 20 veteran suicides a day is based on records from every state.\nThe VA said that 65 percent of veterans who took their own lives in 2014 were 50 or older, a finding that jibes with Trump\u2019s statement that the daily suicides especially pertained to \"older veterans.\" For context, it should be noted that 75 percent of the nation\u2019s veterans are 50 or older.\nOn the other hand, the VA found that younger veterans had the highest rate of suicides. Those ages 18 to 29 had a suicide rate of 77 per 100,000 in 2014. Veterans ages 50 to 59, by comparison, had a rate of 39 per 100,000.\nIn all age groups, the VA found that the percentage of veterans who take their lives was substantially higher than that of adults who never served in the military. The rate for non-veterans ages 18 to 29, for example, was 12.8 per 100,000. The rate for non-vets ages 50 to 59 was 18.6 per 100,000.\nThe 2014 suicide rate for all veterans was 35.3 per 100,000; the rate for all adult non-vets was 15.2 per 100,000. After adjusting for differences in age and gender, the VA concluded that veterans have a 21 percent higher risk of suicide than non-serving adults.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the situation improving?\nDuring a July 7 news conference, VA officials were asked whether their research shows that there has been improvement in the veteran suicide problem, since the updated number, 20 deaths a day, was lower than the previous estimate of 22. David Shulkin, the VA\u2019s undersecretary for health, said the department doesn\u2019t view the new number as a sign of progress.\nShulkin said the average number of daily suicides may decreasing because the aging population of veterans also is waning. He stressed, however, that the suicide rate for veterans was rising.\nVA figures show that the veterans suicide rate actually has increased 32 percent since 2001. That compares with a 23 percent increase in the rate for non-vets during the same period.\nAccording to the new report, the suicide rate among veterans who used VA services increased 8.8 percent since 2001, while the rate among veterans who didn\u2019t use those services increased 38.6 percent.\nCritics have said focusing on the daily number of veteran suicides is pointless and that attention should be fixed on examining the veteran suicide rate and how it compares with the rest of the country.\nShulkin, during the news conference, said the daily suicide rate figure has become so \"ingrained\" in public conversation that the VA decided to recalculate it to ensure it\u2019s correct.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"A shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans.\" His claim is supported by recent research by the VA and we rate the statement True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5c79ae1-2a18-49c8-a325-8e1146fc012e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04698"}
