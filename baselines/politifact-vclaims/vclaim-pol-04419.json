Then he turned on Clinton\u2019s celebrity supporters.\n\"The only people enthusiastic about her campaign are Hollywood celebrities, in many cases celebrities that aren\u2019t very hot anymore,\" he said.\nWe were interested in his line that Clinton\u2019s celebrity backers are \"in many cases celebrities that aren\u2019t very hot anymore.\"\nBelieve it or not, there actually is data that addresses this question.\nEver the dutiful fact-checkers, we dug in. (For the record, the Trump campaign did not respond to our requests for evidence, and though the Clinton campaign did respond, it did not address our particular question.)\nClinton celebs still sizzling\nClinton has received endorsements from at least 900 celebrities. With that volume, some \"aren\u2019t very hot anymore\" (consider Laguna Beach\u2019s Lo Bosworth and MC Hammer).\nBut Hollywood royalty is largely on Clinton\u2019s side.\nTrump specified \"Hollywood celebrities,\" so we won\u2019t count Clinton supporters like radio host Howard Stern or President Barack Obama. And because Trump focused on \"enthusiastic\" supporters, we\u2019ll also limit our investigation to Hollywood celebrities who have campaigned or raised money for Clinton.\nWith those parameters, we identified about 100 hardcore Tinseltown Clinton fans. The roster includes singers Beyonc\u00e9, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, Alicia Keys, Katy Perry and Demi Lovato (the last three of whom performed at the Democratic National Convention); and Oscar winners Meryl Streep, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Leonardo DiCaprio, plus George Clooney (who once defended a fundraiser he held for Clinton with this Half True claim) and Bradley Cooper (whose appearance at the DNC upset some American Sniper fans).\nOther celebrity supporters include Kanye West and wife Kim Kardashian (who\u00a0got\u00a0her selfie with Clinton in 2015), Heidi Klum, Magic Johnson and Elton John (who headlined a New York City concert for the Hillary Victory Fund and isn\u2019t too keen on Tiny Dancer being played at Trump rallies).\nAnd as we said, you can actually gauge how hot these celebrities are. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe consulted E-Poll Market Research, which collects data on almost 9,000 celebrities and measures whether people know and like them. The marketing firm had an E-Score for all but one person on the list (Orange is the New Black\u2019s Dascha Polanco).\nAltogether, the 100 most enthusiastic Clinton celebrities averaged an E-Score of 86 out of 100. Two-thirds of the list scored above 90, with seven netting a perfect 100. (Because E-Score reflects both awareness and likeability, Kanye West scored a low 15 due to low appeal.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaty Perry, a Clinton donor and campaign trail performer, tops Forbes\u2019 list of celebrities with the most Twitter followers (92.1 million). A dozen other Clinton supporters also are on the list. Forbes also counts Perry and six other Clinton backers among the highest-paid celebrities of 2016.\nTen Clinton celebs made it onto Vulture\u2019s Most Valuable Movie Stars of 2015. And finally, half of People\u2019s Top 25 Celebrity Hot List, as of Aug. 25, 2016, is backing Clinton.\nFor a more qualitative take on Trump\u2019s claim, we turned to Hollywood blogger Perez Hilton.\n\"He\u2019s dead wrong!\" Hilton told PolitiFact. \"Katy Perry is one of the biggest and highest-earning pop stars on the planet. Justin Timberlake just hosted a fundraiser for (Clinton). Meryl Streep and Barbra Streisand are legends. Trump himself is the one with D- and Z-list celeb support!\" (Full disclosure: Hilton supports Clinton and has been photographed wearing a Hillary Clinton onesie.)\nNot many of the 100 total celebrity Trump endorsers have also appeared with him on the campaign trail (notable exceptions include former Indiana University basketball coach Bob Knight and several NASCAR drivers). Just one, Beth Chapman of A&E\u2019s Dog the Bounty Hunter, gave to his campaign, according to our search.\nE-Poll Market Research did not have an E-Score on file for 13 of about 60 of Trump\u2019s most prominent defenders. Randy Parker, a spokesman for the company, told us the Republican nominee\u2019s list includes \"some more obscure folk.\"\n\"The fact that so many of (Trump\u2019s) people aren\u2019t even in our database shows that his people are really the ones who are not hot,\" Parker said.\nThe Trump celebrities with E-Scores averaged a 64, with Walker, Texas Ranger star Chuck Norris leading the pack with a score of 99.\nOther high-scoring Trump celebrities include actors Lou Ferrigno (97), Randy Quaid (96), and Paul Sorvino (94). Of the Republican National Convention speakers, Scott Baio of Happy Days clocked a 91, while Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson scored a 78 and soap star and underwear model Antonio Sabato Jr. came in at 71.\nNo enthusiastic Trump Hollywood celebrity appeared on the lists from People, Forbes or Vulture, though Trump supporter Caitlyn Jenner was named Just Jared\u2019s Most Popular celebrity of 2015.\nOur ruling\nTrump said the Hollywood celebrities endorsing Hillary Clinton are \"in many cases celebrities that aren\u2019t very hot anymore.\"\nTrump has a point that out of hundreds of celebrities endorsing Clinton, some have faded.\nBut the data doesn\u2019t lie. Many prolific Clinton-backing stars remain popular according to several metrics: social media influence, earning potential, and popularity on celebrity news blogs and websites. Supporters like Katy Perry, Justin Timberlake, Meryl Streep and George Clooney are arguably the most visible and enthusiastic.\nTrump\u2019s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/57cb5021-de28-46f5-840e-64751fb508fe", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04419"}
