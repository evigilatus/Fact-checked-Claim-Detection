In fact, she publicly criticized Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 opinion upholding the law eight years ago.\"\nWe decided to look into the evidence. We found that Barrett hasn\u2019t written a lot about the Affordable Care Act, but what she has written has been decidedly negative about the Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 ruling upholding its constitutionality.\u00a0\nHer most extensive writing on the Affordable Care Act that we found was a 2017 book review titled, \"Countering the Majoritarian Difficulty.\" The book review focused on judicial restraint and when courts should invalidate laws passed by legislatures.\nBarrett\u2019s writing suggests sympathy with Supreme Court justices who are both \"originalists\" and \"textualists,\" best exemplified by Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, who objected to the majority view that upheld the Affordable Care Act in two cases: the National Federation of Business (NFIB) vs. Sibelius and and the later King vs. Burwell.\u00a0\nThose cases, upheld by Chief Justice John Roberts and the court\u2019s left-leaning justices, found the law constitutional because it ultimately depended on the federal government\u2019s taxing authority to compel people to buy insurance (called the individual mandate). Scalia argued that was wrong because, among other things, the law itself called the tax a penalty.\nBarrett\u2019s review said that Roberts \"has not proven himself to be a textualist in matters of statutory interpretation.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer writing also suggested she sided with Scalia: \"To the extent that NFIB v. Sebelius expresses a commitment to judicial restraint by creatively interpreting ostensibly clear statutory text, its approach is at odds with the statutory textualism to which most originalists subscribe. Thus Justice Scalia, criticizing the majority\u2019s construction of the Affordable Care Act in both NFIB v. Sebelius and King v. Burwell, protested that the statute known as Obamacare should be renamed \u2018SCOTUScare\u2019 in honor of the court\u2019s willingness to \u2018rewrite\u2019 the statute in order to keep it afloat.\"\u00a0\nThe Washington Post cited an interview with Barrett in 2015 on the radio program \"On Point,\" in which Barrett said of the decision that \"it\u2019s clearly a good result that these millions of Americans won\u2019t lose their tax subsidies,\" but \"the dissent has the better of the legal argument.\" (We were unable to find a transcript or recording of the complete interview.)\nWhen President Trump nominated her as his selection to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett noted her close ties to Scalia and his judicial approach, calling him a mentor with an \"incalculable influence\" on her life and alluding to a textualist approach.\u00a0\n\"His judicial philosophy is mine, too: a judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\nFinally, other liberal groups pointed to a letter Barrett signed along with many Catholic clergy, religious and legal experts that objected to the Obama administration\u2019s policies on birth control and the Affordable Care Act. The letter argued that the administration was infringing on Catholic institutions\u2019 religious liberty by requiring them to accommodate their employees\u2019 access to contraception as part of health insurance.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign, but did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nBiden said that Barrett \"has a written track record, disagreeing adamantly with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the ACA. In fact, she publicly criticized Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 opinion upholding the law eight years ago.\"\nThe track record we found is not very lengthy, and it is more academic than \"adamant.\" But it is there, and it strongly suggests Barrett would have sided with Scalia over Roberts in finding the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19028"}
