0001	CHUCK TODD	This Sunday, a rough week for both likely nominees.
0002	CHUCK TODD	For Hillary Clinton, it was that report contradicting her statements old and new about her emails.
0003	SEC. HILLARY CLINTON	Well, it was allowed.
0004	SEC. HILLARY CLINTON	And the rules have been clarified since I left.
0005	CHUCK TODD	For Donald Trump, it was an unprovoked attack on a popular Republican Latina governor, Susana Martinez of New Mexico.
0006	DONALD TRUMP	She's not doing the job.
0007	DONALD TRUMP	Hey, maybe I'll run for governor of New Mexico.
0008	CHUCK TODD	This morning, my interview with the only candidate still viewed favorably by the voters, Bernie Sanders.
0009	CHUCK TODD	Would you take the call if Hillary Clinton asked you to be her running mate?
0010	CHUCK TODD	Plus, we've seen the ClintonTrump polls tighten.
0011	CHUCK TODD	But how tight will they be if and when Sanders gets out?
0012	CHUCK TODD	We have a first look at the true state of the presidential race.
0013	CHUCK TODD	Also, before Donald, there was Arnold, the celebrity candidate who shocked the political world by running in California.
0014	CHUCK TODD	Arnold Schwarzenegger one on one, on the state of the Republican party in the age of Trump.
0015	CHUCK TODD	And joining me for insight and analysis are Robert Costa of The Washington Post, Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway, Jerry Seib, Washington bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, and Neera Tanden, president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.
0016	CHUCK TODD	Welcome to Sunday.
0017	CHUCK TODD	It's Meet the Press.
0018	ANNOUNCER	From NBC News in Washington, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.
0019	CHUCK TODD	Good Sunday morning on this Memorial Day weekend.
0020	CHUCK TODD	In a moment, we'll bring you my interview with Bernie Sanders.
0021	CHUCK TODD	But this holiday weekend, we're going to pause to take a look at this headscratching presidential race.
0022	CHUCK TODD	Let's admit up front, that every year, some people are upset at the major party choices that they have for president.
0023	CHUCK TODD	And it's always this holdyournose business, lesser of two evils, and we push through it.
0024	CHUCK TODD	But how did we get here?
0025	CHUCK TODD	How did we get to the point where on one side, Hillary Clinton would be the most unpopular nominee in history if not for the fact that Donald Trump is even more unpopular.
0026	CHUCK TODD	There are many possible answers to that question.
0027	CHUCK TODD	But it's undeniable that this week, both candidates seem to be doing whatever they could to make matters even worse.
0028	CHUCK TODD	And while we're all asking what does this mean for November, maybe we should start asking what does this mean for January.
0029	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0030	DONALD TRUMP	Thank goodness for emails.
0031	DONALD TRUMP	I love emails.
0032	DONALD TRUMP	Frankly, what Hillary has done is criminal, folks.
0033	DONALD TRUMP	It's criminal.
0034	CHUCK TODD	Donald Trump harping on the Clinton email scandal that just won't go away.
0035	CHUCK TODD	This week, a State Department inspector general said, Hillary Clinton did break the rules, that she never asked for permission to use a private server and would have been denied if she had.
0036	CHUCK TODD	The report contradicts what Clinton has said before and since.
0037	SEC. HILLARY CLINTON	Well, it was allowed and the rules have been clarified since I left about the practice.
0038	CHUCK TODD	The problem for Trump, he has his own transparency issue.
0039	SEC. HILLARY CLINTON	My question is really simple.
0040	SEC. HILLARY CLINTON	If you have paid federal income tax, show us.
0041	CHUCK TODD	Just 19 percent of voters give Clinton good ratings for being honest and straightforward.
0042	CHUCK TODD	But even fewer say Trump has the right temperament to be president.
0043	CHUCK TODD	Trump is putting Clinton's vulnerabilities on display.
0044	DONALD TRUMP	Hillary is a disaster, folks.
0045	DONALD TRUMP	She has bad judgment.
0046	DONALD TRUMP	That was said by Bernie Sanders.
0047	DONALD TRUMP	He's given me a lot of my best lines.
0048	CHUCK TODD	And Trump is trying to drag the Clintons back into the '90s, reminding voters of Bill Clinton's affairs and sexual misconduct.
0049	DONALD TRUMP	Nobody, nobody, perhaps in the history of politics was worse to women or abused women more than Bill Clinton.
0050	CHUCK TODD	But Trump has had his own affairs.
0051	DONALD TRUMP	Can you imagine how controversial I would be?
0052	DONALD TRUMP	You think about him with the women, how 'bout me with the women?
0053	CHUCK TODD	This week, Trump exposed Republican divisions, mocking his party's most prominent Latina politician, New Mexico Governor, Susana Martinez.
0054	DONALD TRUMP	She's not doing the job.
0055	DONALD TRUMP	Hey, maybe I'll run for governor of New Mexico.
0056	CHUCK TODD	And infighting within his own campaign, firing his recentlyhired political director.
0057	CHUCK TODD	Still, so far, Trump appears to be a candidate coated in Teflon.
0058	CHUCK TODD	Not so much for Clinton.
0059	CHUCK TODD	One difference is how each candidate deals with their vulnerabilities.
0060	CHUCK TODD	Trump almost embraces the attack.
0061	DONALD TRUMP	I end up with a lawsuit and it ends up in San Diego, in federal court.
0062	DONALD TRUMP	And I figure, "What the hell?
0063	DONALD TRUMP	Why not talk about it for two minutes?
0064	DONALD TRUMP	Should I talk about it?
0065	DONALD TRUMP	Yes?"
0066	CHUCK TODD	While Clinton struggles to explain.
0067	HILLARY CLINTON	The information that we had is out there, it's been clearly public.
0068	HILLARY CLINTON	And my email use was widely known.
0069	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0070	CHUCK TODD	Bernie Sanders of course is presenting himself as the more acceptable alternative to both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
0071	CHUCK TODD	I got the chance to talk to him yesterday just after he held a rally in Santa Barbara, California, in advance, of course, of the June 7th California primary.
0072	CHUCK TODD	And I began by asking him about his difficult path to the Democratic nomination.
0073	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0074	CHUCK TODD	Let me start with a simple question, but maybe a complicated answer.
0075	CHUCK TODD	How do you win?
0076	CHUCK TODD	Senator Clinton has basically declared herself the nominee, the math is certainly very much in her favor.
0077	CHUCK TODD	Explain to me how you're the nominee in July in your head.
0078	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Fair question.
0079	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And I think there are three paths to victory.
0080	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Number one, I want to go into the convention with more pledged delegates than Secretary Clinton.
0081	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And that's going to be an uphill fight.
0082	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Because for 270 or so delegates, and weve got 46 percent of the pledged delegates.
0083	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	What I want to do, and I think we can, is win California here, and win under the big vote, do very, very well in the other five states.
0084	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And I believe going into the convention, if we can do this, with the majority of pledged delegates, is a very symbolic victory.
0085	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Second of all, we're going to talk to those superdelegates in states where we have won landslide victories, 60, 70, 80 percent of the vote, to say, "Do what the people in your state want.
0086	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	They voted for Bernie Sanders, you as the superdelegates should follow their wishes."
0087	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Third point and most important point, as you know Chuck, there are over 400 superdelegates who came onto secretary Clinton's campaign eight months before the first ballot was cast.
0088	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Before anybody else was in the race.
0089	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Before they could get a sense of what the campaign was about.
0090	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Right now, in every major poll, national poll and statewide poll done in the last month, six weeks, we are defeating Trump often by big numbers, and always at a larger margin than Secretary Clinton is.
0091	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	We're going to make the case to the superdelegates, "Your job is to make sure that Trump is defeated, that Bernie Sanders, in fact, for a variety of reasons, not just polling, is the strongest candidate.
0092	CHUCK TODD	Senator, in your answer there, you're basically contradicting yourself on the issue of superdelegates in this way you're saying you want them to respect the vote in their state, then at the same time, you say, "But oh, by the way, for those of you that are a superdelegate in a state that Clinton won, why don't you think about the general election?"
0093	CHUCK TODD	It's a little bit hypocritical to be on both sides of those issues.
0094	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying.
0095	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	What I'm saying is, there are over 400 superdelegates who made a decision to vote for Secretary Clinton before anyone else was in the race.
0096	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Before they got a sense of what the campaign was about.
0097	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And all that I am saying is for those superdelegates who came onboard before I was even in the race, you have got the very grave responsibility to make sure that Trump does not become elected president of the United States.
0098	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Vote for the strongest candidate.
0099	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And it's not just the polls, Chuck.
0100	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	If you look at the momentum and the energy and the enthusiasm of our grassroots campaign, it will result in a higher voter turnout.
0101	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And Democrats and progressives do well when the voter turnout is high.
0102	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Republicans do well when the voter turnout is low.
0103	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I think our message of income and wealth inequality, the fact that we're the only major country on earth not to have healthcare for all people is resonating.
0104	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	It will win the general election.
0105	CHUCK TODD	Is it fair to say then if you don't win California, you believe your campaign is over?
0106	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	No, that's what you said.
0107	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I didn't say.
0108	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	What I said is obviously California is very, very important, 475 superdelegates.
0109	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Obviously, if we don't do well in California, it will make our path much much harder.
0110	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	No question about it.
0111	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	But I think we have a good chance to win in California, maybe win big, and maybe win four or five of the other states that are off on June 7th.
0112	CHUCK TODD	But without a California victory, you can't win a majority of pledged delegates.
0113	CHUCK TODD	And obviously, you will once again not succeed in a big state with a diverse population.
0114	CHUCK TODD	It's going to be hard for you to convince Democrats to go with you without a California victory.
0115	CHUCK TODD	Fair?
0116	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Hey, look, Chuck, California is the big enchilada, so to speak.
0117	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Obviously it is enormously important, and obviously we want to win it.
0118	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	But let me just tell you something.
0119	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	You know, my campaign has been written off from before we started.
0120	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Nobody thought we would do anything.
0121	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	We've now won 20 states, primaries and caucuses, and I think by the end of the process, we may win half of the states.
0122	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	So we're going to fight till the last vote is cast and try to appeal to the last delegate that we can.
0123	CHUCK TODD	Last week with me, Secretary Clinton said when it comes to party unity, she's doing her part, she's going to do her part.
0124	CHUCK TODD	But that there is a responsibility that falls on you as well.
0125	CHUCK TODD	If she's the nominee, that you have a responsibility to do what it takes to bring your supporters onboard with her.
0126	CHUCK TODD	Do you accept that responsibility?
0127	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Well, the responsibility that I accept in a very, very serious way is to do everything that I can to make sure that Donald Trump will not become elected president of the United States.
0128	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Donald Trump, for a dozen different reasons, would be a disaster as president.
0129	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I will do everything that I can to make sure that does not happen.
0130	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	But at the end of the day, whether it's Secretary Clinton of Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump, anybody else, the way you gain support is through the candidate himself or herself.
0131	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	So my job is to make sure that Trump does not become president.
0132	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And I will do that.
0133	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	But if Secretary Clinton is the nominee, it is her job to reach out to millions of people and make the case as to why she is going to defend working families and the middle, provide healthcare for all people, take on Wall Street, deal aggressively with climate change.
0134	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	That is the candidate's job to do.
0135	CHUCK TODD	I understand that.
0136	CHUCK TODD	But you just said you want to do whatever it takes to stop him.
0137	CHUCK TODD	You don't believe you need to be out there telling your supporters, "You may not be happy with Hillary Clinton, but she's better than him"?
0138	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Well, no question about that.
0139	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	No question about that.
0140	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	But where my mind is right now is to do everything that I can in the remaining caucuses and primaries to try to win them and make the case.
0141	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	But if your question is do I think that Secretary Clinton is significantly a better candidate for America than is Donald Trump, that is not a debate.
0142	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Of course that is true.
0143	CHUCK TODD	Do you think Hillary Clinton needs a clean bill of health from the F.B.I.
0144	CHUCK TODD	before she accepts the Democrat nomination?
0145	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Well, I have said many, many times that I'm trying to run a campaign based on the needs of the American people.
0146	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And that is raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, paid family and medical leave, making public colleges and universities tuitionfree
0147	CHUCK TODD	I understand that
0148	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Those are the issues, by the way, that the American people are deeply concerned about.
0149	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	But so I have not gotten into the email situation at all.
0150	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	There is a process unfolding.
0151	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	There's an investigation that is going on.
0152	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	It will play out and we'll see what happens.
0153	CHUCK TODD	I understand that.
0154	CHUCK TODD	But do you think for the Democratic party and for superdelegates, do you think it's important for them to find out what the F.B.I.
0155	CHUCK TODD	's going to do before the vote in Philadelphia?
0156	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Well, that's not the decision of superdelegates or anybody else.
0157	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	That's the decision of the F.B.I..
0158	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I have no idea when they are going to make their report public or come up with their conclusions.
0159	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	But do I think that whenever that happens, if it happens, that that will be an issue that Donald Trump and the Republicans will seize on?
0160	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I think there is little doubt about that.
0161	CHUCK TODD	You know, you told The Wall Street Journal in November that if Clinton's email practices foiled public records requests, or compromised classified information, that those were valid questions.
0162	CHUCK TODD	Well, the State Department I.G.
0163	CHUCK TODD	Report said just that.
0164	CHUCK TODD	What was your reaction to that report, and does that trouble you?
0165	CHUCK TODD	Does that add to your list of issues that you believe she has a judgment problem then?
0166	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Well, again, you know, these are areas that I have stayed away from.
0167	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	There is a process, people will draw their conclusions from the inspector general report.
0168	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	But again, you know, I think the American people are tired of that type of politics.
0169	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And I think the media and the candidates have got to talk about why the middle class is in decline and why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.
0170	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Those issues are more important to the American people than some of the issues you have been talking about.
0171	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And those are the issues that I focus on.
0172	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I just gave an hour speech right here in Santa Barbara, it wasn't about emails, it was about the future of the American middle class and how we deal with the fundamental problems that they are facing.
0173	CHUCK TODD	Do you have a problem when some of your supporters are quoted in The New York Times saying they're sort of rooting for an F.B.I.
0174	CHUCK TODD	indictment when it comes to Clinton?
0175	CHUCK TODD	Do you tell your supporters not to talk that way?
0176	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I'll tell you, I have a real problem with The New York Times, which from day one, has been trying to be dismissive of our campaign and be very negative about our campaign.
0177	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	You can go out and you can talk to millions of people and you any get response that you want.
0178	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Our campaign is about defeating Secretary Clinton on the real issues.
0179	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I want to break up the Wall Street banks.
0180	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	She doesn't.
0181	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I want to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.
0182	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	She wants $12 an hour.
0183	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I voted against the War in Iraq.
0184	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	She voted for the War in Iraq.
0185	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I believe we should ban fracking.
0186	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	She does not.
0187	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change.
0188	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	That is not her position.
0189	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Those are some of the issues that I am campaigning on that The New York Times goes around, when they talk to a handful of people and do a frontpage story, that's a problem for The New York Times, not for my campaign.
0190	CHUCK TODD	All right, I want to ask you a little bit about the platform and the Democratic party issues platform that's coming up.
0191	CHUCK TODD	A couple of your appointees, when it comes to the issue of Israel, including Cornel West, he refers to the Palestinians as the plight of an occupied people. Do you agree with his characterization?
0192	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	What I believe is that the United States is going to be playing on a level playing field in dealing with Israel and the Palestinian people.
0193	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I am 100 percent pro Israel in the sense of Israel's right to exist, I lived in Israel, I have family in Israel, Israel has the right to live not only in peace and security, but to know that their very existence will be protected by the United States government.
0194	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	On the other hand, I think if we're looking at lasting peace in the Middle East, the United States has got to respect the needs of the Palestinian people.
0195	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	They cannot be pushed aside.
0196	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	So that is my view.
0197	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And, you know, other people can say whatever they want.
0198	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	That is my view.
0199	CHUCK TODD	What do you want the platform to say?
0200	CHUCK TODD	Do you want to refer to the Palestinians as an occupied people?
0201	CHUCK TODD	Do you want to say that Israel is occupying Gaza?
0202	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Well, we're a little bit early about worrying about the wording of what the Democratic platform will be.
0203	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	We've got some good people on our platformwriting committee.
0204	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	But I think at the end of the day, there will be a general recognition by the entire Democratic convention, that of course Israel's right to exist in peace and security is not in debate.
0205	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	But on the other hand, the Palestinian people's needs must also be respected.
0206	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I have the feeling that while the media wants to make this into a great conflict, I think there's going to be broad consensus within the Democratic convention on that issue.
0207	CHUCK TODD	Fair enough.
0208	CHUCK TODD	Final question, on Friday, you warned Secretary Clinton that if she ends up the nominee, that her running mate essentially better not be a conservative or moderate type of Democrat if she wants to win over your supporters and certainly have your enthusiastic support.
0209	CHUCK TODD	Do you consider someone like Tim Kaine falling into that category, the Virginia senator, that he's too conservative or moderate to be on the Democratic ticket?
0210	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Again, Chuck, I don't want to shock you, but I think we are once again into a little bit of speculation.
0211	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I have known Tim Kaine for years.
0212	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	I really like him very much.
0213	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	My point was, and let me repeat it, that for Democrats to win, they're going to have to address the needs of working people.
0214	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	They're going to have to address the needs of the middle class.
0215	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And that means standing up to Wall Street, standing up to the greed of corporate America.
0216	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Even now and then, standing up to the media.
0217	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And that means having a candidate who can excite working families, excite young people, bring them into the political process, create a large voter turnout.
0218	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	And when we do that, we're going to win the election.
0219	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	So I would hope, if I am not the nominee, that the vice presidential candidate will not be from Wall Street, will be somebody who has a history of standing up and fighting for working families, taking on the drug companies whose greed is doing so much harm, taking on Wall Street, taking on corporate America, and fight for a government that works for all of us, not just the one percent.
0220	CHUCK TODD	Would you take the call if Hillary Clinton asked you to be her running mate?
0221	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Well, right now, again, here we are in California, I'm knocking my brains out to win the Democratic nomination.
0222	CHUCK TODD	Yes you are.
0223	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	That's where I am right now.
0224	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	What happens afterwards, we will see.
0225	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	But right now, my focus is on winning the nomination.
0226	CHUCK TODD	Well, that was a very political type of answer that says you're not answering the question.
0227	CHUCK TODD	Fair enough, you're not ruling it out.
0228	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	What I am saying right now is our focus is on winning the Democratic nomination.
0229	CHUCK TODD	All right.
0230	CHUCK TODD	Senator Bernie Sanders from Santa Barbara, California, thanks for coming on.
0231	CHUCK TODD	Stay safe on the trail, sir.
0232	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Thank you very much.
0233	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0234	CHUCK TODD	And later in the broadcast, my interview with Arnold Schwarzenegger, on the state of the Republican party in the age of Trump.
0235	CHUCK TODD	Meanwhile, throughout the morning on this Memorial Day weekend, we're going to honor the men and women in uniform who have died in the past year in service to our country, starting with conflict zones like Afghanistan.
0236	CHUCK TODD	And we are back, panel is here.
0237	CHUCK TODD	Jerry Seib, Washington Bureau Chief with The Wall Street Journal, my partner with the NBCWall Street Journal poll, Neera Tanden, president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress and a member of the platform committee for Hillary Clinton.
0238	CHUCK TODD	Republican pollster and strategist Kellyanne Conway, and Robert Costa of The Washington Post.
0239	CHUCK TODD	Welcome all.
0240	CHUCK TODD	Neera, since you are somebody that the Hillary Clinton campaign has appointed to this, Bernie Sanders, is that still an opponent, an aggressive opponent of Hillary Clinton?
0241	CHUCK TODD	The Bernie Sanders you just heard?
0242	NEERA TANDEN	I thought he made a lot of great points about Democratic unity.
0243	NEERA TANDEN	I welcome that.
0244	NEERA TANDEN	I mean, he does seem to really focus on the general election, which will be against Donald Trump.
0245	NEERA TANDEN	And I think he made clear that that is the paramount concern for Democrats.
0246	NEERA TANDEN	We face a person who's sort of unprecedented in history in this general election.
0247	NEERA TANDEN	And I think he'll be clear about that when this primary's over into June.
0248	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Yeah, that sounds great, but it's not true.
0249	KELLYANNE CONWAY	I mean, he is runningto me Senator Sanders is the most aggressive against Secretary Clinton he's been in the year he's been running here
0250	NEERA TANDEN	I just disagree.
0251	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Okay, well, he's won 20 states, ten million voters and counting.
0252	NEERA TANDEN	Sure, sure.
0253	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And he now wants to kick off your platform committee, members like Barney Frank, and former congressmen and Governor Malloy.
0254	KELLYANNE CONWAY	He's in open warfare with the Democratic National Committee.
0255	NEERA TANDEN	He didn't look like open warfare there to me, I must say.
0256	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Then why doesn't he drop out?
0257	NEERA TANDEN	Because he wants
0258	KELLYANNE CONWAY	He said he promises a messy convention in Philadelphia.
0259	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And look, so look as Bernie Sanders is playing Robin to Donald Trump's Batman, these guys are waging a twofront war, street fight against Hillary Clinton
0260	NEERA TANDEN	Absolutely.
0261	NEERA TANDEN	I hear that.
0262	NEERA TANDEN	I hear that.
0263	NEERA TANDEN	And that is definitely why her negatives are where they are.
0264	NEERA TANDEN	But
0265	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Unity
0266	NEERA TANDEN	But the point here is that I was on Hillary Clinton's campaign eight years ago, and it was a hardfought campaign at this point.
0267	NEERA TANDEN	And then just as the primary ended, Hillary endorsed Obama and was a strong champion for him and united the party.
0268	KELLYANNE CONWAY	But
0269	NEERA TANDEN	And there's nothing in what he said
0270	JERRY SEIB	I thought what I heard in that interview was the terms of the merger being negotiated.
0271	JERRY SEIB	You know, here's what its going to take.
0272	JERRY SEIB	You've got to be respectful of me
0273	CHUCK TODD	Very Wall Street Journal of you, by the way, in terms of the merger.
0274	JERRY SEIB	We all play to stereotypes, dont we?
0275	JERRY SEIB	Got to be respectful to my people, you've got to give me some things on the platform, and you've got to pick a vice presidential nominee that I can say that I can live with.
0276	JERRY SEIB	But what he didn't say when you asked him, "Do you have some responsibility for making your supporters back Hillary Clinton ultimately," he wouldn't go there.
0277	JERRY SEIB	Now maybe it's too early, but that's the real question for me, is will he tell his people, "You've got to go there," or will he back off?
0278	JERRY SEIB	NEERA TANDEN
0279	JERRY SEIB	I think he's already doing that.
0280	JERRY SEIB	I think he's already doing that by what he said here.
0281	ROBERT COSTA	And he seems pretty confident, the senator, when it comes to the platform, that he's going to get some of his people on this committee.
0282	ROBERT COSTA	But the way he answered the Tim Kaine question, he praised Senator Kaine, but this was not an enthusiastic embrace.
0283	ROBERT COSTA	I think he's still waiting to spend his political capital on the running mate.
0284	ROBERT COSTA	He wants a progressive in there.
0285	ROBERT COSTA	He thinks this is the way he shaped the campaign.
0286	ROBERT COSTA	It's not just about the platform.
0287	ROBERT COSTA	It's about who's on the ticket, should he not win the nomination.
0288	CHUCK TODD	Look, part of this week though, by the way, is there is now handwringing in Democratic party world.
0289	CHUCK TODD	And I will give Robby Mook his quote, the quote of the day this morning, the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, "It wouldn't be a general election without some early bedwetting from Washington insiders."
0290	CHUCK TODD	But there's a reason.
0291	JERRY SEIB	Present company excluded.
0292	CHUCK TODD	Exactly.
0293	CHUCK TODD	There's a reason for it, Jerry Seib, and it's how she's dealt with the email controversy.
0294	CHUCK TODD	Here's a compilation of just Thursday.
0295	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0296	SEC. HILLARY CLINTON	I know people have concerns about this.
0297	SEC. HILLARY CLINTON	I understand that.
0298	SEC. HILLARY CLINTON	But I think voters are going to be looking at the full picture of what I have to offer.
0299	SEC. HILLARY CLINTON	You know, the fact is, people have official accounts, they have personal accounts, and when it comes to personal, people dont want their personal email accounts made public.
0300	SEC. HILLARY CLINTON	It was allowed, and the rules have been clarified since I left about the practice.
0301	SYSTEM	(END TAPE) The New York Times editorial board, Bernie Sanders' favorite newspaper these days, "
0302	SYSTEM	[T]
0303	SEC. HILLARY CLINTON	he nation should not be judging leadership as a measure of who is less untrustworthy.
0304	CHUCK TODD	Mrs. Clinton has to answer questions about the report thoroughly and candidly.
0305	CHUCK TODD	That is her best path back to the larger task of campaigning for the presidency."
0306	CHUCK TODD	They don't want to do this, Jerry.
0307	JERRY SEIB	No, they don't.
0308	JERRY SEIB	I mean, and I think that the hope is that it would go away.
0309	JERRY SEIB	But I also think the belief is that the candid answers continue to get her into trouble.
0310	JERRY SEIB	But I tend to agree that with the word candidly in there, the best way to approach this probably is to just say, "Look, here's what happened.
0311	JERRY SEIB	You all know what happened.
0312	JERRY SEIB	There's no mystery left in this.
0313	JERRY SEIB	I did this because I did want some privacy for my email accounts.
0314	JERRY SEIB	It was a mistake, let's move on."
0315	JERRY SEIB	Now, that probably won't be sufficient.
0316	JERRY SEIB	Look, we all know the big issue yet to come isn't what the inspector general of the State Department said, it's what the Justice Department says ultimately.
0317	JERRY SEIB	And what happens when she's interviewed by the F.B.I., which is almost certain to happen.
0318	ROBERT COSTA	But it's not just the answer, it's how Secretary Clinton answers.
0319	ROBERT COSTA	And what we saw this week was her insert herself more into the national political conversation.
0320	ROBERT COSTA	Maybe taking a cue from Donald Trump.
0321	ROBERT COSTA	She's appearing on different programs, she's calling into shows.
0322	ROBERT COSTA	She's trying to not just have some rote answers.
0323	ROBERT COSTA	She knows this is going to be a combative general election and she has to be in the arena.
0324	CHUCK TODD	But I have to say, and I'm curious what your guys' take on this is, the two different ways they deal with their baggage.
0325	CHUCK TODD	Here's Donald Trump who actually decided to talk about Trump University and he attacks the judge.
0326	CHUCK TODD	Here he is.
0327	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0328	DONALD TRUMP	I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump.
0329	DONALD TRUMP	A hater.
0330	DONALD TRUMP	He's a hater.
0331	DONALD TRUMP	His name is Gonzalo Curiel.
0332	DONALD TRUMP	They ought to look into Judge Curiel, because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace, okay?
0333	DONALD TRUMP	But we'll come back in November.
0334	DONALD TRUMP	Wouldn't that be wild?
0335	DONALD TRUMP	If I'm president and I come back to do a civil case?
0336	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0337	CHUCK TODD	Kellyanne, when you attack a federal judge that's in the middle of dealing with a case you're involved in, you might get headlines like this one in The Washington Post, "Judge bashed by Trump orders release of company records."
0338	CHUCK TODD	And suddenly, in the next two weeks, there's going to be a whole lot more Trump University.
0339	CHUCK TODD	Now he does handle his baggage a lot differently than Hillary Clinton does.
0340	CHUCK TODD	But will it eventually catch up to him?
0341	KELLYANNE CONWAY	No.
0342	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And ask the 16 Republicans who ran against him in the primaries.
0343	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And we see Hillary and her surrogates really recycling those same arguments, including Trump University.
0344	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Here's something Donald Trump has mastered, which is very surprising to all of us in the political class.
0345	KELLYANNE CONWAY	For somebody who's never run for office before, he understands that old axiom, "Define yourself before you're defined."
0346	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And he puts all of this out there, Chuck, himself so that when the voters hear it for the 15th time, it doesn't strike them as brand new information.
0347	KELLYANNE CONWAY	The inspector general's report, brand new information.
0348	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And let me just say this one other thing about Hillary and the inspector general's report.
0349	KELLYANNE CONWAY	It's a very unusual place for her because she does best when she can blame the vast rightwing conspiracy for her perils.
0350	KELLYANNE CONWAY	This is the inspector general of the State Department of the Obama administration.
0351	KELLYANNE CONWAY	This is his justice department looking at this.
0352	CHUCK TODD	All right.
0353	CHUCK TODD	Neera, I'll give you a chance to respond.
0354	CHUCK TODD	I know you want to.
0355	NEERA TANDEN	Where can you respond?
0356	NEERA TANDEN	I mean, we did have a lot of news this week, right, about Donald Trump.
0357	NEERA TANDEN	And I would say you're right, that he was able to defeat the Republican primary.
0358	NEERA TANDEN	But that does not mean that he will do well in the general election, because he has the highest negatives of anyone.
0359	NEERA TANDEN	He has, just this week, we've learned all kinds of new information about him, including what we'll learn next week, he'll never return his taxes, he was betting on the housing crisis, essentially.
0360	NEERA TANDEN	And I think the idea that he's Teflon is ridiculous, when he has the highest negatives of anyone running for president ever
0361	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Neera do you know what he's got that Hillary doesn't have?
0362	KELLYANNE CONWAY	He's actually the nominee of his party.
0363	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And she's not.
0364	NEERA TANDEN	Yes, and she will soon.
0365	CHUCK TODD	All right.
0366	NEERA TANDEN	She will be.
0367	NEERA TANDEN	And then we'll see how united the party
0368	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Tell the 10 million Sanders voters that.
0369	CHUCK TODD	We will take a pause, because you guys will be returning.
0370	CHUCK TODD	We'll be back in a moment with a man who knows a little something about running for office as a celebrity outsider.
0371	CHUCK TODD	My interview with Arnold Schwarzenegger, about Donald Trump and his new poll in advance of the June 7th California primary.
0372	CHUCK TODD	And as we go to break, we continue to honor those service members who have died in conflict zones just in the last year.
0373	CHUCK TODD	More from Afghanistan.
0374	CHUCK TODD	And welcome back.
0375	CHUCK TODD	This election isn't the first time someone well known for being an entertainer found himself in a position of political power.
0376	CHUCK TODD	In fact, the state of California has brought a few of them to us, including songanddance man George Murphy, who became a U.S.
0377	CHUCK TODD	Senator.
0378	CHUCK TODD	And of course, Ronald Reagan, you may have heard of him.
0379	CHUCK TODD	You could say that our next guest helped prep this generation for taking an entertainer seriously as a political player.
0380	CHUCK TODD	Arnold Schwarzenegger served as the governor of California from 2003 to 2011 and he joins me now.
0381	CHUCK TODD	Governor Schwarzenegger, welcome back to Meet the Press.
0382	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	Thank you, Chuck.
0383	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	It's wonderful to be back.
0384	CHUCK TODD	You know, this has been a year for outsider candidates.
0385	CHUCK TODD	It's obviously something you're familiar with.
0386	CHUCK TODD	Many people have made some comparisons of your candidacy in 2003 and Donald Trump's today.
0387	CHUCK TODD	What similarities do you see and what are the differences?
0388	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	Well, I don't really study that much of what is the difference between Donald Trump and my candidacy.
0389	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	I study much more the field polls and USC Schwarzenegger polls that were just done about what do the people really think.
0390	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And what is the main interest in the people's minds when you have our election now on June 6th, so that is really  or June 7th I should say.
0391	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	This is really my interest.
0392	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And this is why we did the poll and this is why we really came up with these wonderful studies.
0393	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And they're quite interesting.
0394	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	I think when you look at it, the important thing that comes out of that is that 69 percent of the people want our politicians to work together.
0395	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And I think this should be a message to Democrats and Republicans to work together.
0396	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And this is why people are very upset about Washington today.
0397	CHUCK TODD	You know, I want to play something that you said in 2004 about what made you a Republican.
0398	CHUCK TODD	And then find out if that still holds today.
0399	CHUCK TODD	Here it is.
0400	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0401	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	Then I heard Nixon speak.
0402	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military.
0403	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air.
0404	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	I said to my friend, I said, "What party is he?"
0405	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	My friend said, "He's a Republican."
0406	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	I said, "Then I am a Republican."
0407	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0408	CHUCK TODD	Can you comfortably say that today with Donald Trump as the standard bearer for the Republican party?
0409	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	I comfortably can say that I am a Republican and I always will be a Republican because the Republican party is a big tent and there was not always things that I agreed with or they didn't agree with me many times.
0410	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	But the fact of the matter is that's the philosophy, and everything that I've heard is exactly the same.
0411	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And I think that what is more important about it is not what do I think about Donald Trump.
0412	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	We have to talk about the bigger issue.
0413	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And this is what do the people really feel.
0414	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And the fascinating thing about the poll was that both Democrats and Republicans found that the most important is to really improve the economy and to create more jobs.
0415	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	They were all sensing when it comes to social security, to save social security and to really take care of public schools.
0416	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And they're concerned about the public education in general.
0417	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And those are the kind of issues that Democrats and Republicans are concerned about.
0418	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	Of course they have different ways of solving this problem, and depending if they're Democrat or Republicans.
0419	CHUCK TODD	Well, let me just ask it straight forward.
0420	CHUCK TODD	Are you ready to support Donald Trump for president?
0421	CHUCK TODD	I know you're a John Kasich supporter, you went and campaigned for him.
0422	CHUCK TODD	Are you going to support Trump?
0423	CHUCK TODD	And will you go to the convention in Cleveland?
0424	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	Chuck, as I said, to me the most important thing is now to talk about the latest poll numbers and how the people of California feel and how the people in America basically feel.
0425	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	Because I think it is important that we go and bring both of the parties together.
0426	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	The more we go to the left, the more we go to the right, I believe of what President Eisenhower said, "Politics is like the road.
0427	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	The left and the right represents the gutter, and the middle is drivable."
0428	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And I think this is exactly where the action is, is in the middle.
0429	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	I have seen it when I was governor of the state of California.
0430	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	I have seen it firsthand, that the only way we brought Democrats and Republicans together, we could really solve very important issues.
0431	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	I remember that's how we really started rebuilding California and invested $60 billion in infrastructure.
0432	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	That's when we go and created the AB 32 where we made a commitment to reducing our greenhouse gasses to 25 percent by the year 2020, where we upped our renewables and all this great stuff that is happening when both of the parties work together.
0433	CHUCK TODD	Governor, I can't help but notice though, you're avoiding saying anything about Trump.
0434	CHUCK TODD	You're not saying you're for him, you're not saying you're against him.
0435	CHUCK TODD	You're trying to stay out of it.
0436	CHUCK TODD	I get it.
0437	CHUCK TODD	But is that what you're trying to do here?
0438	CHUCK TODD	By you not saying anything, you're actually making a statement.
0439	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	No, not really, because I try to stay focused.
0440	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	Remember, there's one thing that I've liked over the years when I've promoted bodybuilding and fitness and my movies and politics and issues and so on is to stay focused.
0441	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	So today I want to talk about our poll numbers.
0442	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	Now polls that we have taken, the field polls that the USC Schwarzenegger Institute released this last week and I want to talk about that, because that is really important for the state of California.
0443	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	It's important that the people know how they feel and in which direction to go, and it also will help the candidates to listen to the people carefully, and not to deviate from that and to really talk about those very important issues, since we have the primaries coming up in California, I think the presidential candidates, whoever they are, have to address those issues.
0444	CHUCK TODD	And finally, I want to ask you a question about your native country Austria.
0445	CHUCK TODD	Because what was fascinating is you could argue that they had an election which it came down to somebody from the far left, maybe similar to a Bernie Sanders, and someone from the far right, a nativist of sorts.
0446	CHUCK TODD	And nobody was happy with their choices.
0447	CHUCK TODD	All of a sudden, this country is experiencing an appeal of a socialist and the appeal of a nativist.
0448	CHUCK TODD	What lessons do you think Americans should take away from this?
0449	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	I think that it is pretty much in many different countries I've seen that, that they're looking for an outsider and people are dissatisfied with the status quo.
0450	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And people are dissatisfied basically with the action that is being created in those capitalists.
0451	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	The politicians are not keeping their promises, and politicians don't solve the problems.
0452	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And this is why you see in our poll numbers that 69 percent of the people say, "The politicians have to work together."
0453	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	That is the most important thing.
0454	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And they have to come to a compromise.
0455	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And in Washington, not much is getting done.
0456	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	Some of it is getting done, but not much.
0457	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And I think that to spend billions of dollars on the capital, and it is the worst investment, because nothing is getting done.
0458	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	So therefore, the people are looking for something else.
0459	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And they don't know where to turn to.
0460	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And so this is what you see in America and this is what you have seen in Austria and this is what you see in Germany and this is what you see in France.
0461	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	And you see this all over the place.
0462	CHUCK TODD	All right, I'm going to ask you one last time.
0463	CHUCK TODD	Do you plan on publicly saying whether you'll be for Trump?
0464	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	I will make an announcement before the election, you can be sure of that.
0465	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	But I will do it my way.
0466	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	Which is always an unusual way.
0467	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	As you remember that I announced my candidacy for governor on The Tonight Show.
0468	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	So that was very unusual, and I will do exactly the same thing also with the endorsement.
0469	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	So I will study the various different candidates, what they represent, all that stuff, and I will then make up my mind and I would make the endorsement.
0470	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	So I will make an endorsement, but it will not be here, because then that would be the headline.
0471	CHUCK TODD	Well, and I guess you're saying we're too usual of a place to do this, we're not unusual enough.
0472	CHUCK TODD	Anyway, Governor Schwarzenegger, it's pleasure sir, thanks for coming on.
0473	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER	Thank you very much for having me.
0474	CHUCK TODD	Appreciate it.
0475	CHUCK TODD	When we come back, is the ClintonTrump race really as close as the latest polls indicate?
0476	CHUCK TODD	We've got some new data that suggests one of the candidates may soon get a very nice bump.
0477	CHUCK TODD	That's next.
0478	CHUCK TODD	And we are back.
0479	CHUCK TODD	It's data download time.
0480	CHUCK TODD	So how much is Bernie Sanders hurting Hillary Clinton?
0481	CHUCK TODD	Democrats, of course, still locked in their primary battle.
0482	CHUCK TODD	Republicans starting to get behind their nominee.
0483	CHUCK TODD	And recent polls of course have shown an increasingly tight race.
0484	CHUCK TODD	So the question is, is this tightness something that's going to last till November or is this a current Sanders phenomenon?
0485	CHUCK TODD	Meaning, Bernie Sanders supporters aren't coming home to the Democrats?
0486	CHUCK TODD	Well if history's any guide, we think that's what it is.
0487	CHUCK TODD	Clinton should pick up about 70 percent of the current people right now that say they're for Sanders against Trump but not yet ready to vote for Clinton.
0488	CHUCK TODD	Call them the Sandersonly voters.
0489	CHUCK TODD	We'll show you what they could mean.
0490	CHUCK TODD	Let's start with our latest NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll.
0491	CHUCK TODD	We see a close race between Clinton and Trump, 4643, that's margin of error stuff.
0492	CHUCK TODD	While Sanders, doubledigit lead against Trump, 5439.
0493	CHUCK TODD	It's an eightpoint gap between Clinton and Sanders, so what happens if Clinton gets about 70 percent of that difference if you leave Trump's number as is.
0494	CHUCK TODD	Well, Clinton's lead would jump five points to 5143.
0495	CHUCK TODD	Same phenomenon in other polls.
0496	CHUCK TODD	CBSNew York Times, they have Clinton starting with a sixpoint lead over Trump, they of course had Sanders up double digits as well, 5138.
0497	CHUCK TODD	But if you shift the support from Sanders, Clinton would pick up another three points, and the lead would increase to nine, 5041.
0498	CHUCK TODD	Finally, we'll show you what happens in the Fox News poll, where Clinton actually trailed Trump by three points, 4542, Sanders led Trump in their poll, 4642.
0499	CHUCK TODD	Well, you do the same thing, 70 percent of those Sandersonly voters, Clinton would poll even, to 4545.
0500	CHUCK TODD	The point is, Sanders is hurting Clinton right now.
0501	CHUCK TODD	By the way, in 2008, Barack Obama picked up, you guessed it, three points against John McCain in the first NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll after Hillary Clinton dropped out.
0502	CHUCK TODD	Look, the polls between Clinton and Trump are tight right now.
0503	CHUCK TODD	That's not a surprise.
0504	CHUCK TODD	But it gives you an idea that if Democrats do rally around their nominee, what the race may look like just before the conventions begin.
0505	CHUCK TODD	We'll see if that actually happens though.
0506	CHUCK TODD	Sanders supporters don't seem ready to move just yet.
0507	CHUCK TODD	We'll be back in a moment.
0508	CHUCK TODD	Let me bring the panel back.
0509	CHUCK TODD	You know, the biggest political story of the month may be taking place right now in Orlando, the Libertarian Party Convention.
0510	CHUCK TODD	Don't laugh, I know, because their place on the ballot, they could be "none of the above," if that's possible.
0511	CHUCK TODD	And in fact, we noted, we actually put a battleground map together of what would happen if you have a thirdparty candidacy like the Libertarians who can get 10 percent.
0512	CHUCK TODD	So here's the initial battleground map, here the states that we know will be in play no matter what, those are in purple there, ten states in there.
0513	CHUCK TODD	If the Libertarians can get ten, we think these three red states, Arizona, Missouri, and Indiana, suddenly come into play perhaps for Clinton.
0514	CHUCK TODD	And then we've got two blue states to put in Minnesota and Maine, under the same scenario that those are states that suddenly get put into play for Trump.
0515	CHUCK TODD	Jerry, do you think the Libertarians are going to make a splash this year?
0516	JERRY SEIB	I think they could.
0517	JERRY SEIB	As you know, in our polling, Wall Street JournalNBC News, or NBC NewsWall Street Journal as you call it, we found that there were so many respondents asked about a choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump who were responding, "I won't vote in that race," that we had to create a new answer.
0518	JERRY SEIB	If those people find someplace else to go, even if it's only to make a statement, it could be a significant enough number to tip some states.
0519	JERRY SEIB	And that matters.
0520	CHUCK TODD	Kellyanne, are you nervous about the Libertarians hurting Trump?
0521	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Yes, because I think Hillary Clinton can get to 43, 44 percent before she gets out of bed in the morning, but getting her to 51 percent in a twoperson race seems to be roiling her.
0522	KELLYANNE CONWAY	So yes, if they grab some votes.
0523	KELLYANNE CONWAY	But this convention, based on the public reports, I mean, Bill Welds as vice president running mates has had a hard time," he's confusing Libertarian with liberal Republicans.
0524	KELLYANNE CONWAY	So I think the party
0525	CHUCK TODD	What's interestingyou do that.
0526	CHUCK TODD	You gave me a segue.
0527	CHUCK TODD	Let me first show you, there is a primary of sorts that is taking place.
0528	CHUCK TODD	They had a debate last night.
0529	CHUCK TODD	First let me give you a little of Gary Johnson, the 2012 nominee, former New Mexico Republican governor, who is trying to be the mainstream Libertarian nominee this time.
0530	CHUCK TODD	Here was him yesterday.
0531	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0532	GARY JOHNSON	The Libertarian Party is growing.
0533	GARY JOHNSON	What I'd like to do is I'd like to fill up your current weekly meeting that's occurring in the treehouse to an auditorium.
0534	GARY JOHNSON	Here it is, we're at a threshold here, a real threshold to grow this party and to make it better.
0535	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0536	CHUCK TODD	So that's Gary Johnson's argument.
0537	CHUCK TODD	Here's a compilation of some of his opponents that were on that debate stage.
0538	AUSTIN PETERSEN	I believe in a world where gay, married couples can protect their marijuana fields with fullyautomatic machine guns, baby.
0539	MARC ALLAN FELDMAN	As a physician, I think it's a very good idea to have two separate bathrooms, one for people who wash their hands, and one for people who don't.
0540	DARRYL W. PERRY	Everything should be as legal as tomatoes.
0541	DARRYL W. PERRY	I think people are smart enough to know not to give heroin to a child unless under the direct supervision of a doctor.
0542	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0543	CHUCK TODD	Robert, there actually is a real chance what Kellyanne was bringing where Gary Johnson could get rejected by his party, and the Libertarians then suddenly are not a factor.
0544	ROBERT COSTA	He could.
0545	ROBERT COSTA	When I was on Capitol Hill this week, he talked to some members of the House and Republican senators.
0546	ROBERT COSTA	And they were inching close to the idea of maybe supporting the Libertarian ticket.
0547	ROBERT COSTA	But then they watched these candidates, they watched this convention, and they realized it's an imperfect vessel.
0548	ROBERT COSTA	And this is a problem for many of these neverTrump Republicans.
0549	ROBERT COSTA	Theyre considering Libertarian but they just don't fit into that culture.
0550	CHUCK TODD	Neera, where do you think this sort of neither, the noneoftheabove vote goes?
0551	CHUCK TODD	Does it go to greens and Libertarians and sort of split?
0552	CHUCK TODD	Do they not show up?
0553	CHUCK TODD	Does turnout actually go down, not up?
0554	NEERA TANDEN	I think actually a lot of the negativity of this race is designed to lower turnout.
0555	NEERA TANDEN	And I think that's actually Trump's strategy, to be so negative about everything that he actually lowers Democratic turnout.
0556	NEERA TANDEN	But I think, look, going into this race, it's a crazy year.
0557	NEERA TANDEN	So if it's not Johnson and somebody else, I think that still could attract some Republicans, even though you would think that some of these statements would disqualify them.
0558	JERRY SEIB	You know, we shouldn't forget, there's another place the noneoftheabove vote can go, and that's to the Green party.
0559	JERRY SEIB	And that some of the Sanders voters could drift there, just again, to make a statement.
0560	JERRY SEIB	That's a potential problem.
0561	NEERA TANDEN	Yeah, we have a history there with Democrats, which is Ralph Nader.
0562	NEERA TANDEN	And a lot of people feel like Ralph Nader actually is turning the election towardsthat Republicans don't have.
0563	ROBERT COSTA	Because you look at Trump as a noninterventionist on foreign policy, and some of those Ron Paul, Rand Paul supporters have drifted toward Trump because they see the main Republican party as too hawkish.
0564	CHUCK TODD	Actually, Kellyanne, I could make an argument hes more  Trump would be more comfortable in the Libertarian party than he would in the Republican.
0565	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Well, but that's because the Libertarians are comfortable with Trump as their nominee.
0566	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And I think they will be.
0567	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Look, none of the above, this year is no more outsiders, it's who is the change agent.
0568	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And I don't think there's a single hidden Hillary vote in the country.
0569	KELLYANNE CONWAY	I think there are many hidden Trump votes.
0570	KELLYANNE CONWAY	People who just don't want to engage at the cappuccino counter or water cooler 
0571	CHUCK TODD	It's a fascinating debate.
0572	CHUCK TODD	I've had people swear to me there's hidden Hillary votes on the right.
0573	KELLYANNE CONWAY	There aren't.
0574	CHUCK TODD	Hidden Trump votes on the left.
0575	CHUCK TODD	We'll find out in November.
0576	KELLYANNE CONWAY	We'll see.
0577	CHUCK TODD	We'll be back, 45 seconds, endgame segment, with a look at what a TrumpSanders debate might have looked like had it happened.
0578	CHUCK TODD	And a quick programming note, my colleague Richard Engel got rare access into America's drone warfare operation.
0579	CHUCK TODD	And a sitdown with the C.I.A.
0580	CHUCK TODD	Director John Brennan to talk about our country's drone strategy.
0581	CHUCK TODD	You can watch that report on On Assignment, which airs tonight at 700 Eastern, 600 Central on NBC.
0582	CHUCK TODD	We'll be right back.
0583	CHUCK TODD	Endgame time, panel is here.
0584	CHUCK TODD	You know, there was another player in the TrumpClinton campaign this week, and it was President Obama, overseas in Japan, historic visit, by the way, to Hiroshima.
0585	CHUCK TODD	But he was asked about what foreign leaders at the G7 meeting are saying about Donald Trump.
0586	CHUCK TODD	Here's what he said.
0587	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0588	PRESIDENT OBAMA	It's fair to say that they are surprised by the Republican nominee.
0589	PRESIDENT OBAMA	They are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements.
0590	PRESIDENT OBAMA	But they're rattled by it.
0591	PRESIDENT OBAMA	And for good reason.
0592	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0593	CHUCK TODD	Jerry, there's a couple of unusual things about that statement.
0594	CHUCK TODD	Number one, that he did it overseas.
0595	CHUCK TODD	And there was some criticism was that appropriate or not.
0596	CHUCK TODD	At the same time, Trump embraced the attack.
0597	JERRY SEIB	Yeah, exactly, well, which is what Donald Trump does.
0598	JERRY SEIB	But A) you do hear that a fair amount from people who go overseas, U.S. officials and business leaders, frankly, do tell me that they get the same thing.
0599	JERRY SEIB	B) it also suggests to you that Barack Obama is raring to go to campaign for Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump.
0600	JERRY SEIB	He does not want his legacy to be named Donald Trump.
0601	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Well, except I thought the most remarkable thing President Obama said later on there was that the quote "eventual Democratic nominee," leaving open the possibility that it may not be Hillary Clinton.
0602	KELLYANNE CONWAY	So I didn't hear him say that he's campaigning for Hillary Clinton and he's endorsed her.
0603	KELLYANNE CONWAY	He said the eventual Democratic nominee, why?
0604	NEERA TANDEN	We'll see in a few weeks.
0605	NEERA TANDEN	I think he went through his own experience, which is we had a long Democratic primary eight years ago, and then Hillary was really unified with him.
0606	NEERA TANDEN	And I expect President Obama to be campaigning, and the fact that his numbers are up now is going to be very helpful.
0607	CHUCK TODD	Thats whats
0608	ROBERT COSTA	We talk about the Bernie Sanders bump in the polling, and once President Obama gets and the campaign trail
0609	NEERA TANDEN	Endorses Hillary.
0610	NEERA TANDEN	No question.
0611	ROBERT COSTA	And you see the Republican party, the elders in the Republican party are just not with Trump in a significant way.
0612	CHUCK TODD	And that's been amazing, as President Obama, nobody maybe has benefited more from this topsyturvy primary campaign than Barack Obama.
0613	NEERA TANDEN	Or Donald Trump.
0614	CHUCK TODD	Right.
0615	JERRY SEIB	And the Clinton campaign people, you know this Neera, will tell you that most of the Trump rise in the polls in the last few weeks has been consolidation of the Republican vote.
0616	JERRY SEIB	That's the biggest portion of his rise.
0617	JERRY SEIB	And she will get her share of that when there's a consolidation on the Democratic side.
0618	JERRY SEIB	How big, we'll find out.
0619	CHUCK TODD	Right.
0620	NEERA TANDEN	You might see Donald Trump's highwater mark, 42 percent, 43 percent, 44 percent.
0621	NEERA TANDEN	She has a lot more room to move.
0622	NEERA TANDEN	But it may be the case.
0623	CHUCK TODD	We do have two conventions.
0624	CHUCK TODD	And it's like, you know, I think we know where the race will be right before the convention, the question is where is it going to be after.
0625	CHUCK TODD	But we're not going to get TrumpSanders debate, but we thought we'd put together a facsimile.
0626	CHUCK TODD	Here it is.
0627	SYSTEM	(BEGIN TAPE)
0628	DONALD TRUMP	We're going to run against crazy Bernie.
0629	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Donald Trump is toast.
0630	DONALD TRUMP	This socialistslashcommunist.
0631	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	It is not a wild, socialist idea.
0632	DONALD TRUMP	He's a crazy man.
0633	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	But he claims, he claims to be a billionaire.
0634	DONALD TRUMP	A lot of the Bernie Sanders people have said they're voting for Trump.
0635	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	We defeat Donald Trump by very large numbers.
0636	DONALD TRUMP	Big, big, huge victory.
0637	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	A huge voter turnout.
0638	DONALD TRUMP	Huge victories all over the place.
0639	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS	Huge, and I mean huge.
0640	SYSTEM	(END TAPE)
0641	CHUCK TODD	09573706 Payperview, would you have paid?
0642	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Oh yeah.
0643	CHUCK TODD	Yeah?
0644	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Oh yeah.
0645	JERRY SEIB	In a minute.
0646	CHUCK TODD	Whatever it's worth, 25 bucks?
0647	KELLYANNE CONWAY	I think so.
0648	KELLYANNE CONWAY	And Hillary would have been the odd man out.
0649	NEERA TANDEN	But yet it didn't happen.
0650	NEERA TANDEN	I wonder why it didn't happen.
0651	CHUCK TODD	I don't understand, Robert, why didn't Trump say yes to this?
0652	ROBERT COSTA	Trump's explanation is that he doesn't want to go against someone he thinks is going to come in second in the Democratic race.
0653	ROBERT COSTA	But Trump's a showman.
0654	ROBERT COSTA	I'm surprised it didn't happen.
0655	CHUCK TODD	I was stunned.
0656	NEERA TANDEN	Sanders is a good debater.
0657	NEERA TANDEN	Maybe he recognized that he couldn't handle it.
0658	JERRY SEIB	A lot of downside in that for Donald Trump I think.
0659	CHUCK TODD	I don't know.
0660	CHUCK TODD	The only person that was the loser was going to be
0661	KELLYANNE CONWAY	Hillary Clinton.
0662	CHUCK TODD	Hillary Clinton.
0663	NEERA TANDEN	No, I dont think so.
0664	NEERA TANDEN	I dont think so
0665	ROBERT COSTA	But doesnt it show you the kind of populism that's popular out there?
0666	CHUCK TODD	Well, we shall see.
0667	CHUCK TODD	Oh well.
0668	CHUCK TODD	Maybe for another campaign here.
0669	CHUCK TODD	That's all for today though.
0670	CHUCK TODD	We'll be back next week, because if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.
