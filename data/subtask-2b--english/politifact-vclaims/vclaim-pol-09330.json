Maybe once, right? Maybe?\" he asked on WTMJ-AM (620) in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Well, the State of Wisconsin thinks you should have to do it at least 28 times to make one peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich.\"\n\nWe happened to be driving to a lunch appointment (for Ethiopian food, not PB&Js) when we heard Wagner\u2019s claim, so it caught our attention.\n\nWagner\u2019s evidence\n\nThe former federal prosecutor replied promptly to our request for evidence to back his statement. He even went to the trouble of posting on his blog both the request and his response (which included the requisite dig at PolitiFact).\n\nThe evidence consisted of two things:\n\n-- A four-paragraph Associated Press news article, headlined \"Outagamie County sues over food code inspections,\" that was posted on JSOnline.com the day before Wagner made his claim.\n\n-- A copy of a federal court lawsuit Outagamie County filed against the state over state inspections of the county-owned nursing home.\n\nWagner also noted in his email that he discussed the lawsuit later in his show. (By the way, both the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which produces PolitiFact Wisconsin, and WTMJ are owned by Journal Communications.)\n\nThat means listeners who only heard Wagner\u2019s tease might have thought the state was poking its nose into their kitchen. But he made it clear half an hour later that his claim had to do with the nursing home lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit\n\nOutagamie County sued the state Department of Health Services in March 2013, objecting to code violations cited in 2011 and 2012 at Brewster Village, a county-owned nursing home.\n\nState inspectors enforce both state and federal regulations governing nursing homes. And some of the violations cited at Brewster Village involve federal codes for food preparation.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the state issued its violation notices in 2011, according to the lawsuit, workers at the nursing home conducted \"time studies.\" They wanted to see -- based on how they said the state interpreted federal food regulations -- how long it would take \"to provide for the number of hand washes, glove changes and other steps.\"\n\nThe county concluded that in order to comply, nursing home staff would need to wash their hands 28 times to safely make peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches -- rather than the nine times they normally do.\n\nOf course, in the context of a lawsuit, it\u2019s in the county\u2019s interest to claim the state-required number is as high as possible. Whether it\u2019s nine times or 28 times, the impression for most will be the same: Really?\n\nWash, wash, wash\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember we\u2019re not talking about a person at home making a PB&J for their lunch, but multiple workers making sandwiches for medically fragile people in a 204-bed nursing home.\n\nStill, it seems like a whole lot of washing going on.\n\nState inspectors cited a number of instances at Brewster Village they said violated the federal food code. For example: workers adjusting knobs on a device that was soiled with a brown substance; pouring hot water into a pitcher without first washing hands; touching a drawer handle soiled with grease to remove a clean utensil from the drawer; and donning a pair of gloves and opening a drawer to get a clean utensil and, without hand washing, cutting open two bags of gravy mix.\n\nWhat does the state say about all this?\n\nState inspectors didn\u2019t declare in their reports that nursing home staff needed to wash hands a particular number of times during food preparation.\n\nAnd the Department of Health Services wouldn\u2019t comment to us on Outagamie County\u2019s claim that, according to the state\u2019s interpretation of federal rules, 28 hand washes are necessary during sandwich making.\n\nIt seems likely, though, based on the violation notices the state issued, that the state believes the hand washing should have occurred more than nine times.\n\nOur rating\n\nWagner said \"the State of Wisconsin thinks you should have to\" wash your hands \"at least 28 times to make one peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\"\n\nWagner later made it clear he was referring to food preparation in a county-owned nursing home. But although the state indicated it wanted nursing home staff to wash their hands more than nine times, it didn\u2019t specify a number.\n\nWagner\u2019s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09330"}
