He let him off the hook,\" the Kilmartin campaign ad says.\n\nThe facts of this case have been widely reported but the story broke two years ago. So let's review.\n\nIn the spring of 2006, Providence was trying to collect back taxes from Felix Nelson Garcia for his storefront property on Cranston Street. John Cicilline, Garcia's lawyer, wrote a $75,000 check on his law office account to the city tax collector's office, to be used as collateral. Garcia was to pay the tax bill once he refinanced the property. To allow the refinancing to happen, the city lifted a lien on the property.\n\nWhen that check expired, Cicilline wrote a replacement check on the same account, which apparently never had sufficient funds to cash it. Cicilline maintained that the city knew that the money wasn't there. City officials said they agreed to the deal because Cicilline was a well-regarded criminal lawyer who was unlikely to jeopardize that distinction or do anything to embarrass his brother.\n\n(Cicilline was subsequently sentenced to 18 months in federal prison after pleading guilty in June 2008 to shaking down drug-dealer clients. He is now disbarred.)\n\nThe check was never cashed and the property changed hands without the city getting its money. The incident led to the firing of Tax Collector Robert P. Ceprano.\n\nProJo.com reported the news of the bad check on Sept. 18, 2008. By then, Garcia's bill, with interest, had grown to $132,000.\n\nFive days later, Providence Police Chief Dean M. Esserman asked the state police to investigate. They spent nearly nine months on the probe, before sending the case to Attorney General Patrick Lynch. Two months later, Lynch's office decided against criminal prosecution.\n\nNow back to the campaign ad.\n\nDuring all of this, Fernandez, as city solicitor, was Providence's top lawyer. Neither Fernandez nor his office prosecuted the case. Kilmartin says Fernandez should have done that, implying that he didn't because John Cicilline is the mayor's brother.\n\nThe Kilmartin ad leaves out a lot of important information.\n\nIt is true that Cicilline wrote two bad checks totaling \"over\" $100,000. The actual total was $150,000.\n\nBut the second $75,000 check was a replacement for the first check, which had\u00a0 expired. Cicilline never owed the city \"over $100,000,\" as the ad implies. As a result, the phrasing of the Kilmartin ad is technically true but grossly misleading.\n\nSecond, and perhaps more important, state law prohibits any city or town solicitor from prosecuting a felony. That authority rests with the attorney general, who declined to take action after an independent investigation by state police.\n\nRobert Craven, a lawyer for the Kilmartin campaign and former state prosecutor, argued that Fernandez should have repackaged the case as a misdemeanor charge or filed a civil suit against Cicilline to get the money. (That wouldn't actually be a prosecution. Only crimes are prosecuted; civil cases are litigated.)\n\nThe Fernandez campaign said that, by that time, the city solicitor's office had a conflict of interest because Ceprano (the fired tax collector who had been represented by Fernandez's office) had sued the city for wrongful discharge. To avoid the conflict, Fernandez hired Deming E. Sherman, of Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge, to pursue a civil lawsuit to recover the unpaid taxes.\n\nDavid M. Zlotnick, professor of law at Roger Williams University School of Law, said Fernandez's sending the case to a private lawyer seems more than reasonable. \"If you refer the case to outside counsel, then the suit is going to get pursued.\" In a later e-mail he said, \"There seems to be no effort to sweep this under the rug or avoid tackling a serious matter.\"\n\nSherman says Fernandez instructed him about a year ago to explore potential civil action against Scott L. Hammer, the private attorney who dealt with the Garcia account on the city's behalf.\n\nThe campaign provided us with an April 21, 2009 letter from Sherman acknowledging that he would represent the city \"in connection with potential litigation against Scott L. Hammer and John M. Cicilline...\"\n\nSherman said he has been actively pursuing a case against Hammer and depositions are still being taken. He would not say whether any action was planned against Cicilline, who has since been released from prison.\n\nAnd, for the record, the Kilmartin ad says, in big letters, \"Joe Fernandez failed to prosecute corruption - Providence Journal 4/1/09.\" The Journal's story that day, headlined \"Deadline near for suit in Providence tax case,\" says no such thing.\n\nTo sum it up:\n* Kilmartin's ad cites a dollar amount that is misleading.\n* He attacks Fernandez for not bringing criminal charges, when Fernandez, by law, had no authority to do so.\n* He faults him for not bringing a civil case, when Fernandez, for ethics reasons, turned the case over to a private lawyer to pursue potential civil action.\n\nHis allegations against Fernandez fall into the realm of ridiculous, and we give him a Pants On Fire!\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14457"}
