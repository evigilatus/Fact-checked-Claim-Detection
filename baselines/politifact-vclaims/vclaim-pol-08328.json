Women deserve equal pay for equal work.\"\nIt was not the first time Obama (or other Democrats) have offered the 77-cent data point -- not by a long shot. A search on the White House website calls up literally dozens of examples of policy papers, blog posts and speeches in which the president cited the 77-cent statistic. He used it in a proclamation for National Equal Pay Day (July 20, 2010), in remarks at a White House forum on women and the economy (April 6, 2012), in a conference call with reporters (June 4, 2012), and remarks on the 50th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act (June 10, 2013), just to cite a few.\nBefore we get into the statistics, we need to explain how we\u2019re approaching this claim in this fact-check. We\u2019ve heard the 77-cent statistic used a lot of different ways, and small changes in wording make a big difference in determining whether it\u2019s accurate or not.\nThe less accurate version -- once offered by Obama himself -- states that women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns for the same work, or in the same job. As we\u2019ll explain below, the data doesn\u2019t show that. By contrast, the more accurate version simply states that women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns, period. That is more accurate (though not without some caveats, also listed below).\nWe struggled a bit with how to classify the claim Obama made in the State of the Union, since his phrasing was somewhat ambiguous. He used the more accurate formulation, but he then followed up two sentences later by saying, \"Women deserve equal pay for equal work.\" Did Obama\u2019s \"equal pay for equal work\" line suggest that he believes the 77-cent pay differential refers to statistical comparisons of \"equal work\"? Or was this sentence simply a philosophical statement that was distinct from the statistical claim?\nUltimately, we decided that Obama\u2019s statement that \"women deserve equal pay for equal work\" was aspirational rather than a part of his statistical claim, so we\u2019re judging him on his claim that women \"make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.\"\nHere\u2019s a rundown of what we\u2019ve found in the past, updated for the most recent data.\nRatios vary depending on the methodology\nThe basic federal data comes from two agencies -- the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the two agencies\u2019 numbers don\u2019t exactly agree.\nThe Census Bureau, which tracks annual wages, found women who worked full-time, year-round in 2012 made 77 cents for every dollar men earned across the country -- a percentage in line with what it\u2019s been for the last few years. This comparison includes all male and female workers regardless of occupation.\nMeanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses a different measures to analyze the pay gap, including weekly wages. BLS found that women who worked full time in wage and salary jobs had median usual weekly earnings of $669 in 2012, which was 82 percent of men\u2019s median weekly earnings. This, too, was in line with the ratio in recent years.\nWhat\u2019s the difference? Unlike the measure of annual wages by the Census Bureau, the weekly wage analysis does not account for people who are self-employed. It does include people left out of the year-round wage measure, such as some teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers.\nAnother measure -- hourly rates -- shows a smaller degree of pay disparity. According to BLS data, women were paid 86 percent of the median hourly wages of men in 2012. This evaluation accounts for part-time (fewer than 35 hours) workers, which are more often women and are paid less than their salaried counterparts. Women paid by the hour made median hourly earnings of $11.99, compared to $13.88 for men. However, this figure excludes salaried workers -- another reason why the statistics differ.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, told PolitiFact in 2012 that the measure of annual wages is preferable, since it doesn\u2019t exclude salaried workers. \"It\u2019s the one that goes back the furthest in time,\" she said. \"It\u2019s the one that is most traditional.\"\nBut some researchers, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, prefer working with hourly wages, arguing \"an incomplete picture\" is cast with weekly earnings because women work fewer hours than men, \"which would make a gap in weekly earnings between the two groups substantial even if their hourly wages are the same.\"\nIn other words, there\u2019s a range of professional opinion on what the data shows.\nDifferences in jobs held\nIt\u2019s important to point out a few additional caveats.\nFirst, there\u2019s a significant variation in wage gaps from occupation to occupation.\nThe Institute for Women\u2019s Policy research looked at pay parity for the top 20 occupations for women in 2011 using median weekly earnings. The center found the pay gap varied depending on the sector, though women lag in nearly every category. Nurses (96 cents for every dollar) and cashiers (90 cents) were closer than most; accountants (77 cents) and financial advisers (66 cents) were more divergent than most.\nSecond, it\u2019s important to note that the existence of a pay gap doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the gap is caused by individual employer-level discrimination. Rather, some portion is likely the result of broader demographic patterns.\nFor instance, men and women historically enter certain fields more than others -- a phenomenon known as \"occupational segregation.\" Women more often choose to be receptionists, nurses and teachers, while men pursue paths as truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers, according to the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research. When data from all these fields is combined together, as in the Census and BLS studies, the gap is at least partially explained by the predominance of women in lower-paying fields, rather than women necessarily being paid less for the same job than men are.\nIn addition, women disproportionately obtain degrees that lead to lower-paying jobs than men, and they take more time off from work for pregnancy and child care, according to a 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh. Despite the growth in fathers\u2019 role in child care, the child-care burden shouldered by women tends to restrict their career options and hours worked.\nWhile such patterns raise important policy questions, they don\u2019t necessarily point to discrimination per se.\nSo how much of a role does discrimination play? Hartmann attributed anywhere from one-quarter to one-third of the gap to direct discrimination by the employer. A U.S. Labor Department blog post put it a bit higher -- around 40 percent. The CONSAD paper suggested that when you control for every factor but discrimination, the gap shrunk to between 93 cents and 95 cents -- not zero, but significantly smaller than the 77-cent figure Obama used.\nWhen we checked with the White House, a spokesman acknowledged that there is more than one way to calculate the gender pay gap, and that discrimination isn\u2019t the only factor causing the gap. But the spokesman added that it would be wrong to ignore how discrimination and differences in workplace flexibility impact occupational choice.\nOur ruling\nObama said women \"make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.\"\nIt's worth noting that the entire 77-cent gap is not necessarily due to discrimination -- a conclusion some listeners might have drawn when hearing Obama mention \"equal pay for equal work\" shortly after citing the 77-cent figure. And there are alternative calculations that show a smaller overall gap. Still, the 77-cent ratio is a credible figure from a credible agency.
