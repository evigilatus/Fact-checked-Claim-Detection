The board\u2019s Investment Committee oversees the university\u2019s $400 million total endowment.\nThe foundation is classified under Florida laws as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, meaning some relevant records are shielded from disclosure.\nThis makes it hard to pinpoint the exact companies the foundation invests its money. Here\u2019s what we know.\nThe committee that oversees the university\u2019s endowment does not select individual stocks or companies for the endowment to invest in; rather, it hires investment managers who decide what funds to invest.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdam Freeman, the communications director for USF, said the video asserts that the USF Foundation made a decision to invest in certain companies, which is not the case.\n\"The university does not invest in individual companies,\" he said. \"A diversified portfolio has exposure to a wide array of asset classes with investments that will span most, if not all, major industries. The investment practices followed by the foundation are common within colleges and universities as well as other institutional investors.\"\nSteven Perfect, a finance professor at Florida State University, said investors have no control over the contents of individual funds, but said they can always choose to move to other mutual funds that more closely track their preferences.\nA strict enforcement of the video\u2019s divestiture goals would be a bit of a challenge, but is certainly possible at some cost, Perfect said. There are certain investment plans that offer investors carbon-free portfolios, for instance.\u00a0\nUSF Divest said there are hundreds of campaigns going on nationwide and there are many examples of successful divestment\u00a0efforts. For example, Columbia University divested from private prisons in 2014 by selling its stock in\u00a0G4S, the world's largest private security firm, as well its shares in the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA).\u00a0\nWhat about those specific industries?\nThe foundation\u2019s status under Florida laws and its wide-ranging investment techniques make it hard to pinpoint specific companies and industries where money is being invested.\nThe most recent document about the foundation\u2019s investment decisions is from 2013.\nBack in 2013, Ken Souza, the investment director of the USF Foundation, provided a list of investment managers that decide what mutual funds to invest in. Once they had the list of mutual funds, the group was able to look up the specific companies using the Securities Exchange Commission Edgar website.\nTo look up a mutual fund on SEC Edgar, you need the name of the mutual fund or the Stock Ticker associated with the mutual fund. (A Stock Ticker is the five-letter identification to look up the mutual fund.)\nThis is what the group received:\n\nWith the stock tickers, they were able to look at what companies those mutual funds invested in, which included British Petroleum (an oil company), Altria (a tobacco company better known by Philip Morris) and CoreCivic (a company that owns and manages private prisons and detention centers), to name a few.\nWe were able to confirm these companies on the SEC Edgar website. We noticed that portfolio holdings were even more diverse than what USF Divest highlighted.\nFor instance, Wilmington Funds (WMRIX) invests in stock in multiple industries including automobiles, airlines, textiles, technology and energy.\nUSF\u00a0Divest said it requested more up-to-date information from the foundation but never got it. We asked the university and the foundation, too.\nFreeman said that the foundation does not have a publicly available document that would provide that level of detail like the 2013 document. (And he did not offer one up.)\nBesides the foundation\u2019s audited financial statements, the most updated investment information that is publicly available is in the foundation\u2019s Investment Prospectus \u2014 a two-page overview about the endowment\u2019s investment strategy.\nAs detailed in the Investment Prospectus, the endowment is invested with managers who specialize in specific asset classes. (An asset class is a group of securities that have similar characteristics and behaviors and is subject to the same laws and regulations.)\nPerfect said the Foundation\u2019s asset allocation plan suggests it\u2019s investments are diversified, but said he can\u2019t be certain without seeing what\u2019s inside each asset class.\nOur ruling\nUSF Divest said the university invests in oil companies like BP, tobacco companies, weapons manufacturers and private prisons.\nBased on a 2013 list of mutual funds that the foundation invested in, the claim holds water. The caveats are that the mutual fund managers directed where the money should be invested, not the foundation directly, and this investment is common and covers most industries represented on the stock market.\nThe statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
