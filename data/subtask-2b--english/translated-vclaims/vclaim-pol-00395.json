Using the images of Trump and Adolf Hitler, a Facebook post was published on July 22 with similar quotations for each man. \"Jews are not humans, but rats,\" says writer Hitler. At the same time, Trump says: \"Migrants are not humans, but animals.\" This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Two other articles were also published on Facebook on July 22. Someone claims that Hitler said: \"Jews are not humans; they are animals,\" while Trump said: \"Undocumented immigrants are not humans; they are animals.\" Other features include Joseph Goebbels, Minister of Publicity under Hitler's leadership in Nazi Germany. \"These are not humans, but animals,\" says Goebbels about those who stoned the Jewish neighborhood of Poland occupied by the Nazis. The article then attributes to Trump this statement about asylum-seekers on the United States-Mexico border in 2019: \"These are not people. These are animals.\" What did Trump actually say? He called gang members \"animals,\" not all immigrants. Here's what really happened in May 2018. California officials had met at the White House to hold a round table on immigration policy, Margaret Meems, Mayor of Fresno County, California, which mentioned members of the MS-13 gang known to have committed brutal crimes. California &apos; s laws made it difficult for it to share information with federal authorities about dangerous criminals such as members of the MS-13 gang. On January 11, 2021, Facebook, in an article in Facebook, Nancy Belosi, was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. On January 12, 2021, Trump said: \"We have a lot of people coming into our country, or trying to get in - and we're stopping a lot of them - but we're taking people out of the country. You wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't people. These are animals. We're getting them out of the country at a level that's never happened before. Because of weak laws, they come quickly, we get them, we release them, we get them back, we get them out. This is crazy.\" Trump shot this comment, including from Sen. Diane Fenstein, who tweeted: \"Migrants are not \"animals.\" The President's statement was extremely offensive and racist. Migrants are our family and friends and they make significant contributions to our country.\" However, others pointed out that Trump was referring to members of the MS-13 gang; he did not call all immigrants \"animals.\" Subsequently, the White House issued a press release entitled \"What you need to know about violent animals MS-13,\" which described gang members as \"animals\" 10 times. Trump also told a reporter who asked him about the observation that he was referring to \"the next MS-13 gangs,\" according to The New York Times. When Trump recently used his comment in a misleading tweet claiming that Trump called asylum seekers \"animals\" - with the participation of democratic presidential candidates and liberal volunteers - we assessed the allegation as false. Our Facebook article said that Trump said: \"Migrants are not humans, they are animals.\" A word for a word, that's wrong. At a round table on migration policy, Trump said: \"These are not people. These are animals.\" But the context is important. Trump was responding to the sheriff who said that California's laws made it difficult for her to share information with federal authorities about dangerous criminals like MS-13. Trump also later said that he was referring to gang members. Trump was criticized for his choice of words, and some interpreted his remarks as seducing all undocumented migrants. But this Facebook article goes beyond its limits. We assess it wrong.
