In fact, 70 percent of recent voters in party primaries in Austin voted exclusively in Democratic primaries from 2006 through 2012, with 22 percent participating exclusively in Republican primaries, according to numbers that Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin ran for us.\n\nVoting in a primary election doesn\u2019t necessarily prove someone\u2019s political lean, though in Texas it\u2019s the closest signal available from voting records. Texans do not register to vote by party affiliation; anyone can vote in either primary, even switching from election year to election year.\n\nIn Austin, where many down-ticket races field no Republican opposition, sometimes the only way a voter can affect the outcome is by choosing between Democratic candidates in the primary. In the same way, it often makes sense for voters in, say, Midland, to commit to the county\u2019s Republican primary.\n\nCouncil races in Austin are nonpartisan, and while city ordinance says the commission should have \"diversity by race, ethnicity, gender and geography,\" it doesn\u2019t specify any restrictions on members\u2019 politics. But we looked into whether Ryan got the commission members\u2019 votes right.\n\nIn November 2012, Austinites voted to switch the council from seven citywide members to 10 district representatives and a mayor, starting with the November 2014 election.\n\nSome 550 people applied to be on the 14-member commission that will draw the new districts\u2019 maps by Dec. 1, 2013. A panel narrowed the pool to 60 finalists, then city staffers drew names at random, according to the city\u2019s website. The new members will choose six more from the pool of finalists to round out the group.\n\nRyan told us by email, \"When the eight were announced, I did a quick check on those individuals,\" looking at records from the 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012 primaries. Afterward, he said, he got curious about the other eligible applicants and calculated that 55 percent voted in the 2012 Democratic primary and 24 percent voted in the Republican primary.\n\nHe started his research, Ryan said, with information from the commission applications the city posted online. Then he matched each applicant\u2019s information to his own voter database, which he said he compiled from information kept by county clerks\u2019 offices and the Texas secretary of state, the state\u2019s chief elections officer.\n\nThe applicants whose names were drawn for the commission were Magdalena Blanco, Mariano D\u00edaz-Miranda, Rachel Farris, Phil Hewitt, Carmen Llanes Pulido, Art Lopez, Anna Saenz and Maria Solis.\n\nAll except Llanes Pulido were registered Travis County voters from 2006 through 2012; according to Smith\u2019s records, Llanes Pulido was registered in Travis from 2007 through 2012. If she voted in the 2006 primary somewhere else, Smith said, it probably was not in Texas, because his records showed no voting history for her before the 2007 general election.\n\nAt our request, Travis County Tax Office spokeswoman Tiffany Seward looked up each new commission member\u2019s 2006-2012 primary voting record and emailed us the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2006\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\nMagdalena Blanco\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\n\n\nMariano Diaz-Miranda\n\n\n\nNo vote\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\nRachel Farris\n\n\n\nNo vote\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhil Hewitt\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\nCarmen Llanes Pulido\n\n\n\nNot registered in Travis\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\nArt Lopez\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\nAnna Saenz\n\n\n\nNo vote\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nNo vote\n\n\n\nNo vote\n\n\n\n\n\nMaria Solis\n\n\n\nNo vote\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe sought to speak with all eight for their views and reached everyone but Saenz, although Blanco, Farris, Hewitt and Lopez declined to comment. Farris, incidentally, writes the MeanRachel.com blog, where she is identified as a Democratic activist who also writes for the Huffington Post.\n\nThree commissioners who voted in the latest three Democratic primaries said by telephone that voting records did not tell the whole story and party politics won\u2019t bear on the commission\u2019s job.\n\nLlanes Pulido told us, \"I consider myself politically independent; I do not consider myself a Democrat.\" She dislikes how primaries cause voters to identify themselves with a party, she said, and as an elections judge had asked voters, \"In which primary would you like to participate?\" rather than \"Are you a Democrat or a Republican?\" Party leanings are not germane, she said, \"because the Austin City Council is a nonpartisan council and the elections are nonpartisan elections.\"\n\nD\u00edaz-Miranda said Ryan\u2019s tweet wasn\u2019t relevant. \"The job we\u2019re doing is to try to bring more people to feel represented,\" he said. He considers himself independent, he told us. \"I\u2019ve also voted Republican here,\" he said; as an example, he said, he voted for Terry Keel for Travis County sheriff (a post Keel held from 1992 to 1997 before serving as a Republican state representative from Austin).\n\nSolis said, \"I\u2019m not going to give you an opinion about my politics because that\u2019s not what this is about. \u2026 I think I\u2019m a well-informed, balanced person that will vote on what we\u2019re supposed to be doing and not on my party preference.\" The commission\u2019s job, she said, is to give voters representation that is \"hopefully more within their own area, and hopefully they will know the people that they are voting for.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nRyan said the first choices to draw Austin\u2019s council districts are seven Democratic primary voters and one GOP primary voter.\n\nRecords show that six of the eight members voted in the three Travis County Democratic primaries from 2008 through 2012, and two of the six also voted in the county\u2019s 2006 Democratic primary. One commissioner voted in the 2008 Democratic primary and didn\u2019t vote in any others. One voted in two Democratic primaries and two Republican primaries since 2006.\n\nWe rate his statement as True.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCLARIFICATION, 11:30 am, June 5, 2013: We revised this story to clarify that 70 percent of recent voters in party primaries in Austin cast ballots exclusively in Democratic primaries. The original version said 70 percent of Austinites had recently voted exclusively in those primaries. This revision did not affect our rating of the claim.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09258"}
