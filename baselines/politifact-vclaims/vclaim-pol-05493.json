Marco Rubio defended past support of a cap-and-trade bill in the Florida House by saying it was an attempt to protect the state from future federal regulations.\nFox News moderator Bret Baier asked Rubio about the issue at a Republican presidential primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 28, 2016. Baier said Rubio had \"wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap-and-trade system\" while he was House speaker in 2008, and asked why Rubio had changed his mind.\nRubio denied he backed a popular plan supported by then-Gov. Charlie Crist, claiming he was looking to insulate Florida from restrictions a future president might impose.\n\"I have never supported cap and trade, and I never thought it was a good idea, and I was clear about that at the time,\" Rubio said.\nRubio has been very outspoken during this campaign about his opposition to cap and trade, which lets businesses trade pollution credits if they don't meet emission caps. But is his retelling of what happened in 2008 accurate?\nCap and trade mission\nWe literally went to the tape to find out, because the key evidence in this claim is a snippet from a March 13, 2008, appearance Rubio made on WFSU\u2019s Florida Face to Face.\nRubio was discussing HB 7135, an energy and climate change bill championed by Crist that included the Florida Climate Protection Act. That part of the law allowed the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to formulate a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse emissions from electric utilities.\n\"Florida should position itself for what I believe is inevitable, and that is a federal cap-and-trade program. Florida should do everything it can to be an early complier so it can access early compliance funds and so that it can help influence what that cap-and-trade looks like at the federal level,\" Rubio said on the show, which ran during the legislative session. \"And so I\u2019m in favor of giving the Department of Environmental Protection a mandate that they go out and design a cap-and-trade or a carbon-tax program and bring it back to the Legislature for ratification some time in the next two years.\"\nCrist used a portion of this clip during his 2010 Senate primary campaign against Rubio in an attempt to show Rubio favored a cap-and-trade program. WFSU, which operates The Florida Channel covering state government, demanded Crist stop using footage of the show because of a law barring use of its footage in political campaigns.\nThis limited portion of the show has been resurrected online during the presidential primary, leading some conservative sites to question Rubio\u2019s stance on the issue.\nBut wait, as they say, there\u2019s more. Rubio\u2019s campaign had complained the clip was out of context, and it appears it really was. They have pointed to a longer edit of the footage that shows Rubio going on to say:\n\"I\u2019m in favor of them designing it. I\u2019m not in favor of them designing it and implementing it. I\u2019m in favor of them designing it and then bringing it back to the Legislature. The way we\u2019re going toclean up our environment, the way we\u2019re going to lower carbon emissions, is not through government mandates.\"\nThat certainly changes the context of his statement. Rubio\u2019s campaign did not respond to PolitiFact\u2019s questions about his potential support of cap and trade, but they have addressed this issue before.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

But he concluded that \"instead of adopting measures that will have little if any impact on our environment and make life in Florida more expensive, we need a strategy that encourages environmental conservation, fuel efficiency and energy diversity, while continuing to stimulate our economy.\"\nRubio also said in a March 2007 speech that Florida was ripe to change energy policy because it was both environmentally sound and potentially lucrative.\n\"This nation, and ultimately the world, is headed towards emission caps and energy diversification,\" he said. \"Those changes will require technological advances that make those measures cost effective. The demand toward such advances will create an industry to meet it. Florida should become the Silicon Valley of that industry.\"\nRubio did seem to change his tune a bit by 2009, when he was being criticized for his full-throated opposition of cap and trade after presiding over the passage of HB 7135. Environmentalists and scientists noted Rubio had shepherded the entire process as House speaker.\n\"The legislation was passed to move forward on cap-and-trade policy, and certainly Marco Rubio didn't stand in the way of that legislation passing and my understanding was that he was supportive of the process,\" John Reilly, a leading climate change expert from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology hired by Rubio to advise lawmakers, told the Miami Herald. \"He certainly seemed to accept the science of climate change.\"\nRubio argued then that he wanted to take executive authority away from Crist, although the DEP countered they would have always needed legislative approval. Cap and trade planning fell by the wayside as Crist waged a losing Senate primary battle against Rubio.\n\"It has worked out as it was designed to work out, which was to stop a cap-and-trade system in Florida,\" Rubio said in 2009. Some critics at the time doubted that was Rubio's true plan, as it was a big gamble that the Legislature would shut down any proposed DEP cap and trade proposal.\nBut a 2015 article in the National Journal said that while the bill passed (and it passed the House and Senate unanimously), Rubio did add wording that prevented the plan from being implemented. The final bill indeed only allowed DEP to develop a potential plan, and required legislative approval to become practice.\nThe National Journal quoted former House minority leader and state Rep. Dan Gelber, D-Miami Beach, who said, \"I fully credit him with the gutting of the bill.\"\nOur ruling\nRubio said, \"I have never supported cap and trade.\"\nAs House speaker in Florida, Rubio did preside over the unanimous passage of an energy bill that allowed the state to develop a cap-and-trade plan for electric utility emissions. But it appears his comments on the bill have been taken out of context, and that there may have been some legislative craftiness afoot.\nRubio said he wanted Florida to cook up a plan of its own before federal regulations were imposed on the state. He also voiced opposition to government mandates and inserted a roadblock to letting any plan actually be implemented, details that get left out when Rubio is accused of supporting the measure.\nHe now is much more vocal in his opposition of cap and trade, but it looks as if he has always favored a largely hands-off approach from government.
