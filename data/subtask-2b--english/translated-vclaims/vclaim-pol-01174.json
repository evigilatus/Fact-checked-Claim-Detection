Chuck Schommer, New York University, supported a border-wall deal during Barack Obama's presidency, and then turned after President Donald Trump took over the White House. The article contains a picture of Schommer and a mock confession from the first person revealing the party cause of the minority leader in the Senate. In 2014, I helped develop and sign a $25 billion deal to finance a border wall, Now, Trump wants $5 billion for a border wall. Well, I'm just gonna cry and piss and whine because he's a Republican and he wants to.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The meme swims in real mistakes and suspicious interpretations. There is no agreement on the border wall in 2014. According to the article, Schommer helped set an agreement on the border wall in 2014. This is wrong: there was no border-barrier deal that year. He could have been the author of the article thinking about the 2013 proposal sponsored by Schommer through the Senate. However, the 2013 legislation has been described as a $25 billion deal to finance a \"border wall\" with realistic obstacles. This proposal was approved by the Senate in 2013, the comprehensive migration plan sponsored by and voted in favour of Schommer. But the house controlled by the Republicans didn't accept the bill anymore. (It should be noted that the Presidents, and not the legislators, as proposed by Mme, sign draft laws in the form of a law. The package included more than $46 billion for border security. The vast majority of those funds ($30 billion) were for the recruitment of more United States border patrol personnel along the southern border. About $8 billion could have gone towards building or repairing 700 miles of fence (including some double-layered fence) along the United States-Mexico border. This is not $25 billion for the wall, as the Mim claimed. It will be easy to say that the duel supported by Schommer in 2013 corresponds to the same description of Trump as \"inviable, material, long, strong, and beautiful south border wall,\" with \"probably 35 to 40 feet in the air.\" On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 On February 3, 2012, Schommer's office insisted that the border fence was very different from the promised Trump Wall. The Senator &apos; s office referred to Trump &apos; s tweet from the election when Trump scolded his opponent in the Bush pocket to confuse the two. \"Jeep Bush just talked about my border proposal to build the Trump fence. It's not a fence, Jeb. It's Wall. There's a big difference. Daniel Joaquin, Schumer's spokesman, said: \"Sen. Schumer supports duel where it makes sense and then he still does today.\" Schommer also argues that border security is not limited to the wall, and that there are other more effective ways to secure the border. The Mimi claims that Schommer is opposed to a wall \"only because Trump is Republican.\" Another point needs to be made: in January 2018, Schommer said that he offered to support the financing of the Trump border wall in exchange for a broader immigration package that included a deal for the so-called \"wreamers,\" young immigrants living illegally in the country. Schommer reportedly made a $25 billion offer to the wall during a private meeting with Trump, where legislators negotiated a way to avoid government closure. Schommer canceled his offer just a few days after his presentation, saying he was out of the table because Trump rejected the broader immigration deal. The New York Times stated that while the White House refused to admit that Schommer had made a facet, it was confirmed by the Senate leaders on both sides of the corridor. An offer in the name of Schommer to finance a border wall undermines the idea of the Mimi that he automatically excluded the wall just because Trump wanted it. Our Facebook article says that in 2014, Schommer \"helped to develop and sign a $25 billion deal to finance a border wall\" and now opposes Trump's request for $5 billion for a border wall \"only because he's a Republican.\" There are many factual errors here: there was no border barrier deal in 2014. A 2013 package of legislation proposed $8 billion for the boundary fence - not $25 billion for the boundary wall. More importantly, the border fence supported by Schommer in 2013 differs from the way Trump described his border wall. The Mimi shines the previous support of Schommer to finance the border wall earlier this year, in exchange for the protection of dreams. We value this wrong mail.
