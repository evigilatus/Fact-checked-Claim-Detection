Petri says Obama commission recommended vouchers for Medicare", "text": "When House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan submitted his 2012 federal budget plan in April 2011, he touted how much more it cut spending, debt and deficits than President Barack Obama\u2019s plan.\n\nSome of the loudest objections to the Wisconsin Republican\u2019s proposal, however, decried its transformation of Medicare. MoveOn.org, a left-leaning political advocacy group, went so far as to say Ryan would abolish the 46-year-old program in 10 years.\n\nWe ruled that claim False, partly because current Medicare recipients would continue to receive traditional Medicare even after 10 years.\n\nBut, as we noted, Ryan\u2019s plan would change Medicare dramatically. Starting in 2022, Medicare would no longer directly help pay for doctor visits, hospital care, other services and prescription drugs. Rather, future Medicare participants would choose a private insurance plan and Medicare -- through what are called premium-support payments or vouchers -- would help pay for the insurance.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group that studies health care policy, noted that in the days after Ryan\u2019s budget plan was released, three national polls found Americans divided on such a change.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, R-Wisconsin, was conducting his annual survey of constituents. In his April 2011 newsletter, the 32-year Fond du Lac congressman posed this question to residents in the 6th District, which is north and west of Milwaukee:\n\n\"One of the recommendations put forth by the president\u2019s debt commission was to convert the Medicare system from a government-run insurance program to a system where Medicare participants are given a voucher to purchase insurance in the private market. Would you support such a change?\"\n\nThat left us with this question: Did a commission created by a Democratic president recommend the same sweeping change to Medicare that was part of the House GOP budget?\n\nThe debt commission mentioned in Petri\u2019s question -- the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform-- was formed by an Obama executive order in February 2010. The 18-member panel included Ryan, who was appointed by Republican leaders of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe commission was charged with making recommendations to balance the federal budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. The recommendations came in a report issued in December 2010. This is what Petri\u2019s survey question cited in saying the commission recommended a voucher program for Medicare.\n\nThe word voucher appears only once in the commission\u2019s 66-page report, as part of Recommendation \"3.3.13.\" The recommendation addressed Federal Employees Health Benefits, the health insurance program for federal employees and retirees.\n\nThe commission said the insurance should be made into a premium-support or voucher program. Federal retirees could use their voucher to pay part of their Medicare premium.\n\nBut that is for a limited group, federal employees and retirees.\n\nThat is not transforming all of Medicare into a voucher program. Had that recommendation been made, it undoubtedly would have stirred the same criticism that the Republican plan has.\n\nThe commission\u2019s report noted that two commission members -- Ryan and Alice Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton -- had proposed converting Medicare into a voucher system. The commission\u2019s view was that such a system \"holds significant promise of controlling costs, but also carries serious potential risks.\"\n\nThe commission suggested that, if its recommendation were put in place to make health insurance for federal employees and retirees a premium-support or voucher program, \"that experience would be useful in considering a premium-support program for Medicare.\"\n\nSo, the president\u2019s commission recommended trying a voucher program with federal employees and retirees and then, based on the results, deciding whether to try it with Medicare.\n\nAfter we contacted Petri\u2019s office on May 6, 2011, spokesman Niel Wright said the wording in the constituent survey question about Medicare was incorrect. He said the question should have stated that the president\u2019s commission \"discussed,\" rather than recommended, making Medicare a voucher program.\n\nAlso after our call, this note was added to the electronic version of the survey question on Petri\u2019s website:\n\n\"CORRECTION: The question above is somewhat misleading. Instead of saying that the recommendation was \u2018put forth\u2019 by the president's debt commission, the question should read that this recommendation was \u2018discussed\u2019 by the president's debt commission.\"\n\nWright told us that when Petri\u2019s office distributes results of the survey, a note will be included \"indicating that a problem with this question was brought to our attention,\" as would \"additional information clarifying how the question should have been phrased.\"\n\nWright also said the survey was reviewed by the Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards, also known as the Franking Commission, and that \"neither the Republican nor the Democratic staffers at the commission noticed anything objectionable\" or partisan. \u00a0\n\nTurning to the Truth-O-Meter, in surveying constituents, GOP Congressman Tom Petri said a commission created by the Democratic president had recommended making Medicare a voucher program. The commission did not make that recommendation and Petri admitted the wording in his survey was wrong. We rate his statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13122"}
