Fred Upton, for his voting record on health care.\n\"He voted a dozen times to kick thousands of Michigan families off their health insurance and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions,\" an ad from Hoadley states.\nThe basis of Hoadley\u2019s attack is Upton\u2019s consistent opposition to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which barred insurance companies from discriminating \u2014 in pricing and coverage \u2014 against people with preexisting medical conditions, such as cancer survivors and kids with diabetes as Hoadley\u2019s ad notes.\nThe ACA also introduced federal subsidies for Americans to buy coverage in the individual insurance market and for states to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income Americans.\nIn 2019, more than 500,000 Michiganders were covered under plans purchased in the individual market, according to an estimate from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. And today, a little more than 800,000 are covered under the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\nA repeal or overturning of the ACA, and the loss of its protections, would put that coverage at risk, experts say.\nIn the five years that followed the ACA\u2019s passage, Upton voted 12 times for bills, budget resolutions and amendments that called for repealing the law.\u00a0\nMore recently, Upton has spoken out against Republican efforts to repeal the ACA without a replacement. \"You simply cannot take what would be millions of people off coverage without a backup plan ready to go,\" he told The Detroit News in April 2019.\nThat month, he was one of only eight Republicans who supported a resolution urging the Trump administration to end its effort to overturn the ACA. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments next month on a case supported by the administration asking the court to invalidate the law.\nHoadley\u2019s claim includes recovered COVID-19 patients among those whose coverage would be at risk, but Upton\u2019s votes to repeal the ACA came years before the pandemic.\u00a0\nUpton spokesperson Josh Paciorek said, \"Fred believes we must forge a bipartisan path to ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable care while always protecting preexisting conditions.\"\nNonetheless, Hoadley\u2019s ad gives an accurate count of Upton\u2019s votes from 2011 to 2015 and their potential impact.\u00a0\nLooking at Upton\u2019s voting record\nThe Hoadley ad cites 12 times that Upton voted to repeal or defund the ACA. Here's how they break down:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpton voted three times to repeal the ACA without a replacement. Once in 2011, again in 2012 and a final time in 2013.\u00a0\nIn 2015, Upton voted for a bill to repeal the ACA that directed House lawmakers to propose an alternative.\nUpton supported budget resolutions in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 that assumed savings from repealing the ACA and allowed ACA funding to be redirected to pay for other federal spending\nUpton voted four times during budget negotiations in 2012 and 2015 directing lawmakers to repeal the ACA.\n\nHow repeal of the ACA would affect coverage\nUnder the ACA, millions of Americans buy their health insurance through the individual market or receive coverage through the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. If the law is repealed or struck down by the Supreme Court, many could face higher costs for health insurance, lose automatic coverage or become unable to afford coverage.\nA New York Times analysis says as many as 21 million people would be at risk of becoming uninsured.\nThey would also lose protection under ACA provisions that bar discrimination against people with preexisting medical conditions. President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders pledging to preserve these protections have no legal effect, experts say.\nAbout 54 million Americans had a preexisting condition in 2018 that would likely leave them uninsurable in the individual insurance market if the ACA were repealed, according to a 2019 analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. That includes 29% \u2014 just over 1.7 million \u2014 of Michiganders under 65.\u00a0\nWould Upton\u2019s votes have cost Michiganders their coverage?\nThe implementation of the ACA\u2019s major protections helped insure thousands of Michiganders in the individual market soon after Upton cast his first vote to repeal the law in 2011.\u00a0\nBy the time the preexisting condition protections kicked in in 2014, Upton had voted to repeal the ACA four times and supported three budget resolutions that assumed savings from the law\u2019s repeal.\u00a0\nKaren Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation said that votes cast before 2014 may not have led to immediate coverage losses. But she said Congress relies on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that measure the impact of legislation over the next 10 years.\u00a0\nIn 2014, nearly 550,000 Michiganders were insured by plans purchased in the individual market, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates, up 74,600 from the previous year. The number was 511,700 last year.\nIn mid-2014, Michigan\u2019s expanded Medicaid program covered roughly 58,000. Today, it covers more than\u00a0800,000.\u00a0\nAn analysis this year from the nonpartisan Center for American Progress estimates that repealing the ACA would result in 827,000 Michiganders losing their insurance.\nOur ruling\nA Hoadley ad states\u00a0that Upton \"voted a dozen times to kick thousands of Michigan families off their health insurance and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions,\" citing his votes to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act.\nFour of those votes were for legislation that would have repealed the law. The eight other votes cited by the campaign laid the groundwork for repealing the ACA, but would have required additional action from lawmakers.\nRepealing the ACA would have jeopardized health coverage for Michiganders covered under plans purchased in the individual market and the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18803"}
