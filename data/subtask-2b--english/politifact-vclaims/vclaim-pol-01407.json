Still, the story has been shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook, so we thought we\u2019d clear the air, just in case.\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nOn Oct. 17, 2018, Canada became the second country in the world to legalize recreational marijuana. The first was Uruguay.
