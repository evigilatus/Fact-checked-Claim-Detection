No documents are cited.\nThe claim about a child trafficking and a pedophile sex ring links to a New York Post story that makes no reference to either child trafficking or a sex ring.\nThe claim about the Clinton Foundation and members of Congress links to an internet message board where anonymous people have posted under the topic, \"Breaking: Its (sic) worse than classified emails. Political Pedophile Sex Ring exposed.\"\n\"Hillary, Bill, all of them knew/know and were active participants,\" says the poster, who has the nickname \"WartHog76.\" \"DC and the FBI, DOJ fear a complete loss of public support for the federal government. ... Both parties, all levels of government. Its (sic) about to come apart.\"\nSubsequent posts by other people range from speculation that the story is part of a Clinton strategy (\"Throw out some wild claims, have them proven false, and their real crimes will be dismissed as false\") to a link to another website claiming that Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are connected to a place called Sex Slave Island.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter pertain to the real-life story of financier Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire sentenced to 18 months in jail and ordered to register as a pedophile in 2008 after pleading guilty to a Florida felony charge of soliciting a minor. He had been accused of hiring underage girls for massages and sex at Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach mansion.\nClinton has repeatedly flown on his plane. Trump's phone numbers were found in Epstein's address book.\nThe Conservative Daily Post article doesn't mention Trump's connections to Epstein.\nWe contacted the FBI. Spokesman Andrew Ames said in an email, \"We have provided no comment, nor confirmed any investigation, beyond the existence of a letter from the Director to select members of Congress, which was then provided to the media by members of Congress.\"\nAnother commentator on the message board says, \"NYPD has verified it. It's not a false claim.\" An NYPD spokesman said he was unaware of anyone make such a statement.\nOur ruling\nThe Conservative Daily Post says, \"FBI confirms evidence of huge underground Clinton sex network.\"\nWe could find no evidence that such a network exists; there is definitely no evidence that the FBI has confirmed it. The blog post seems to be relying on an anonymous claim put up on an internet message board.\nHere at PolitiFact, we believe it's up to the entity making a claim to support it with real evidence, especially when a claim is as extraordinary as this one.\nFor now, the Post story fails to rise above rumor or hoax.
