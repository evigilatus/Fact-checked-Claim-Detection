Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., according to a meme circulating on social media.\nAccording to one version of the meme, Bachmann said, \"There are those who say a border wall won't work. They just don't have the vision Donald Trump does. The Chinese built a Great Wall 5,000 years ago. You don't see any illegal Mexicans in China.\"\nIt\u2019s a tidy confluence of past and present presidential campaigns, as Trump\u2019s lead in the Republican field is often compared to Bachmann\u2019s early success in the 2012 presidential election.\nSeveral readers asked us to look into whether Bachmann actually made the comments. We obliged and found no evidence backing the claim. We also reached out to Bachmann\u2019s spokesperson, who said the former member of Congress never made the remarks.\nThe first thing that had us raising our eyebrows was some of the text that accompanied the meme when it was posted on Facebook.\n\"What do you think about a Trump/Bachmann ticket in the 2016 Presidential race?\" it said. \"Former Rep. Michelle Bachman (sic) told Fox News' Jenna Jameson she \u2018admired Donald's leadership and vision\u2019 and also complimented Trump on his reality show success, \u2018If Donald can do for this country what he did for Arsenio Hall America will be great again.\u2019 \"\nJameson is a former porn star, not a Fox News host, nor is she employed by the network in any way, said a Fox spokesperson. (Jameson did make a rocky appearance on a Fox entertainment program in 2013.)\u00a0\nWe also searched three comprehensive databases -- Nexis and CQ, which aggregate transcripts, and Critical Mention, which records video and closed captioning -- and found no record of Bachmann ever making those comments.\nTo our knowledge, she hasn\u2019t appeared on Fox News since Trump announced his candidacy. She has commented on and praised Trump in several interviews on different networks, though she has never mentioned his wall proposal. Here\u2019s a rundown of her Trump-related remarks:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Aug. 6 on MSNBC\u2019s Hardball: When asked if Trump will make for a good candidate, Bachmann said, \"Well, that's what he\u2019ll \u00a0have to prove on the stage\" at the first GOP debate. \u00a0\n\u2022 Aug 8 on CNN Tonight: \"He\u2019s like the Rocky Balboa of politics. He\u2019s a winner. He\u2019s been winning all through his life.\"\n\u2022 Aug. 10 in an interview with conservative radio host Tony Perkins: \"When he talks about the effects of illegal immigration on the United States, that resonates with the American people.\" \u00a0\n\u2022 Aug. 17 on CBS News: \"He\u2019s getting it right. \u2026 Donald Trump has the secret decoder ring of what\u2019s on voters\u2019 minds. I think I had that too when it came to the repeal of Obamacare. Donald Trump understands people are not happy with massive immigration from third-world countries.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBefore Trump, Bachmann championed the idea of a border fence for years, but we couldn\u2019t find an instance when she\u2019s evoked the Great Wall of China.\u00a0ButTrump has.\n\"Well, 3,000 years ago, the Great Wall of China was built. We would like to have that wall. That wall, nobody gets through. That I can tell you. And that's 13,000 miles. right?\" he said at a town hall in New Hampshire on Aug. 18. \"I want it to be so beautiful because maybe someday they're going to call it the Trump Wall.\"\nBachmann\u2019s spokeswoman told us that Bachmann agrees with Trump\u2019s views on immigration, adding, \"Trump's emphasis on stopping the current tidal wave of immigration is in sync with a plurality of voters, as polls demonstrate a great majority of Americans believe.\"\nOur ruling\nA meme says that Bachmann said, \"The Chinese built a Great Wall 5,000 years ago. You don't see any illegal Mexicans in China.\"\nWe found no evidence that Bachmann ever said this, and her spokeswoman said she did not, in fact, say it. The meme seems to have satirical origins but is now being passed off as fact.\u00a0We rate the statement Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06057"}
