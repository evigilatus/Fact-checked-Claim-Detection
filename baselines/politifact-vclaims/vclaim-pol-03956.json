But the agency announced in September that premiums for individual health insurance plans sold in Florida in 2017 would go up an average of 19.1 percent.\nThat is for any individual plan that meets the ACA\u2019s minimum coverage requirements, whether it\u2019s sold on the federal exchange\u2019s HealthCare.gov or not.\nThe premium changes depend on the company: For plans sold on the exchange, Health First\u2019s increase is the lowest at 11.7 percent. Humana\u2019s premiums are going up at the highest rate, 36.8 percent.\nChanges for compliant plans sold off the exchange range from a high of 27.3 percent for AvMed, to a decrease of 1.5 percent for premiums with Cigna.\nThe nationwide average for premium increases is about 25 percent, according to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing Trump didn\u2019t mention is that customers who buy plans off the exchange won\u2019t necessarily be paying the full price of those increases.\nAbout 1.53 million Floridians bought their coverage off the federal exchange in 2016. Out of those, 1.42 million -- 93 percent -- were subsidized in part by the federal government to make the plans more affordable. The average premium tax credit in Florida was $305.\nAbout 1 percent of customers who buy a plan off the exchange earn too much income and do not qualify for any subsidies. They will have to pay the full increase.\nAlso, people have the option to choose a different, cheaper plan.\nFor 2017, Health and Human Services has estimated that 86 percent of Floridians who buy a plan off HealthCare.gov will be able to find a plan for $100 a month or less. Amid double-digit increases last year, average premiums after subsidies went from $82 to $84, the agency said.\nAgain, Trump is talking only about people who buy insurance on the exchanges. People who get insurance through work wouldn\u2019t necessarily see the same increase. Small group plans, for example, will see an average premium increase of 9.5 percent, for example.\nIn Jacksonville, Trump also said that \"over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year.\" For 2017, every Florida county still has at least one Obamacare option on the exchange.\u00a0Last year, Florida Blue and UnitedHealthcare were the only two insurance companies to offer policies in all 67 counties. UnitedHealthcare announced earlier this year it would leave the exchange in Florida and dozens of other states.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive, double-digit premium hike.\"\nThe state announced in September that ACA-compliant plans would see an average premium hike of 19.1 percent. That\u2019s lower than the national average of 25 percent, but is still a sizable increase. Most people who buy those policies qualify for federal subsidies, however, so they likely won\u2019t see an increase as high as Trump is implying. And the vast majority of Floridians get their insurance through their job, where increases aren\u2019t going to be as high.\nThose are important points he didn\u2019t mention, so we rate his statement Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc6699ef-5777-4860-a17e-dcf06d0032a5", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03956"}
