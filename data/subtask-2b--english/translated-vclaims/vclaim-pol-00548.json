Was Aurourke right when he said that it was time for Congress to initiate isolation proceedings for more than a year? No, not really. The Senate campaign saw a different language: Chris Evans, a spokesman for Orrick, said that democracy was \"consisting in saying that he would vote for isolation in the House of Representatives.\" Evans said that O'Rourke made comments about his isolation during his campaign to separate Mr. Ted Cruz from the United States last year. He also noted that Cruz's campaign \"alterably mentioned\" Aurourke's stand on isolation during the race. In an e-mail, Evans said: \"He wants to vote to isolate the President and says he believes that there is sufficient reason, sufficient justification, for Congress to take action.\" \"If he didn't believe that Congress should run these proceedings, he wouldn't have said over and over again that he would vote to do so.\" While Aur\u00fcrk, a former congressman from El Paso State, said that he personally supported the isolation of Trump for more than a year, such statements often came with warnings. No direct call for isolation was issued until last month. It was inconsistent in its general comments on whether Congress had \"time\" to act in isolation and voted twice against the opening of impeachment as a member of the Council - first in 2017 and again in early 2018. In his e-mail, Evans pointed out that \"you're not looking at whether he's \"calling\" for isolation, but whether - as he said in MSNBC - he feels it's time for Congress to act. He has said for more than a year that he has seen enough to vote for him, and considering that he is a member of the Commission, Evans participated in eight news articles when he was asked to provide evidence to substantiate Aurourke &apos; s claim. They all contain references showing his personal support for the accusation, but none of them show that Democrats explicitly state that \"it's time\" for Congress to act. Among these stories, it was close to saying that the time had come for Congress to work in an interview with the Dallas Morning News in July 2018, which quoted O'Rourke as saying that \"execution, like an accusation, shows that there is enough for the case to proceed, and at this stage, there is certainly enough for the case to proceed.\" It should also be noted that Aur\u00fcrk tends to distinguish between isolation in the Chamber of Deputies and conviction in the Senate. The Constitution allows the Council to dismiss a President by a simple majority. As soon as the case reaches the Senate, the senators shall hold a trial and may condemn and remove the President from office by two thirds of the votes. Early responses focused on Republican colleagues Aurourke on the topic of isolation early in August 2017, when his ideas were asked during a public event organized by Texas Tribune. He also discussed it in an interview with the Dallas Morning News in October 2017, stressing that while he personally supported isolation, Congress should not act until the members of the parties were able to support this effort. \"The only way that should happen is that the facts are so convincing that a Republican colleague from my country can return to her or his area and explain to their voters how they were able to vote to isolate their party leader,\" said Orrick, \"This is a set of conditions that do not exist today.\" While his campaign in the Senate was escalating, Aurourk appeared on KFYO radio in Lubok in April 2018 and discussed isolation with the host Chad Hasty, who asked if democracy had \"seen enough to where it would vote to isolate the President.\" \"The answer is yes,\" said O'Rourke. Because I want to be honest with you. I've seen an attempt, no matter how ham, to conspire with a foreign government in our national elections. I've seen an attempt to obstruct justice in the investigation of what happened in the 2016 elections.\" Having raised concerns as to whether Trump could be President and stressed the need for Mueller to complete his investigations, Aurourke said: \"Because here, there is no point in accusing him at this time.\" He said that it would not make sense until Republican legislators felt comfortable enough to come before their constituents and explain to them how they voted to dismiss their party leader. He said, \"We're not there yet.\" On January 13, 2021, Jake Taber, in his remarks on CNN Radio, stated that Donald Trump's second presidential charge was \"most isolated between the two parties in American history.\" According to Louis Jacobson, on January 13, 2021, Aurourc voted against the impeachment proceedings. I voted against him both times. In December 2017, Aur\u00fcrk voted against an indictment by the Republic of Greene, De-Hoston. The Council introduced the resolution by a vote of 364-58. She voted against another indictment from Greene in January 2018, which was rejected by the House of Representatives 355-66. In July 2018 (while we verified the truth of Cruz &apos; s claim about the Orourc position) in an article entitled: How Pieto Orroc became a yes and don &apos; t charge Donald Trump now. The article decided that O'Rourke made numerous statements about isolation, which summarizes this: \"He personally voted as a member of the House of Representatives to accuse Trump, as U'Rourke says, but does not support it at this time.\" :: Evans Bolivi Fakt told him at the time that Aurourk did not call for the isolation of Trump and that he did not raise the subject \"in municipal halls or assemblies, did not e-mail fund-raising or petitions, did not publish the social media that advocated it, and did not use his current position of public confidence to do so through speeches, letters or resolutions. In his comments to Lubok Avalanche-Jornal at the end of July 2018, this sentiment was echoed by Aur\u00fcrk, which was published entirely in the bottom of the Polyte Fact article. Aurourke stressed the need to give M\u00f8ller an opportunity to complete his investigations \"and allow him to find the facts wherever he leads, at the highest level.\" On the issue of isolation, I have never asked, and you have seen us, I have never led a municipal hall with her. \"I am not on the decision to isolate the President.\" This remained the case until the end of his Senate election campaign and the beginning of his presidential campaign in 2019. In March, when the Dallas Morning News in Iowa asked him whether he still preferred isolation, as he had done in the past, he pushed Orrick backwards. The interaction in the Atlantic has also been documented. \"You asked me once if you voted, and you said yes,\" said Aurourke. \"I wasn't there to call it that. I just think that discrimination is important in this case.\" He also noted that the 2020 elections were likely to determine what was happening to Tramp more than the impeachment procedure in Congress. \"Leave it to Congress, where power lies in our Constitution, to decide on the basis of the facts now available or those provided by the Muller report,\" said Orrick. \"Where I think, however, this will eventually be decided in the November 2020 elections.\" But by May, O'Rourke said that he openly supported the isolation of Trump in an interview with the Dallas Morning News. He said, \"We've finally learned the truth about this president.\" \"Yeah, there must be consequences. Yes, there must be accountability. Yeah, I think there's enough evidence now for the House of Representatives to move forward with isolation.\" \"For more than a year, I was saying that it was time for Congress to act and begin isolation proceedings.\" It is true that O'Rourke has said for more than a year that he personally supports the isolation of Trump, but he has consistently said that this fact does not mean that he calls for Congress to take action. As a member of the Council, he voted twice against the resolutions of isolation that came to the Chamber after first saying that he supported isolation. It is difficult to suggest that O'Rourke can at the same time say that he does not call for isolation while still suggesting that \"it's time\" for Congress to act. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong. In fact, this statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.
