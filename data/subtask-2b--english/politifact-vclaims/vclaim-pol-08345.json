Chris Christie and an old story about President George W. Bush to draw a distinction between the two cable networks.\n\"I don't have a job so all I do is watch TV,\" Coulter said. \"If you watch no station but MSNBC, you have no idea what they're talking about on Fox. On Fox, I promise you, they're reporting the Chris Christie scandal -- maybe not 24 hours a day like the 9/11 attack.\"\nCoulter then pivoted to talking about the run-up to the 2000 presidential election and how reporters found out that Bush had a drunk driving arrest on his record.\n\"That story hurt George Bush in the 2000 presidential election,\" Coulter said. \"Who broke it? Fox News.\"\nIs Coulter rewriting history or does she have her facts right? We thought we\u2019d check.\nBad news at a critical moment\nHeaded into the final week before Election Day, Nov. 7, 2000, polls showed a razor-close contest between Bush and Democratic nominee Vice President Al Gore. With the disputed results in Florida, we know now how accurate those polls were.\nJust five days before the election, the country learned that in 1976 police in Maine had arrested Bush for drunk driving. His past troubles with drinking were already on the record but until Nov. 2, an arrest was not part of the narrative.\nThe first news organization that ran the story was Fox News. It carried an item at 6 p.m. that day. Once Fox News ran it, the Associated Press spread the story to all the broadcasters and newspapers that subscribe to its service. To Coulter\u2019s point, the broader public first learned about Bush\u2019s arrest through Fox News.\nUncovering a story vs. reporting it\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the news business, breaking a story has a particular meaning. A reporter breaks a story by being the one who found it first. In the competitive world of journalism, these morsels are precious and newsrooms generally hold their cards close to the chest until they are ready to spring their scoop on the world.\nThe release of the Bush arrest followed a different path. Fox News took this story from a local affiliate.\nErin Fehlau, a reporter with the Portland Fox affiliate WPXT, first got wind of the arrest on the afternoon of Nov. 2. While working on another assignment, a police officer mentioned overhearing a conversation about Bush and drunk driving. Fehlau quickly found the case number and began following the paper trail.\nBack at the station, Fehlau\u2019s news director, who was relatively new, didn\u2019t know if this was old news. Later that afternoon, he called Fox News in New York City to find out. Fox News contacted the Bush campaign where a staffer confirmed that Bush had been arrested.\nAssistant news director Matt Ledin remembers what happened next.\n\"I was sitting in my office and I saw Fox reporting our story.\" Ledin told PunditFact. \"I think they credited us, but I was surprised.\"\nThat was at 6 p.m. At 7 p.m., WPXT had the story in its newscast. At 10 p.m., Fehlau broadcast her report with all the details.\nFox News had no hand in doing the digging that brought this story to light. WPXT was an independent news operation in 2000, owned by Pegasus Communications, a Pennsylvania corporation that paid for the rights to run Fox programs.\nFehlau was generally credited with breaking the story. Fehlau won the National Clarion Award for her work while the station won the regional Edward R. Murrow Award for investigative journalism.\n\"CBS, ABC and NBC, all had satellite trucks out in front of our station the next morning,\" Ledin said. \"Fehlau was on all the network shows.\"\nOur ruling\nCoulter said Fox News broke the story of George W. Bush\u2019s 1976 drunk driving arrest. In terms of being the first to broadcast the story, that is correct.\nOn the other hand, breaking a story has the strong meaning of having made the effort to uncover something that was obscure. In that sense, a local news station that happened to be a Fox affiliate gets the credit. While Fehlau's station was contracted to run Fox programming, it is independetly owned and not part of Fox News, the cable news channel.\nWe rate Coulter\u2019s statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08345"}
