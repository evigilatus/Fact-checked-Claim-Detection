Here\u2019s video of them departing on Air Force One that night.\n\nPer White House pool reports, Obama played rounds of golf on Dec. 17, 19, 21 and 23. The First Family has also spent time at the beach, walked a nature trail at a botanical garden, played escape the room and dined at a popular Japanese restaurant \u2014 all in Hawaii. On Christmas Day, the President and First Lady visited troops at a marine base, again in Hawaii.\nSeveral of the other claims made in the article are entirely fabricated. The Obamas never took Air Force One to Chicago for White Castle burgers. There is no Air Force Osprey specifically to transport the First Dog. (Here\u2019s an article describing Bo walking up and down the aisle of Air Force One.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article\u2019s assertion that Air Force One is not obligated to fly anywhere \"unless it was on official business\" lacks critical context. Vacation trips fall under the official travel category as the president and vice president are assumed to be always on duty, according to the Congressional Research Service.\nThe article also includes a picture of the First Family\u2019s dog, Bo, departing a marine helicopter. As our friends at Snopes point out, the image was taken in 2013 during the Obamas\u2019 vacation on the Martha\u2019s Vineyard.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter the photo, the article then concludes with a wink:\n\"It\u2019s a fairly well-known fact that after about 150 words and a picture that may or may not be related, most conservative readers will stop reading and go comment that the Muslim should be executed for playing golf. Therefore, less than 20% of those who clicked this article will have made it this far.\"\nWhile BuzzFeedUSA.com\u2019s article fetched no comments, many who read the same article posted on a different fake news site seem to have missed this disclaimer and praised the dissident pilot.\nIf this kicker isn\u2019t enough to convince you that the article is fake, or if you only read the headline, we\u2019ll state it more emphatically: It\u2019s Pants on Fire!\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3641530f-d560-42b8-be6f-23070da52b09", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03831"}
