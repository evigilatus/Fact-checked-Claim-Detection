Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo are earning close to $180,000 annually in their roles as chief executive, but most of the highest-ranking officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are doing even better.\n\nAs the Port Authority\u2019s finances come under greater scrutiny, New Jersey Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex) pointed out in a recent radio interview how many of the top agency officials are earning larger salaries than the two governors charged with overseeing their operations.\n\n\"Clearly, the Port Authority is needed, because to coordinate bi-state transportation, you can\u2019t be continually going back and forth between two cities and two states and multiple jurisdictions,\" Wisniewski told host John Gambling on WOR-AM. \"But the Port Authority\u2019s grown beyond its original mission. It\u2019s now a real estate empire in addition to everything else.\"\n\nWisniewski, also chairman of the state Democratic Party, went on: \"It\u2019s become so large. Many of the top officials at the Port Authority earn more money than the governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them.\"\n\nCould many top agency officials really be taking home more money than Christie and Cuomo?\n\nThat\u2019s right, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Based on the latest data released by the Port Authority, 11 of the 12 highest-ranking agency officials earn larger annual salaries than Christie and Cuomo.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the governors\u2019 paychecks.\n\nChristie is earning an annual salary of $175,000, according to Bill Quinn, spokesman for the state Department of the Treasury.\n\nIn New York, Cuomo receives slightly more, earning $179,000 per year, said Morris Peters, spokesman for the New York State Division of the Budget. But Cuomo reimbursed the state for five percent of his 2011 salary, Peters said.\n\nNow, let\u2019s turn to the Port Authority officials.\n\nIn December, the transportation agency posted information on its website about annual salaries and other earnings for all of its more than 6,000 employees. To evaluate Wisniewski\u2019s claim, we looked at annual salaries for the top 12 positions listed on the agency\u2019s organization chart.\n\nHere\u2019s how the salaries for those positions break down, as of Nov. 30:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\nPerson\n\nAnnual Salary\n\n\n\nExecutive Director\n\nPatrick Foye\n\n$289,667\n\n\n\nDeputy Executive Director\n\nBill Baroni\n\n$289,667\n\n\n\nGeneral Counsel\n\nDarrell Buchbinder\n\n$276,926\n\n\n\nChief Administrative Officer\n\nLouis LaCapra\n\n$251,758\n\n\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nErnesto Butcher\n\n$251,758\n\n\n\nChief of Capital Planning\n\nDavid Tweedy\n\n$251,758\n\n\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nMichael Fabiano\n\n$240,032\n\n\n\nChief of Real Estate & Development\n\nMichael Francois\n\n$236,340\n\n\n\nChief Engineer\n\nPeter Zipf\n\n$219,050\n\n\n\nInspector General\n\nRobert Van Etten\n\n$208,468\n\n\n\nSecretary\n\nKaren Eastman\n\n$198,328\n\n\n\nChief of Public & Government Affairs\n\nJamie Loftus\n\n$165,022\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, of the 12 \"top officials\" at the Port Authority, 11 of them were getting larger paychecks than Christie and Cuomo.\n\nThose figures back up Wisniewski\u2019s statement, but it\u2019s worth noting that even Port Authority workers at lower points in the pecking order earned more in salary and additional pay last year than the two governors' annual salaries.\n\nFor example, 65 police officers earned more than $200,000 in salary and additional pay, according to a Star-Ledger analysis.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a radio interview, Wisniewski claimed, \"Many of the top officials at the Port Authority earn more money than the governors of the states that have jurisdiction over them.\"\n\nThe assemblyman\u2019s comments are on the money, according to data released by the Port Authority in December. Christie and Cuomo earn $175,000 and $179,000, respectively, earning less than 11 of the 12 highest-ranked Port Authority officials.\n\nWe rate the statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank Lautenberg\n\n\nstated on June 15, 2011 in an interview on ABC's \"Top Line\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since 2004, there have been some 1,300 attacks (on rail targets).
