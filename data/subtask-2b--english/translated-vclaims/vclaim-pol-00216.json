Trump is planning to hold a rally in Fayetteville on September 9th a day before the 9th special election, which is the race that is pissing off Republicans NCC Dan Bishop against Democratic Dan McCreedy. But voters don't have to wait for Trump to take the stage to hear his ideas about McCreedy. Trump was recently taken to Twitter for weight. I look forward to being with Dan Bishop in two weeks in North Carolina. His opponent believes in open borders and holy cities, and will not protect your second amendment!\" Trump garroted on August 27. Is it fair for Trump to say that McCreedy supported \"open borders and cities of refuge\"? We didn't find any evidence of McCready using those specific words, so we contacted the Trump campaign. Samantha Cotton, a regional contact manager for the campaign, sent a document in which McCreedy &apos; s comments on migration were included. Cotton refers to three cases in which she said that she supported Tramp's claim: McCreedy supported the Dream Act; he was a \"driller\" when asked how he dealt with undocumented immigrants in the United States; and he was opposed to the State Bill, which required the Chiefs of Police to comply with the federal immigration authorities. While McCready opposed a bill that would suppress asylum policies, this does not mean that it supports the cities of refuge. The Tramp claim on open borders is unfounded. We'll explain it to you. The Act on the Development, Relief and Education of Foreign Minors, known as the DREAM Act, was first introduced in 2001. The aim was to help immigrants who came to the United States as children. A similar bill was submitted by Seans. In 2017, Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Dorbin D-IL, would have given citizenship to legally bound immigrants who meet specific criteria, such as access to certain levels of educational attainment, military service and employment. This bill applies mostly to children who have been brought to the United States and are already here, so it is not accurate to describe it as an \"open border\" policy. Now it's what McCreedy claims to be \"distinguishing.\" Cotton provided a link to an editorial column of the Charlotte Control Authority as of October 2018 in support of its claim. The observer wrote that McCready was \"direct questions\" about how he dealt with immigrants currently in the United States illegally. But in that column, I quote McCreedy saying that immigration reform \"starts securing borders.\" In fact, he has repeatedly said that he wants to secure the border. His comments on the Forum and, in a recent discussion by the Council, echo the position set out on its website. When asked how he dealt with migrant families at the border, McCready said: \"We urgently need safe borders. If some Democrats say we don't need safe borders, it's crazy. Now, I don't think we need 3,000 miles of wall to do that. I think we could use the kind of surveillance technology I used in Iraq,\" he said, referring to his experience as a refugee. The McCready plans for undocumented migrants living in America may be vague. But that doesn't mean he prefers open borders. Here, Trump has a little more case. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" There is no single definition of what constitutes a \"protected city,\" but the term is broadly applied to cities or states that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. For example, California law prohibits law enforcement agencies from using funds or local officials to investigate or arrest individuals for immigration purposes. In North Carolina, municipalities cannot prevent their law enforcement agencies from cooperating with United States immigration and customs enforcement authorities. But the sheriffs can independently decide whether they want to comply with IND. A recent bill, HB 370, could have changed that by asking North Carolina Police Chiefs to honour ICE detainees, but Goof's democracy. (Roy Cooper) Rejection of the bill. If the law were to become law, the Chiefs of Police would have to detain prisoners for up to 48 hours after their prison sentence if requested to do so by the Immigration and Naturalization Authority. As previously reported by the PolicFact NC, CIA detainees are not on valid orders. In his 23 August interview with WBT-FM, McCready said he believed that Cooper's veto was \"the right decision.\" But that doesn't mean that McCready supports holy cities, as his spokesman said, Matt Fred. \"No, Dan doesn't support a \"protected city.\" Violent criminals belong to the prison in every city, and Fred told Poletti his fruit in an e-mail. An analyst at the Centre for Migration Studies is not convinced of the McCready interpretation. Jessica Vaughn, Director of Policy Studies of the Commonwealth of Independent States, who prefers low-level migration, says she thinks Trump's tweet is fair. \"The only reason to oppose the bill is to facilitate asylum policies,\" said Vaughn, \"if someone says they want the Chiefs of Police to have a choice to obstruct ICE, Other experts believe that Trump's accusations are negligible. One of these is Peter H. Shawk, an honorary professor of law at Yale University and a resident researcher at New York University. In an editorial article for The Los Angeles Times 2 July, Democrats warned against embracing open borders. The McCready position \"does not imply that he prefers \"open borders,\" although he will be open to the accusation that his preferred policies will not \"do enough\" to secure the border,\" said Shouk to Poletti Fuckett in an e-mail. He said: \"As in the case of holy cities, the lack of cooperation with INS detainees is certainly what \"protected cities\" do, but whether that is sufficient to qualify as a city of refuge depends on how one defines the term.\" We asked Larry Sabato, founder and director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, whether he thought Trump's tweet was fair. \"The Democrats will say it isn't and the Republicans will say it is. This is where we are in the post-fact era,\" said Sabatu in a telephone interview. \"Personally, I think it's extended by the White House. But it is not completely fabricated, which is an achievement due to the Trump tweet.\" In fact, the terms - \"open borders\" and \"safe city\" - are \"not so insensitive as to mean everything someone wants to mean,\" as Jessica Polter said, an associate policy analyst of the Institute for Migration Policy. But she does not believe that McCready supports open borders, a term that has no consequences for people who enter the country illegally. \"When someone says that he is interested in border security and refers to the technology he used in Iraq, it is clear that this is not someone who believes that there should be no consequences,\" said Polter in a telephone interview. She does not believe that HB 370 support for the disputed North Carolina Law on IC detainees is the same as that of the cities of refuge. \"The absence of a policy to honour detainees does not mean that the wardens are told that they cannot honour the detainees.\" The sheriff still has the ability to honour detainees, while policies in some cities or other states say they cannot. Trump said that McCready \"believed in open borders and cities of refuge.\" There is no evidence that McCready supports open borders. While McCready objected to a bill requiring the Chiefs of Police to comply with the immigration and naturalization regime, he did not say that he believed that the Chiefs of Police should be prevented from working with the Immigration and Naturalization Authority. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.
