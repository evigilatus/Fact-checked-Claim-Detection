Kansas City and St. Louis officials threw their hats into the ring, and state officials proposed an innovation corridor along I-70, which would link the two metro areas.\n\n\nMissouri\u2019s brochure\u00a0released on the\u00a0MakeMOHQ2Home website\u00a0claims the state ranked third in \"average yearly growth of high-tech industries.\"\n\n\nWhen you think of a \"high-tech\" state, California and New York may be the first states to come to mind, but not Missouri. We wanted to find out how high-tech Missouri really is, and how it ranks in the country.\n\n\nWe spoke with the researchers behind the data and economic experts who all agreed that rate of growth can be misleading.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s a high-tech industry?\n\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that defining high-tech is a moving target. Generally, though, it considers jobs with lots of workers in science, technology, engineering and math fields to be part of the high-tech industry.\n\n\nMissouri officials used a\u00a02016 Milken Institute study\u00a0in their claim.\u00a0The Milken Institute\u00a0is a nonprofit and nonpartisan think tank.\n\n\nThe Milken Institute has a \"free-market slant,\" said Michael Leeds, chair of the economics department at Temple University, \"but (is) a credible group of scholars.\"\n\n\nMinoli Ratnatunga, director of regional economics research at the institute\u2019s Center for Regional Economics, was a researcher in the study. Ratnatunga said the group considered 19 industries it thought were high-tech.\n\n\nA few of these industries include: pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing, commercial and service industry machinery manufacturing, medical equipment and supplies manufacturing, telecommunications and computer systems design.\n\n\nMissouri\u2019s ranking\n\n\nThe Milken Institute\u2019s\u00a02016 State Technology and Science Indexshows that Missouri ranked third in average yearly growth of high-tech industries from 2010 to 2015.\n\n\nHowever, this is just one component that makes up Missouri\u2019s overall placement.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Missouri ranked 28 out of 50. Two years prior, Missouri ranked 34 out of 50. In 2012, Missouri ranked 29 out of 50. These scores are based on several factors: human capital investment, research and development, risk capital, technology and science workforce, and technology concentration.\n\n\nMassachusetts, Colorado and Maryland were ranked the top three states overall in 2016. Kansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma ranked behind Missouri, with West Virginia rated last.\n\n\n\"That tells us where Missouri ranks relative to its peers,\" Ratnatunga said. \"It\u2019s improving, and things like (high-tech) growth is one aspect that\u2019s impacted its overall ranking, but it\u2019s not in the top tier.\"\n\n\nRatnatunga said it\u2019s easy for Missouri\u2019s high-tech industry to look as if it\u2019s grown exponentially.\n\n\n\"If you have a relatively small sector, it\u2019s easier to get a higher growth rate,\" Ratnatunga said. \"The same 500 jobs added in California would be a smaller growth rate.\"\n\n\nLeeds also said the rate of growth can be deceiving.\n\n\n\"If you have a very small base, twice a very small number is 100 percent growth, but it can be a very small number,\" he said.\n\n\nRatnatunga said companies like Amazon need to look at the index overall when considering a state\u2019s economy. This means recognizing qualities like overall growth in the economy, the quality of the workforce, universities, capital investments and research and development inputs.\n\n\n\"If it doesn\u2019t meet Amazon\u2019s requirements, it might be a great choice for other companies that are looking to grow in high-tech,\" Ratnatunga said.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nMissouri officials claimed Missouri ranked \"3rd (in) average yearly growth of high-tech industries.\"\n\n\nWhile Missouri high-tech industries may have seen growth, the size of base matters. Missouri has seen a growth in high-tech jobs, but the claim can be misleading when you don\u2019t consider the size of the base. Overall, Missouri is about average in the rankings.\n\n\nWe rate this\u00a0Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02651"}
