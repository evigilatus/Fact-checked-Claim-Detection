The 56-year-old child was described in the news reports as a registered Republican. But bloggers are promoting a novel that suggests that the liberals behind the pipe bomb plot argue that until recently, Sayok belonged to the Democratic Party. \"A newly registered democracy as a Republican, covered his truck with Trump posters and started sending unexploded bombs to Democrats,\" reads an article that appeared on Facebook on 26 October. \"And you have to ask why the Americans find that suspicious?\" This story was highlighted as part of Facebook &apos; s efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Florida, Sayuk registered with the Republican Party in Florida on 4 March 2016, less than two weeks before Trump won the Republican presidential election in Florida. However, the records from the Miami-Dade Elections Department show that on two occasions in October 2012 - 9 October and 26 October - Sayuk started new voter registration applications but did not complete them. Both times, check the box adjacent to the Republican Party as its affiliation to the Party. On October 9, 2012, he checked the box that he said had a \"new registration,\" but apparently left blank the answer to the question whether he was ever \"sentenced to a mental disability in voting.\" On 26 October 2012, none of the funds indicating the reason for his application for registration (i.e., none of the funds were examined) were verified. New registration, change of address, change of name, change of party, etc.) Someone sabotaged Incombe, indicating that he was incomplete. As submitted to Polyte Fact in response to the request for public records, copies of each of the 2012 Sayuk applications appear in the section requesting a driver &apos; s licence from Florida, an identity number or the last four figures of the applicant &apos; s social security number. The Florida Elections Act provides that if none of this information is included in the voter registration application, registration is considered incomplete. Facebook, mentioned on January 11, 2021 in an article in Facebook Nancy Belusi, no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021, Seok &apos; s request to vote was not completed until March 4, 2016, according to the section, when he provided his full information, he updated his mailing address, and again reported that his party affiliation was republican. Also in the 2016 form, the box next to the \"new registration\" is checked as the reason for the request. The box next to \"change party\" is empty. Although Sayuk successfully registered to vote before Trump won the presidential election on March 15, his application appears to be too late to be eligible to vote in those elections. In Florida, the registration deadline for the upcoming elections is 29 days before the elections. However, the record of Sayuk &apos; s vote appears to indicate that he was then driven out of the vote: he went to vote three times earlier - in the 2016 primary elections, the 2016 general elections, and the August 2018 initial elections. Friends and other people who know Sayok said that there was no interest in politics until Trump appeared on the political scene, and the Washington Post published a report on October 27. He started sharing pictures of himself on Facebook campaign events. Ronald Lowe, the lawyer who represented Sayuk in a fraud case, told the newspaper Sayok \"He has no interest in politics... \"I've registered as a Republican actor to vote in Florida -- Louie said he thought it was the first time in Syook's life -- in 2016, telling the story. Our Facebook article of 26 October states that \"a newly registered democracy as a Republican, covered his truck with Trump posters and began sending unexploded bombs to Democrats. And you have to ask why the Americans find that suspicious. We didn't find evidence that Syook was a lifetime democracy. While it is true that State records show that Sayuk registered to vote relatively recently, in 2016, a request from 2012 shows that Sayok then considered himself a member of the Republican Party.
