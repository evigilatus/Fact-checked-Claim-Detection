In a letter dated 15 October 2014 to David Feldman, Houston City Prosecutor, Abbott, in his capacity as Attorney-General of the State, said that the Feldman office \"requested many Houston priests to hand over their own papers to the city government, including their speeches.\" Abbott, who posted his message on his office website, was talking to the city's legal defense efforts against a lawsuit filed by local voters seeking to repeal the city's law. :: The Houston City Council, led by Mayor Anis Parker, approved the Houston Gender Equality Act in 2014 at a step that his supporters described as protecting the rights of transgender persons by allowing Houston citizens to use bathrooms in businesses and public facilities of their own kind. The sermons were said to have been asked to submit a proposal for cancellation before the voters succeeded in November 2014. On August 4, 2014, according to Houston Cronkel News, Parker and Feldman announced that more than half of 50,000 signatures on a petition to cancel Hiro's ballot were invalid. According to the Fact Sheet, Houston lawyers delivered more than 2,000 pages with approximately 11,300 signatures because the people who collected the signatures were either not voters registered in Houston or did not sign the petition themselves. In response the following day, many residents filed a lawsuit accusing the city of invalidating an unlawful petition for annulment. The city issued summonses, as allowed by the Texas Act, as part of its defence in the lawsuit, in which it stated that it would argue against the validity of many signatures on the petition for annulment. Feldman told the Fact Sheet that the city included its request for preachers in the subpoenas because the priests who led the petition had issued instructions to collect signatures during church service. We've looked for details from the city -- does the Houston government suspect that there are preachers convincing the collectors of false signatures? - No success. The city also did not respond to our inquiries regarding the summonses mentioned, copies of which were received from the Abbott State Office. In an interview with John Kerry on 31 January 2021, Hurricane Harvey said that \"water fell in Houston in five days more than Niagara Falls in one year.\" By Brandon Mulder, 5 February 2021 to our investigation, the spokesman for the state of Abbott, Jerry Strickland, sent copies of five e-mail subpoenas, issued on 10 September 2014 by city attorney Christine Schlemmer, addressed to the priests of Houston Steve Rigel, Hernan Casta\u00f1o, Khan Huenh, Dave Welch, and church leader Magda Hermida. Each summons contains 17 categories of documents and communications that church leaders were told to submit by 10 October 2014, including: \"All speeches, presentations or speeches concerning heroin, petition, Mayor Anis Parker, homosexuality or gender identity prepared, delivered, revised, approved or in your possession.\" \"All contacts with members of your community concerning Hiro or the petition.\" According to the summons, documents and communications include writing, notes, notes, electronic recordings, videos, e-mails, instant messages, text messages, e-mails or \"related \"e-stocked material.\" Meanwhile, two days after Abbott wrote his letter, the city revised the subpoenas to delete the sermons. Parker said that the opponents deliberately misinterpreted the original language of the summonses, which sought to make a speech about the signature collection process; then again she confirmed that the changes did not prevent the speeches from being published, according to a news story in a fact sheet. Our verdict on Greg Abbott said that the city attorney \"requested that many of my priests Houston hand over to the city government many of their own papers, including their speeches.\" Five summonses submitted by the city of Houston required priests to make personal speeches and contacts with members of their group.
