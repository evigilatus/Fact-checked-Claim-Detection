Andrew Como signed the abortion legislation, which his plaintiffs say he's writing Roe against Wade in state law. The Law on Reproductive Health, sponsored by the Democratic State Sin Liz Kruger, provides that a health-care practitioner \"may perform an abortion if, in accordance with a reasonable professional judgement and good faith issued by the practitioner based on the facts of the patient's case: the patient is within twenty-four weeks of the initiation of the pregnancy, there is an absence of the child's health, or if the abortion is necessary to protect the patient's life or health.\" Previously, women in New York can only have an abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy if their lives are threatened, according to Justin Flag, Croger's spokesman. Under the new law, women could also abort after 24 weeks if their health was threatened or if the foetus was not viable. This is the criterion set by the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Flag said, but the contradiction between state and federal laws \"it is stated that many women were forced out of the state to obtain the necessary medical care after 24 weeks.\" New York law is part of the trend: in states where many people prefer abortion rights, legislators move to make Roe v. Wade an ordinary part of State law. \"With the signing of this law, we send a clear message that no matter what happens in Washington, women in New York will always have the fundamental right to control their bodies,\" said Komo. New New York law has disturbed anti-abortionists, who consider that Roe's exceptions to mother's health or life can apply to any pregnancy for any reason. The Catholic bishops in the state said in a statement: \"The law already enacted by our State will be radically expanded by enabling more health practitioners to provide abortion and removing all State restrictions on late action.\" On the Internet, anti-abortion opponents have written numerous Facebook messages about New York law. One of the sites from Jan 23 attacked him with a suggestion that he allowed the children to be killed a minute before they were born. \"I was born at 12:05,\" read the text on the picture of a smiling child. \"In New York, it's now perfectly legal to kill me at 12:04.\" This article is inaccurate, although it has been shared more than 5,500 times and has been referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misinformation in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, is it true that women can abort the minute before a child is born? Flag called such a \"surprise\" situation. \"If a child is born healthy at 12:05, the only thing that happens at 12:04 is labor,\" he said. \"If it was vaginal birth, it is likely that the child's head was crowned for several minutes, and the labour itself lasted for several hours or even days. In the caesarean section, the mother was ready for surgery for some time.\" However, a caesarean section is not always possible, as Daniel Castaldi-Meka, Vice-President of Political and Government Affairs at the National Institute of Reproductive Health, an organization that advocates abortion rights. She said that abdominal surgery could endanger a mother's life or health. Jen Villavisio, a Middle West doctor performing abortions, said in a statement by Paulette Fuckett that the article was \"inaccuracy.\" She said, \"Abortion does not take place in 40 weeks in cases of healthy and viable pregnancy.\" \"Over and above all, abortions that occur at this stage of pregnancy are pregnancies where fatal foetal abnormalities have been diagnosed.\" In some cases, complications were not detected or developed until the third quarter of pregnancy. Doctors may ask patients whether they wish to continue the pregnancy and to put an \"inviviolable fetus,\" as she said, or to perform an abortion. Philavisio said that abortion was necessary to save the mother's life. \"If, however, the mother's life is at risk and she is pregnant with a viable fetus, delivery is often performed, not abortion. \"The concern to save the life of both mother and baby becomes.\" In the third stage, abortion represented \"less than 1 per cent of abortions.\" The data repeats that. The Guttmacher Institute found that \"a little more than 1% of abortions take place in 21 weeks or later.\" In a study on abortions in the United States in 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that 1.3 per cent of abortions occurred in 21 weeks of pregnancy or later. Finally, New York law codifyes what already exists in federal law at the state level. Our Facebook rule oversimplifies and distorts what New York law allows. The Reproductive Health Act allows abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy only if the life or health of the mother is threatened or if the foetus is not viable. This function does not place significant and clear restrictions on the new law; rather, it gives the opposite impression. We value this wrong mail.
