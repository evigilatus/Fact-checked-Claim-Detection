In the ad, it's called \"option,\" it says, \"Nelson's voice for billions of sloppy spending plans like a bridge to nowhere. Lemox didn't ask for a single mark and pushed for ban all of them.\" We're gonna split this claim into two fact checks. In this item, we're looking at the first half, about Nelson's record on the markings. But we also encourage you to look at our fact-finding companion for Lemox's claim that he \"has never asked for one sign and paid to prevent them all.\" (It is not black and white as proposed by the Declaration). The claim that \"Nelson voted billions of meagre spending as a bridge to nowhere\" is supported in the announcement by reference to the Senate vote on the votes of 264, 20 October 2005. This is the vote on the highway re-licensing bill, which included $225 million for the Alaska Bridge to link the small town of Quichekane to Gravina, an island with only a few dozen residents and an airport. The project has been called a false name on the bridge to nowhere by a group of government guards and has become a national symbol of federal spending of barl pork. Nelson voted in favour of the Highway Bill, passed with overwhelming support from both parties, 93.1. To be clear, this wasn't a high or downward vote on the bridge to nowhere. The bill covered $286.5 billion up to 2009 for highway programmes, mass transport, safety and research. The Alaska Bridge was less than one tenth of the total expenditure on the bill. We couldn't find any evidence before the vote that Nelson had an opinion about the Alaska Bridge somehow. In a press release issued that year, Nelson mentioned the fact that there was $8.6 billion in the Florida Road Projects Bill, including the expansion of the 75-state road from Fort Myers to Naples; the construction of a link between the 4 states in the Tampa Bay area; the improvement of alternative roads I-4 in Orlando; and the expansion of the bypass around Talahasi. However, Nelson had had an opportunity to cancel funding for a bridge to no place specifically when Mr. Tom Coburn of the United States, R-Okla, proposed an amendment that would have redirected $125 million in funding for the Alaska Bridge towards rebuilding the New Orleans Bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina. That amendment failed 82-15, and Nelson was among those who voted against it. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. John McCain, R. Ares, then Vice-President Barack Obama, was criticized for a similar vote. Obama and others said that they voted against the Cooper's amendment not because they agreed to fund the bridge to nowhere, but because they felt it was wrong to single out the pork project for a single state without eliminating it for all states (or they feared that their pork projects would be on a block next time). By the way, the bridge to nowhere didn't get the money. A Congressional committee directed $225 million for the Gravina Island Bridge to the Alaska Department of Transport to spend money as it deemed appropriate. Although Alaskan officials can still decide to spend it on the bridge, ultimately the price of the project is balloons and the money is spent elsewhere. But back to Lemox's claim that Nelson voted for \"billions of sloppy spending allocations like a bridge to nowhere.\" \"He did,\" said Steve Ellis of the general sense taxpayers, a group following federal leads. \"I have supported bills, along with many other senators, which have billions of dollars in allocations.\" On April 11, 2011, in a press release. In the federal government's way you have to spend Florida's high-speed money. \u2022 April 11, 2011, based on an analysis by taxpayers of public sense, the said highway bill contained over 6,000 risks at a cost of more than $24 billion. \"Whether they're \"growling\" or not all that depends on who you're talking to,\" said Ellis. \"But alongside rank and file, Nelson was definitely someone who actively participated in the specialty game. I wouldn't have put it in a dedicated Pantheon, but he certainly played the game.\" Politicians have been established before to expand the truth by claiming that their opponent supported the bridge simply to no place because they voted for the Highway Bill in 2005. But this announcement is painted with a larger brush, criticizing Nelson for voting billions of dollars of strings like a bridge to nowhere. Nelson may not have specifically supported the bridge project to nowhere, but he certainly voted in favour of a bill that was known to include billions of dollars from the road plans, and that's why he's here. We're mostly assessing the claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13102"}
