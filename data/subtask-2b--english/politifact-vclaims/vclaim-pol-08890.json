Cupp asked, \"Do you trust the U.N.?\" Jones responded that the United Nations had overseen \"172 successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations.\"\nAfter Cupp expressed skepticism, Jones continued, \"The world is a tough, nasty place, and we focus on the places the U.N. has not been able to change human nature. But we are in a much safer world because of the U.N. than we would be without it.\"\nIs it really true that the United Nations, since its establishment after the end of World War II, has overseen \"172 successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations\"? That would be between two and three new ones per year.\nWhen we checked with Jones, he pointed to a 2005 U.N. report. It stated that \"since 1945, the U.N. has assisted in negotiating more than 170 peace settlements that have ended regional conflicts. Examples include ending the Iran-Iraq war, facilitating the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and ending the civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala. The United Nations has used quiet diplomacy to avert imminent wars.\"\nBecause the document is eight years old -- and because \"170 peace settlements\" is not precisely the same thing as \"172 successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations\" -- we decided to check with the United Nations directly to see if there was an updated number.\nCounting the peacekeeping missions -- which are typically launched once a peace deal is in place -- is pretty straightforward: The running total since 1948 is 68 peacekeeping missions, of which 15 are ongoing.

U.N. officials say there\u2019s no way of knowing the correct number today, but the 2005 figure, combined with other data that is up to date, suggests that 172 is a reasonable approximation.
