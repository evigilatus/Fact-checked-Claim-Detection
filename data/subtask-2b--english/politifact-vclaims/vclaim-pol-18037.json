Bloomberg acknowledged his past as a Republican and an Independent. But he argued that he isn\u2019t such a Democratic outsider if you look at who he supported.\n\"But if you want to know my Democratic credentials, I spoke for Hillary Clinton at the DNC Convention in Philadelphia in 2016,\" Bloomberg said at the Feb. 26 forum. \"I certainly supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden, (Biden) says no, but I was there both times for them, thank you very much.\"\nWas Bloomberg really there for Obama and Biden in their 2008 and 2012 campaigns for the White House?\nIt would be a stretch to say he was an enthusiastic Obama supporter. Bloomberg did not endorse Obama\u2019s 2008 run, and while he did endorse him in 2012, that happened a week before the November election in an opinion piece that also criticized Obama\u2019s record.\n\"Mike said he supported Obama both times. He voted for him both times,\" said Stu Loeser, a Bloomberg campaign spokesman.\nRELATED: Bloomberg is registered as a Democrat, but is he accepted as one?\nBloomberg in June 2008: He defended Obama but stayed neutral\nObama\u2019s 2008 bid was plagued with rumors that he was secretly a Muslim with anti-Israel views. Bloomberg, who is Jewish, flew to Florida in June 2008 to defend Obama. Bloomberg at that time was mayor of New York City.\nThe rumors about Obama were lies, Bloomberg told the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County, \"wedge politics at its worst, and we have to reject it \u2014 loudly, clearly and unequivocally.\"\nBloomberg told the audience he had not decided whom to support, the New York Times reported. When he was asked whether he would become an ambassador to Jews for Obama, Bloomberg said he would \"speak out against intolerance for both candidates,\" including Republican nominee Sen. John McCain.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a July 2008 speech to the Independence Party of Minnesota, Bloomberg spoke about both Obama and McCain, without picking a side. \"Now, we're lucky this year: we have two candidates who have shown, on at least some issues, that they are capable of thinking and acting independently of the special interests,\" Bloomberg said.\nOverall, Bloomberg delivered a largely neutral stance in 2008. He did not endorse either of the party candidates.\nBloomberg in 2012: He endorsed a \u2018divisive\u2019 Obama\nBloomberg endorsed Obama Nov. 1, 2012, in a Bloomberg.com post headlined, \"A vote for a president to lead on climate change.\"\nBloomberg lauded Obama\u2019s efforts to reduce carbon consumption, for setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks, and for adopting tighter controls on mercury emissions.\nBut he also said Obama had not done enough to build a coalition of centrists, \"which doomed hope for any real progress on illegal guns, immigration, tax reform, job creation and deficit reduction.\"\n\"And rather than uniting the country around a message of shared sacrifice, he engaged in partisan attacks and has embraced a divisive populist agenda focused more on redistributing income than creating it,\" Bloomberg wrote in his endorsement.\nLoeser told PolitiFact that Bloomberg\u2019s endorsement was \"designed to flip or lock down voters who still hadn't committed to Obama-Biden by the last days of the campaign.\"\nOur ruling\nBloomberg said, \"I certainly supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden. ... I was there both times for them.\"\nIn 2008, Bloomberg defended Obama against attacks that he was anti-Israel, but Bloomberg did not endorse a presidential candidate that cycle.\nIn 2012, he endorsed Obama\u2019s re-election in a post that mixed in criticism of his record.\nBloomberg\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
