Mitt Romney made history as the lone Republican to vote to convict President Donald Trump at Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, he became the target of social media smears.\nOne attack linked the Utah senator to Ghislaine Maxwell, the woman who allegedly recruited girls and young women for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.\nThe Jan. 29 post is a screengrab of what appears to be a news story or blog post featuring a photo of Maxwell. It reads, in all-caps:\n\"Epstein\u2019s recruiter Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s father Robert Maxwell gave Mitt Romney his first $2M investment and started him in business.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe claim has an element of truth, but is misleading.\nThe body of Robert Maxwell, a British publishing baron, was found floating in the Atlantic after he went missing off his private yacht in November 1991 and the circumstances have remained mysterious. He was an early investor in Romney\u2019s first investment fund at the Bain Capital firm, which was pivotal in Romney\u2019s later political career.\u00a0\nBut Romney had already established himself in business by the time Robert Maxwell gave him money \u2014 and Maxwell\u2019s investment was not the first in the fund.\nThe Epstein connection\nEpstein, a disgraced financier, was accused of sexually abusing and trafficking underage girls. He committed suicide by hanging himself in a New York City jail cell Aug. 10.\nGhislaine Maxwell, a British socialite, is the Oxford-educated daughter of Robert Maxwell. Her father's business empire collapsed following his death, according to ABC News, which did a series on Epstein. Ghislaine Maxwell moved to New York and became Epstein\u2019s girlfriend. Her whereabouts are unknown.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhislaine Maxwell allegedly helped recruit girls for Epstein and is being sued, along with Epstein\u2019s estate, by three women who say they were among the victims.\u00a0\nThe Romney connection\nThe post we\u2019re checking shows a headline from an article on JohnBWellsNews.com, whose slogan is \"Making The News Great Again.\" That article links to a July 2012 article in The Telegraph, a London-based news organization.\u00a0\nThe Telegraph reported that after Romney set up the Boston consulting firm Bain Capital in 1984, Robert Maxwell invested $2 million in Romney's first private equity fund, a fund that \"launched (Romney\u2019s) controversial career in finance.\"\nThe same day, the Los Angeles Times reported that the fund had been seeded with $12 million from Bain partners and that Maxwell\u2019s $2 million was one of the early, but certainly not the first, outside investments. After Maxwell\u2019s death, investigators discovered Maxwell had stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from his company's pension funds.\nRomney\u2019s fund was invested in startup companies and leveraged buyouts. It paid out an average of 173% in average annual returns over a decade and was the \"start of the private equity powerhouse that ultimately fueled Romney\u2019s political career,\" the Times said.\nRomney was established in business before starting the fund. He worked for two years at the Boston Consulting Group and six years at the Bain & Company consulting firm before co-founding the new firm-within-a-firm, Bain Capital, in 1984.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims that Robert Maxwell \u2014 the father of the woman who allegedly recruited girls and young women for sexual exploitation by Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 gave Mitt Romney \"his first $2 million investment and got him started in business.\"\nThe $2 million from Maxwell did not start Romney in business. Romney had eight years of business experience before co-founding the Bain Capital investment firm.\nMoreover, Romney\u2019s first fund at the firm was seeded by $12 million from Bain partners, although Maxwell was one of the early outside investors.\nThis statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical details that would give a different impression.
