They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they\u2019d still eat it up.

The meme has continually resurfaced over the years, though it has repeatedly been debunked.\nWe searched People\u2019s archives, which date back to the 1970s, and found no Trump interviews in 1998 \u2013 or any other time \u2013 that feature that quote or anything resembling it.\nMost of the magazine\u2019s articles at the time that involved Trump discussed his celebrity and high-profile divorce from Marla Maples.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople also issued a statement rebuking the quote\u2019s authenticity.\n\"PEOPLE looked into this matter exhaustively when the quote first surfaced,\" a magazine spokesperson said. \"We combed through every Trump story in our archive and did not find anything remotely like this quote \u2013 and no Trump interview in 1998.\"\nTrump did talk politics in the late 1980s and \u201990s, but there is no record of him bashing the Republican party, or its voters.\nFor example, in a 1988 episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show, Trump said he would probably never run for president, but wouldn\u2019t rule it out completely. The image used in the meme is from that interview:\n\nOn Sept. 30, 1999, Trump wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal and said he was considering a presidential run, and sounded as if he would do so as an independent.\n\"Unlike candidates from the two major parties, my candidacy would not represent an exercise in career advancement ...
