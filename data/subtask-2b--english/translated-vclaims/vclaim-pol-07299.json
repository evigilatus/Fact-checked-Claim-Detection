In the Declaration, the Narrator says with a dark tone: \"Young people in a State-run school are sexually abused. When the local investigation is delayed, the Texas Guard informs Attorney General Greg Abbott and asks him to investigate. The narrator says Abbott didn't do anything, adding that 11 months later with more incidents of abuse and neglect. \"But Abbott didn't pursue the case,\" says the Narrator. In support, the Davis campaign presented news stories describing attempts by a Texas guard to obtain authorities outside West Texas, including the Attorney General, to look into alleged incidents at the West Texas State School in Beit. We reviewed those and other news reports, which together recorded the failure of a government lawyer to take preliminary action before the Abbott office submitted the related allegations to a major jury. Abbott's not doing anything? General information on alleged sexual offences by remote school officials to February 2007 news reports from Texas Seaver and Dallas Morning News. But the Texas Guard, Brian Borzinsky, has been working on the case for years and has already arrived in the state for help. Borzinsky sent an e-mail to the assistant prosecutor, Will Tatum, on 21 February 2006, detailing the sexual abuse of young males in school, according to information published by the Abbott office in March 2007. He said the local prosecutor's e-mail had a case, but \"I didn't do anything with it and I'm losing hope that he would do it. .................................................................................... I want you to see this report and tell me what you think.\" Borzinsky had begun his investigations in February 2005. According to the Abbott office, Tatum refused to pursue the case because of jurisdictional concerns; under state law, the Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office needed a local prosecutor to request assistance before it could intervene. When Borzinsky &apos; s e-mail request became public, Jerry Strickland, Abbott &apos; s spokesman, said that Tatum still had to send the report to his superiors before responding to the e-mail, but did not follow the Agency &apos; s procedures, according to the news reports at that time. Strickland said: \"Knowing the seriousness of the allegations contained in that e-mail, the Office of the Prosecutor would have taken the necessary action, and this agency would have been actively involved in the matter in any way possible.\" But Strickland also said that two days after Burzinsky sent the e-mail, Tatum correctly told the guard that Ward County Attorney General, Randall Reynolds, In April 2007, Austin's American-Stateman News said that Tatum sent to Borzinsky the name and address of his supervisor, Adrian McFarland, and that he'd been able to find out who he was. Abbott acted in 2007. Strickland said that the D.A.'s office initiated an aggressive investigation after Reynolds asked for help, which came on January 17, 2007. In April 2007, a major jury in Ward County returned 13 indictments against two former school principals for inappropriate sexual behaviour with six students between 16 and 19 years of age, at which time the Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office announced. Abbott and other state prosecutors were brought before the Grand Jury to bring charges against former Texas Youth Commission officials Ray Edward Brookings and John Paul Hernandez, Abbott's office. At that time, Abbott said: \"With the indictments today, the victims of sexual assault at the West Texas State School are a step closer to the justice they deserve.\" On January 27, 2021, Marco Rubio says in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders.\" Parks appointed the District Attorney as Prue Tim after the District Attorney dropped the case, as the ad said. In April 2010, a jury sentenced Brookings to 10 years &apos; imprisonment for having been convicted of having sexual relations with a teenage prisoner. In 2011, the Hernandez jury acquitted 14 boys of harassment charges in 2004 and 2005. The Texas Public Prosecutor &apos; s Act on criminal prosecutions in general, and the news story of the statesman in April 2007 indicated that the Texas Attorney General is an Executive Director primarily defending the state in civil disputes, \"although in domestic criminal cases involving insurance fraud, Medicaid or elections, the Attorney General of Texas can normally find a way to involve himself, in one way or another. Using a provision in the Penal Code dealing with computer offences, its employees may initiate investigations into the demand for sex from minors on the Internet.\" The charges are like those from West Texas, the story says, \"Outside the border, even the local prosecutor asks for help in writing.\" Eric Nichols, Deputy Prosecutor of Criminal Justice, told the newspaper that the state agency was following the letter of law. At that time, the Texas Government Act provided that: \"Prosecutor's counsel may request the assistance of the Public Prosecutor in the prosecution of all types of criminal cases or in the performance of any duty imposed by law on prosecution counsel. When such assistance is requested, the Attorney-General may appoint an Assistant Public Defender as an Assistant Public Defender.\" In 2007, the Legislature amended the Act to provide that the Attorney-General may assist in any criminal trial. Further approved review: The Attorney General may assist \"in prosecuting criminal offences related to the Texas Youth Commission.\" The story of the statesman says that two legislators, Jim McCrenolds of Lovekin and Jim Dunham of Wako, asked Nichols whether Abbott's office should do more at first: even if he couldn't start the trial, couldn't he pick up the phone and call Reynolds, or even the governor, the chief executive of the state? In an interview at that time, Nichols said that Abbott's assistants assumed that the local prosecutor was doing his job. \"Do you automatically conclude that nothing will happen?\" Nichols asked. On the other hand, the story of the U.S. man may not matter if someone in the D.A.'s office called Reynolds for help. He told Borzinsky the legislators in 2007 that Reynolds had consistently assured him that he would sue the case. The story is that Reynolds didn't say anything in his defense except blame politics or \"the breakdown of communications.\" A timetable accompanying the story stated that Abbott had learned of the investigation in West Texas at a meeting of senior Agency staff in January 2007. On March 9, 2007, Abbott announced that the grand jury would soon begin hearing the case. In her announcement, Davis said that Greg Abbott did nothing to follow up on reports of child sexual abuse at a state-run school. In 2006, the Abbott Office responded to the report of one of the guards detailing such allegations by stating that the local prosecutor needed State assistance - reports that the state attorney had done nothing more. However, this charge ignores a central development. In 2007, after the local prosecutor requested assistance, State lawyers supervised by Abbott made an offer to the senior jurors that led to charges. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong. In fact, this statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.
