Christopher Hake, who was killed in 2008 while serving his second tour of duty in Iraq.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image shows Kelli wiping her face as her son comforts her. Text below the photos say:\n\"With his widow and son looking on, Speaker Pelosi ripped up the speech containing the name of Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake, killed in the line of duty in Iraq.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe photo of the Hakes was not altered. But the moment did not come when Pelosi was tearing the speech. It came before, when Trump introduced the family and was speaking about Sgt. Hake.\nA similar photo of Kelli Hake wiping her eyes was taken by the Associated Press at 10:14 p.m. (ET), the time that Trump was speaking about Hake and the roadside bomb that killed him in Baghdad in 2008.\nWhile the image is from the same event, and the speech does contain Sgt. Hake\u2019s name, the post makes it look like it\u2019s showing the family\u2019s reaction to Pelosi\u2019s action. That\u2019s incorrect. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17378"}
