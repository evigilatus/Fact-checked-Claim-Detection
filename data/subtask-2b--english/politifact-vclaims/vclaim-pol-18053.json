Quaden Bayles 2011-2020.\" The short clip shows an American news anchor saying that police found the body of a 9-year-old before abruptly stopping with this warning: \"This video may show graphic content. Share to continue watching.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nIt\u2019s similar to another hoax suicide report. In February, we debunked claims that Kobe Bryant\u2019s widow killed herself after his death. Like this post about Bayles, that one also featured the BBC News logo and an \"R.I.P\" video that cut off with a warning that told viewers to share it to continue watching.\u00a0\nBBC didn\u2019t report on Bryant\u2019s supposed suicide, and it didn\u2019t report on Bayles allegedly killing himself. We found no other media coverage of such an event, either.\u00a0\nWe rate this blog post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18053"}
