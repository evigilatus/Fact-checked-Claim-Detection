In 32 percent of counties, individuals looking to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act online marketplace have just one choice for their insurance provider, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, last updated in November 2016.\nIn several states, including Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming, there\u2019s only one insurance provider total participating in each state\u2019s online marketplace in 2017. \u00a0\nThat\u2019s a significant change from 2016, when just 7 percent of counties \u2014 and one state, Wyoming \u2014 were limited to one insurance provider on the online exchanges.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Wisconsin has 15 insurance providers participating in the exchanges in 2017, and Ohio has 11.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Trump\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t mean one-third of people have only one provider to choose from for health insurance. Because rural and sparsely populated areas tend to have lower competition, about 21 percent, or one-fifth, of exchange enrollees live in these counties where there\u2019s only one insurance provider to choose from, according to Kaiser.\nSo of the approximately 9.2 million people enrolled in the Affordable Care Act exchanges in 2017, about 1.9 million could only purchase insurance from one company.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese individuals could still buy insurance outside the marketplace and from another provider. But if they did so, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get a federal subsidy to defray the cost.\nInsurance companies that have dropped from the exchanges \u2014 including UnitedHealthGroup, Humana and Aetna \u2014 have said they were losing money by participating.\nAmong plans offered on the exchanges, costs have gone way up. Looking at a standard measurement used by the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 what a family of four with a household income of $60,000 would pay for premiums on the second-lowest-cost silver plan \u2014 average premiums for this type of plan rose by 38 percent between 2014 and 2017.\n\"Of course, everyone would like to see more competition in the marketplaces \u2014 that's important for keeping costs down,\" said Sherry Glied, dean of New York University\u2019s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. \"But there has always been a recognition that there would be more competition in some places than others.\"\nGlied added that individual insurance markets in many states were highly concentrated before the Affordable Care Act, too.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"One-third of the counties \u2014 think of it, one-third \u2014 only have one insurer left.\"\nAs long as you know that Trump is specifically talking about Affordable Care Act exchanges, Trump\u2019s figure checks out. People trying to purchase insurance on a government exchange only have one provider to choose from in 32 percent of the nation\u2019s counties, according to late 2016 data from Kaiser.\nThat means 21 percent of Affordable Care Act enrollees, or about 1.9 million people in 2017, can only pick from one health insurance provider.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim True.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    1 7  Politifact Rating: True  \"One-third of the counties \u2014 think of it, one-third \u2014 only have one insurer left\" on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.
