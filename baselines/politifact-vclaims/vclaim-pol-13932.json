What type of person does the county need?\n\nHolloway: I think it needs a person like Lee Holloway, to be honest with you. I\u2019m sincere about that. I think I\u2019ve got all of the skills and the ability. And the big initiatives all came from me, for a long time: the health (insurance) initiatives, which saved $100 million for the county; the pension obligation bonds \u2014 he (Scott Walker) couldn\u2019t get the votes; the sales tax. I tried to save Midwest Express, and did everything I could. He couldn\u2019t get the votes for that. I created the GAMP program, which lasted for 16 to 18 years, and it became a national model. The UWM (expansion), that\u2019s my deal. He was talking about $6 million; I came up with $13 million. Those are a lot of big projects. He\u2019ll come up and try to get publicity and say, \u2018Me and Chairman Holloway\u2026\u2019 And he doesn\u2019t veto my stuff. \"\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of boasting from the effusive chairman, who has not ruled out appointing himself interim executive.\n\nWe decided to take a closer look at the comment about the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee project, which relates to land the UWM Foundation purchased to construct its Innovation Park campus on the County Grounds in Wauwatosa. The foundation\u2019s first payment of $5 million is due Dec. 15, 2010.\n\nSo, did Holloway really drive a harder bargain than Walker, getting $7 million more for the county and its taxpayers?\n\nThe project has been under discussion for several years, and has also included land division, a development plan, rezoning and creation of a tax incremental financing district from the city of Wauwatosa.\n\nIn the case of the land deal, the county and UWM Foundation have an agreement for purchase of the 88-acre tract, located east of U.S. Highway 45 and north of W. Watertown Plank Road for $13.55 million.\n\nWhen talks began, each side came to the table with its own outside appraisal of the land\u2019s value. UWM\u2019s was for about $8 million; the county\u2019s came in at $13 million\n\nHolloway was involved in crafting the county\u2019s response for the next level of negotiations, moving UWM closer to -- and possibly above -- the county figure, according county and UWM Foundation staff involved in the talks.\n\nHolloway pushed for the county to use a formula that took into account the future value of the parcel, once it was fully developed, said Craig Dillman, the county\u2019s manager of real estate services.\n\nThe formula, called a floor to area ratio, is commonly used in real estate development. Holloway argued the development could be more dense than the UWM projections.\n\n\"That\u2019s how the higher value came to be achieved,\" Dillman said.\n\nThe two sides eventually agreed not only on a price of $13.55 million -- but also on a formula that calls for future payments to the county if UWM\u2019s development exceeds projections.\n\nWhat did others say about Holloway\u2019s role?\n\nUWM Foundation President David Gilbert said he didn\u2019t know the extent of Holloway\u2019s involvement in the county side of the talks. He said Holloway was one of several players.\n\n\"The main person we negotiated with was Craig Dillman,\" Gilbert said.\n\nWalker Chief of Staff Tom Nardelli said Holloway was trying to take credit for something that was a group effort on the county\u2019s part.\n\n\"Holloway always believed he could get more\" for the land, Nardelli said. \"If Scott said five, he\u2019d say go to six.\"\n\nIn his claim, Holloway argues the county -- as in Walker -- was ready to settle for $6 million.\n\nBut no one we talked with recalls that figure ever coming up -- after all, UWM\u2019s appraisal was for $8.5 million. And no one associated that figure with Walker, who Holloway claims was ready to accept it. Indeed, Walker was not at the table himself -- Dillman was there.\n\nWe asked Holloway for an interview several times. He didn\u2019t respond.\n\nCounty Board spokesman Harold Mester said Holloway recalls that the $6 million figure was \"discussed behind the scenes\" by UWM and county negotiators, before the first offer was presented by UWM.\n\n\"The County Executive was ready to sell that land at a lower price,\" Mester said. \"The chairman said \u2018Wait a minute. This is one of the most valuable land parcels we have, at the crossroads of the state of Wisconsin.\u2019 The chairman thought there was a lot more value there.\"\n\nSaid Mester: \"The chairman takes credit for getting more money for the taxpayers and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\"\n\nNardelli responded: \"That was all being negotiated. Scott never wanted less. It\u2019s assinine to suggest that.\"\n\nLet\u2019s score this one out.\n\nHolloway bragged he got $7 million more for taxpayers than Walker was willing to accept from the UWM Foundation. From all accounts, Holloway was involved in the talks, and pushed for the formula that was ultimately used and the final price tag was about $5 million more than UWM\u2019s initial appraisal. So some him credit for the higher price.\n\nBut there\u2019s no concrete evidence that Walker was willing to simply accept the UWM appraisal -- and certainly none that he wanted to go $2.5 million lower. That wouldn\u2019t be much negotiating at all. \u00a0We rate Holloway\u2019s statement Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
