Chuck Grassley. \"This is ridiculous,\" said Sun Johnny Ernest. The Republican Senators of Iowa were talking about President Donald Trump's comment that windmills cause cancer. Trump made a note at the fundraiser for the National Congress of the Republic. As he often does, Trump attacked wind energy as a source of energy. We've checked his recent false claim that he's leaving electrical grids at the mercy of the wind. \"If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just dropped 75% in value,\" said Trump to his Republican colleagues April 2. \"They say that noise causes cancer\" We asked the White House for evidence that the noise of wind turbines causes cancer. We didn't hear a reply. The health impact of wind turbines has been the subject of many speculations. The Australian Parliament has taken the issue sufficiently seriously to form a select committee on wind turbines. The team was sympathetic to personal reports of discomfort, and the list of diseases he heard was long: \"Tenetus, hypertension, heartbeat, cardiac arrhythmia, stress, anxiety, dizziness, dizziness,\" and more. But no one complained about cancer. In its 2015 final report, the Committee stated that further evidence was needed to establish a link to any disease. On January 31, 2021, Ryan Fornier stated on Twitter that \"Biden's administration has lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\" Noah Y. Kim wrote: February 1, 2021 at the same time, \"A medical association of Australia says that available Australian and international evidence does not support the view that voice without voice or low-frequency voice generated by wind farms, as currently organized in Australia, has adverse health effects on the population living next to it. A review conducted in 2014 in the journal Professional and Environmental Medicine for Scientific Studies showed that \"epidemiological studies have shown links between living near wind turbines and anxiety.\" And \"honor seems to be associated with more individual characteristics than noise than turbines.\" Very annoying, yes. Cancer? No. Trump's words were particularly unwelcome in Iowa. The state of Hokkai receives nearly 40 per cent of its electric power from the wind - more than any other state. (after two days of Trump, Iowa Goff) Kim Reynolds has started an initiative to expand wind turbines in her condition. Reynolds avoided questions about Trump's statement, saying that she was not entitled to comment. But Sin Ernst didn't have any reservations. \"This is ridiculous,\" she said April 4 (hearing 2:20). \"The wind energy is just a great source of the state of Iowa. We're very lucky to have a lot of power from a clean energy source.\" The Governor Trump said that the windmill noise caused cancer. The White House did not provide any evidence. There is no study in support of the statement. In relation to the Republican Senators of Iowa, we appreciate this ridiculous phrase: pants on fire.
