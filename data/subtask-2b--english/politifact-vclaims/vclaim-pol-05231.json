The top bracket is $9,000 and higher.\nHowever, there\u2019s a catch. Greitens said people making $9,000 or more would fall in the top bracket. In fact, this chart applies not to how much a person earns but to that individual\u2019s taxable earnings \u2014 after any deductions.\nTaxable income vs. gross income\nTaxable income is gross income less all personal exemptions and deductions.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Revenue allows the following standard deductions for Missouri taxpayers.\nStandard deductions for Missouri taxpayers\n\nThe chart shows a single filer can claim a standard deduction of $6,300. Therefore, if that person makes $9,000, as Greitens\u2019 said, then he or she would only have a taxable income of $2,700 \u2014 even with no other exemptions. When we refer back to the department\u2019s tax bracket chart, we can see such an individual would fit into the state\u2019s fourth tax bracket instead of the highest tax bracket.\nAll things being equal, a single filer would need to make at least $15,300 before he or she would face the highest tax rate.\nMarried people filing jointly, heads of household and surviving spouses could make more than $15,300 and still not be in the top bracket.\nOur ruling\nGreitens said, \"We have 10 different tax brackets, and if you\u2019re making $9,000, you\u2019re already in the top tax bracket.\"\nThe plain meaning of \"making $9,000\" is that\u2019s how much a person earns. However, the Missouri tax brackets aren\u2019t based on gross income but on income after deductions and exemptions. Those reduce a person\u2019s taxable income, which is the basis of the chart Greitens had in mind.\nA person making $9,000 would fall in the fourth tax bracket, closer to the bottom, and certainly not at the top.\nMost people would understand Greitens to be talking about gross income, and in this case, his statement falls far short of the mark.
