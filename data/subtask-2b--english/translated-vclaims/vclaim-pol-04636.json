He attacked Hillary Clinton's plans to accept refugees and promised to strangle all immigrants from countries that might send terrorists to the United States. \"We must immediately stop immigration from any country that is threatened by terrorism until proven screening mechanisms are put in place,\" he said to the crowd in Cleveland on July 21. \"My opponent has called for a radical increase of 550 percent in Syria, think about this, think about this. An increase of 550 per cent in Syrian refugees, as well as the current massive influx of refugees, was already coming to our country under the leadership of President Obama.\" This is suggested although there is no way to examine these refugees to find out who they are or where they came from. I just want to bring people into our country who will support our values and love our people.\" We have addressed these issues in many other fact-finding exercises. In sum: Trump is wrong to suggest that the examination was not performed and correct when he said that Clinton recommended an increase of 55%. Let's go through the relevant points. The exodus of thousands of Syrians fleeing a war has claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people, described as the largest humanitarian crisis since the Second World War. The fear - here and in some of the countries I have accepted - is that some of these people may be terrorists pretending to be refugees. Compared to other countries, the United States accepted very few countries - for example, about 2,000 last year. Half of them are children. Only about 2 per cent are single men of combat age, the majority of whom are likely to be potential terrorists. In 2015, President Barack Obama said that he would increase the number to 10,000. Then, on September 20, 2015, as the nation of CBS appeared, Clinton said, given the scope of the problem, \"I think the United States should do more, and I would like to see us move from a good start from 10,000 to 65,000, and immediately start developing mechanisms to examine the people we will receive.\" On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" This increase is 550 percent of Trump and the Republicans were talking about it. This part of Trump's statement is accurate. However, contrary to Tramp's claim that \"there is no way to examine these refugees to find out who they are or where they came from,\" refugees are already being examined, although, like any security programme, there are no guarantees. Said Raj Shah, spokesman for the National Commission of the Republic, \"The head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ministry of Internal Security and the National Anti-Terrorism Centre of the Obama Administration have testified that because there are no databases in Syria, the existing procedures cannot effectively ensure that terrorists associated with ISIS do not pretend to be refugees and come to the United States. According to the American Refugee Entry Programme, which was established in 1980 and reprocessed after 11 September, a potential refugee must first receive a referral from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, an American embassy or a recognized non-governmental organization. UNOCI takes four to ten months and only 1 per cent is recommended for resettlement. Before the United States starts the investigation, where names, biographical information and fingerprints are operated through federal terrorism and criminal databases. In addition, officials of the Ministry of National Security interview refugees. If they overcome those obstacles, they must also pass the medical examination, have a sponsoring agency, pass \"cultural guidance\" classes and be examined for another security permit. As we stated in November, Syrian refugees are assigned an additional level of scrutiny, with their documents transmitted to confidential and non-confidential information. Only then, after a process of one to two years, or more, can they come to the United States. There may be gaps in some information because they are fleeing the war, but if ISIS or another terrorist group wants to get someone in the United States, the experts tell us, it would be faster and easier to arrange for them to fly as tourists. Our Governor, Hillary Clinton, Trump, said, \"I have called for a radical increase of 55% in Syrian refugees... despite the fact that there is no way to sort out these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they came from.\" The figure of 55% is true. To say that there is no way to examine them to find out who they are or where they came from, they ignore the thorough examination to which they are subjected. We value the claim half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c874e0c3-26be-4fff3-9659-4711651f5e1", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04636"}
