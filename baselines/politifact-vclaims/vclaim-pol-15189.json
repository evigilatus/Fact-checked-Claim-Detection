The Federal Reserve system has presided over a 95... percent decline in the U.S. dollar.\"\n\nBoard member Patricia Hardy questioned Cargill's statement: \"It's amazing how this board knows so much about so many different subjects but I think this is innately biased in its statement and there would be lots of economists who would have a question on the role in this way.\"\n\nAnother board member, Mavis Knight, asked: \"Is the Federal Reserve System the only reason why there has been a decline in the U.S. dollar since 1913?\"\n\nWe wondered the same thing. In search of an answer, we first delved into the Fed's history.\n\nOn Dec. 23, 1913, Congress created the the Federal Reserve System to serve as the nation's central bank. Its primary responsibility is to influence the flow of money and credit in the economy, returning all excess earnings to the U.S. Treasury. Currently, the system's seven board members, including Chairman Ben Bernanke, are responsible for U.S. monetary policy. They constitute a majority of the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions affecting the cost and availability of money and credit.\n\nBut does that mean the Fed is responsible for the dollar's decline in value over 90-plus years?\n\nCargill didn't respond to our inquiries. (Board members wound up approving a revision of her amendment stating: \"Analyze the decline in value of the U.S. dollar including abandonment of the gold standard.\")\n\nMeanwhile, Dan Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, called Cargill's connection between the Federal Reserve and the declining dollar \"propaganda\" that ignores the impact of inflation from 1913 to 2010.\n\nThe buying power of a dollar in 1913 would be almost $22 today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index inflation calculator. That matches up with Cargill's claim that the dollar has dropped in value by 95 percent. Then again, annual income per person is about $32,000 today, compared to about $400 in 1913 ($8,757 in 2010 dollars) \u2014 a hefty increase in earning power.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarry Bosworth, an economist at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, similarly said the Federal Reserve isn't responsible for the U.S. dollar's value, which he called \"pretty constant\" relative to other currencies.\n\n\"The decline in the value of the dollar is the result of inflation, but advocates of the gold standard may argue that it could have been avoided if the U.S. had stayed on the gold standard, so they blame the Federal Reserve Bank,\" Bosworth said. The value of U.S. dollar was tied to gold until 1973, when the United States, switched from a system of fixed exchange rates to floating rates.\n\nIn simple terms, inflation is when the price of goods and services rises and buying power erodes. Do Federal Reserve critics blame the Fed for that, too?\n\nJesse Benton, a spokesman for Rep. Ron Paul, R-Lake Jackson, said the congressman agrees with Cargill's claim. Benton said that Paul, a former Libertarian candidate, believes inflation is caused by increases in the money supply \u2014 which the Fed controls \u2014 rather than prices going up.\n\nDollar-driven \"inflation (then) causes a rise in prices,\" Benton said. \"We think that it's very important to keep that in mind.\"\n\nRobert Auerbach, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas, former banking committee investigator and author of the book, \"Deception and Abuse at the Fed: Henry B. Gonzalez Battles Alan Greenspan's Bank,\" told us Cargill's amendment was misleading because it oversimplified both the dollar's and the Federal Reserve's history.\n\nAuerbach was trained by Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, one of two free-market economists who board members recently voted to add to the state's curriculum. In his career, Friedman famously championed killing inflation by keeping the supply of money growing at a steady but slow pace, though he later backed off that view, Auerbach said.\n\nMonetary policy offers two basic choices, Auerbach said: Letting the money supply grow, fueling inflation, or keeping the reins tight, which can cause severe recessions.\n\n\"If you're limited from printing money, you'd put a huge number of people out of work,\" he said.\n\nUpshot: Cargill's correct that a dollar now has about 5 percent of the buying power it did in 1913, when the Federal Reserve System was created. That's basic math. Yet while a dollar now buys far less than in 1913, Americans also have far more earning power. And the dollar has generally held its value compared to other countries' currencies.\n\nThe thrust of Cargill's statement is that the Fed presided over, or caused, that decline in value. In contrast, most experts we spoke with trace the decline to inflation over the years rather than specific actions by the Federal Reserve Bank. Though some Federal Reserve critics echo Cargill's point, such debates are best left to the economic experts who have waged them for decades.\n\nAll in all, we rate her statement as Barely True.\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15189"}
