The text then turned into the words, \"I\u2019m gay.\" That\u2019s because the series of numbers in this case corresponded to a Facebook page titled \"I\u2019m gay.\" The series of numbers was the account\u2019s Facebook page ID.\n\"Today\" created a Facebook page called, \"Don\u2019t panic! This is just a test,\" and ran an experiment asking users to type the page\u2019s ID number into the same formula and, you guessed it, the text changed to the words, \"Don\u2019t panic!
