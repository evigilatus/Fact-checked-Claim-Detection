Scott Walker put a happy face on the state\u2019s long-term budget outlook in his second debate with Democratic challenger Mary Burke.\n\"The most recent fiscal year just ended with a cash balance of some $517 million,\" Walker said. \"And the next state budget will begin with a surplus of over half a billion dollars -- $535 million to be exact. That means we can invest in our priorities.\"\nThat first figure is undisputed and widely reported: The state ended the year from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014 in the black by $517 million.\nBut Burke challenged Walker\u2019s second figure.\nThere\u2019s a $1.8 billion shortfall heading into the 2015-\u201917 budget, she said, not a \"surplus of over half a billion dollars.\"\nThat\u2019s a huge difference.\nTo determine if Walker is right about the projected $535 million surplus, we turned to reports issued by the state\u2019s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\nBut first, we want to be crystal clear about what is being debated here.\nIt\u2019s not a prediction of how the second year of the 2013-\u201915 budget will end up.\nRather, Walker is talking about projections on where the state\u2019s finances will be as the next governor and Legislature put the 2015-\u201917 budget together in early 2015.\nThis is what is often referred to as the \"structural deficit.\" The name is unfortunate. The figure does not reflect a \"deficit\" or -- if Walker is right -- a \"surplus\" at the end of a budget year.\nRather, it is a tally of past decisions -- both in spending and in tax collections -- that officials will have to account for in the next two-year budget. As such, it\u2019s a benchmark for the size of the budget challenge.\nThe Fiscal Bureau does this exercise periodically, mostly during budget season. The bureau\u2019s longstanding method is to assume no loss or gain in revenue and no changes in spending. Applying the same approach allows for a consistent picture over time. The bureau\u2019s latest estimate came out Sept. 8, 2014.\nThe bottom line: a $1.76 billion deficit heading into the 2015-\u201917 budget.\nAmong the chief reasons for the gap: Tax cuts approved by Walker and the Republican-led Legislature, which contributed to a slowing of revenue.\nThe numbers cited by Walker\nSo what is Walker referring to with his $535 million surplus figure?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat figure is contained in a Sept. 18, 2014 Fiscal Bureau memo to a Republican state representative, John Nygren of Marinette.\nIn the wake of the $1.8 billion estimate, Nygren asked the bureau to look at it a different way.\nHe asked for an estimate of the budget challenge assuming that lawmakers would hold most spending at 2014-\u201915 levels for the two following years, and tax revenue would rise at the five-year average of 2.9 percent.\nThat yielded an estimate of a $535 million surplus.\nThe Fiscal Bureau also got a request from a Democrat, state Sen. Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse. It asked the Fiscal Bureau to run an estimate based on increases in school spending, granting state agencies their $1 billion spending requests and other changes. Budget requests came in Sept. 15, 2014.\nThat estimate was a $2.7 billion shortfall. \u00a0Another scenario run for Shilling was a deficit of $4 billion.\nYou get the idea. Just weeks from the Nov. 4, 2014 election, both parties have come up with ways to manipulate the Fiscal Bureau\u2019s $1.8 billion estimate using some scenarios that range from spending freezes to giving agencies everything on their wish lists.\nWe\u2019re not buying it.\nWalker\u2019s own budgets report the \"structural deficit\" number using the method the Fiscal Bureau used to come up with $1.8 billion.\nAnd lawmakers of both parties have done the same for years.\nIndeed, Walker has used the \"structural deficit\" estimates to his advantage in the past and even has made it the centerpiece of his re-election campaign.\nEvery time you hear the governor say he inherited a $3.6 billion \"deficit\" from Gov. Jim Doyle, it\u2019s a reflection in part of the $2.5 billion \"structural deficit\" the Fiscal Bureau estimated in 2011 as Walker prepared his first budget.\nAnd Walker, again using the Fiscal Bureau\u2019s traditional methodology, has touted the fact that his tight budgeting actually eliminated -- however temporarily -- the structural deficit heading into his second budget.\nWalker\u2019s campaign argues that the Fiscal Bureau memo is based on some outdated figures and that it\u2019s zero-growth assumption is unrealistic.\nBut the governor is seeking to have it both ways, trumpeting the bureau\u2019s method when it suits him and rejecting it when it does not.\nThe numbers will change again when the Fiscal Bureau updates its report in early 2015.\nOur rating\nWalker told debate viewers: \"The next state budget will begin with a surplus of over half a billion dollars -- $535 million to be exact.\"\nThat rosy number flies in the face of the official estimate that uses a long-established method used by members of both parties, and the governor\u2019s budget office.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07103"}
