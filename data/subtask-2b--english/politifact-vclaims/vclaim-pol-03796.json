Marco Rubio, R-Fla., asked Tillerson whether he thought Vladimir Putin was a war criminal (Tillerson's answer: \"I would not use that term\"), while Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., pressed him on Exxon opposing sanctions against Russia. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSenators have taken a hardline on Russia, both for its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine and its likely interference in the 2016 elections. Some, including Rubio, were keen supporters of economic sanctions against Russia in 2014.\nAt that time, Exxon, with Tillerson at the helm, had struck joint venture deals with the Russian petro giant Rosneft to explore for oil across the country. Exxon estimated its exposure on those deals at $1 billion. Sanctions presented big problems for those investments.\nAt his confirmation hearing on Jan. 11, 2017, Tillerson rejected the assertion that he ever tried to scuttle sanctions.\n\"I have never lobbied against sanctions personally,\" Tillerson said. \"To my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions.\"\nThat\u2019s an artfully crafted answer that\u2019s pretty misleading\nGovernment lobbying records show that in 2014 and 2015, Exxon paid the Nickles Group over $193,000 to press \"issues related to Russian sanctions impacting the energy sector,\" along with a number of other matters.\nIt paid another $120,000 in 2014 and 2015 to Avenue Solutions for work on a range of issues, including \"energy sanctions in the Ukraine and Russia.\"\nIn the same time frame, according to public logs, Tillerson visited the White House five times to see Jeffrey Zients, director of the National Economic Council. The meetings started about a week after President Barack Obama authorized the first of three rounds of sanctions. Bloomberg reported that Tillerson saw Treasury Secretary Jack Lew seven times in the second half of 2014. The Treasury Department oversees how sanctions are carried out.\nThat seems to directly contradict Tillerson\u2019s statement, but Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers told us it didn\u2019t.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Exxon Mobil regularly engages with lawmakers and others to discuss the potential impact of sanctions and to express our view that sanctions should treat American companies fairly,\" Jeffers said. \"We do not express an opinion as to whether or not sanctions should be imposed; that is a decision for policy makers.\"\nBut at Exxon\u2019s May 2014 shareholder meeting, Tillerson offered a more negative take on sanctions overall. He told reporters that sanctions are \"imprecise and ineffective.\" and that \"our views are being heard at the highest levels,\" he said, according to the Associated Press.\nOil industry experts told us it\u2019s hard to believe that Exxon wouldn\u2019t have opposed the sanctions.\nTadeusz Patzek is a professor and petroleum industry analyst at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Patzek thinks Tillerson is a good choice for secretary of state, but he also said Exxon\u2019s interests in Russia were quite clear.\n\"Russia is the last global frontier with big untapped oil resources that could be made available to Exxon,\" Patzek said. \"From this point of view, Exxon must have viewed the sanctions as unhelpful to the corporation.\"\nTim LaPira, a political scientist who studies lobbying at James Madison University, told us Tillerson\u2019s claim is \"implausible.\"\n\"The message of what sanctions would do would necessarily communicate that they were taking a clear position against them,\" LaPira said. \"If Exxon Mobil hired expensive lobbyists to communicate about sanctions, but not the corporation's position against them, then it seems to me they used shareholders' money to accomplish exactly nothing.\"\nGovernment ethics advocate Jordan Libowitz with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said, \"I doubt they would lobby for a bill that essentially cost them $1 billion.\"\nOur ruling\nTillerson said that he never lobbied against sanctions that targeted the Russian energy industry, nor to his knowledge had Exxon. But lobbying records show Exxon spent over $300,000 to argue its case on sanctions. Visitor records for the White House and the Treasury Department show Tillerson was a visitor when sanctions were being considered.\nAn Exxon spokesperson said the company simply offered information on sanctions. But in 2014 Tillerson told reporters that he thought sanctions generally were ineffective and that he had let top government officials know what he thought of them.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8f2e0fd6-e516-41da-82a1-2bb276c0c91d", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03796"}
