Terry Brandt hires a plane to send 124 immigrant children to Honduras?", "text": "The surge in unaccompanied minors from Central America to the American border with Mexico may have moved from the front pages in recent weeks, but it is still a hot topic on the Internet. A reader recently sent us a serial e-mail praising Iowa Goff. Terry Branstad, a Republican, claimed to have defended President Barack Obama's decision to send over 100 unaccompanied minors to Iowa. According to e-mail, Brannstad hired a jet for immigrant children and sent them all back to Honduras. A warning to the spoiler: The story of adventure is pure fiction. Here's the e-mail text that our reader received, full of a mistake in spelling the governor's name: \"The subject: Obama is flying illegal teenagers to Iowa - the governor of Iowa is spending their house,\" you know? Obama just said, \"In your Iowa,\" and Iowa brought her back. The Governor of Iowa -- Horay to you, Governor, who announced: Iowa will not take any illegitimate children (mostly teenagers) in IOWA. \"Obama rejected it yesterday, sent 124 young children 13-19, and landed by plane in De Moines. The airport manager contacted the office of Governor Terry Brandt, who drove to the airport and rented a plane from Chicago from the United States. In eight hours, all the children were loaded with food and drinks. The Iowa left at 8 a.m. De Moin. The next station was Honduras. The plane was unloaded, four social workers from Iowa made sure they arrived at the station, told Honduran officials, here are your children, have no papers, let them come illegally to America. Iowa refuses to take them. Iowa has her own laws. No minors are not with adults. Iowa didn't hear one thing from Washington. The U.S. states are fed up. The Governor is a Republican. It kind of makes me wonder if he wants to be a presidential candidate in the next election. \"Yes to Hawkeye State! This, in my view, should be done by all States. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Butterman: January 11, 2012: Let's hear for Iowa! We asked the governor's office about the e-mail. \"It's a rumor we've heard about for several weeks now, but it hasn't happened,\" said Jimmy Centress, communications manager Brastade. Moreover, a governor like Brandastad would not have the capacity to move dozens of children quickly to Honduras -- a process governed by federal rather than state law. \"Air travel, as an interstate trade, is governed by federal law and Congress,\" said Kevin Johnson, Dean of the Law School of the University of California-Davis and major in immigration law. \"State violations of interstate trade have been repeatedly annulled by the Supreme Court. The laws of the State imposing taxes on those entering the State have been repealed since about a century ago. The Iowa scenario will never happen legally. Under an anti-trafficking law signed by President George W. Bush in 2008, unaccompanied minors from neighbouring countries (such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala) and Central American countries that fuel the current boom are guaranteed access to the federal legal system to claim their stay in the United States, rather than their immediate deportation, as unaccompanied minors from Mexico may be. In the wake of the surge of migrant children, some legislators have called for revision or repeal of the provision, but no such action has yet been taken. According to the Di Moin Register, at least 139 unaccompanied migrant children entered the state between 1 January 2014 and 18 July 2014. They arrived in the trickle, not in a large group like that described in the e-mail. They came to the state because the relatives who lived in Iowa were able to catch them. The children were asked to live with their relatives until the immigration judge was able to examine their case. A judicial decision on whether to grant asylum or whether to face deportation may take years, given current case schedules and staff. In mid-July -- before e-mail starts trading -- Prastad offered a mixed reaction to the possibility that some unaccompanied minor immigrants would end up in Iowa. \"The first thing we have to do is secure the border. According to CBS News, Brasstad said. \"But I also don't want to send a signal that you are illegally sending your children to America. This is not the right message.\" The serial e-mail said that Brannstadt hired a plane to remove 124 illegal immigrant youths from his country and return them to Honduras. The Branstad office denies this, and there is no reliable evidence to undermine the Governor &apos; s account. In addition, Branstad would have no authority to take such a step on its own. We're assessing the allegation of pants on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07385"}
