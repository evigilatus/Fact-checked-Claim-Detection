As expected, Todd and Obama had a long discussion about the Department's strategy to deal with the Islamic State, the terrorist group responsible for cutting off the head of two American journalists, where Obama said \"we will defeat them.\" And then Todd noticed that Obama's response was \"a long way from when you described them as JV's team.\" \"Was that bad intelligence or bad judgment?\" Todd asked. \"Remember that I was not referring specifically to an Islamic State,\" Obama replied. \"I have said that, at the regional level, there was a whole series of organizations that were primarily focused locally, not focused on the homeland, because I think many of us, when we think of terrorism, the model is Osama bin Laden and 9/11.\" Did Obama make his remarks or did Todd fake what Obama said? We decided to take a look. In recent weeks, critics have aligned themselves with Obama's note \"JV\" as the Islamic State continues to wreak havoc throughout Syria and Iraq. The source of this comment is a file from New Yorker Obama by editor David Reimnick. The magazine New Yorker published Reimnick's file on January 27, 2014. He wrote: \"In the campaign of 2012, Obama not only spoke of the killing of Osama bin Laden; he also said that al-Qa'idah had \"degraded.\" Obama replied: \"The analogy we use here sometimes, and I think it's accurate, is if the Javi team wears a Lakers outfit that doesn't make them Cuban Bryant.\" (For non-sport fans, JV is a symbol of junior high schools, usually a high school or a high school team.) Rimenek confirmed to Bolivi Vak that the interview took place on 7 January and referred to a specific event that had taken place only days earlier: he crossed the Iraqi city of Fallujah on 3 January. At that time, the Islamic State (often referred to as ISIL or ISIL) was not a household name. They are often referred to in press reports as a group associated with Al-Qaida. However, reports from that time clearly indicate that the group was responsible for controlling the city. In January 4, the island mentioned America: \"Friday, armed members of ISIL sought to win over the inhabitants of Fallujah, one of the cities they invaded on Wednesday. A leader appeared among the prayers of Friday prayers on the main street of the city, announced that his fighters were there to defend the Sunnis from the government, and one resident said. &quot; \"We are your brothers from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, \" armed to travel through the city in a stolen police car declared by means of a loudspeaker. We're here to protect you from the government. We call on you to cooperate with us. \"The officials of the Iraqi Government told the French News Corporation that according to the National Broadcasting Corporation, ISIL, which is associated with Al-Qaida, continued to control parts of the two cities on Thursday. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, when Remenek referred to a group of Al-Qaida who had taken over Fallujah, it was clear who was speaking. On 25 August, White House Press Minister Josh Ernest claimed that Obama's comment was out of context and that \"the President was not unique\" to the Islamic State in that interview, but rather to extremist Islamic groups in general. The post-fact Washington newspaper compared that with the version that had not been published before and gave Ernest's comment four Pinocchios, the worst estimate. (In what it's worth, Remenc told Bolivi Fuckett that the verification of the facts \"got it right.\") This is also confirmed by a copy of the conversation that was given to the mail (and verified by Remenc). Rimnik: \"You know where this goes, though. Even on your holiday in the last two weeks, in Iraq, in Syria, of course, in Africa, Al-Qaida has reappeared.\" Obama: \"Yeah, but David, I think the analogy we use here sometimes, and I think it's accurate, is if JV put on the Lakers uniform, and that doesn't make them Cuban Bryant. I believe that there is a difference between the ability and reach of Bin Laden and a network that actively plans major terrorist conspiracies against the homeland against jihadists who participate in various conflicts of local power and disputes, which are often sectarian.\" But JV took the Fallujah. Obama: \"I understand. But when you say, \"I've taken the Fallujah\" - \"Remink: \"I don't know how long.\" Obama: \"But let us remember that Fallujah is a very conservative Sunni city in a country that is independent of anything we do, deeply divided on sectarian grounds. How we think about terrorism must be sufficiently defined and defined so that it does not lead us to believe that any terrible acts that occur around the world and are in part motivated by an extremist Islamic ideology pose a direct threat to us or something that we have to engage in. This is largely left unmistakably. Obama may not have specifically said ISIL, but he was clearly talking about them. Rimink referred to events in Syria and Iraq, particularly the seizure of Fallujah, by the Islamic State, and Obama referred to the group responsible for this as the \"JV team.\" The Governor Obama said his joint comment \"it did not refer specifically to ISIL.\" It was not specifically asked about ISIL, but it is very clear that this is the group referred to in the conversation. The text supports this, as well as news events from the time of discussion. We're assessing the statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07343"}
