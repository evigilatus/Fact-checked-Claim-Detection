She said she made a mistake using the system, but she's still taking the classification seriously. \"I have a lot of experience dealing with classified materials, starting when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee going to four years as Secretary of State,\" she said. \"Disaggregated material has an address that says \"Too secret, secret, secret.\" Nothing, and I'll repeat this, and that's what was verified in the report of the Ministry of Justice, Since we found that Clinton's e-mail contained some classified information, we liked this statement. The information is not confidential until a certain authority within the Government declares it confidential. The way that person shows his or her design is by adding a header and a vehicle to the relevant document, often on the cover page as well - all of which shows that the document contains confidential information. Clinton is right that the FBI didn't find any of these labels in her e-mails. Of the tens of thousands of e-mails reviewed by the FBI, 81 e-mail series were found on Clinton's private servers with classified information, as identified by various intelligence agencies in the United States, according to the FBI report of 2 September. Only three e-mail chains contained some sort of classification mark: at least one paragraph preceded by the \" (c) \" mark, indicating that those paragraphs were \"secret,\" the lowest level of classification. However, none of the three had a letterhead, a maid or a cover page that indicated more that the e-mail contained classified information. Although there was a \" (c)\" before the paragraphs, this information was not properly confidential because it did not contain a letterhead, FBI Director James Coumi said at the 7 July session before Congress. He said \"reasonable,\" that Clinton probably didn't realize it was classified. On the Clinton side, she told the FBI \"she does not know what \" (c) \" means at the beginning of the paragraphs and speculates that it refers to paragraphs numbered in alphabetical order,\" according to the OIOS report. It also challenged the need to classify these specific paragraphs at all. So it turns out that the three e-mail chains out of 81 contain classified information on Clinton &apos; s e-mail server. What about the other 78? In her statement, Clinton said that the classified material contained an address with \"secret\" and that there was no e-mail with that address. This, however, ignores the possibility of what happened in this case that confidential information is left unteached as a result of a human error. All information to be classified should have an address for proper designation. However, if a person makes a mistake and forgets to include the name after that original identification, the information remains confidential. \"In that case, the information was confidential, but in the absence of signs, the person receiving the information may not have a realistic way of knowing this fact,\" said Lisa Gottin, Co-Director of the Freedom and National Security Program at Brennan Center for Justice. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On 11 January 2021, \"classification\" is not an inherent or obvious situation. She said he was an actress.\" \"This act is meaningless if it is not passed on to others.\" Kumi said it was understandable that Clinton did not realize that some of this unmarked information was confidential. However, he also said that she had to admit through the discussion that some of these e-mails did not belong to a non-confidential system, since 36 of these e-mail chains had \"secret\" information and 8 had \"very confidential\" information. \"There is evidence to support the conclusion that any reasonable person in the position of Minister Clinton or those with whom she met on the issues should have known that the non-confidential regime was not a place for that conversation,\" Kumi said in a statement he made on 5 July. For example, some of these e-mail discussions touched on the CIA's drone programme. Members of Clinton staff told the FBI that some of this supposedly confidential information relating to drones had already been disclosed to the public in news reports. Clinton regularly treats confidential information as Foreign Minister. She had looked at confidential information in a hard copy in her office and had used other safe channels when travelling. Some of the e-mails that have now been announced show that the Clinton team is actually discussing how they could not send confidential information to each other via a private server and instead had to move the conversation to a more appropriate place. In the end, Komi said that the Department of Justice should not prosecute Clinton because there was insufficient evidence that it had deliberately abused classified information, nor did the investigators find large amounts of open confidential material. Many transparency experts say that the Government is systematically overclassifying, such as the classification of information that in fact does not harm national security if released. This is probably the case with Clinton's e-mails, as Thomas Blanton, Director of the National Security Archives at George Washington University, said, prefers a lower rating. \"The point is there is no objective criterion for classification,\" said Planton. \"Very little of what is classified will be considered to be so by all experienced observers.\" Our rule said Clinton: \"The classified material contains an address that says, \"Too secret, secret, secret.\" Nothing, I repeat, this is what was verified in the reports of the Department of Justice, and none of the e-mails that I sent or received were such an address.\" In order to be properly classified, the information must contain a header. Clinton was right that nothing in her e-mail had a header indicating the status of her classification. Three e-mail chains have \"C\" that refer to \"secret\" information, but this is not enough to consider e-mail as properly marked confidentially. However, this does not mean that there was no confidential information in her e-mail. If someone has identified information that must be confidential, it is technically still confidential even if someone neglects to name it below the line. The FBI found 81 e-mail series containing information determined to be confidential, although none of the information was properly tagged, so it was not necessarily clear to the recipients. The exact Clinton statement is precise but requires additional information. So, we assess her claim mostly correct. :: Editor &apos; s observation: The original version of fact-checking has been completed by defining half of the truth.
