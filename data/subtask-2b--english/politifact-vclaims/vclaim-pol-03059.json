Obamacare, have been met with concerns about whether health insurance will still offer comprehensive coverage under new rules.\nBut U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio says Florida law mandates that insurers cover more essential health benefits than the federal law.\n\"In Florida, essential health benefits aren't just what the federal government requires, it is what state law requires,\" Rubio said on Facebook Live July 20.\nThen he continued \"under state law, in order to sell insurance in Florida, there are over 40 separate individual conditions that must be covered. In essence, you cannot sell a health care plan in Florida if you don't cover these things -- far beyond the essential health benefits included in Obamacare. Irrespective of what we do in federal law, we still have to follow the state law, and these plans will still have to go through the state. My point is much of what health insurance in Florida will look like will be determined by the state Legislature. That\u2019s the way it should be.\"\nIn Florida, are insurers required to cover more conditions than under President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation? A reader emailed the Truth-O-Meter and asked us to check it out, so we did.\nRubio has a point -- Florida did have a long list of health care mandates before the federal law passed in 2010.\nBut multiple experts told us that comparing the number of state mandates to the number of essential health benefits in the federal law is not an apples-to-apples comparison. In some ways, the federal protections are more sweeping.\u00a0Understanding what the laws say about coverage requires reading the fine print.\nFederal law requires coverage of 10 categories of essential health benefits\nPrior to the Affordable Care Act, every state had its own mandates. Some states had a longer list of mandates than others -- Florida\u2019s list of mandates was long, said Timothy Jost, emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law and a supporter of the federal law.\nThe Affordable Care Act took a different approach: It set 10 coverage \"essential health benefit\" categories for plans sold on the individual and small group markets nationwide.\nThe categories were:\nAmbulatory patient services;\nEmergency services;\nHospitalization;\nMaternity and newborn care;\nMental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment;\nPrescription drugs;\nRehabilitative and habilitative services and devices;\nLaboratory services;\nPreventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and,\nPediatric services, including oral and vision care.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal law is a minimum standard -- states are allowed to provide greater benefits. For example, Florida law requires coverage of adult student dependents until age 30, with some caveats, while the federal law only requires such coverage until age 26.\nThe 10 categories were intentionally broad so states could have flexibility to apply them. As part of the federal law, each state sets a benchmark plan which defines the essential health benefits.\nWhile the federal law sets 10 broad categories, Florida lists specific benefits.\nThe Florida Office of Insurance Regulation directed PolitiFact to the benchmark plan, a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan which shows about 34 covered benefits. The first thing we noticed is that the list of benefits has some overlap, so it doesn\u2019t mean that the 34 benefits are three times more than the broader 10 required categories in the federal law.\nFor example, in the federal law, mental health and substance use is one category, but in the Florida benchmark plan, that\u2019s broken down into four benefits for inpatient and outpatient mental health and substance abuse.\nA spokesman for Rubio sent us a chart showing about 50 mandates and their accompanying state statutes. About half of the statutes related to health conditions or procedures such as newborn hearing screening, emergency room services and a mastectomy. The remainder were related to covering services by certain health providers, such as acupuncturists, or types of people covered such as dependent adult children.\nIn the laws Rubio cited about providers, many don\u2019t actually require that insurers cover certain services. For example, a statute Rubio cited about massage therapists states that if a policy covers massage, it must cover the services of a person licensed to practice massage if it has been prescribed by a physician.\nBut the numbers alone don\u2019t tell us much about the actual coverage patients receive -- we have to read the fine print to see who would get certain types of coverage under Florida\u2019s laws, said Justin Giovannelli, an expert at Georgetown University\u2019s Health Policy Institute.\nFor example, Rubio\u2019s list references laws on substance abuse and mental health treatment, but state laws don\u2019t require coverage for those services for the individual market. However, since the federal law supersedes state law, the Obamacare plans must cover those services.\nRubio also cited a Florida law about maternity care. That statute isn\u2019t a blanket requirement that insurers cover maternity care. Instead, it contains a few provisions that explain if a policy provides maternity care, here are the particular requirements -- for example, it must cover post-delivery services.\nOnce the federal law defined maternity care as an essential health benefit, then all individual plans had to include coverage for that benefit -- regardless of existing state laws. (Before the law, some consumers purchased riders.)\n\"So whereas the ACA requires an insurer in the individual market in Florida to offer coverage that includes these benefits, if the ACA went away, an insurer would not be obligated by federal or state law to provide coverage of these benefits,\" Giovannelli said.\nJoe Antos, a health expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says it\u2019s not surprising that Florida law lists more than 10 benefits.\n\"The tradition among insurance commissioners in most states is to be more precise about what has to be covered,\" he said.\nBut comparing the number of state benefits with the ACA\u2019s required essential health benefits isn\u2019t the point, he said.\n\"The number really doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is, what is the economic impact on the premiums?\" he said. \"When most people talk about this, they seem to think there are huge savings from cutting out things like maternity coverage and mental health. The reality is maternity coverage is very small percentage of the total for a comprehensive plan. Mental health would be expensive, but Medicaid picks up vast majority of mental health expenses.\"\nRubio has a point about the state legislatures having the power to set health care laws -- something it had before the ACA and will continue to have.\nRichard Cauchi, a health insurance expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said that nearly half of Florida\u2019s health care related laws were enacted before 1989 and only six in the last 10 years.\nThe federal health care law has had a role in expanding the types of conditions covered in Florida. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, Florida Blue added pediatric services for dental, vision and habilitative services, said Doug Bartel, Florida Blue spokesman.\nOur ruling\nRubio said, \"In order to sell insurance in Florida there are over 40 separate individual conditions that must be covered. ... far beyond the essential health benefits included in Obamacare.\"\nRubio\u2019s spokesman pointed to a list of about 50 state mandates, about half of which pertained to health conditions. But many of the state mandates only apply if an insurer chooses to cover a condition. The federal protections are more sweeping and put more requirements on insurers to cover a broad range of services.\nRubio\u2019s comparison omits that state laws alone would leave Floridians on the individual market without certain types of coverage that are mandated by the federal law. He also ignores that state categories are defined more narrowly.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-07-27 18:41:26 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"In order to sell insurance in Florida there are over 40 separate individual conditions that must be covered. ... far beyond the essential health benefits included in Obamacare.\"    Marco Rubio U.S. Senator    Thursday, July 20, 2017 2017-07-20    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03059"}
