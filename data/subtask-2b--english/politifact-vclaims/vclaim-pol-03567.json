Pepsi recently announced its plans to lay off up to 100 employees over three distribution plants within the city after experiencing a 40 percent dip in sales apparently from the new tax, and Canada Dry Delaware Valley also blamed recent months\u2019 low sales for new layoffs.\nBut the most significant reaction so far comes from Jeffrey Brown, owner of six ShopRite stores in Philadelphia and 10 in the Delaware Valley, who told Philly.com last month that he expected to lose about 300 employees \"voluntarily and through layoffs\" this spring. Two days after the article was published, though, on Fox 29, he ditched the part about layoffs and said he expects some attrition as his stores are forced to cut hours.\n\"There will be some attrition, what happens when people don\u2019t get enough hours, we\u2019re unionized, so it goes by seniority, so when the new people, people that have been with us for like less than a year they get their hours cut. And when it gets cut beyond a certain point it\u2019s not really worth their while to have the job and they start looking for other employment and the ones that don\u2019t, we have to balance the numbers overtime,\" he told Fox 29.\nIt wasn\u2019t clear in that interview whether Brown had just forgotten to mention the layoffs he previously claimed were coming, or if he purposely steered in a different direction.\nBut, in a follow up Philly.com article published Feb. 23, he referenced layoffs again, saying, \"There\u2019s no way of knowing the layoff number, but 280, 300 jobs will be gone one way or the other. If a person quits or goes on unemployment, or I lay them off, the jobs will be gone.\"\nThe city has insisted businesses have been overreacting in their opposition to the tax, noting that the American Beverage Association last year spent over a million dollars in advertisements opposing Mayor Kenney\u2019s plan to tax sugary beverages to pay for Philadelphia children to attend pre-K. Kenney's spokesperson, Lauren Hitt, noted, \"Brown is part of the same industry that spent ten million dollars and made plenty of misleading claims trying to kill the tax last year.\"\nShe also said via e-mail: \"We feel that Philadelphians should be skeptical of any unverifiable numbers that Brown or any other members of the soda industry put out.\"\nMarc Stier, Director of the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, is also skeptical of Brown's claim that there's been a 40 to 50 percent drop in ShopRite's beverage sales, and a 15 percent dip in overall sales. He said he doubts the drop in beverage sales could account for that high a level of overall losses, referencing Progressive Grocer's 2016 Annual Consumers Expenditure Study that shows soda makes up only four percent of nationwide grocery store sales.\nBut John Stanton, a St. Joe\u2019s professor who\u2019s specialized in food marketing for decades, asserts that Brown's numbers make sense. He said it's unlikely shoppers will substitute their sugary beverages with healthier options.\n\"I just think that\u2019s kind of a ridiculous conclusion to draw,\" he said, \"Now, is it possible that someone is going to say, \u2018Let\u2019s buy just two liters of coke?\u2019 It\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to say, \u2018Let\u2019s buy fresh carrots with the money we\u2019re going to save,' because the two liters of coke taxed are going to cost as much as the three liters of coke untaxed, so it\u2019s not like they have a lot of extra money.\"\nHe also says the beverage section is, in general, the most important section for a supermarket. Stores usually display soda and drink products in several areas throughout the store. Their sales tend to make up a large amount of total sales revenue.\nAnd, aside from the profit made when shoppers buy the product, supermarkets also make revenue through promotional allowances. That\u2019s when a distributor (say, Pepsi) pays the store to display its product on an end cap, which is the small, outward facing section on the end of an isle. If shoppers at a supermarket start buying less Pepsi, Pepsi gives the supermarket less money in promotional allowances. So, by selling less of a product like Pepsi, the store not only loses sales revenue, but it sacrifices even more revenue from lost promotional allowances. Soda is generally a common product displayed on end caps and thus often contributes to a store's promotional revenue.\n\"Supermarkets rely on these promotional payments,\" Stanton said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Meleta, a spokesperson for Brown, emphasized that the stores aren't only selling less soda, but they're also selling less of other products the tax covers: some sugary syrups and dairy alternatives like cashew and almond milk.\n\"If all people just stopped buying Coke and Pepsi, we probably would have been fine,\" she said.\nBut, because of the variety of products now taxed, she said the ShopRite stores are losing thousands of customers to stores outside the city, where the same products are now less expensive.\nKenney has insisted sales will rebound to normal levels in time, citing examples from tobacco and liquor taxes, but Stanton objects to that claim, too. He said shoppers are habitual. Once they create a routine, they tend to stick to it.\n\"I have a feeling [Kenney's] not a very good food marketer,\" he said.\nAnd Meleta said though she doesn't know whether sales for beverages not included in the soda tax have increased, if they have, it hasn't leveled out the overall losses.\nThis all explains how the tax may contribute to revenue loss, but what about the discrepancy between layoffs and attrition?\nThough Brown did mention the possibility of layoffs, Meleta said no employees have been laid off. However, there has been up to a 6,000 hour reduction, and up to 300 employees have since left voluntarily, she said.\nStanton said this is a reasonable result of significant decreases in beverage sales. He explained supermarket budgets are driven by revenue. If revenue goes down, there\u2019s very little supermarkets can do other than cut hours. Ultimately, it\u2019s up to management to decide how to distribute hours, whether to decrease hours for a large number of employees or to let some people go in order to pay others a \"livable wage.\"\n\"To me, cutting people\u2019s hours and letting people go, they\u2019re the same thing,\" Stanton added.\nOur Ruling\nWhat we're judging here isn't the possibility of the beverage tax costing ShopRite stores 15 percent of their total sales or whether that necessitates substantially cutting hours. We're just checking to see if Brown has remained consistent in his explanation of how he is losing employees.\nThough Brown has distanced himself from his early use of the word \"layoff,\" a Philly.com article from Feb. 23 directly quotes him using it. He never definitively said layoffs were going to happen, but he mentioned the possibility. And on Fox 29, he didn\u2019t deny the possibility of layoffs, he just didn\u2019t use that word. In both cases his explanation was ambiguous. However, when we reached out to Brown to clarify his statements, a spokeswoman for him, Karen Meleta, said he had not made any reference to possibly laying off employees, and that there have been no layoffs to date.\nSo, even if the tax is responsible for reduced profits in Brown's supermarket, causing him to have to cut hours and lose employees, he has clearly been inconsistent in citing layoffs or attrition.\nWe rate the claim a Half-Flip.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03567"}
