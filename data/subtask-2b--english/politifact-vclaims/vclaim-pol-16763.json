The program distributes about $260 million a year in family planning grants.\nThe program helps provide patients with cancer screenings, STD testing and annual exams for women, but it does not fund abortion care.\nInstead of complying with the new rules, Planned Parenthood decided to pull out of the federal program, saying that forcing Title X providers to stop referring abortions would be unfair to patients and limit their access to reproductive health options.\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization operating out of Washington D.C. and New York City that studies and advocates for the advancement of sexual and reproductive health and rights, Title X-funded providers serve about 3.8 million contraceptive clients.\u00a0\nOf that group, 1.6 million are served by Planned Parenthood centers.\u00a0\nThe claim\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked for backup, Pocan spokesman Conor McCabe told us the congressman took the 79% figure from a Planned Parenthood graphic.\nPlanned Parenthood told us the Wisconsin statistics came from the Democratic staff of the U.S. Senate\u2019s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee.\u00a0\nAccording to that research, there were 19 Title-X funded sites -- not limited to Planned Parenthood -- operating in Wisconsin in 2015. Collectively, the sites provided contraceptive care to nearly 31,000 women across the state.\u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood health centers served 79 percent of these women.\u00a0\nThat does not exactly close the case, however.\nPocan\u2019s claim said those patients rely on Planned Parenthood \"for their basic health care.\"\nThat brings to mind such things as annual check-ups and flu shots.\u00a0\nBut Title X doesn\u2019t cover any of that, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The money is strictly for reproductive health care.\u00a0\n\"Title X funds only cover services that prevent or help to achieve pregnancy,\" said Mia Heck, director of external affairs at HHS.\u00a0\nAmong the services covered: birth control, STD screenings, emergency contraception, breast exams, cervical cancer screenings and abortions.\nOne can argue those are considered basic care when it comes to reproductive issues. But Pocan\u2019s tweet used it more broadly, which was misleading.\nTo be sure, Planned Parenthood does provide more general health care. Among the things it offers, according to its website: physicals, anemia testing and screenings for colon cancer, diabetes and cholesterol levels.\nCertainly some Title X patients may get general care at Planned Parenthood clinics. But that care is not paid for by Title X, as Pocan suggests.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nPocan said \"In WI, over 79% of Title X patients rely on Planned Parenthood for their basic health care.\"\nWe found these numbers match data collected for a U.S. Senate committee, and used by Planned Parenthood itself. But Pocan\u2019s claim was a bit off by framing the debate around \"basic health care.\"\nTitle X funds are limited to reproductive health care issues, not such things as physicals, flu shots and other general matters for which people might see a doctor.\nOur definition for Mostly True is: \"The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\"\u00a0\nThat fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16763"}
