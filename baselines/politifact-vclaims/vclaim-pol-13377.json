John Kasich says the state \"just clawed back about $900,000\" in development aid", "text": "Gov. John Kasich can\u2019t seem to stop talking about JobsOhio, his new private economic-development corporation that replaced part of the state Department of Development. He gives the department a lot of stage time when he\u2019s promoting his budget plan.\n\nAnd Kasich heaps praise on the JobsOhio architect and Silicon Valley venture capitalist Mark Kvamme (pronounced KWAH-me), who is working for $1 a year. Kasich refers to him as \"The Great Kvamme\" and introduces his presentations as \"Kvamme Time.\" (Kasich moved Kvamme into a new position March 18 to avoid a legal challenge stemming from Kvamme\u2019s out-of-state residency.)\n\nIn his State of the State speech on March 8, Kasich said \"Mark Kvamme just clawed back about $900,000 from companies that made promises and they didn't keep them.\"\n\nThe governor\u2019s claim about efforts to recoup money got PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s attention, given that the state\u2019s budget is tight as a drum. So we invested some time in his statement.\n\nKasich is referring to state\u2019s efforts to recoup portions of aid packages the Department of Development gives companies that agree to locate, expand or remain in the Buckeye State.\n\nThe department, for example, just gave American Greetings a package of grants, loans and tax rebates worth a maximum $93.5 million over 15 years.\n\nLike any deal, this one has strings. American Greetings promises to stay in Ohio and keep the equivalent of 1,750 full-time jobs at its headquarters. If the card maker falls short, the state can recoup a portion of its aid package.\n\n\"We're not going to give taxpayers' money to people who are not going to keep their promise,\" Kasich said during his speech. \"We're going after the money. That's the way it ought to be.\"\n\nWhen Kvamme started in January, he sent out what the department informally refers to as \"clawback\" notices to 11 companies that received state aid but haven\u2019t lived up to their end of the deal.\n\nSpecifically, Kvamme is trying to recoup from these companies all or portions of \"rapid outreach grants,\" which are used for infrastructure improvements, including water, sewer, road, and rail improvements on or near a company\u2019s property. The state is after a total of $900,312.\n\nLeedsworld Inc. of Warren, which makes promotional business products, received a $250,000 rapid outreach grant. But state is trying to clawback \u00a0$162,875 from the company, which fell short of its job creation goal by 65 percent. The company is out of business.\n\nThe state also wants back an entire rapid outreach grant worth $250,000 that went to Haden Prism, a paint shop in Toledo that worked with DaimlerChrysler. Haden Prism sought bankruptcy protection in federal court.\n\nSo, with this background in mind, let\u2019s circle back to Kasich\u2019s State of the State claim and evaluate it on the Truth-Meter.\n\nKasich said Kvamme \"just clawed back about $900,000 from companies.\"\n\nWe think the average listener would get the impression that the state has recouped $900,000 and not understand that Ohio has only begun an effort to chase a refund. Kvamme\u2019s actions started a specific process that began with the notices he sent in January to those 11 companies.\n\nThe distinction is important because not a penny of the $900,000 target is in hand and it\u2019s difficult to predict how much the state might ever recover.\n\nFor example, Leedsworld went out of business in 2009 and Haden declared bankruptcy in 2006, making it challenge for the state to get money from either company.\n\nAt the moment, the Department of Development does not have a statistic to reflect its success rate in recovering money. Department spokewoman Bethany McCorkle said that because of the individual nature of each deal and company, the department can\u2019t predict how much money it can recover or when.\n\nIn interviews, Kvamme has been more precise than Kasich on the clawbacks, specifying the state is just beginning to chase the money. He also makes the larger point that the new administration is trying to be more aggressive than past ones in recouping money.\n\nBut it was Kasich who delivered the State of the State address and the clawback claim.\n\nHis words -- \"just clawed back about $900,000\" -- do contain some element of truth. \u00a0And we\u2019re assuming here that he\u2019s referring to the specific process by which the state sends clawback notices to companies that have not lived up to their agreements.\n\nBut Kasich spoke in the past tense, as if it was a completed action. And he gave no hint that the process just underway with no guarantee of what can be recovered. Those details might have lessened the dramatic flair of his address, but are important for the listener to fully understand his statement.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter we rate his claim as Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13377"}
