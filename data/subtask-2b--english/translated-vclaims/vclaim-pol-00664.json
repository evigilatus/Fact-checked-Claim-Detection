Ron Johnson, a long-time businessman himself, joined the choir by tweeting 6 May 2019: \"99.4% of the business in Wisconsin is small business,\" books of the Republic of Wisconsin. \"This week, we celebrate 1.2 million people in Wisconsin who work in small businesses - almost half our workforce.\" In a manufacturing country multiplied by a lot of physically imposed buildings, do we really have a lot of small businesses? Let's work on it. According to the Federal Bureau of Figures Johnson, statistics come from an official file of the United States Small Business Administration. 99.4% of businesses in Wisconsin are small businesses. This week, we celebrate 1.2 million people in Wisconsin who work in small businesses... almost half of our workforce. The important observation here is that the Agency's definition of \"small\" business is rather large. The classification according to federal standards varies according to industry, but the German Business Authority generally considers that any business in which less than 500 employees are employed falls into the category of \"small.\" In Wisconsin, 99.4% of businesses already have less than 500 employees, according to the 2019 Small Business Profile of the Supreme Bar Association Advocacy Office.

According to Johnson's tweet, SBA reports those small companies employ 49.9% of all workers in Wisconsin. However, the report puts the account at $1.3 million, not 1.2 million Johnson. Of course, this ratio will fall significantly with a smaller definition of \"small.\" Companies with fewer than 20 employees accounted for about 500,000 jobs in 2016, representing about 20 per cent of the State workforce. Does that make Wisconsin a great state for small businesses? None of this speaks of whether Wisconsin is a good country for small businesses. The Kaufman Entrepreneurship Indicators address this task to some extent, using a variety of data sets to measure the rate of new entrepreneurs in each state, and the number of new businesses starting because of opportunities (i.e., the number of new businesses starting because of opportunities). If the owner comes from unemployment or other employment), the jobs created by new businesses and the percentage of new businesses that survive their first year. Through all these measures, Wisconsin ranked 46th among 50 states and Washington, D.C., in 2017. This rose from death in 2016 but is still the fourth consecutive year at the bottom of the ten. This is only one of the many potential indicators of the state trading climate, based on surveys and data analysis. Some are more positive in Wisconsin, but most place Wisconsin on average or below. That drove then Gov. Scott Walker was often miscalculated in 2017 to select the most glowing of the latest results of the Wisconsin claim was the top 10 states of business. Johnson's ruling tweet says that small businesses are important in Wisconsin, where they account for more than 99% of all businesses and half of all employment. This allegation - based on the federal definition of \"small\" businesses - is in line with the latest data. We're assessing his statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00664"}
