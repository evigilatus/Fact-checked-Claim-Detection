Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall, in 2006 or so, \"he said. \"Now, she hasn't done anything, so naturally the wall hasn't been built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.\" Clinton, referring to her time as a member of the United States Senate from New York, replied that she had voted in favour of border security, which she said contained a wall in \"some limited places\" but also measures such as new technology. So, does Clinton support the kind of wall Trump wants? The National Company Polyte Fact studied how Trump plans to build and pay for the wall. Trump says that the wall can cost $8 to $12 billion, it can be made of ready concrete, and it goes up to 35 to 40 feet, 50 feet, or higher. He said that the wall did not need to run about 2,000 miles from the border, but about 1,000 miles from natural barriers. As Tramp suggested in the debate, Clinton voted in favour of a barrier. However, this has not been as supportive as it is. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" As mentioned earlier, the Trump campaign cited Clinton's vote in favour of the Public Security Act 2006, signed into law by President George W. Bush, which authorized the installation of some 700 miles of fences along the country's southern border, along with other security measures. This was the beginning of an attempt at comprehensive migration reform. It is therefore fair to say that Clinton supported a barrier. For our purposes, the differences between the wall and the fence in this claim are not significant - both barriers. But the fence supported by Clinton is not as extensive as the Trump Wall promotes. In its formulation, Trump is equal to both. The Associated Press Agency stated that the fence, which is largely located in urban areas, is not the kind of hard wall that Trump has pledged to build at Mexico's expense. The fence has gaps and gates for miles and are built to allow landowners access to their property on the southern side of the fence. Migrants are known to travel around the fence. In fact, Trump himself said the duel \"was such a small wall, such a wall was nothing.\" Our evaluation of Trump said that Clinton wanted the wall. Clinton voted in 2006 for 700 miles of duel along the United States-Mexico border, but not for the longer and longer concrete wall it undertakes to build. The statement is partially accurate but out of context. We evaluate his statement half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/95d8bd7c-ee9-4f37-a7c9-e003d18a8316", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04095"}
