Not a lot of words.", "text": "As President Donald Trump was preparing to celebrate in Washington on July 4, with the appearance of tanks and other weapons, some social media users were retreating by sharing the image of one of Trump's ancestors as President, former General Dwight D. Eisenhower. An article published on the Internet showed a picture of Eisenhower with the following address: \"When the United States was asked whether it should have a military parade to show its strength, this was President Eisenhower's response: \"Sure not. We are the outstanding force on the ground. In order to try to imitate what the Soviets are doing in the red square, it would make us look weak. \"A reader who saw the article asked us to check it. At least since early 2018, when Trump's idea of a military parade in the country's capital was reported to Snoops.com at the time. The fact-finding site observed that it was in fact a quote from the historian Michael Pichlos, the author of the book \"The Presidents of War,\" in an interview with NPR \"All Things Considered\" on February 7, 2018. Beechlos was expressing Eisenhower's feelings about military marches, but he did not quote him directly. While Eisenhower did not fight with marches after major military victories and while some military equipment was present at his inauguration in 1953, \"there was a military parade without the end of a war, an opening or a major cause in Washington, D.C., this is our tradition.\" The report of the National People &apos; s Party (NPP) continued: Pichlos refers to the 1950s, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was President, and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev presided over major military reviews showing the latest events in the Soviet military force. The Beechlos say that some in the White House approached Eisenhower, himself a decorated military general, suggesting that the United States would do the same thing, and he said, Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook article Nancy Belusi, no longer Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021 \"Eisenhower surely said no, we are the outstanding force on the ground,\" says Pichlos, referring to Eisenhower's response. \"To try to imitate what the Soviets are doing in the red square, it'll make us look weak.\" Samantha Kenner, Director of Communications at the Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum, and the Boys' House in Abilene, said it was. But William E. Hitchcock, a historian from the University of Virginia and author of the film \"The Eisenhower Age: America and the World in the 1950s,\" told Paulette Fuckett that views were consistent with those of Eisenhower. Lance Ganda, a military historian at Cameron University, agreed. \"The feeling is certainly consistent with everything we know about him,\" said Janda. \"He was, after all, the president who cut off famous defence spending, warned of a military industrial complex, and preferred covert operations over the public use of military force. Nor was it booby-trapped or huge.\" Janda referred to a passage in Eisenhower's speech on April 16, 1953 \"A chance for peace.\" \"The cost of one of the modern heavy bombs is: Modern Top School in over 30 cities. They are power plants, each serving a city with a population of 60,000. It's a well-equipped and well-equipped hospital. It's 50 miles from the concrete pier. We're paying for one fighter plane with half a million mules of wheat. We pay one destroyer with new houses that could have accommodated over 8,000 people.\" And Chester Buck, historian of Ohio University and co-author of Dwight D. Eisenhower's presidency, told Snoops that he agreed that Eisenhower had a weak view of the idea of a show like Tramp's. Our judgment A told us that when asked whether the United States should have a military parade \"to appear outside its power,\" Eisenhower said, \"Sure not. We are the outstanding force on the ground. For us to try to imitate what the Soviets are doing in the red square will make us look weak.\" The Eisenhower Presidential Library, among other experts, failed to find any occasion when Eisenhower spoke these words. However, this passage stems from the wording of the Eisenhower's views by the historian Michael Beechloss. Several historians told us that the Bichlos summary is consistent with their own understanding of Eisenhower's views. We evaluate the statement half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00463"}
