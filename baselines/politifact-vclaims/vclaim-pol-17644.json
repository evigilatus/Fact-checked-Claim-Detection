He fled China in 2014 in anticipation of corruption charges from the Communist Party. Since then, Wengui, who is a member of President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, has become known for his outspoken criticism of Chinese efforts to weed out corruption.\nG News is the media arm of Guo Media, a company linked to Wengui. Axios reported in October that the company paid Bannon, Trump\u2019s former chief strategist and former executive chairman of Breitbart News, at least $1 million for \"strategic consulting services.\" Both Bannon and Wengui have their own sections on G News.\nWe could find no other media reports that corroborate G News\u2019 story about the source of the coronavirus.\nThere is a lab near Wuhan that deals with dangerous pathogens \u2014\u00a0and some have linked it to China\u2019s biological warfare program. The country denies having such a program, but the U.S. State Department has raised concerns about China\u2019s potential noncompliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, which bans the production of such weapons.\nOfficials are still working to determine the source of the coronavirus outbreak. In its most recent situation summary, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that both it and Chinese authorities had isolated the genome of the 2019 coronavirus.\nTheir findings suggest \"a likely single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus.\" The disease appears to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, and it spread from there to several Asian countries, Australia, France, Canada and the United States. Researchers believe the current outbreak pattern suggests the coronavirus may have spread from animal to human at first, and now from human to human.\u00a0\nG News\u2019 story is inaccurate.
