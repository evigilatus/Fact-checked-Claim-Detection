Her comments referenced an article in the Washington Times, a conservative newspaper.\nTrump has made repeated claims about massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we\u2019ve debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again (and we debunked a claim by his spokesman Sean Spicer).\nThe claim made on Fox and Friends is based on an extrapolation of a controversial study that relied on a very small number of responses. Researchers involved in the underlying survey of voters have cautioned against using their data to reach conclusions about noncitizen voters.\nStudy about the 2008 election\nWe emailed a spokeswoman for Fox News and did not get a reply; however, the Washington Times article showed that the information came from Just Facts, a think tank that describes itself as conservative/libertarian and was founded by James D. Agresti, a mechanical engineer in New Jersey.\nAgresti\u2019s conclusions are based on data from a paper by Old Dominion University researchers who used data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, or CCES.\u00a0He multiplied the findings in that data with U.S. Census Bureau estimates of the noncitizen population to come up with a conclusion about the number of noncitizen voters nationwide.\nIt\u2019s important to note that the CCES researchers have disputed the conclusions Old Dominion researchers reached about noncitizen voters.\nHere\u2019s how the studies unfolded: In 2008, the CCES surveyed 32,800 adults nationwide online about their political views. Respondents answered at least 100 questions before they made it to the citizenship question, one of the last questions asked.\nThe survey showed that 339 identified themselves as noncitizens -- about 1 percent of the total respondents. Then of the 339 self-identified noncitizens, 39 of those claim to have voted, said Brian Schaffner, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, one of the main researchers.\nThat\u2019s 39 respondents out of 32,800 people who are now being used to extrapolate millions of illegal voters. Schaffner has warned that with a subset that small, the responses might be unreliable.\n\"Survey respondents occasionally select the wrong response by accident\u2014perhaps because they are rushing through and not reading the questions carefully, because they do not fully understand the terminology being used, or because they simply click on the wrong box on the page,\" Schaffner wrote in a Politico magazine article after the November election.\nSubsequent CCES surveys provide more evidence that some respondents answered the question wrong. There were 20 respondents who identified themselves as citizens in 2010 but then in 2012 changed their answers to indicate that they were noncitizens, which Schaffer said is \"highly unrealistic.\"\nIn 2014, researchers at\u00a0Old Dominion University used the CCES data in 2008 and 2010, as well as voter records in 2008, to conclude that more than 14 percent of noncitizens indicated that they were registered to vote. Their best guess at the portion of noncitizens who voted was about 6.4 percent, or 1.2 million votes cast.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers at CCES (including Schaffner; Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard political scientist; and\u00a0Samantha Luks, managing director of scientific research\u00a0at YouGov)\u00a0have criticized the methodology used by Old Dominion.\nThey said it didn\u2019t fully consider the possibility that people responded to the survey inaccurately.\n\"You are ignoring the measurement error in a very small group which is going to inflate those numbers,\" Schaffner said,\u00a0\"then you assume this is a random sample of all noncitizens in the country, which it probably isn\u2019t.\"\nMore than 100 political scientists\u00a0from universities and colleges wrote an open letter in January disputing the Old Dominion paper as evidence for Trump\u2019s claim that millions of noncitizens voted.\n\"In a survey as large as the CCES, even a small rate of response error (where people incorrectly mark the wrong item on a survey) can lead to incorrect conclusions,\" they wrote. \"The scholarly political science community has generally rejected the findings in the Richman et al. study and we believe it should not be cited or used in any debate over fraudulent voting.\"\nJesse Richman, one of the Old Dominion researchers and a political science professor, told PolitiFact he still stands by his research and responded to the criticisms by CCES researchers in a working paper in February.\nAgresti of Just Facts, the source of the numbers cited on Fox and Friends, used the same data from CCES and Old Dominion and concluded that between 594,000 to 5.7 million noncitizens voted illegally in the 2008 election. Agresti said his number on the high end of his range was higher than Old Dominion because he used different methodology in his calculations.\nOther research has found small numbers of noncitizen voters\nSetting aside surveys, another way to find noncitizen voters is to examine state voter records and compare that with data about immigration status. But states have struggled with attempts to do that. Florida tried before the 2012 election and scrapped the effort amid many errors.\nWe interviewed other election experts:\u00a0Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine; Lorraine Minnite, political science professor at Rutgers University; and Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who has tracked voter fraud allegations since 2000.\nAll three rejected Agresti\u2019s conclusions.\nThere have been some instances of noncitizens voting, but actual evidence has shown small numbers among millions of votes cast nationwide. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who co-chairs Trump\u2019s voter fraud commission, has obtained a total of one conviction for noncitizen voting since 2015.\nNorth Carolina\u2019s 2016 post-election audit showed a few dozen noncitizen voters out of 4.8 million votes cast. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted announced in February that since he took office in 2011, he has identified 126 noncitizens who cast ballots.\nOur ruling\nFox and Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, \"5.7 million -- that\u2019s how many illegal immigrants might have voted\" in 2008.\nThe number comes from a conclusion by Just Facts, a conservative/libertarian think tank. Just Facts\u2019 numbers came from a study by Old Dominion University researchers. That study was based on a survey which showed that 39 people out 32,800 claimed to be noncitizens who had voted.\u00a0Just Facts used data from the study and Census estimates on the noncitizen population to come up with a national figure of noncitizen voters.\nBut other researchers and political scientists have said the small number is not a reliable source of data on noncitizen voters nationwide.\nWe rate this claim False.\n'\n Share the Facts 2017-06-22 19:37:32 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"5.7 million -- that\u2019s how many illegal immigrants might have voted\" in 2008.
