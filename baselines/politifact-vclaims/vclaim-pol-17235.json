Claims of widespread voter fraud across the U.S. have been presented without evidence and led to a string of defeats in court.\nBut this claim carries a particularly noteworthy bit of absurdity \u2014 even if it were 100% true, it would not have altered the Wisconsin election results by a single vote.\nEthan Pease, a temporary employee of a subcontractor, told his story shortly after the election, but it has found renewed life after he appeared at a Dec. 1, 2020, press conference in Arlington, VA, then made appearances on Fox News with Sean Hannity and Fox Business with Lou Dobbs. Trump posted the press conference video on his YouTube channel.\nVarious write-ups of this claim appeared on an array of conservative websites and were widely shared on Facebook. These stories were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\nMany narratives citing Pease connect his claim to improperly counted votes.\nDobbs introduced Pease as a man who \"has come forward charging postal workers backdated 100,000 mail-in ballots so they could be illegally counted.\" The Lutchman Report website said ballots were backdated \"so that the ballots would be counted even if they arrived after the statutory deadline.\"\nBut that\u2019s simply not possible \u2014 the Wisconsin deadline is based on when ballots are received, not postmarked.\nLet\u2019s dig into the details.\nPease\u2019s allegation\nPease\u2019s claim \u2014 sworn to in an affidavit that is being used in a lawsuit\u00a0challenging the election results \u2014 is based on two conversations he had with USPS workers while filling a delivery role around the election.\nPease said he started his job Aug. 26, 2020, as a temporary employee with United Mailing Services, working as a route and box truck driver in the Madison area. His job was to pick up mail and bring it back to UMS, which then sorted it so he could drive the sorted mail to USPS. That mail included ballots housed in separate bins.\nHere\u2019s\u00a0Pease\u2019s description of the interactions the day after the Nov. 3 election.\nNov. 4, I was asked by a senior USPS employee named Monte if I had forgotten any ballots the night before. Monte explained that an order came down from the Wisconsin-Illinois chapter of USPS that 100,000 ballots were missing. Monte then told me that his post office had dispatched employees to look for the missing ballots around 4 a.m., and that only seven or eight were found at UMS. Based on my previous experience and habit of double-checking for ballots, I believed that to be a lie.\nThe following day, Nov. 5, 2020, I had a conversation with a different USPS employee named Rachel, in which she admitted USPS employees were ordered to backdate ballots that were received too late to be lawfully counted.\nAt this point we can\u2019t address the validity of Pease\u2019s claims, though it\u2019s noteworthy they come from a temporary employee of a subcontractor based on his interpretation of conversations, not any direct observation.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe USPS did not immediately respond to an email asking if they are investigating the matter.\nBut we do know this had no impact on the election results.\nNo impact on election results\nThe widely shared social media posts built around Pease generally connect his claims to illegally counting those votes, though Pease never made that claim himself in the press conferences or Fox appearances.\nAnd that connection is fraught with logical impossibilities.\nThe biggest by far is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Wisconsin voting deadline.\nAn array of litigation on absentee ballots in Wisconsin ended Oct. 26 with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling absentee ballots would only be counted if they were returned by Election Day \u2014 upholding previous practice. Democrats and other nonpartisan groups had sought changes allowing ballots to be counted if they were postmarked by Election Day, even if they were received later.\nSo local election workers across the state only counted absentee ballots that were submitted by the time polls closed on Election Day.\nThe entirety of Pease\u2019s allegations involve actions taken Nov. 4 and 5. In terms of the vote tally, it doesn\u2019t matter what USPS employees did with ballots at that point. No election officials were going to count them. And the entire state had already reported its election results (Milwaukee County was last about 4 a.m. Nov. 4)\nIn Madison, where Pease worked, the last election results were reported the night of the election.\nReid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, summed it up this way, addressing Pease\u2019s claims:\n\"In Wisconsin, no ballots received after 8 p.m. on Tuesday, November 3, could be counted, period. It doesn\u2019t matter when they were postmarked. This was extensively litigated in federal courts in the weeks prior to the election and everyone, including the post office, knew that postmarks were immaterial to whether ballots were counted in Wisconsin.\"\nWe should also note that some conspiracy theories online connect the timing of Pease\u2019s comment \u2014 a ballot search at 4 a.m. Nov. 4 \u2014 to the \"vote dump\" claims that allege a jump in votes for Democrat Joe Biden in the wee hours of Nov. 4 is somehow questionable. The vote dump claim has been repeatedly debunked: The increase in votes was simply when the City of Milwaukee finished counting its absentee ballots, which were predictably heavily in Biden\u2019s favor.\nBut the connection is illogical on its face as well. It\u2019s ridiculous to assert a jump in reported votes occurred at the same time employees were searching for ballots across an array of facilities. That supposed correlation leaves no time for ballots to be transported to election officials, verified, counted and added to tallies.\nOur ruling\nAn array of social media posts have seized on statements from a \"whistleblower\" to say the USPS backdated 100K ballots so they could be counted illegally.\nWe can\u2019t yet gauge the validity of the back-dating claims, but we do know it\u2019s ridiculous to say this affected the Wisconsin vote totals.\nAbsentee ballots had to be received by the time polls closed on Election Day to be counted, and all state election results were reported by the early morning hours of Nov. 4. Pease\u2019s claims relate to actions allegedly taken Nov. 4 and 5. Whatever happened to ballots then, no one was going to count and include them.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17235"}
