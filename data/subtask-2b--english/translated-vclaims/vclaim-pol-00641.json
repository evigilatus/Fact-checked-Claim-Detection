Is that right?", "text": "If elected President, Democratic candidate Peto Aurrok said that he would launch a $5 trillion plan to combat climate change and invest in communities already dealing with its impact. In his plan of 29 April, Aur\u00fcrk said: \"climate change disproportionately affects the poor and minority communities throughout the United States and around the world.\" \"Reese is no. One indicator of where there are toxic and contaminated facilities today.\" We have often assessed another false claim in the Orrick plan with regard to the number of people with \"unsafe\" drinking water. This time, we asked if he was right about the race and the placement of toxic facilities. The O'Rourke claim reflects a NAACP statement highlighting environmental and climate issues affecting coloured and low-income communities, drawn from a 2016 editorial in The Nation citing examples of \"environmental racism.\" We asked about six experts to weigh their ranks to help us evaluate the prosecution and the evidence of Aurourke. They said that while different types of studies could produce mixed results, there was research that supported the view of Aurourc. \"There is ample evidence that toxic and polluting facilities are disproportionately located in low-income and color communities,\" said David Koniski, a professor at Indiana University, who is researching environmental justice. The types of facilities reported by Aurourc include coal-fired power plants, hazardous waste dumps and incinerators, oil refineries and chemical manufacturers. \"The vast majority of research indicates that minorities in the United States, especially black and Spanish, are disproportionately burdened with environmental risks of pollution compared to eggs,\" said Jeremy Minnis, a geography and professor at Temple University. Blacks and Spanish in the United States tend to be poorer than whites, so there was some debate as to whether the geographical disparity of these facilities was due to race or socio-economic status, as Menes said. But even when social and economic factors are similar between white and non-white communities, minorities are still more vulnerable to environmental risks, as Paul Mohai, an expert in environmental justice and professor at the University of Michigan, said. Some studies have found that the ethnic composition of neighbours is a stronger indicator than income, real estate value and other socio-economic factors, as Mohai said. These studies have used \"remote\" methods and have studied ethnic and socio-economic differences at the time of setting up facilities. In a study published in 2015, Mohi and Robin Saha, a collaborator at the University of Montana, first discovered a neighbourhood, people with low colours and incomes, or commercial facilities for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. They examined facilities that existed from 1966 to 1995 and the demographic composition of host neighbourhoods close to sitting down and demographic changes after sitting down. \"Our results show that instead of hazardous wastes (treatment, storage and disposal facilities) \"pull\" colored people, already disproportionate and growing populations of colored people seem to be \"pulling\" a new facility,\" their study said. The experts said that the factors analysed with regard to the racial disparity in the location of hazardous facilities included the following: verification of the distinctive facts mentioned by John Kerry on 31 January 2021 in an interview where he said that Hurricane Harvey \"has dropped more water in Houston in five days than in Niagara Falls in one year.\" This general theme has been studied for decades and has produced mixed results, with researchers using different methodologies. A 1995 report by the General Accounting Office of the United States summarized the results of 10 studies focusing mainly on the demographic characteristics of persons living near hazardous waste facilities. (In 2004 the name of the Agency was changed to the Government Accountability Office). The report stated that the findings of the studies differed because researchers used different methodologies, different definitions of \"ethnic minority\" and analysed different types of facilities. GAO Bolivi Fukte told that she was not aware of an updated version of the 1995 report. In September, the Journalist Resource, a website that sponsors scientific studies and reports, published a research group focused on environmental justice. It noted that people most at risk of living near toxic waste sites are often low-income ethnic/ethnic minorities. The summary included mandate-specific studies with different results. A 2000 study on Texas and Louisiana stated that the race was \"not very linked to the hazardous waste site.\" However, the 2009 study on Illinois said, \"Our results support previous research that refers to race, rather than class, was the main indicator of environmental inequality.\" The 2016 editorial in The Nation, referred to by the Aurourke campaign as a guide, was linked to the General Audit Office report of 1983 and studies of 1987 and 2007 by researchers of the United Christian Church. \u2219 (The Church is involved in advocating for racial and social justice.) The Global Assessment Office report focused on hazardous waste landfills in eight south-eastern states and found that blacks represented the majority of the population in three of the four landfill communities. More than a quarter of the population in all four societies receive income below the poverty level, most of which are black. The 1987 study of the United Christian Church stated that race is \"most important\" among the variables tested with respect to the location of commercial hazardous waste facilities. The 2007 study stated that race is still \"a separate expectation\" of the location of the facilities and \"a stronger expectation of income, education and other social and economic indicators.\" Mohai was one of the leading authors of the 2007 study. The 1987 study was \"Simite\" and helped launch the Environmental Justice Movement, as stated by Jill Witzkovsky Hibbs, an environmental justice expert and visiting professor at the University of Buffalo Law School. Our ruling, O'Rourke, said, \"Reese is no.\" One indicator of where there are toxic and contaminated facilities today.\" Several studies indicate that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to live near hazardous waste facilities and other plants. They also found race to be a stronger indicator than other variables, such as income or property value. There is no consensus on the Aurourc claim, but much research and expert reactions support his claim. In all, we assess the statement of Aurourke that it is mostly true.
