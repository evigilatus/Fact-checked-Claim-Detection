He can\u2019t even control his own party and get people together in a room.

It happened after a budget standoff over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.\nBut what did Trump actually say back in 2013?\nWe couldn\u2019t find a match for the quote attributed to Trump, but we did pinpoint similar comments.\nIn a September 2013 Fox & Friends phone interview, Trump blasted Obama for failing to \"get everybody in a room.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you say who gets fired, it always has to be the top. Problems start from the top, and they have to get solved from the top, and the president\u2019s the leader, and he\u2019s got to get everybody in a room, and he\u2019s got to lead. And he doesn\u2019t do that, he doesn\u2019t like doing that, that\u2019s not his strength.\"\nTrump also said that further down in history \"when they talk about the government shutdown, they\u2019re going to be talking about the president of the United States, who the president was at that time. They\u2019re not going to be talking about who was the head of the House, the head the Senate, who\u2019s running things in Washington. So I really think the pressure is on the president.\"\nIn an Oct. 7, 2013, interview with then-Fox News host Greta Van Susteren, Trump criticized Obama for not being a dealmaker during the shutdown.\n\"You have to get everybody in a room. You have to be a leader. The president has to lead. He has to get (the Speaker of the House) and everybody else in a room, and they have to make a deal. You have to be nice and be angry and be wild and cajole and do all sorts of things, but you have to get a deal.\n\"And, unfortunately, he has never been a dealmaker. That wasn't his expertise before he went into politics and it's obviously not his expertise now. But you have to get the people in a room and you have to get a deal.\"\nA few days later, Trump appeared on CNN for an interview with Piers Morgan, repeating that the shutdown meant Obama \"is not leading and not getting people into a room.\"\nTrump also took to Twitter before, during and after the shutdown to voice his opinion, agreeing with users that it would never happen if he were president and that Obama had \"failed to lead.\"\nFACT \u2013 the reason why Americans have to worry about a government shutdown is because Obama refuses to pass a budget.\u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2013\n\nObama has not passed a single budget in 4 years. Democrats don\u2019t even vote them in Congress. He has failed to lead!\u2014 Donald J.
