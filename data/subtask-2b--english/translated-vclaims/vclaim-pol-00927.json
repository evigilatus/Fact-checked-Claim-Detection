A video of a man flying over the grooves and desert with some kind of jet-powered hoverboard bound to his feet. Many people doubt a technical trick, but in fact, it's a real deal. Frankie Zapata is passing through a rocky face in a Facebook video. The Facebook video shows Frankie Zapata, the French skateboarding champion and the flying airmaker. The Zapata web site offers a variety of models, including the aircraft air exhibition, with six small engines, and the UI plane, designed for the U.S. superlight market. Under the federal aviation system, Zapata stated that its device could reach 140 km per hour, or about 87 miles per hour, and the flight could continue from 6 to 10 minutes. Zapata took it to 150 meters (about 500 feet) and believes it can go higher. Although it is alleged that this is \"very easy to learn,\" there is some disappointing news for potential buyers: the site says that now, \"only Frankie Zapata can fly the plane.\" The Guinness Book of Global Records gave Zapata the record for the world &apos; s most remote flight in 2016. Zapata flew more than a mile (7,388 feet sharp) along the coast of Sauset-les-pins in southern France. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021, \"50 metres rose above the surface to try and be tracked by a fleet of boats and jet skis, Frankie, 37, he led a future plane called the aircraft developed by his company Zabata Racing,\" and said the records tracking flyer. The company also has a video from Zapata that waves to the crowd at much lower at the Grand 2018 Award in France. Frankie Zapata shows his flying air at the Grand 2018 Award. The only unprofitable message in Facebook is the headline. It says that Zapata was walking more than 103 miles an hour, which is faster than the company says it's possible. That hardly seems important while he's faking a past. Our Facebook video showed a man flying while standing on a small device, apparently at more than 103 miles an hour. He did, although he's not as fast as the headline claims. We're assessing this mostly right.
