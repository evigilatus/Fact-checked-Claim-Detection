It was confusing for any parent who dared to look at social media at the time. This is because news reports on the challenge warned parents that a ghouls-like personality known as \"Momo\" targets children who do not suspect them online and encourages them to harm themselves. Some stories even included interviews with their parents who said that their children saw this Momo creature on the Internet. But it didn't take long for the news reports to revisit the warnings on the Internet whose legitimate news stories seemed to perpetuate: Did the Momo Challenge Threat carry any atoms of truth? Or is it a scared trick that's becoming viral? We'll cut the road to the chase: it's just noise and deception. These warning points, such as these, have been referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As we did, we couldn't find the same real \"challenge\" on the Internet. The only content we found was the warning signs shared by scared parents, and stories about it. However, groups of parents claim that they, or their children, saw Momo appear. While we couldn't find the challenge on any platform, it didn't mean reinventing copies of the trick that wouldn't appear. Unfortunately, crooks, cyber bullies and copycats are picking up viral trends like these, using them to create a set of challenges of their own. Regardless, there is no evidence that the threat is real. What's Momo's challenge? As you read it, the challenge can take several forms. This is common when viral madness spreads at a rapid rate. Most warnings about Momo show a picture of a Golish character with explosive eyes and dark mixed hair. Momo's scary character is actually a sculpture called Mother Birds, creating a Japanese private archeology company called the Linc Factory, which is not linked to the challenge. The article was presented at a vanilla horror fair in Tokyo in 2016, according to The Atlantic. This article was posted on Instagram A between MIORS (@pen.mirrrors) on Jul 15, 2018 at 9:33am PDT. Further warnings claim that it is the subscriber who initiates contact when searching for the private telephone number on the Internet and then sends a text message or a WatsApp message. Whatever the way the connection is made, it's assumed that the vibrating doll requires viewers to complete the challenges that may include waking up in the middle of the night to hurt themselves or others -- How did it start? Is it real? Momo began as an urban Internet legend in July 2018 and was directed to the media later that month when a newspaper wrote that the game was linked to the suicide of a 12-year-old girl in Buenos Aires. Shortly thereafter, the suicides of a 12-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy in Colombia were also assumed to be linked to this challenge. However, none of these circumstantial reports linking the game to suicide have been substantiated. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021, the challenge came up again in February 17 warnings from one of the parents on Facebook for the town of Wisbedton, England. This warning turned into an article in a local newspaper before it was picked up by national newspapers such as Dili-Mil and Dili-Star. It eventually made its way to more legitimate outlets such as the BBC. As social media warnings doubled, it didn't take long for the viral story to catch up with the news media in the United States. There's a wave of local news stations jumping on the story, inflating it to millions of parents. Media critics and others criticized the coverage, punishing news organizations that produced those irresponsible reports that gave fuel to the trick, which increased parental hysteria. The amazing image of Momo became very well known because of the viral nature of this article, it would not be difficult for a child to tell his parents that they heard or saw Momo. It would not be unusual for a child to report finding the creature frightening. However, this does not mean that the child interacted with Momo online in the way described in these warnings on the Internet. \u25cf What should parents do? It is positive for Momo that he may be an incentive to have a necessary conversation between parents about their children &apos; s use of the Internet and the subjects to which they are exposed on the Internet. The Parental Zone, a London-based organization that seeks to provide parents with the support they need to help their children move safely via the Internet, reports and warnings about the same challenge that could cause children distress. \"It is important for parents to talk to their children about this. The best way to start is to ask a general question whether they've seen anything on the Internet bothering them or worrying them.\" The organization said. \"explain that there are often things happening on the Internet that can be misleading or frightening and that some things are designed to get a lot of attention.\" But Dr. Richard Fred, a psychiatrist for children and adolescents and author of Wired Child, suggests that the conversation should go further. In an e-mail to Politic Fact, Fred said that he would like to see Momo's case trigger more parental insight into the fact that children who spend long periods of time on screens do so at the expense of participating in real-world activities. \"The result of many Momo stories is to tell parents to talk to their children about the content of the problem,\" books. \"So, in essence, I think the issue can become very focused on making content better, while in fact a lot of it is very convincing or potentially addictive to children. In February 27, YouTube said that he had no evidence of challenging videos. Since then, the content has been distorted with the signature of Momo's photo. We want to clarify something about Momo's challenge: we didn't see any recent evidence of videos promoting Momo's YouTube challenge. Videos that encourage harmful and dangerous challenges conflict with our policies. -- YouTube (@YouTube) 27 February 2019 -- any content related to Momo -- means even videos that warn people of Momo -- are now defined on the platform as \"defined by YouTube society as inappropriate or offensive to some audiences.\" If a restricted pattern is placed at the expense of the child, this content will not appear. We warn parents of the \"Momo Challenge,\" saying that he infiltrates children's online programs and encourages them to harm themselves or others. There may now be a copy of this challenge, where electronic or copycat bracelets capture the viral trend, but there is no evidence that this challenge is real and there was no definite link between the game and any deaths. Child psychologists and online safety groups say that the most important thing for parents is to constantly watch their children use the Internet and to communicate frequently about the content that their children face online.
