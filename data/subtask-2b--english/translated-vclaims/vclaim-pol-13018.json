The President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Bill Nelson, and President Barack Obama are criticized by the Republican and former State legislator, Adam Hasner, for creating slow jobs. \"Obama-Nilson is an economic record. Creating jobs... in the slowest post-recession rate since the Great Depression, \"Hassner's tweet on May 23, 2011. Many politicians and experts have talked about \"recovering from unemployment\" -- when the economy recovers but with little job creation. But we wanted to check whether job creation after the recent recession has failed to create jobs after every other recession since the Great Depression. On May 26, Chancellor Hasner Rick Wilson sent us an online article on May 20, USA Today linked to him in tweeting, which states: \"Almost two years after the official start of economic recovery, job creation continues to swing at the slower post-recession rate since the Great Depression. Employment in the country today is 5 per cent less - a loss of 7 million - than when the recession began in December 2007. This is by far the worst job creation performance after any of the recessions of dozens since the 1930s. In the past, an average of 13 months after the recession, the economy recovered. If this were a typical recovery, nearly 10 million people would be working today more than it was when the recession officially ended in June 2009.\" We wanted to do our own job recovery test. First, we got the recession dates back to the Great Depression from the National Bureau of Economic Research, a non-partisan research organization based in Cambridge, Mass. The NBER site contains a table showing the dates of the recession (written as \"max and perigee.\" The \"restriction\" line is the length of every recession. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, there have been 13 recessions since it began in August 1929 and lasted for 43 months, and the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics has data on 12 jobs per month. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 20 January 2021, last recession from December 2007 to June 2009, or 18 months. It should be noted that although Obama may be sentenced by voters to job creation, the recession was under way prior to his election as President in November 2008. We contacted economists to ask them about Hassner's claim. Heidi Sherholds, an economist at the Institute of Economic Policy, a labour-supported liberal think tank in Washington, D.C., did not agree with Hassner's claim about job growth: \"The growth of jobs is not as fast as it can be, but it was wrong. Job growth after the economic recession of the early millennium was slower, and the slowest in the records\" was written in an e-mail. Sherholds sent us a chart prepared on the basis of data from the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics, which on the left side shows the rate of employment growth over 22 months (now 22 months after the end of the recession in 2007) following a recession in the last four recessions: 1981, 1990, 2001 and 2007. The graph shows that the slowest jobs were in the aftermath of the recession in 2001, when the number of employees working in the non-agricultural sector fell by 976,000. Economists had referred to that period as \"recovery from job loss.\" \"You won't find anything slower than a recession in early 2000,\" said Sherholds in an interview. However, in the 22 months following the recession in 2007, the number of staff members increased by 535,000. Sherholds sent more in an e-mail: \"The slow employment opportunities that recovered after the last three recessions were due (to) the slow growth in output caused largely by the fact that they were, to varying degrees, stagnating in the balance sheet. \" (The recession in the Palance newspaper is caused by the bubbles of real estate or financial assets that explode - meaning that people and/or companies have assets that are less valuable than their liabilities, and therefore will choose to repay their debts rather than invest and consume, which slows growth.\" We asked Sherholds about the claim in the United States of America today, the article that Hassner based on tweeting. The article \"The United States of America Today\" cited job losses since the beginning of the recession -- this is not the same \"post-recession rate\" that Hasner referred to, after the recession ended. It is simply two different ways of looking at job loss or growth. \"Recovering wasn't slower,\" said Sherholds about the recent recession. But she agreed that \"from the beginning of the recession, we have more jobs... than any other recession since the Great Depression, that's right.\" We sent the Sherholds scheme to James Sherk from the Conservative Heritage Foundation. He suggested measuring from the beginning of the depression instead of the end in another way. His own scheme was drawn up from the beginning of the recession, which shows that the work picture is worse for the last recession of the previous three years. We texted Nelson Dan McLaughlin to ask for his answer. He did not address the accuracy of Hasner's claim by comparing job creation after recession, but argued that Nelson tried to create jobs, for example, by advocating a high-speed railway in Florida. We sent the Sherholds scheme to Wilson and he answered by e-mail: \"I will not select mysterious economic data: we have quoted an article from the United States of America today on the issue under consideration.\" Hassner said that job creation has been at the slowest post-deflation rate since the Great Depression. The words concern us, and we believe that most readers understand \"post-recession\" as meaning post-recession. On the count of the recession, the recovery of employment in 2001 was slower. And Hassner doesn't give a full picture when this is classified as \"Obama Nelson's economic record\" -- the recession started before Obama was elected president and senator who can't blame him for recovering from jobs more than Hassner, a former state legislator, can blame unemployment in Florida. However, Hasner was out by only one of the 12 stasis. We're mostly assessing this claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13018"}
