Budget.\"", "truth_label": "true", "date": "stated on January 18, 2017 in a senate confirmation hearing:", "title": "How much does the United States contribute to the United Nations?", "text": "The Donald Trump Administration has formulated an executive order that would reduce United States payments to the United Nations by up to 40 per cent. (S) Rob Portman, R. Ohio, highlighted the important role of the United States in the financing of the United Nations during the United Nations confirmation session. Ambassador Nikki Haile \"When all our taxpayers pay about 22 percent of the budget, I think they expect to see an organization that is more efficient, more objective and more in line with our values,\" said Portman in January 18, 2017. \"How do you intend to support the national security interests of the United States, but also to ensure that the United Nations is a more effective body towards promoting a more peaceful and less volatile world?\" The United Nations and United States budget documents show that the Portman figure is correct, and if peacekeeping is included, the percentage increases. The current regular budget of the United Nations requires $5.4 billion over two years. In a formula based on the size of a country &apos; s economy and other factors, the United States share is set at 22 per cent, or about $1.2 billion. Based on the recent Obama administration budget, the United States has provided $1.2 billion to the United Nations over two years, and Portman is right. But this is only for the regular budget of the United Nations. More than a dozen other United Nations agencies and operations are also supported by the United States dollar. The largest peacekeeping operation is peacekeeping operations, which are worth some $7.8 billion this year alone. The United States share of that cost is over 28 per cent, or $2.2 billion. Daniel Greenfield mentioned on July 30, 2015, in an article on the front page, \"Obama spent $7 billion to bring electricity to Africa, failed so badly.\" By John Greenberg: 11 February 2016, the following three United Nations agencies -- almost all within $100 million a year -- are the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). However, the United States provides approximately $3.3 billion per year to finance United Nations activities. A 40 per cent reduction would save taxpayers about $1.3 billion from the current federal budget of US$ 4.1 trillion. The impact on the United Nations will be significant, although the precise impact will depend on how reductions spread. The Governor Portman said that US taxpayers cover 22% of the UN budget. The budgetary documents of the United Nations and the United States confirm this. The percentage of peacekeeping operations is even higher. We're assessing this claim right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/63427eda-6b4a-44f-8a7b-173dcc05f504", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03728"}
