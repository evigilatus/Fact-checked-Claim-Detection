This time It came by way of Oregon Catalyst, a conservative political website and a picture it posted of an Oregon Healthy Kids billboard.\n\nFlying above pictures of healthy kids and their families and physicians is the sentence \"No family earns too much to qualify.\"\n\nSure, the program has been expanded, but could that possibly be true? Or, as Oregon Catalyst poses the question: \"Can anyone explain this? It seems like anyone is entitled to government service whether you need it or not.\"\n\nWe decided to check in with Cathy Kaufmann, manager of the Healthy Kids Office, and see whether it\u2019s true that any family can qualify for the program.\n\n\"Any Oregon family with an uninsured child has a path to Healthy Kids regardless of income,\" she said. However, that insurance may come at a cost that makes it -- for most people -- essentially out of reach.\n\nAny family can get insurance through the Healthy Kids Connect program, Kaufmann explains, but some will pay more than others. Families earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level (about $44,000 a year for a family of four) qualify for free child health care. Families earning between 200 and 300 percent of the federal poverty level (about $66,000 for a family of four -- also Oregon\u2019s median income) qualify for subsidized health care on a sliding scale.\n\nNow for the third category: Those families making more than 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Well, they could still enroll their children through Healthy Kids Connect, but they won\u2019t get any financial break, Kaufmann said. In fact, because the Healthy Kids coverage is so comprehensive -- it covers medical, dental and vision care -- they\u2019ll be paying a pretty high yearly premium. Possibly as much as $3,400, according to a rate sheet posted on the Healthy Kids website.\n\nSo, it seems, the billboard is factually accurate. Any family can qualify, whether they make $1 a year or $1 billion. That said, it seems to us Oregon Healthy Kids could have been more precise in their advertising: Families do have to meet certain income limits to qualify for assistance. We rate this claim Mostly True.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13946"}
