On February 14, the President of Missouri University said, \"Missori is ranked 45th in the state in the financial support per capita for higher education, and @Missori State is the last school in Missouri State. This has to change.\" We wanted to know if those numbers were true. The SMART Chief of Staff directed us to obtain data from the annual report of the Missouri budget project. A Missouri draft budget describes itself as an organization that provides \"independent and objective research and analysis of the State budget and tax issues.\" The Missouri budget submission draws its information from Griffin. Since 1961, Griffin, now housed by Illinois State University, has published data on State tax support for higher education every year. All the organizations we've reached out to use Grepven's data. According to Griffin data, Missouri ranked 45th in State funding for per capita higher education in 2018, 2017 and 2016. This first claim by Smart that Missouri is ranked 45th in the state in the financial support per capita of all higher education facilities was confirmed. Things have actually gotten worse since I mentioned the smart numbers. Mizuri is classified by number. 46 for data 2019 Kim Dansy, Assistant Director of Policy Research of the Institute of Higher Education Policy, said \"President Smart's statement on funding allocations for the University of Massachusetts does not look at all funding for students, and his statement is accurate.\" The International Institute of Higher Education is a non-partisan policy and research centre, \"maintains its resources to government agencies, higher education organizations, philanthropic foundations and others committed to increasing access to and success in post-secondary education.\" However, Dansy proposed an analysis of funding for higher education through full-time enrolment. \"This gives a more accurate view of how State higher education funds are used to serve current students and enhance their success,\" she said. The most recent data available to consider funding for higher education through basic education was from 2017, and data from the State Association of Higher Education Executive Officers show that Missouri ranked 38 out of 50 in the State allocation for all basic education. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \"while Missouri is certainly not the worst in funding every student, it has been constantly declining in this measure over the past three years,\" said Dansy. What about the second part of his claim? In the latter part of his tweet, Smart said Missouri State is the last between Missouri schools. Is Missouri State University ranked last in the State &apos; s individual financial support for higher education? When asked where Smart got his numbers, Debov referred to the annual Higher Education Facts book of the Ministry of Higher Education in Missouri, published in February 2019, but did not include figures from FY2019. In the Fact Book, Missouri State University has the lowest level of State allocation per FTE among public universities for four years in the State. This means that Missouri State University receives the least funding from all state public universities, with $4,225 per student. In comparison, the public university with the largest state funding is Lincoln University, which receives $9,764 per student. The largest university system in the state, Missouri University, receives $7,373 per student. \"By allowing the State of Missouri to decline funding of hundreds of dollars per student behind other universities, the State inadvertently established a system whereby institutions are punished for growing registration and rewarded for declining registration,\" Debov said. \"As student allocations often fluctuate year after year,\" said Dancy, Missouri State University, was among the lowest in the state over the past 10 years. The Missouri State University has a plan to combat low numbers. \"We are working with legislators throughout the state to advocate for the adjustment of equity in the operating funds of the State of Missouri to address this issue,\" said Debov. \"We have seen some success in the early stages of the state budgeting process.\" However, the process had not yet been completed and the University was not sure what the outcome would be. \"But we still hope that the funding gap between Missouri and the next less funded university will be eliminated in the next fiscal year,\" said Debov. The president of Missouri State University, Governor Cliff Smart, said: \"Missouri is ranked 45th in the state's financial support per capita for higher education and @Missouri State is the last time among Missouri schools.\" While the wit did not have the latest figures from FY2019, it was on track with the figures from previous years, Missouri State and Missouri State University show a low ranking compared to other states and similar universities. We're assessing this statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00779"}
