On Meet the Press, NBC correspondent Maria Shriver tried to underscore\u00a0the pivotal economic role mothers play.\n\"Two-thirds of American families rely on the mother's income to stay above the poverty level,\" Shriver told host Chuck Todd, as a graphic highlighted the same message.\nThat\u2019s a powerful message -- that two in three American families would fall below the federal poverty line if it weren't for Mom.\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s incorrect.\nShriver botched the wording of a different stat from the Shriver Report, a regular publication focused largely on the status of women. For the 2014 edition, Shriver partnered with the liberal Center for American Progress.\nThat report claimed that \"In an era when women have solidified their position as half of the U.S. workforce and a whopping two-thirds of the primary or co-breadwinners in American families, the reality is that a third of all American women are living at or near a space we call \u2018the brink of poverty.\u2019 \"\nThat passage may sound like it supports Shriver\u2019s point. But it doesn\u2019t.\nSo what's the real number?\nWe asked Philip Cohen, who researches inequality and families at the University of Maryland, to see if he could\u00a0find the actual\u00a0percentage of families who rely on a mother\u2019s income to stay above the poverty level.\nUsing Census Bureau data from the March 2014 Current Population Survey and comparing it to poverty threshold statistics, Cohen identified 33.6 million U.S. families that included at least one child and a mother. In 6.7 million of those households, the mother\u2019s income was vital in the way Shriver stated.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a shade under 20 percent -- far from two in three.\n\"You could say 20 percent of families with mothers and children rely on the mother\u2019s income to remain above the poverty line,\" Cohen said. \"The rest either were poor already, 16 percent, or still wouldn\u2019t be poor even without the mother\u2019s income, 64 percent, because of income from the father or other family members.\"\nCohen tried a slightly different approach and started just with the families that were not in poverty, which created a pool of 28.2 million households. That\u00a0would boost the percentage of families who rely on a mother\u2019s income to stay out of poverty to about 24 percent.\n\"I don\u2019t see how you can get to 67 percent, or two-thirds, as Shriver said,\" Cohen told us.\nCohen agreed with Shriver\u2019s main point -- that mothers in many families make a huge difference in the family\u2019s standard of living -- but said she got the specific statistic wrong.\nAfter contacting Shriver, she tweeted a correction. Shriver wrote, \"Clarifying what I said on\u00a0@meetthepress: 2/3 of U.S. families rely on a mother's income that keeps many families out of poverty, but not all.\"\nOur ruling\nShriver said that for two-thirds of families with children, the mother\u2019s income keeps them out of poverty. According to an analysis of Census Bureau data, the actual figure is closer to one-fourth. The mother\u2019s income matters, but not to the extent she said.\nAn expert said there was a grain of truth to Shriver\u2019s claim -- a mother\u2019s income makes a big difference in a family\u2019s standard of living -- but not at the percentage Shriver said.\nWe rate her claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06428"}
