(Scott Walker) So taxpayers in Wisconsin (and voters in the next election to the office of Governor) would like to know: does the state government have a deficit, a surplus, or what? The basic budget of Wisconsin is, of course, a two-year document. Therefore, there is no \"budget for 2014,\" as Darling said. However, more than two months after the fiscal year from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015. This is the second half of the 2013-15 budget. These time points are important because the law stipulates that the State budget for the biennium must be balanced. An actual deficit cannot be activated. What has attracted the headlines is the Office's expectation that \"the State's obligation over the year\" - often referred to as the deficit or deficit \"structural\" - is $1.8 billion for the next budget period, 2015-17. This is an estimate of the amount of the budget for the next biennium -- if there are no changes in income or expenditure -- it will be unbalanced. In other words, the shortage is not real red ink. This is now Darling &apos; s claim. Surplus? The Darling Office referred to the Legislative Tax Office's memorandum issued five days before the $1.8 billion memorandum. The Office is a non-partisan agency that the political parties consider to be the gold standard in budgetary matters. The previous note indicates that 2014-15, the second year of the current biennial budget, began on 1 July 2014 with a balance of $443 million. So, it's true that at this moment in time -- the midpoint of the two-year budget -- books in black. However, the same note also presents the budget picture for the second year of the session. That is, it shows what money is expected to come from, and how much it is expected to come out of. It shows that the surplus of $443 million was swallowed and that the State faces a \"income shortfall\" of about $116 million - since its revision to $396 million - by the end of the fiscal year - 30 June 2015. That's because the collection of taxes was less than expected. As we have stated, the State cannot suffer from an actual deficit. Accordingly, the Finance Office stated that the State may need an invoice for budget reform by 30 June 2015 unless revenue is higher than currently anticipated and/or if expenditure is not reduced. Depending on the size of the revenue deficit, it is also possible for Walker's administration to reduce spending - by not filling open positions, for example - enough to eliminate the need for a budget reform bill. Therefore, as of now, the State budget has a surplus of $443 million, but this is expected to become a deficit of $396 million by next June. Today, to $1.8 billion, the \"annual liability\" or deficit estimate for 2015-17, which prompted Darling to submit its claim. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021, $1.8 billion there are two key issues to know about the new figure from the Finance Office: 1. The projected shortfall of $1.8 billion - about 5.8 per cent of the projected expenditure in the State budget for 2015-17 - is a deliberate speculation on future tax collection and demand for services. In large part, deficiencies are due to changes in the amount of funds generated through income and sales taxes, which depend on the economy, among other factors. 2. Human rights and fundamental freedoms. 12 - 17 5 Again, the projection relates not to the current budget cycle, but to the biennium 2015-17. The 2015-17 budget is what the winner of the 4 November 2014 presidential election between Walker and Democratic Mary Burke must devise. Indeed, this shortfall represents an imbalance between current income and expenditure. It assumes that there are no changes in revenue or changes in expenditure - in other words, the continuation of state government operations as they are now. The state's been here before. When Walker took office in January 2011, he faced $2.5 billion in \"a commitment\" or deficit, in addition to an increase of approximately $1.1 billion in requests for funding from government agencies. This amounted to $3.6 billion in \"deficit,\" which Walker addressed through funding cuts and the Collective Bargaining Act 10. Here is the current status: budget period: 2013-15 cycles -- year 1 July 2013-30 June 2014, ended with a surplus of $443 million for 2013-15 years -- year 2 July 2014-30 June 2015, expected to end with a decrease of $116 million (later revised to $396 million) for 2015-17 sessions for 1 July 2015-30 June 2017, expected to begin with a decrease of $1.8 billion. Thanks to the reforms of the Republic, the 2014 budget will begin with a surplus of $443 million.\" The second year of the current budget for 2013 - 2015 - referred to by Darling in the 2014 budget - began with a surplus of $443 million. However, the year is expected to end with a decrease of $396 million, and the next biennium - 2015-17 - is expected to begin with a decrease of $1.8 billion. Darling's statements are partially accurate, but they ignore many contexts. Our assessment is half correct.
