Fiorina later was fired by HP\u2019s board.\nOn Meet the Press Sunday, host Chuck Todd asked Fiorina why she was fired.\nFiorina used the question to list her accomplishments at HP.\n\"What people fail to comment on is the fact we doubled the size of the company, took the growth rate from 2 percent to 9 percent,\" she said. \"We tripled the rate of innovation to 11 patents a day and went from lagging behind to leading in every product category. We grew jobs here in the U.S. and all over the world. You can't just leave those facts out -- they are as vital to the record as the fact that yes, indeed, I had to make tough calls during tough times. Tough times that many technology companies didn't survive at all.\"\nGiven Fiorina\u2019s dismissal and other issues at HP, we were interested in that first claim -- that under her leadership, the company doubled in size.\u00a0\nFiorina's\u00a0claim is not referring to the number of employees (you can read a good primer on that from our archives here). In this case,\u00a0staff at Carly for America (Fiorina\u2019s political action committee) said she was referring to the revenues created by the company.\u00a0By this specific measure, HP did double.\nIn 1999, when Fiorina became CEO, HP\u2019s annual revenue was $42.4 billion, according to annual Securities and Exchange Commission filings. With the exception of a slight dip in 2001 (at the end of the dot-com bubble), revenue increased each year -- to $86.7 billion in 2005, the year she left. That\u2019s a little bit more than double.\nBut that doesn\u2019t tell the entire tale. There are a few critical caveats.\nWhere the growth came from\nWhy such growth? Well, Fiorina spearheaded a major $25 billion acquisition of HP\u2019s rival, Compaq, to increase the company\u2019s share of the personal computer market. The merger was publicly controversial, in part because it tipped HP\u2019s focus toward computers (a tough market) and away from its most successful product, printers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe merger went through, and the company grew. In 2001, the year before the merger, revenue was $45.7 billion, and the Compaq revenue was about $40 billion. In 2003, after the two companies merged, revenue was $73 billion.\nStephen Morrissette, a business professor at the University of Chicago, noted that the fact that so much of the revenue growth was a result of the merger casts some shade on Fiorina\u2019s claim.\n\"Most executives would likely not use the phrasing \u2018doubled the size of the company\u2019 to describe their performance if the increase was all or mostly due to an acquisition,\" Morrissette said.\nDoubled revenues, but not necessarily stronger\nDespite the increased revenue, the HP-Compaq merger led to sluggish stock prices and missed profitability targets. The merger also led to the thousands of firings often cited by Fiorina\u2019s critics. The merger was widely seen as a bust at the time, and it contributed to the HP board\u2019s decision to fire Fiorina. (HP stock value plunged by nearly half during her tenure and rose again after she was fired.)\nHP had $42.4 billion in revenues and $3.1 billion in net earnings in 1999. When Fiorina was ousted in 2005, yes, the company reported $86.7 billion in sales. But that year HP had only $2.4 billion in earnings.\nLastly, the employee head count gets a bit complicated.\u00a0According to SEC filings, HP had 84,400 employees worldwide in 2001, the year before the merger. In 2001, Compaq had 63,700 full-time employees. That comes to a total of 148,100 workers. In 2005, just after her departure, HP's worldwide workforce reached 150,000. That includes acquiring some other companies, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nSome analysts have seen the merger more favorably in recent years, noting that it accomplished Fiorina\u2019s goal of increasing HP\u2019s share of the personal computer market even though Fiorina\u2019s execution failed.\nFiorina \"is taking credit for something she launched and got started,\" Charles House, co-author of The HP Phenomenon, told the San Jose Mercury News in 2011. \"But I think you obviously have to give a hell of a lot of credit to (her successor) for making it successful. I'd be loath to say it would be the same with her there.\"\nOur ruling\nFiorina said that while she was CEO of HP, the size of the company \"doubled.\"\nThat's correct when discussing one specific aspect, revenues, but you could argue that's a bit of a red herring.\u00a0The revenue growth\u00a0was largely thanks\u00a0to a controversial\u00a0merger with Compaq and not organic. Moreover, the new revenue\u00a0did not come with proportional increases to either profits or the number of HP\u00a0jobs.\nFiorina\u2019s figures are accurate, but standing alone, they don\u2019t tell the whole picture.
