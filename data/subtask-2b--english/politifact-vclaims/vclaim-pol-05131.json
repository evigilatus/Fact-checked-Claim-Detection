That\u2019s what fact checkers do.\nShe said she made it up.\n\"I just like the number three, it\u2019s big enough, but small enough,\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s a joke that speaks to a truth.\"\nShe did look up the state\u2019s area, and the length of its coastline and fiddled around with the numbers, but couldn\u2019t get much farther.\n\"I would love to know what it really is,\" she said. \"I\u2019m a math nerd, but non-scientific math.\" \u00a0\nSo we dug in.\nWe quickly discovered this is a tough question, and after tinkering with the Rhode Island Geographic Information System Geospatial Data Catalog for a few hours, we called for backup. \u00a0\nChuck Labash and Michael Bradley, who work at the University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center, say an accurate calculation would require a Ph.d. or master\u2019s-level study into shallow water bathymetry (the science of underwater depth) \u00a0and an analysis of Rhode Island\u2019s tides.\nYou would need to establish what low-tide measurement to use \u2014 Lowest Astronomical Tide, Mean Low Water, or Mean Lower Low Water \u2014 then you\u2019d have to check every point in the state at that designated low tide. \u00a0\nOr, you could commission a light detection and ranging airplane flight and measure all of the state\u2019s shores using lasers and sensors within the span of the average hour-long low tide period.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Bennett\n\n\nstated on January 1, 2013 in a Gov. Lincoln Chafee YouTube video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our numbers are going up at the airport.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy C. Eugene Emery Jr. \u2022 January 10, 2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this would cost \"hundreds of thousands of dollars,\" according to Bradley. We didn\u2019t think our bosses would bankroll that kind of research. \u00a0\nWe turned to Bryan Oakley, a geoscientist who studies glacial, coastal, and marine depositional environments at Eastern Connecticut State University. He was able to give us rough some numbers.\nRhode Island is about 1,000 square miles, if you don\u2019t include the water, as the state does in its \u00a01,214 square mile figure. A 3-percent increase in size would be about 30 square miles, or roughly the size of Cranston. \u00a0\n\"This seems a tad unrealistic to me,\" Oakley said.\nHere\u2019s Oakley\u2019s cocktail-napkin analysis: Rhode Island has 400 miles of coastline. The intertidal zone, or the area on the shore covered at high tide and uncovered at low tide, is at most 50 feet wide. The fluctuation in size between tides is about 3.7 square miles at most, making the state .37 percent bigger at low tide, he said. \u00a0\nThese numbers, he told us, are very rough and his guess is that Rhode Island is about .1 percent bigger at low tide.\nLabash and Bradley agreed. So did Jim Turenne, a soil scientist for the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service.\nOur Ruling: \nOn T-shirts and postcards, Treadwell writes: \"Rhode Island: 3% bigger at low tide.\"\nShe admits making that up.\n\"It\u2019s like I know we\u2019re weird and have problems but hey, we\u2019re still here,\" Treadwell said. \u00a0\nBesides, who would buy a T-shirt saying: \"Rhode Island: 0.1% bigger at low tide?\"\nNevertheless, it\u2019s ruling time and this is certainly a ridiculous (although fanciful) claim.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire! \u00a0(Hilary, there\u2019s a genuine, red-plastic, Pants on Fire! button waiting for you at The Journal.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05131"}
