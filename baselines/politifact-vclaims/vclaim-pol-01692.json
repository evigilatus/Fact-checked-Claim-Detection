Tammy Duckworth added another wrinkle to that criticism by highlighting an implication of the law that hasn\u2019t received as much attention.\n\"If you are a gun store owner and you decide to go out of business\u2014you retire, you don\u2019t want to do this anymore for whatever reason\u2014you right now are allowed to convert your entire gun store inventory to \u2018personal use,\u2019\" Duckworth said. \"And once it is a personal use weapon, you can sell it without background checks.\"\nThe first-term Illinois senator made the comment while expressing her support for federal legislation that would require universal background checks for gun purchases, a policy which polls show more than 80 percent of Americans support.\nThe federal government places few restrictions on private sales by people who aren\u2019t legally considered gun dealers. But could a former gun store owner really sell off the remainder of his or her inventory\u2014a veritable arsenal, potentially\u2014without running afoul of the law?\nThe short answer: Yes, generally speaking. PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as True a similar claim in 2013. The more interesting question is why.\nPrivate sales\nFormer gun dealers who no longer are licensed to sell guns have the same legal right to sell guns as any other private citizen.\nThe federal rules for private sellers state they can\u2019t give or sell a firearm to someone they know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun. They also can\u2019t sell or transport firearms across state lines. But that\u2019s pretty much it\u2014although 19 states have instituted their own background check requirements beyond federal law.\nIllinois, for instance, requires all firearm purchasers to obtain a state permit, which can only be issued after a background check.\nBut when a federally licensed gun dealer sells a gun in any state, the buyer must go through a background check.\nAnd the law says anyone who repeatedly buys and sells guns \"with the principal motive of making a profit\" must obtain such a license from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF. That\u2019s different than occasionally buying and selling guns to enhance or liquidate a collection.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Schneider\n\n\nstated on September 16, 2016 in a campaign tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Dold \"continues to side with his Republican leadership and the NRA in blocking consideration of a bill that would keep firearms out of the hands of people on the terrorist watch list.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Anna Bruzgulis \u2022 October 18, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom business stock to personal collection\nSo how do guns from a retailer\u2019s business inventory wind up in their personal collection?\nFederal rules permit licensed dealers to transfer firearms out of their business inventory and into their personal collection\u2014whether they are planning on leaving the trade or not. If they maintain their license, those weapons must sit in their collection for a year before they can be sold in a private, potentially background check-free transaction.\nIf they let their license lapse or it is revoked, they become just like any other private individual, meaning their property and sales no longer fall under the ATF\u2019s purview\u2014unless, of course, they cross the line by buying and selling in a way that resembles doing business.\nAccording to Mark Jones, project director for the National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence and a former ATF agent, the burden of proof for that crime is high.\n\"It\u2019s a pretty big mountain to climb to go after an FFL (federal firearm licensee) and prove that they\u2019re actually criminally culpable or to go after someone who\u2019s not an FFL but who\u2019s dealing without a license,\" said Jones.\nA particularly striking case from 2006 illustrates that point.\nSanford Abrams, a Maryland gun store owner and National Rifle Association board member, had his license revoked for a litany of violations, including that he couldn\u2019t account for more than a quarter of his inventory. Between 1996 and 2000, 483 guns that were used in crimes were traced back to Abrams\u2019 store, according to a report from the Brady Center.\nYet Abrams maintained he could continue selling off his inventory as part of his personal collection. And in June 2006, the ATF affirmed that he could do so because he would only be acting as a dealer if he repeatedly purchased and resold firearms.\nOur ruling\nDuckworth said former firearms dealers can transfer guns from their inventory into their personal collections, and then sell those guns without background checks.\nFederal law permits gun dealers to transfer inventory to their personal collections, and private gun sales under federal law do not require background checks. Many states, including Illinois, have added their own requirements, though.\nA former dealer\u2014and any other private individual\u2014could still get into trouble by continuing to buy and sell with profit as their main motive rather than enhancing or liquidating their collection. But there\u2019s no definitive legal yardstick\u2014such as the number of guns sold\u2014for determining compliance.\nDuckworth\u2019s statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing. That\u2019s our definition for a statement that\u2019s True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01692"}
