However, regardless of the manner in which the courts rule, some believe that there is already an agreement across the political spectrum that the Trump movement violates the Constitution of the United States. \"There is a consensus between the two parties that this appointment violates the requirement of appointments in the Constitution, which is superior to any law cited by the management lawyers,\" said Rip Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Sometimes politicians use the term \"party consensus\" misleadingly to suggest that policy debate has been preferred, while the battle has in fact begun. That's what Pelosi did here. The appointment of Whitaker, a day after the mid-term elections, replaced former Attorney General Jeff with Whitaker, a lawyer from the Ministry of Justice. There was a legal battle over whether Whitaker, as an unauthorized officer, took up the role legally. (See our story for more details on legal arguments.) The risks of conflict are particularly high because the Attorney General oversees the investigation of Special Advocate Robert Mueller into Russia &apos; s intervention in the 2016 elections and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Whitaker publicly criticized Mueller's probe as too broad. According to the lawyers of the Legal Counsel &apos; s Office of the Ministry of Justice, Whitaker &apos; s appointment is well founded. But some constitutional experts say Trump went over Congress illegally when he lifted Whitaker without confirmation from the Senate. The State of Maryland was the first legal appeal against Whitaker's position in the Federal Court, and three members of the Democratic Senate asked the courts to declare Trump's move in violation of the appointment requirement. - 'Cause I don't know. - 'Cause I don't know. The phrase &quot; bi-party consensus &quot; requires unpacking. Politicians usually use this mark to create the impression that a critical mass from both sides has jointly settled on a unified vision of things, and that there is no serious debate that still exists. We only found one Republican lawman, Sin Jeff Flick of Arizona, who called the appointment unconstitutional. \"You have someone who is not a certain senator in a position to oversee the achievement of the President's campaign just doesn't sit well here,\" said Flick Hill, \"and I don't think it's really consistent with practice and the Constitution.\" The Belusi office also cited examples of manual skiing by other members of the General Democratic Party. A political article sent to us by Republican legislators expressing the hope that Trump would move quickly to fill the top position of the Ministry of Justice with a permanent alternative. But the desire to cast a negative story is not the same as describing the current land as unconstitutional. No inquiries have been sent to the leaders of the Republican Congress requesting their opinion on the constitutionality of the Whitaker appointment. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines to provide security, and told her \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, we did not need to look seriously for examples of Republican legislators defending Trump's choice, contrary to Pelosi's claim. Mr. John Kennedy, R. La, who serves on the Senate Judicial Committee, said, \"The President has the right to inform himself of the advisers he chooses.\" \"In view of the fact that it is the duly elected President of the United States,\" Kennedy CNN said, \"I think we should give the man a chance.\" In follow-up to correspondence with the Belusi office, it appears that its officials confirm that Republican legislators generally do not believe that the Constitution has been violated. \"Mr. Belusi refers to the party consensus of the leading republican legal minds throughout the country, which the radical Republicans ignored, as the Republicans in Congress pointed out, to put a rubber stamp on President Trump's unconstitutional actions,\" said Henry Connelly, spokesman for Belusi. The Belucci office referred to six conservative legal and political commentators who had either argued against or questioned the constitutionality of Whitaker's appointment. For example, they referred us to an interview with Michael Mukassi, who served as Attorney General of the George W. Bush administration. \"The back must be a certain person, in my opinion,\" said Mukasi. But we also found many examples of Republicans who believe that Whitaker's appointment is constitutionally valid. \"I accept the OLC ruling that the appointment of Whitaker is legal although it has not been confirmed in the Senate,\" Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez wrote in an opinion article today in the United States of America that ran after the Pelosi statement. Some constitutional scholars share this view. \"There is a consensus between the two parties that the appointment of Mato Whitaker violates the requirement of appointments in the Constitution,\" said the Governor, Belosi. The so-called \"party consensus\" in Belucci depends on a group of conservative intellectuals who share the view, widely held by Democrats, that Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional. However, the Belucci Office acknowledged that this is not, in general, a widely shared view among Republican legislators. In fact, some Republican legislators and leading legal lights, along with some constitutional scholars, believe that Whitaker's appointment was legal. The claim that there's a misleading \"consensus\" suggests debate about the constitution of Whitaker's appointment is resolved, while in fact the battle is borrowed. We're assessing this statement wrong.
