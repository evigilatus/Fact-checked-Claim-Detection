We have to work on spending.\"\nThe Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projected\u00a0that the\u00a0Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in December, would increase the total deficit over the next 11 years by about $1.9 trillion. According to a\u00a0recent report\u00a0by the the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the budget climbed to $779 billion in the 2018 fiscal year, increasing 17 percent from $666 billion in 2017.\nBacon has a technical point. Tax collection data shows that overall revenues are slightly up. But the significance of this small increase is undermined once you factor in inflation \u2014 and there is strong evidence that tax revenues increased despite the new tax law, not because of it.\nWhat the data shows\nThe data does show that, without adjusting for inflation, tax revenues rose between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 \u2014 but only by 0.4 percent.\nPolitiFact has\u00a0previously reported\u00a0this rise is smaller than\u00a0almost every previous year since World War II, except for a few years in which tax revenues declined, largely due to recessions.\nBut even this small increase disappears once you consider other context \u2014 such as the flourishing economy and an adjustment for inflation.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors shrinking the federal deficit,\u00a0found that\u00a0after adjusting for inflation, tax revenues actually fell by 1.6 percent. (The calculation is for the first 11 months of fiscal 2018, compared to the first 11 months of 2017)\nEven more important, the role of the new tax law in boosting revenues is diminished once you look at the month-by-month data for tax collections.\nThree months in fiscal year 2018 were governed by the old law \u2014 October, November and December. Another two months \u2014 March and April \u2014 were governed by the new law, but were dominated by tax payments for income generated in 2017, and thus was predominantly shaped by the old law. A final month, September, had not produced final data by the time of our article.\nThat leaves six months in which it was the new law that shaped tax payments to the government \u2014 January, February, May, June, July and August.\nAnd if you compare the cumulative collections for those six months in 2017 and 2018, tax collections actually declined by 3.8 percent between 2017 (when the old law was in force) and 2018 (when the new law was in force).\nThe Urban Institute-Brookings Institution\u00a0Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation, told us the key idea is that tax revenues naturally grow with a growing economy.\n\"The economy has been doing well. Revenues, however, haven\u2019t grown as much,\" said Donald Marron, an institute fellow at the Tax Policy Center. \"So the tax cuts reduced revenues relative to what they would have been, just as every serious analyst predicted.\"\nThe Bacon campaign said the congressman was, in fact, referring to the increased individual income tax receipts when he made the statement, not corporate revenues. Broken down, individual tax revenues have gone up, while corporate tax revenues have declined.\nOur ruling\nBacon defended the tax law by dismissing projections that it will add to the deficit, saying that revenues \"are actually up after tax reform.\"\nRevenues did increase by 0.4 percent, but this historically small increase disappears once inflation is factored in. In addition, any causal link between this small revenue growth and the new tax law is dubious, since during the months in which the new law predominated, revenues were actually down.\nThe Bacon campaign told us he meant to say that individual tax revenues have gone up, not revenues overall. Still, he didn\u2019t specify that to viewers. We rate the statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16641"}
