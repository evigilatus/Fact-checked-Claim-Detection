Tammy Baldwin greeted the Obamacare replacement bill -- she calls it \"Trumpcare\" -- with a sharp retort.\nThis was the Wisconsin Democrat\u2019s tweet on March 8, 2017, two days after the unveiling of the the House GOP bill:\n#ReadtheBill & you\u2019ll see #TrumpCare would allow insurance execs to personally make millions off your health care.\nTo be sure, the top executives at five major insurers -- Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealth, Anthem and Humana -- already make millions, with each CEO earning between $10.3 million and $17.3 million in 2015, according to the latest figures.\nCould the CEOs make millions more as a result of the GOP bill?\nThere would be an opportunity for that: A proposed tax break in the bill connected to executive compensation would be worth millions of dollars to the health insurers.\nBut the tax break would go to corporations, not personally to the executives.\nAnd Baldwin\u2019s claim assumes the corporations would give millions of dollars in raises to the executives.\nA tax deduction change\nBaldwin\u2019s attack centers on a provision of the bill, which is supported by President Donald Trump, that would change a tax deduction:\n\n\nCurrently, Obamacare limits to $500,000 the amount of an individual executive's compensation that a health insurance company can deduct as a business expense.\n\n\n\n\nThe aim, as U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., has noted was to prevent health insurers from passing along profits they made via Obamacare to their executives, and then deducting the cost of those raises on the company\u2019s taxes.\n\n\n\n\nThe GOP replacement bill would repeal the $500,000 limit, generally making the cap $1 million, the same amount that applies to other types of businesses. In other words, health insurance companies could increase their tax deduction.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upshot for the federal government, as estimated by Congress\u2019 nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation: $400 million in lost tax revenue over 10 years.\n\n\nThe effects\nSo, as Baldwin suggests, the GOP proposal would allow health insurers to claim a greater tax deduction for the pay it gives its top executives.\nA CNN/Money news report said that of the $73 million paid to the CEOs of the five major insurers in 2015, only $2.5 million was deductible under Obamacare tax laws, but more than $70 million of it would be deductible under the Republican legislation.\nBut there are other important facts to consider:\n\n\nIt\u2019s misleading to say that executives would \"personally\" benefit from the change, given that the tax break is for corporations, not individuals.\n\n\n\n\nThe health insurance companies would have more of a financial incentive, in terms of tax deductions, to give raises to their executives. But even if the companies opted to provide bigger raises, there\u2019s no evidence that the executives would reap \"millions.\"\n\n\nAs Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told us:\n\"A more accurate version of Baldwin\u2019s statement would be that Trumpcare would make it easier for insurance companies to increase their CEO\u2019s pay.\"\nOur rating\nBaldwin says \"\u2018Trumpcare\u2019 would allow insurance execs to personally make millions off your health care.\"\nOne provision in a Trump-supported Republican bill to replace Obamacare is a tax break worth an estimated $400 million over 10 years.\nIt\u2019s possible that money could fund raises for health care company executives. But the tax break is for the companies, not individuals; the companies could use the savings for other purposes; and even if the savings were used for raises, there\u2019s no evidence that executives would get millions.\nFor a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    4 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly False  \"\u2018TrumpCare\u2019 would allow insurance execs to personally make millions off your health care.\"    Tammy Baldwin U.S. senator, D-Wis.
