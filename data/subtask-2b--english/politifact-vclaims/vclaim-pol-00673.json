But it cannot survive treason from within. For the traitor appears not a traitor \u2013 He speaks in the accents familiar to his victims, and he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation \u2013 he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city \u2013 he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to be feared.\"\nThe words, with some slightly different iterations, have been widely attributed to Cicero across the internet for some time, but we could find no evidence that he actually said or wrote it. (Additionally, he died in 43 B.C., a year before the meme claims he said the quote.)\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
