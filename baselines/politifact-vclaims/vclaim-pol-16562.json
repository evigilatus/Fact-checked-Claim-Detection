Joe Biden immediately challenged him on the feasibility of the timetable, saying \"Number one, there is not a single military man in this audience who will tell this senator he can get those troops out in six months if the order goes today.\" Sen. Hillary Clinton also said she doubted the six months number.\n\n\nExperts disagree on how quickly withdrawal could occur. But some believe a speedy withdrawal could take place in less than a year if non-essential equipment was left behind.\n\n\nAs time has gone by, though, Richardson has gradually dropped the phrase \"six months\" from his arguments for a hasty withdrawal. In a subsequent debate on Aug. 19, Richardson said withdrawal could be completed in six to eight months. At a Sept. 26 debate, moderator Tim Russert asked Richardson if it was possible to withdraw troops in less than a year; Richardson said it was, but he didn't claim the six-month time frame.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo Biden is on solid ground saying that Richardson's six-month figure seems to be a thing of the past. But he falls short when he says Richardson accepts a year-long time frame.\n\n\nIn a Richardson campaign video, a narrator says Richardson's time frame to withdraw troops is \"as quickly as they can safely exit the country.\" His web site -- www.getourtroopsout.com \u2013 emphasizes withdrawal in a matter of months, citing several past examples of large troop movements that have occurred in \"as little as three months\" or \"in just a few months.\"\n\n\nIt may be strategically smart of Richardson to drop the controversial six-months number that distracts from his main argument of a fast withdrawal. But we can't find any examples of Richardson \"acknowledging\" a year-long withdrawl time-frame either. We rate Biden's charge half-true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16562"}
