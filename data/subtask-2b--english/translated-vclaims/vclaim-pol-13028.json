Rick Perry is manipulating presidential candidacy in 2012, and he commended him for opposing abortion and amnesty for illegal immigrants -- and for tracking down Democrats. According to a copy of Limbo on May 18, which was posted on the Internet, Limbo said: \"Ric Perry is the man who followed these Democrats who left the state. Remember that they fled, just as the Democrats in Wisconsin did, with reference to 14 members of the Wisconsin State Senate who left Badger State for almost a month this year in an attempt to stop legislation that diminishes the collective bargaining rights of many State workers. There is no doubt that Limbo, who did not respond to an e-mail seeking support for this allegation, was referring to one of two past events in the Texas Legislature: when the Democrats of the House of Representatives went to Oklahoma in May 2003 in an attempt to prevent action on redrawing the regions of the State House of Representatives, or when the Democrats of the Senate similarly took a tour in July 2003 to New Mexico. Both trips temporarily prevented a sufficient number of members of the Chamber in question from doing business. Both ended with the eventual return of Democrats and Republicans who developed revised zones, resulting in WDP candidates obtaining a majority of United States Council seats. Did Perry Dee track the departures, as Limbo says? News reports from these episodes indicate that Democrats in the Senate have never been \"tracers\" since their destination was quickly detected; before the departure of Austin on July 28, some interviewed the fact that senators were flying private planes to Albuquerque. The next day, the Houston Chronicle published that Lieutenant Goff. David Dehorst, who presides over the Senate, said that since the senators left the state, \"from a practical point of view, there's not much we can do.\" However, the sudden departure of more than 50 Democrats from Pete on May 12, 2003, triggered research work involving Republicans with heavy weight, including Perry. On May 13, 2003, Dallas Morning News reported that Democrats had been found the previous night, based on a vision of a private plane belonging to former Speaker Pete Lane, the D-Hele Center. Lanie was on his car Piper Cheyenne with his pilot on 12 May, took off from Hill County Airport and landed at the mid-city executive airport in Ardmore about an hour later, saying the newspaper, quoted by an officer at the airport. In a telephone interview, the former news reporter Matt Stiles told us that he drove to Ardmore from Dallas the same day after his colleague, Pete Slover, immersed the plane site. Stiles said he arrived at the Holliday Hotel by 6:00 p.m., identified Lanie, then collected comments from some Democrats at home. According to the news, four Texas police officers, dressed in civilian clothes, also arrived at the hotel in the wake of Democrats. That evening, the newspaper said, the soldiers spent most of their time sitting in the hotel lobby, with cars and planes ready to move anyone who volunteered to return to Austin. \"We came at the request of the Governor's office to make contact and inform them that their services are still required in Austin. They chose to stay here.\" The newspaper said the soldiers were planning to leave by midnight. After that, we called Bob Richter, former spokesperson of Tom Kradek, then Speaker of the House of Representatives. Richter told us that the day the Democrats disappeared, Perry showed up \"Jong-ho\" to get them back and \"bringing a bunch of people together to try and find them.\" A command centre has been set up alongside the speaker's office. Richter once said that he saw Perry in his office calling the number on the tail of a plane because of me. On 23 May 2003, a subsequent article from the Morning News reported that in the early hours of the search, a lieutenant from the Department of Homeland Security contacted the Federal Department of Homeland Security looking for the whereabouts of Lanny's plane. Internal security officials issued a partial copy of the call and said that the DPS officer had misled them to believe that the plane had crashed, as reported in the newspaper. According to an article issued on 28 May 2003 by the Houston Chronicle, Chairman of the General Commission of Inquiry of the House of Representatives Kevin Bailey, De Houston stated that the security tapes in the Capitol showed that Perry entered and left the Kradik office on 12 May. Billy also said that National Defence Coordinator Perry - Assistant Attorney General Jay Kimbro - gave the California telephone number to the Internal Security Air Ban Service, which tracks terrorists and smugglers. He wasn't the only governor looking for Dems. The President of the United States, Tom Delay, R. Texas, then the majority leader of the House of Representatives, said that his staff had asked the Federal Aviation Administration to find Lanie's plane, according to the news story of the morning of 23 May. The report quotes from Deliley that when he found out that the plane was on its way from Armor to Austin Airport, he passed the information to Cradic. On June 5, 2003, the newspaper San Antonio Express News stated that, at some point, Perry was an official of the Democratic Party, where he sent Texas guards to search for two missing Democrats - something that the newspaper said was \"a direct contradiction to the Governor's long-standing claim that he was not involved in the search for democratic legislators who fled Austin to kill a bill for the redivision of Congress.\" According to the newspaper, the DDP official, Lieutenant Will Craice, who was described as the highest-ranking officer of the command post established in the Capitol, testified in a suit brought by a Democratic legislator against the Democratic Party. The newspaper said that Caris said that Perry Peggan asked me many questions and eventually ordered the guards to send Galveston and Brownsville where he believed that Republic Craig Island, Dalveston, Rennie Olivera and De Brownsville were hiding. There were no legislators. The island was in Ardmore and Olivera in Matamoros, Mexico, via Rio Grande from his hometown, as reported in Express-News. The spokesman for Perry, Kathy Walt, told the newspaper that Perry hadn't issued such orders. All the time, Walt described the Governor as not participating in the hunt more than verifying his status. According to a press article published on June 5, 2003 by Austin Austman-American statesman citing Chris's testimony, it was Kradek who told the GSS that missing legislators were in Ardmore. The Perry office did not respond immediately when asked about Limbo &apos; s claim that he had identified the Dimes. Cradic made a statement saying, \"That's not true. Perry wasn't the guy who followed the Democrats. Perry was trying to find the missing legislators. His National Defence Coordinator and the Ministry of Public Security participated in this effort, which also included federal agencies, and the Governor reportedly directed Texas guards to two cities in Texas. But it was a news organization that got to Democrats first. We're barely evaluating the statement. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021 Editor's Note: This statement was estimated to be barely correct when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name of the evaluation to most of the error.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13028"}
