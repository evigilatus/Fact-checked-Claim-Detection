Wade.", "text": "Roe's charge against Wade against John McCain appears to be an oral lapse eight years ago. McCain responded to the written questionnaires, saying that he was opposed to Roe v. Wade, but when the San Francisco Fact Sheet and CNN asked him about it in late 1999, McCain said: \"I want to see a point that is irrelevant (court judgement) and that can be abolished because abortion is no longer necessary. But certainly in the short term, or even in the long term, I would not support the abolition of Roe vs. Wade, which would then force X the number of women in America to (retreat) illegal and dangerous operations.\" McCain's associates almost immediately began to retract McCain's words, pointing out that McCain misspoke when he used the phrase \"even in the long term.\" McCain said in an interview a few months later, \"It's clear that I misspoke there.\" I am someone who made mistakes in this campaign, and I will continue to make mistakes. My voting record is clear, from 17 years of life support. I still hold on to this position, and I still think that Roe v. Wade was a very wrong decision, as most experts say. On January 13, 2021, General David Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines in inaugural security, and told her \"We're not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, South Carolina this year, McCain said, \"I don't support Roe v. Wade. \"You have to flip.\" We find that McKeen's short observation of support is not a complete change of location, so we evaluated Romney's claim for the true half.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00328"}
