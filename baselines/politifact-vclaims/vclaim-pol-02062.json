The group supports black, progressive candidates and is backing Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in the Florida Democratic primary.\nThe ad portrays Graham, who served one term in the House representing North Florida\u2019s District 2, as a contrarian to former President Barack Obama.\n\"Gwen Graham says she is the progressive candidate for governor,\" the voiceover says, \"but while in Congress she voted against President Obama 52 percent of the time.\"\nWe wanted to know if about half of Graham\u2019s votes really went against what the Obama White House wanted.\n\nYou may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization,\u00a0we depend on \u2014 and answer to \u2014 you.

Go on the record as saying facts matter!\n\nWe found the claim slightly overstates Graham\u2019s votes against Obama by focusing only on part of her time in Congress, rather than both years of her term.\nGraham\u2019s breaks with the White House were on issues of national security, foreign policy and energy. Sometimes, she was one of just a handful of Democrats to do so.\nGraham voted more reliably liberal on health care and abortion. Still, according to VoteView.com\u2019s analysis of every roll call vote, Graham was \"more conservative than 91 percent of Democrats in the House at the time.\"\nUnderstanding the division\nThe breakdown comes from an analysis by Congressional Quarterly, which tracked how members of Congress voted when the president took a clear position. That includes statements of administration policy provided in advance of the vote, as well as statements by the president or his designated spokespersons.\nCQ offered a percentage for votes in both 2015 and 2016.\nIn 2015, CQ counted 89 House votes where the White House had a stated preference. According to CQ, Graham supported the president on 49 percent of those votes in 2015. In other words, she voted against Obama 51 percent of the time.\nOne of the most controversial pieces of legislation that Graham voted for in 2015 was a Republican bill that authorized the construction of the\u00a0Keystone XL Pipeline (HR 3). Twenty-eight Democrats including Graham voted in favor of authorizing the pipeline\u2019s construction, which also passed the Senate. But Obama vetoed the bill.\nMore examples:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaurice Ferre\n\n\nstated on July 1, 2010 in an editorial meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaurice Ferre says Kendrick Meek \"has voted 98.6 percent of the time with the Democrat party.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Trenton Daniel \u2022 July 21, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Graham voted for the Republican-backed North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act (HR 8), which supporters said would have\u00a0helped modernize infrastructure and federal policies. But\u00a0the Obama White House threatened to\u00a0veto the bill because \"it would undermine already successful initiatives designed to modernize the nation's energy infrastructure and increase our energy efficiency.\"\u00a0It did not make it to a vote in\u00a0the Senate, however.\n\n\u2022 \u00a0Graham voted in favor of legislation (HR 37) that would have amended the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Obama had signed Dodd-Frank into law in 2010. The bill did not pass the Senate.\nIn 2016, however, the percentage of Graham\u2019s votes with Obama increased. Of 54 votes, CQ found Graham voted in line with the White House 65 percent of the time. Or, she broke with Obama on 35 percent of those votes.\nSome examples:\n\u2022 Graham was one of only three Democrats to vote for the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, which would have increased congressional oversight of sanctions against Iran. It passed the House but did not come to a vote in the Senate, but Obama had threatened to veto the bill.\u00a0\n\u2022 Graham joined 11 Democrats in voting for a GOP-backed bill that would have prohibited the transfer of a Guantanamo Bay detainee to a facility in the United States.\n\u2022 Graham also voted for the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, which would have placed significant hurdles on the processing of some refugees, likely resulting in at least a pause in admissions. The Obama White House said the bill would in effect prevent Syrian immigrants from coming to the United States by adding significant new certification requirements.\nGraham camp objects\nGraham spokesman Matt Harringer said the claim doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\"Gwen disagreed from time to time with President Obama, like on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but she is proud of her progressive record and overwhelmingly voting to support President Obama's agenda \u2014 including voting eight times to save the Affordable Care Act, to defend the Clean Power Plan and to protect the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau,\" he said.\nGraham voted multiple times against Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act while in Congress. The White House only weighed in on half of those votes, despite the fact that Obama would have likely opposed\u00a0the measures.\nHarringer pointed to CQ\u2019s party-unity scores, which are included on the same study as the presidential positions. Graham\u2019s average party-unity score was 84 percent after two years in Congress.\nHe also pushed back on VoteView.com\u2019s characterization of her as a \"conservative\" Democrat. \"You could just as easily say she was the most bipartisan Democrat in the Florida delegation at the time,\" Harringer said.\nOur ruling\nThe Collective super PAC said Graham \"voted against President Obama 52 percent of the time.\"\nIn her two years in the House, Graham stood out as a Democrat who did not always vote the party line, siding with conservatives on some significant measures about foreign policy and defense. But the group\u2019s ad overstates the percentage in which Graham voted against what Obama wanted by only looking at part of her time in Congress.\u00a0\nGraham voted against Obama\u2019s stated policy preference around half the time in 2015, but only 35 percent of the time in 2016. On average for those 143 votes, she broke with Obama 45 percent over two years.\nBecause the claim is partially accurate but missing some details, we rate this claim Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-05-17 14:55:13 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Says Gwen Graham \"voted against President Obama 52 percent of the time.\"    The Collective super PAC https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-laiQeLBa4&feature=youtu.be   in an ad Thursday, May 11, 2017 2017-05-11    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02062"}
