(See our other checks on the image here.)\nSanders and the death penalty\nThe Vermont senator has been an opponent of the death penalty for his entire political career. And with one exception, he has voted against expansions of the death penalty at every turn.\nSanders opposed the Violent Crime Prevention Act of 1991 during his first year in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\"All over the industrialized world now, countries are saying, \u2018let us put an end to state murder, let us stop capital punishment\u2019,\" Sanders said in a 1991 speech on the House floor. \"But here what we\u2019re talking about is more and more capital punishment.\"\nThe bill, which included provisions to authorize the death penalty as appropriate punishment for crimes involving the murder of a law enforcement officer, terrorism and drug trafficking, never reached the desk of President George H.W. Bush.\nIn 1994, however, Sanders voted in favor of the final version of the\u00a0Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, a bill that expanded the federal death penalty. Sanders had voted for an amendment to the bill that would have replaced all federal death sentences with life in prison. Even though the\u00a0amendment failed, Sanders still voted for the larger crime bill.\nA spokesman for Sanders said he voted for the bill \"because it included the Violence Against Women Act and the ban on certain assault weapons.\"\nSanders reiterated his opposition to capital punishment\u00a0in 2015.\u00a0\"I just don\u2019t think the state itself, whether it\u2019s the state government or federal government, should be in the business of killing people,\" he said on a radio show.\nClinton and the death penalty\nClinton\u2019s campaign did not provide her stance on capital punishment.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last time she publicly addressed capital punishment, which was 15 years ago, Clinton offered support.\nIn her 2000 run for U.S. Senate, she was quoted by a Washington Post columnist as saying the death penalty had her \"unenthusiastic support.\"\nClinton\u2019s history on the issue, however, is slightly\u00a0complicated.\nAs director of the legal aid clinic at the University of Arkansas in the 1970s, Clinton helped to get the death sentence of a 20-year-old African-American man sentenced to life in prison. But according to a timeline of the case\u00a0compiled by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on criminal justice, Clinton\u2019s views on the topic changed as her husband\u2019s did.\nBill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, is described as shifting his position on the death penalty as part of an effort to present himself as a centrist \"New Democrat\" in the 1980s.\nCiting Paul Kengor\u2019s 2007 book God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, the timeline says that Hillary Clinton \" \u2018agonized\u2019 over her husband\u2019s embrace of capital punishment,\" eventually supporting it.\nAs first lady, she supported the 1994 crime bill that Sanders opposed.\nAfter her election to U.S. Senate, she co-sponsored a bill that made it easier for prisoners on death row to appeal for exoneration through DNA testing.\nClinton hasn\u2019t yet addressed the issue in the 2016 election cycle.\nOur ruling\nThe infographic claims Bernie Sanders opposes\u00a0the death penalty and that Hillary Clinton supports\u00a0it.\nSanders has\u00a0opposed the death penalty for at least the last 20 years, though he did vote for the 1994 crime bill that, among many other provisions, expanded the number of crimes that could result in\u00a0death penalty sentences. While Clinton has helped make it easier to appeal a death sentence, her most recent documented statements on the topic\u00a0expressed tepid support.\nWithout a clear\u00a0idea of her most recent stance,\u00a0we can only assume she still holds that position.\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06007"}
