In total, the country has counted 1,540 confirmed and probable cases during the outbreak, including 22 deaths.\u00a0\nA probable case does not have a positive laboratory result, but \"is treated like a confirmed case based on its exposure history and clinical symptoms.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth experts vs. politicians\nAs for the whys of New Zealand\u2019s success, both health experts and politicians can be credited \u2014 along with New Zealanders\u2019 willingness to abide by stay-at-home orders \u2014 according to a number of news analyses.\nNational Geographic credited New Zealand\u2019s success to mandatory quarantines for all visitors beginning March 15, which it called one of the strictest policies in the world at the time \u2014 even though there were just six cases nationwide. Just 10 days later, it instituted a complete, countrywide lockdown, including a moratorium on domestic travel. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern \"made clear, concise statements about the situation to the nation, bolstered by a team of scientists and health professionals\" and citizens abided by the restrictions, wrote a reporter who became one of the quarantined visitors.\nHow strict? The lockdown from March 24 to April 9 allowed non-essential workers to leave home only for essential exercise within close proximity to their residences, Forbes reported.\n\"New Zealanders didn\u2019t complain, they didn\u2019t protest, they simply followed the rules,\" another foreign reporter who was in New Zealand for the lockdowns, wrote in Politico. When Ardern\u2019s health minister took his family for a 20-minute ride to the beach, he was demoted, the reporter wrote.\nArdern announced the reopening of schools in May.\nThe BBC credited Ardern\u2019s leadership as well as the presence of New Zealand Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield at Ardern\u2019s daily briefings. Bloomfield effectively explained complex health issues, and that made New Zealanders more compliant in following orders, the network reported.\nThe New York Times reported June 8, the day the New Zealand lifted its lockdown and declared the virus eliminated, that Ardern \"has been praised internationally for her approach to New Zealand\u2019s outbreak, which was among the most stringent in the world.\n\"Her live video updates on Facebook, streamed from her own home, offered a relatable understanding of the impact of the coronavirus lockdown on the lives of New Zealanders, but a firm resolve to eradicate the disease from the country.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claimed that \"New Zealand let health experts\" rather than politicians make decisions about how to deal with COVID-19, \"and as of today they have zero COVID cases.\"\nAs of July 7, the date of the post, New Zealand reported having 22 active cases of COVID-19 \u2014 but each had been detected at the port of entry among people returning from travel abroad. In other words, the country had zero active, locally transmitted cases.\nHealth experts, along with New Zealanders\u2019 compliance with stay-home orders, are partly credited for the success. But Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s decisions to order strict early lockdowns, following scientists\u2019 advice, have won wide praise.\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs a little more information, our rating is Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17718"}
