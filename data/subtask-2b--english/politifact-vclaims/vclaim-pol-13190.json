Paul Ryan voted for wars, tax cuts and a drug bill that weren\u2019t paid for", "text": "In closed-door remarks to campaign supporters on April 14, 2011, President Barack Obama looked back in frustration at lengthy negotiations with Republicans over funding to keep the federal government operating.\n\nObama opined, as a CBS News online story reported, that he expects Republicans to continue using the budget process to \"enact their political agenda under the guise of cutting spending.\"\n\nThe president singled out U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the House Budget Committee chairman who has authored a long-term deficit-reduction plan.\n\n\"When Paul Ryan says his priority is to make sure, you know, he's just being America's accountant, trying to be responsible ...This is the same guy who voted for two wars that were unpaid for, voted for the Bush tax cuts that were unpaid for, voted for the prescription drug bill that cost as much as my health care bill -- but wasn't paid for,\" Obama told his supporters. \"So it's not on the level.\"\n\nIn making the remark, Obama pointed to several big-ticket items approved during the Bush administration while Ryan was in Congress -- ones he says have helped drive the nation\u2019s record deficits.\n\nGiven the prominence of the protagonists and the timeliness of the comments, we decided to take a look at Obama\u2019s critique of Ryan.\n\nWith the words, Obama is offering an opinion about how Ryan has framed his budget-cutting efforts. We can\u2019t fact-check the president\u2019s opinion about Ryan\u2019s message. But we can focus on the factual assertions, and try to put them into some context.\n\nWe started with the White House, which declined to comment, saying the president\u2019s remarks spoke for themselves.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the votes.\n\nThere is no dispute Ryan voted for Afghanistan and Iraq war funding; for the major tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 (and extended in 2010); and for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit created in 2003.\n\nAll were big-ticket items.\n\nBut Obama goes a step further to assert that all were \"unpaid for.\" That\u2019s Washington parlance for bills not offset by corresponding spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere in the federal budget.\n\nBudget experts we consulted and the historical record confirm there were no direct offsets built into those bills.\n\nObama\u2019s claim on the prescription drug bill was slightly different -- that it wasn\u2019t paid for and \"cost as much as my health care bill.\"\n\nLet\u2019s break this into two parts.\n\nObama appears to refer to the gross outlays needed for the two landmark bills.\n\nFor the Medicare prescription drug bill, passed in 2003 and effective in 2006, we found a range of cost estimates for 10 years: $395 billion to $720 billion. The official Congressional Budget Office estimate was the low end.\n\nThat was at the time. Now, government estimates show the original cost projections were too high, perhaps by as much as 40 percent, said Jon Gabel, senior fellow in health care research at the National Opinion Research Center.\n\nObama\u2019s health reform bill -- the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- was pricier, with estimates in the $800 billion to $1.4 trillion range. \u00a0Ryan and Republicans opposed the bill.\n\nBut the two measures were passed seven years apart, so inflation may be a factor.\n\nPaul Van de Water, a former Congressional Budget Office official who is now a senior fellow with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, did an inflation-adjusted comparison and found the Medicare bill is probably two-thirds or three-quarters the cost of the Obama health care measure.\n\nThat is, Obama\u2019s health care bill is still hundreds of millions of dollars more costly than the Medicare drug bill.\n\nSo the president was off in equating the gross cost of the bills.\n\nOn the offset question, the Medicare prescription drug bill, however, indisputably added to the federal deficit. It was not offset by new revenue or other spending cuts.\n\nIn contrast, the official government estimate of the 2010 health care law\u2019s impact said it would actually reduce the deficit, in part because of the new taxes it enacts to help offset the cost of expanding health coverage.\n\nThe source for that is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe CBO\u2019s estimate is hardly undisputed -- Ryan, other Republican leaders and various budget analysts have argued that the CBO\u2019s report was skewed by questionable assumptions given to it by the Obama administration. They contend the law would actually add to the deficit.\n\nNevertheless, we -- and Congress -- have used CBO estimates as the gold standard on such matters. So Obama has a pretty firm leg to stand on in saying his health bill was paid for while the Medicare bill was not.\n\nThat covers the details behind the president\u2019s remarks. In this case, it\u2019s important to put them into their proper context. We consulted several experts and sought Ryan\u2019s take.\n\nRyan was asked in a recent interview about Obama\u2019s citing the Medicare drug program, the two wars and the Bush tax cuts as major drivers of the deficit.\n\nHe disagreed: \"We still had these enormous, building, unfunded liabilities, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security -- I mean, the big drivers of our debt.\"\n\nHis office sent us a defense of his votes on war funding, quoting his budget plan: \"Like all categories of government spending, defense spending should be executed with greater efficiency and accountability. But responsible budgeting must never lose sight of the fact that the first responsibility of the federal government is to provide for the defense of the nation.\"\n\nOn the Bush tax cuts, Ryan aides said the congressman believes that \"we have deficits because Washington spends too much, not because Americans are taxed too little.\" He says the tax cuts helped fuel economic growth and bring in more tax revenue.\n\nIndeed, in December, Obama himself backed a compromise with Republicans, including Ryan, that extended the Bush tax cuts.\n\n\"Bottom line: Ryan has voted for massive new spending and so has the president,\" said Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nIraq war costs have topped $1 trillion, said Scott Lilly, former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and now a research fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Neither Bush\u2019s war effort in Afghanistan nor Obama\u2019s escalation there has been paid for, both analysts noted.\n\nIn April, both Obama and Ryan unveiled long-term deficit reduction plans in the neighborhood of $4 trillion over a decade or more.\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nThe president cherry-picked a handful of votes in an effort to show that Ryan is not pristine on the subject of the deficit.\n\nObama got it right on Ryan\u2019s support for the big-ticket bills, including war funding, Medicare prescription drugs and the Bush tax cuts. He was also on target in saying that none was offset or \"paid for\" by spending cuts or tax increases. That\u2019s the main part of his claim.\n\nHe was off the mark in asserting that one of the bills -- Medicare prescription drugs -- was as costly as his 2010 health care reform bill.\n\nThat puts him at Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13190"}
