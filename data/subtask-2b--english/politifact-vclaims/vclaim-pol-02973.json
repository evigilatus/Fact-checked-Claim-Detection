By email, Adler spokesman Jason Stanford advised that Adler relied on a Texas Monthly \"Daily Post\" story on FBI crime statistics published the day that Adler tweeted.\nThe story includes a headline declaring Austin the state\u2019s safest city. In the main, the story says that according to data compiled by the FBI covering 2015 and part of 2016, Odessa by far had the state\u2019s highest violent crime rate, 1,070.1 violent crimes reported per 100,000 residents, up 25 percent from 2014. The FBI classifies as violent crimes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault.\n\"It\u2019s long been noted that Austin is something of a fairytale land where violence is rare, and at least compared to the rest of the state, that tends to bear out,\" the story says, going on: \"Although Austin\u2019s violent crime rate of 287.7 per 100,000 is slightly up from 2013, it\u2019s grown at a much slower rate than any comparably safe city over the past couple of years, putting Austin in the top spot for safe Texas cities.\"\nFBI says don\u2019t compare jurisdictions\nWe noticed, though, the story didn\u2019t mention a consistent FBI advisory against employing its statistics to compare jurisdictions.\nSince at least 2011, the FBI has said it \"strongly discourages\" using FBI Unified Crime Reporting statistics to compare communities. That note said: \"Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale.\" The FBI admonished in May 2017: \"Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place.\"\nWhen we asked FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer to evaluate Adler\u2019s claim, Fischer replied by email: \"Since crime is a sociological phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors, the FBI discourages ranking the agencies and using the data as a measurement of law enforcement effectiveness.\" Fischer passed along elaboration from FBI analyst Loretta Simmons: \"Comparisons lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their residents. Valid assessments are possible only with careful study and analysis of the range of unique conditions affecting each local law enforcement jurisdiction.\"\nAustin, big city?\nAnother consideration is whether Austin fairly ranks as a big city in comparison to, say, Houston, Dallas or San Antonio.\nThis year, before rating Half True U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s description of his hometown as the nation\u2019s safest city, we noted that CQ Press--which annually reports on crime rates using FBI statistics--enables adjustments based on population density--and if you impose a density of at least 2,720 residents per square mile, Austin and El Paso fall out of its big-city crime rate rankings. That density squeeze, we found, left San Antonio with the No. 6 lowest crime rate nationally, Dallas at No. 12 and Houston at No. 17.\nAustin region\u2019s violent crime rate\nAnother wrinkle: The crime rates cited by Texas Monthly were not city-specific, instead taking into account metropolitan statistical areas. This means the touted Austin figures reflected crimes tallied through Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties.\nThat said, the Austin area in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than any of the state\u2019s other regions, we confirmed in our own break-out of what\u2019s posted by the FBI. Austin\u2019s rate of 287.7 violent crimes per 100,000 residents greatly trailed the Odessa area\u2019s No. 1 state rate of 1070.1 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. Meantime, the Austin region\u2019s murder/nonnegligent manslaughter rate of 2.2 per 100,000 residents ranked third behind the rates for less-populous Wichita Falls (1.3 per 100,000 residents) and Brownsville (1.6 per 100,000 residents); the Longview area had the state\u2019s highest rate (10.1 per 100,000 inhabitants).\nLOWEST VIOLENT CRIME RATES, TEXAS METRO AREAS, 2015\n\n\n\n\nREGION\n\n\nVIOLENT CRIME RATE\n\n\n\n\nAustin-Round Rock\n\n\n287.7 per 100,000 residents\n\n\n\n\nTyler\n\n\n295.7\n\n\n\n\nCollege Station-Bryan\n\n\n315.5\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAllen-Edinburg-Mission\n\n\n298.1\n\n\n\n\nBrownsville-Harlingen\n\n\n299.8\n\n\n\n\nMidland\n\n\n322.3\n\n\n\n\nSherman-Denison\n\n\n327.1\n\n\n\n\nSan Angelo\n\n\n329.3\n\n\n\n\nDallas-Plano-Irving\n\n\n330.6\n\n\n\n\nWichita Falls\n\n\n334.5\n\n\n\n\nSOURCE: Chart showing crime rates in Texas Metropolitan Statistical Areas, https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-6 (PolitiFact Texas compilation, August 2017)\nMore recent FBI data\nOur own look into FBI crime reports further showed that in January 2017, the agency released its preliminary report tabulating crimes in each U.S. city of 100,000 population or greater in the first half of 2016.\nFrom those figures, we roughed out the violent crime rate for each of 35 Texas cities (not metro areas) listed in the report. Our finding: Austin (population about 948,000 as of July 2016) ranked 21st in the state with a violent-crime rate of 209 incidents per 100,000 residents--trailing cities including El Paso (population about 683,000) with 195 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants); Laredo (192 violent crimes per 100,000 residents); Midland (186 violent crimes per 100,000 people); and the capital\u2019s northern suburb, Round Rock (73 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants). See our chart here.\nWhen we alerted Stanford to what we found, he replied by email that Adler compares Austin solely to the state\u2019s biggest cities, specifying Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth.\nEl Paso safer?\nSeparately, our web search turned up an April 2017 ranking of Texas cities for public safety by Pittsburgh-based Niche, a self-described \"blend of data scientists, engineers, parents, and \u2018yinzers\u2019 who are passionate about helping you discover the schools and neighborhoods that are right for you.\"\nStarting from FBI statistics, Niche says, it based the public-safety grades on each city\u2019s assault and robbery rates and, to lesser degrees, local rates of murder, burglary, vehicle theft and larceny plus resident responses to questions about local crime and safety.\nNiche ranked Austin No. 22 nationally among \"best cities to live in America\" though the city landed a public-safety grade of C+ -- like El Paso, Brownsville, Midland, Laredo, Wichita Falls and Tyler. Faring better, Plano, Richardson, College Station, and McAllen each had a public-safety grade of B-minus, per Niche, with Round Rock ranking fifth nationally thanks to its public-safety grade of B.\nCriminologist: Comparisons \u2018chancy\u2019\nWe also queried Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox about Adler\u2019s claim. By email, Fox said he\u2019s determined that per FBI figures, Austin in 2015 had the lowest homicide rate among 51 U.S. cities with at least 300,000 residents and at least 20 homicides; Austin\u2019s rate was 2.5 for every 100,000 residents, narrowly besting San Diego\u2019s 2.6 rate, according to a table Fox provided. Among Texas cities Fox evaluated, Houston had the highest homicide rate, 13.3 per 100,000 residents.\nDoes that arguably make Austin the safest big city in Texas? Fox said by phone that such judgments are hard to cement because cities differ in many ways including, for instance, how suburban they happen to be. \"There are a whole bunch of reasons cities differ that have nothing to do with safety,\" Fox said, \"that have nothing to do with police and how they\u2019re doing their job. That\u2019s why it\u2019s chancy to make those kinds of comparisons.\"\nOur ruling\nAdler called Austin the safest big city in Texas.\nAs we\u2019ve said before \u2014 and as experts keep stressing \u2014 using crime data to declare one city \"safer\" than another is fraught with peril. That said, FBI statistics suggest the five-county Austin region in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than other Texas regions. But El Paso had a lower violent-crime rate than Austin in the first half of 2016.\nAdler\u2019s claim adds up to a statement that\u2019s partly accurate while lacking important context. We rate it Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
