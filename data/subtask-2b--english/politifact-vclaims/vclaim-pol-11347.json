Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits. Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.\"\n\nHere\u2019s the math:\n\nExxon Mobil Corp. estimates it earned $41 billion in 2011.\n\nDivide by 365 days in the year and 24 hours in a day \u2014 and that\u2019s $4.67 million.\n\nEvery hour.\n\nObama has previously struggled with the facts about Exxon\u2019s profit. In 2007, he claimed the company\u2019s profits had never been higher, when that wasn\u2019t true at the time.\n\nLast year, Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., was on stronger ground when he declared that \"over the past decade, the big five oil companies \u2014 BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell \u2014 made a total profit of nearly $1 trillion.\" PolitiFact Virginia rated that Mostly True.\n\nThis time, Exxon answered the president on its blog, saying \"the reality is that statistics such as by-the-hour profits only tell part of the story.\"\n\n\"Consider if the president had added the following statistics: ExxonMobil\u2019s taxes were $12.3 million an hour, and it took more than $47 million an hour to run the global business. Those statistics are also accurate and they put the $4.7 million an hour in profits in context.\"\n\n(We should note that we can\u2019t independently verify the company\u2019s tax bill. As we\u2019ve reported before, the actual income tax, for example, paid by Exxon to the U.S. government is confidential information. We have dinged politicians for inaccurately characterizing the company\u2019s taxes.)\n\nThe company has a point that Obama\u2019s statistic doesn't detail the oil company's expenses. But in this fact-check, we\u2019re focusing just on the claim that, \"Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.\" As a simple snapshot of Exxon\u2019s 2011 profit, his arithmetic is right on target. We rate the statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
