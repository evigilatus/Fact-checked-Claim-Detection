It's always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be $30 million, like Trump said. \"They have no idea what the number is. To be honest, our government has no idea what they're doing on so many fronts. Trump questioned the figure of 11 million earlier in his presidential presentation last year, and treated 30 million and 34 million as alternative estimates. That claim appreciates pants on fire. Is it possible that after a year Trump's claim of 3 million or 30 million could be more accurate? The answer is still no. Assessment of undocumented persons in the United States The Ministry of Internal Security last estimated the undocumented migrant population at 11.4 million in January 2012, down from the peak of 12.2 million in 2007. This includes persons who have entered the United States illegally and persons who have exceeded their stay on visas. The figures from independent organizations studying migration are all in the same stadium. In this context, there is a decline: unauthorized population (2012) and unauthorized population (2012) (last year) BIO Research Centre 11.2 million 11.3 million (2014) Centre for Migration Studies 11.1 million 10.9 million (2014) Centre for Migration Studies 11 to 12 million By Samantha Buterman: 11 January 2021 11.7 million (2016) * This is a preliminary estimate. All these figures come from the subtracting of known legal immigrants from the total number of foreign births documented in the United States census and then controlling the estimated percentage of unauthorized migrants who refuse to answer the census. The researchers in all organizations have told us that Trump's statement is absolutely inaccurate. According to Robert Warren of the Centre for Migration Studies, which is a non-partisan think tank on immigration policy, there is certainly a \"zero probability\" of only 3 million, or up to 30 million. \"There's strong evidence that the number is 11 million, with a reasonable margin of error plus or minus 1 million,\" he said. Jeffrey Basil, a demographic engineer at the Pio Research Centre, described each of the Trump numbers as \"almost impossible\" and explained why. At a low level, survey data show that there is a large number of people born abroad and a sufficient number of legally recognized persons who cannot reach less than 3 million. The high estimates provided by Tramp run counter to the limited number of housing units in the United States, Mexico and Central America in terms of the size of censuses and surveys, and American data on admissions and departures. \"Simply there's no way there's an additional 20 million people in the country who have escaped their discovery,\" said Basil. If the figure was actually as high as 30 million people, school enrolment and birth registration would reflect this, since general education and the nationality of the right to birth were catalysts for undocumented migrants, Stephen Kamaruta, Director of Research at the Centre for Migration Studies, who called for low levels of legal migrants. Kamaruta said, \"But the numbers aren't true.\" \"The Butom Line is that we don't know what the confirmed number is. However, based on the available evidence, it seems highly unlikely to be 20 million (more).\" Why does 11 million trumps always indicate that he was skeptical of the figure 11 million because it was \"always\" the estimate. We have told experts that there is a good explanation for this: a steady flow of people entering and leaving. \"The reason he heard the same number for years is that the population wasn't growing,\" said Warren. \"There is a massive rupture in the number of illegal immigrants. Hundreds of thousands came at 11 million and left hundreds of thousands, as Kamaruta said, adding that the undocumented population is an unusual demographic group because it cannot grow with births (since all children born in the United States are citizens). But even if I folded into these citizens' children, the figure would be 17 million at the most, he said. Although the federal estimate had not been completed for a few years, the experts agreed that the external group accounts were correct. However, Kamaruta criticized the Government for not providing a newer number. \"This creates considerable uncertainty in the debate on an important policy issue. As he said, \"We have to do something about the deficit, but we don't know how big it is.\" \"We're talking about something everyone sees as a problem without any data.\" Our governor Trump said the number of illegal immigrants \"can be 3 million. It could be 30 million.\" Both numbers are not within the scope of potential. Every reliable estimate we found was in the range of 11 million, with a margin of error of about 1 million. The figure has been \"always\" 11 million in recent years due to the influx of undocumented migrants into the United States and abroad. We appreciate Trump's claim for pants on fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5f092ad0-100c-401f-9889-8d203115c3522", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04390"}
