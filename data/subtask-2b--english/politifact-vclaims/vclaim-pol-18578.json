(Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\nThe story \u2014 which also linked a long-since debunked claim about a \"dump\" of votes for Democrat Joe Biden in the middle of the night \u2014 contained nothing approaching proof of this claim.\nHere\u2019s why this is both wrong and ridiculous.\nPublisher tweaks article after question, still wrong\nThe closest thing to proof presented in the story is a sentence saying the signature (actually referring to initials) MLW was used on the \"fake votes.\"\nIt then shows a picture of a ballot with those initials.\nBut those initials are under a section titled \"Absentee ballot issued by.\" It\u2019s where the issuing clerk puts their initials on every ballot. The Madison city clerk is Maribeth L. Witzel-Behl \u2014 in line with the initials cited in the story.\nIn other words, those repeated initials are exactly what and where you would expect to find repeated initials on thousands of ballots.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDane County Clerk Scott McDonell confirmed in an email the initials are simply those of the Madison clerk.\nWhen asked for proof that this picture showed votes were fake, Gateway Pundit Editor Jim Hoft changed the headline within minutes to say the votes were \"suspect\" rather than fake. And he briefly added a line to the story saying, \"Madison County attorneys contacted The Gateway Pundit to say the ballots were signed by the city clerk in Madison, Wisconsin.\" That was later deleted.\nOf course, Hoft didn\u2019t pass along this information to readers until he was challenged on the matter, and after the story had collected thousands of social media shares and comments.\nAside from bungling the location \u2014 Madison is a city in Dane County \u2014 Hoft\u2019s temporary change pointed\u00a0out the obvious reason for the repeated initials, while still asserting there is something underhanded about the ballots. Which there isn\u2019t.\nHoft did not offer any other proof of his amended claim in the story or an email exchange.\nOur ruling\nA story shared widely across social media said, \"More than 2,000 fake votes were found at the Wisconsin Recount in Dane County on Friday!\"\nAn amended version instead referenced them as being \"suspect\" votes.\nNeither claim has any basis in reality.\nThe repeated initials aren\u2019t those of the voter, they\u2019re initials of the clerk who issued the absentee ballots. That\u2019s not sketchy, it\u2019s just a basic element of how elections are administered.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18578"}
