Clinton said, \"Even once I proposed that you try to negotiate a reduction in the national debt of the United States.\" While she was talking, Trump intervened, \"mistake. Wrong.\" We didn't get a response from the Trump campaign the night of the debate. The Trump campaign also failed to respond when we considered his comments on debt in May. Clinton is right that Trump spoke of negotiating debt reduction, but he retracted his views after economists clarified his idea. The Tramp debt statement stems from the comments made by Tramp on national debt in two separate interviews in May. Trump's initial remarks came in an interview with Andrew Ross Surkin and Becky Quick on May 5, 2016. \"Mr. Trump, you're talking about debt. And you're to some extent the king of religion. I appreciate that point. Debt agreements have also been negotiated over the years. Do you think, in terms of the United States, we need to pay 100 cents on the dollar, or do you really think there are ways in which we can renegotiate that debt?\" Trump: \"Yeah, I think -- look. I've borrowed, knowing you can pay back with cuts. And you've done well with debt. Now, of course, I was sushbucking, and it was good for me and it was good for me and all that. And as you know, religion was kind of interesting to me. Now we're in a different situation with the country. But I'll borrow, knowing that if the economy breaks down, you can make a deal. If the economy is good, it is good. So, you can't lose. It's like, you know, you make a deal before you go into a poker game, and your odds are much better.\" Quickly: \"I understand you did this in business deals, but do you suggest we negotiate with American credit this way?\" Trump: \"No, I think so. I think there are times when we can refinance. We refinance debt over the long term. Because we owe a lot of money. I can see a long-term renegotiation, where we borrow in the long term at very low prices.\" But let's be clear. I mean, you're not talking about renegotiating sovereign bonds already issued by the United States? Trump: \"No. I don't want to renegotiate bonds. But I think you can make the discount, I think, you know, depending on where the interest rates are, I think you can buy it again. You can -- I'm not talking about renegotiation, but you can buy back with discounts, you can do things with discounts. I'd like to refinance the debt. I think we should refinance long-term debt.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman, January 11, 2012, the second comments were received in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on May 9, 2016. Trump: \"I'm just saying you can buy again. Look, this isn't a real estate deal where you can go and buy a mortgage with a big discount because the market's crashing, okay? This is the government of the United States. The bonds are completely sacred. I say... if interest rates rise, you can buy the debt with a discount on the market - only on the market. You just buy the back of the debt on-- off a discount.\" Wall Street Journal: \"And so the US government must spend its money to go buy bonds again and--\" Trump: \"Well, if they can make good deals. If they can buy the debt back in good deals, you can buy it back in the market. If prices rise, they will always remain - and will always be given that opportunity. But no, I'm not talking about negotiating with people who have debts or creditors or anything like that.\" He tried to clarify his remarks in an interview with him on 9 May in CNN, and said that the media had misunderstood his comments. \"If interest rates rise and we can buy bonds again by discount, if we are sufficiently liquid as a country, we must do so. In other words, we can buy a debt recovered by discount,\" he said. \"People said I wanted to go buy debt and default, and these people are crazy.\" Experts told Politi Fact in May that Trump's statements were unclear and that he confused the concepts of \"discount,\" \"refinancing\" and \"renegotiation.\" (We have given a more detailed discussion of the consequences of what appeared to be argued in this article.) Paulo Mauro, a senior colleague at the Peterson Institute of International Economics and a visiting professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey University Business School, said that he had been asked by Politi Fuckett in May. On the night of the first presidential debate, Dean Baker, an economist working at the Left Economic and Policy Research Centre, said that Trump's comments \"were meaningless.\" \"The United States has the strongest credit rating possible because it has always paid its debt,\" he said. \"He will pay a heavy price if he tries to negotiate a reduction. We will pay higher interest rates for many decades to come. More importantly, the ratio of interest payments to (GDP) at low levels for 50 years is hard to see why anyone is trying to do so. Le Crandall, chief economist of ICAP, a company that analyzes Federal Reserve operations, economic data and treasury funding trends, said the New York Times. \"Why should they? They have a contract \"need a full payment. Our referee, Clinton, said Trump once suggested that he would try to negotiate a reduction of national debt. In two separate interviews in May, Tramp suggested that he could do something to negotiate federal debt through \"discount\" and that he was \"refinancing debts\" and \"rebuying debts against - a discount.\" He retracted his criticism by saying that his words had been misinterpreted. We're mostly assessing this claim right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2325dbd2-1cfb-4756-b276-26655f0a104e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04266"}
