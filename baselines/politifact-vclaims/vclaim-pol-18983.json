Many Republicans, on the other hand, say President Donald Trump should pick Ginsburg\u2019s successor immediately. The debate is a replay of a fight that took place in 2016, when a seat came vacant during President Barack Obama\u2019s last year in office.\nInvoking another period in history, a Facebook post claims that Ginsburg herself was nominated and confirmed to the court a little over a month before an election.\n\"Fun Fact,\" the post says. \"RBG was nominated and confirmed 43 days before an election.\"\nThis is inaccurate.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But those were not the 42 (or 43) days \"before an election.\" Ginsburg\u2019s nomination and confirmation happened the year after the national election.\nThe process began about eight months after President Bill Clinton won his first presidential election.\u00a0\nClinton announced Ginsburg as his Supreme Court nominee on June 15, 1993, to fill the seat vacated by retiring Justice Byron White. The Senate received the nomination on June 22, and on Aug. 3, 1993 confirmed Ginsburg as an associate justice on the court with a vote of 96-3. That was 42 days after the Senate received the nomination.\u00a0\nWe rate this post False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18983"}
