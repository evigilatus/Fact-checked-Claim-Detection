In Fairfax County, Va., a wealthy county, just 350 miles away, life expectancy was nearly 82 years, an 18-year differential. The life expectancy gap for women in the two counties was 12 years.\"\u00a0\nWas Sanders right? We took a closer look. (Sanders\u2019 campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)\nLet\u2019s start by noting that the two counties are indeed at opposite ends of the income spectrum.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, McDowell County, in the heart of Appalachian coal country, has a median household income of $25,595, about 44 percent of the national median household income of $57,652.\nBy contrast, Fairfax County, located in the affluent suburbs of Washington, D.C., has a median household income of $117,515, or slightly more than double the national median.\u00a0\nSo median household income is more than four times higher in Fairfax County than it is in McDowell County.\nWhat about life expectancy?\nThe longest-running data on life expectancy by county in the United States is compiled by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. We used the institute\u2019s interactive database to find the most recent data for both of the counties Sanders mentioned.\nHere\u2019s a summary for 2014, the most recent year available:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe data shows that life expectancy is a few years longer than Sanders said for men in McDowell County \u2014 67 instead of 64 \u2014 which in turn makes the gap for men between the two counties 15 years, rather than the 18-year figure Sanders cited.\nFor women, Sanders also is slightly off \u2014 there\u2019s an 11-year gap rather than a 12-year gap.\nBut while Sanders is a bit off on the numbers, his overall point is sound. In fact, not only can people in Fairfax County expect to live longer than those in McDowell County, but the gap between the two has been widening for nearly four decades.\nThis chart shows life expectancy for men, women, and both in the two counties since 1980. Figures for McDowell County are shown in red, and figures for Fairfax County are shown in green. It\u2019s easy to see the trend lines going in opposite directions.\n\n\u00a0\nIt appears that Sanders\u2019 comparison actually emerged more than five years ago, in a New York Times article by Annie Lowrey. She wrote:\nFairfax County, Va., and McDowell County, W.Va., are separated by 350 miles, about a half-day\u2019s drive. Traveling west from Fairfax County, the gated communities and bland architecture of military contractors give way to exurbs, then to farmland and eventually to McDowell\u2019s coal mines and the forested slopes of the Appalachians. Perhaps the greatest distance between the two counties is this: Fairfax is a place of the haves, and McDowell of the have-nots. \u2026\nOne of the starkest consequences of that divide is seen in the life expectancies of the people there. Residents of Fairfax County are among the longest-lived in the country: Men have an average life expectancy of 82 years and women, 85, about the same as in Sweden. In McDowell, the averages are 64 and 73, about the same as in Iraq.\nOur ruling\nSanders said, \"In 2014 ... in McDowell County, W.Va., one of the poorest counties in the nation, life expectancy for men was 64 years. In Fairfax County, Va., a wealthy county, just 350 miles away, life expectancy was nearly 82 years, an 18 year differential. The life expectancy gap for women in the two counties was 12 years.\"\u00a0\nA few of these numbers are slightly off, but Sanders\u2019 overall point that there is a large gap in life expectancy between the two counties is solid.
