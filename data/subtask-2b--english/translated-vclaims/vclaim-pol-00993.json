In particular, the United States Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who is the first candidate in a large and unstable field of Democrats seeking to run for 2020 (Rolling Stone, CNN, Vanity Fair). That's how Gardner attacked Harris. Gardner made his comments during this part of an interview with Ryan Warner of Colorado Public Radio (emphasis is ours): \"Well, if you look at the people who will run against those who will receive the democratic nomination, these are the people who have adopted higher taxes, more regulations. They want to undo much of the progress that has been made in the economy for people throughout our country who have been able to take more of their salaries. We've heard social medicine efforts, people who want to take 150 to 160 million people insurance. I don't support that. We've heard a lot of talk about the things they want to do, this -- crawl, crawl ever -- towards socialism, and I think it's the wrong direction for our country.\" Warner: \"I think these people who want to take people's insurance away, as you say, may formulate it differently, and say they want to make sure that there is--\" Gardner: \"Well, they didn't. I mean, listen to what Kamala Harris said. She said, \"Let's get rid of it.\" Those aren't my words. That's what she said. When it comes to securing someone in this country, she said, \"Let's just get rid of it.\" That doesn't make up. These are her words on national television.\" Warner: \"I think the idea, though, is to make sure that people are covered in terms of health care. Do you have any doubts -- \"Gardner: \"You'll take their insurance away. Now, you can't put words in her mouth. What she said was, \"We'll take their insurance away.\" That's what she said. Before we go into what Harris said, or didn't say, it's important that we understand medical care for everyone, and that's what Gardner gets with his comments. \"Medical care for all\" is a proposal by the American Senate (Bernie Sanders), who has also announced his candidacy for the democratic candidacy for the presidency. The Sanders Plan would establish one national health insurance programme covering all those living in the United States. It will replace all other types of insurance, including insurance provided by the employer, medical aid and ultimately medical care. \u2219 (Read our interpreter about what medical care is for everyone, and what isn't) In her campaign launch speech, Harris said: \"I run to declare, once and for all, that health care is a fundamental right, and we will deliver that right with medical care for all!\" Since then, she has defended her support for medical care for all. What Harris said was that Gardner's spokesman confirmed that Gardner was referring in his interview to comments made by Harris at the municipal hall in De Moyen, Iowa, two weeks ago. This event was hosted by Jake Taber and broadcast by CNN. On January 13, 2021, in a story written by General David Berger, commander of the United States Navy, Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security was rejected, and he said to her, \"We are not working for you.\" Does this solution include cutting insurance companies as we know them out of the equation?\" Harris: \"I think the solution -- and I actually feel so strong about this -- is that we need medical care for everyone. That's the point.\" Momentarily thereafter, Taber noted that Harris was a co-sponsor of the Sanders Medical Care for All Bill, and exchange continued. \"I think that's gonna take out your insurance completely.\" So, for people who love insurance, they can't keep it?\" Harris: \"Well, listen, the idea is that everyone has access to medical care, and you don't have to go through an operation through the insurance company, and you're not gonna have to go through the insurance company. From us didn't have that attitude, where you should wait for approval, and the doctor says, well, I don't know if your insurance company would cover this? Let's get this over with. Let's move on.\" The differences between what Harris said and what Gardner said at the literal level, Gardner misquoted Harris. You never said, \"Let's get rid of it,\" or \"We'll take their insurance away.\" Harris said, \"Let's remove all that,\" referring to approval and the waiting process for the need to pass through a private insurance company. However, through universal medical care support, Harris calls for the disposal of the private insurance market. In this sense, Gardner is right that Harris supports changing the health-care system for many people. However, it failed to make it clear that it supported the replacement of their health care with something else, not the complete removal of health care. As reported by The New York Times, Harris \"Presley\" referred to the termination of private insurance, which attracted attacks from Republicans and triggered a debate between the two democratic parties. The Times said that her assistants later quickly said that they would also support changes in less severe health care. However, as CNN stated, \"Harris's desire to consider alternative ways to a single payment system should not cast doubt on her political commitment.\" In response to Gardner's claim, Harris' spokesman told us: \"The medical care for all supported by the Harris Bill will give all Americans access to insurance.\" The Governor Gardner says Harris said, \"We'll take their health insurance away.\" Gardner's reference to Harris' notes was in CNN City Hall. Gardner was determined that's what Harris said, but that's wrong. Harris asked for support for medical care for all, for the elimination of private health insurance, and criticized various aspects of private insurance and said, \"Let's get rid of all that.\" The context is clear. However, Harris does not support medical care for all, which would end the private health insurance system. But where Gardner was silent is that Harris' plan supports the creation of one, a national health insurance programme that would cover everyone. People are gonna change health insurance. We appreciate Gardner's statement half correct.
