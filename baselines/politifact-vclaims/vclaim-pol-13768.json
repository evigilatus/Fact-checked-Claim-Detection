Greg Walden says nearly half the incoming Republicans are newcomers to politics", "text": "Members of the U.S. House of Representatives as well as the chamber\u2019s groupies love telling anyone who\u2019ll listen how it is the \"people\u2019s house,\" a sometimes raucous and befuddling chamber of 435 members whose backgrounds and ideologies are a cross-section of the entire nation.\n\nThis year especially, the preferred message is that your representative is probably like you -- hard working, honest, genuine, young and old, educated and not. He or she, the thinking goes, has come to Washington on a noble journey, the furthest thing from the most hated label of all - career politician.\n\nRepublican Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon seemed to suggest all of that and more when he made this point while delivering the Republican weekly radio response on Nov. 13: \"The incoming Republican freshman class \u2013 well, it\u2019s no ordinary group: nearly half of its roughly 80 members have never served in elective office before.\"\n\nThis theme has even more power this year in the wake of the Tea Party movement\u2019s success and its assertion that Washington is the problem; that it\u2019s populated by free-spending, self-serving career politicians. And as Congress gets ready for serious work it\u2019s the fuel for Republican energy in the House.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a look at the numbers to see if the impression Walden paints holds up.\n\nWhen the House convened Jan. 5, 85 newly elected Republicans were sworn into office. (The total is different from Walden\u2019s because some races were undecided when he spoke. Back then, not all Republicans had been declared winners. Also, Republicans claim 87 new members were sworn in. But two arrived at the tail-end of the previous Congress)\n\nOf the 85, 32 Republican freshmen never held a publicly elected office before, according to the National Republican Campaign Committee, which helps elect Republicans to the House. (Not every one of those 32, however, is a complete novice. At least three worked previously as congressional aides or at the White House, one is on the Republican National Committee\u2019s executive committee and at least two raced unsuccessfully for other public offices in the past.)\n\nIn real terms, that means 38 percent of the newest Republicans in the House never held elective office before. If you base the calculation on information known at the time Walden spoke, it\u2019s still about 36 percent. Either way it\u2019s a bit of a reach from \"nearly a half,\u2019\u2019 as Walden suggests. By comparison, only one of the nine Democrats newly elected to the House could claim to be a political neophyte.\n\nWalden\u2019s staff says he used two sources for his claim. A column in the website PoliticsDaily that flatly said - without offering any support or attribution - that 35 new Republicans came from non-political backgrounds. The second source was the National Republican Congressional Committee, which according to Walden\u2019s office, said 32 had never held elective office before.\n\nThe final number is 32.\n\nDoes this really matter? Not really. As they say for the stock market, past performance doesn\u2019t predict future actions. The same is true in Congress, where members often find themselves taking positions and votes that they did not envision while running for office.\n\nAnd that does nothing to diminish the truly diverse background of the incoming class of the 112th Congress. The new Republicans include Tim Griffin of Arkansas, a former assistant U.S. attorney; Robert Dold of Illinois owns a pest control business, was a White House aide and once managed an Internet data storage concern.\n\nThere are farmers and surgeons and airline pilots. There is Michael Grimm of New York, who owns a health food store and was an FBI agent and Jon Runyan who, before arriving in Washington, was an All-Pro offensive tackle in the NFL. There\u2019s alsoJames Lankford of Oklahoma, who worked as a religious youth camp director before winning election to the House.\n\nAll of this is interesting and supports Walden\u2019s claim that the new GOP class in the House brings considerable non-political experience. But the gap between 38 percent and Walden\u2019s suggestion of \"nearly half\" is simply too wide. For this reason, we rate his claim Barely True.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTed Ferrioli\n\n\nstated on April 26, 2011 in an opinion column\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Public Employee Retirement System is making more millionaires than the Oregon state lottery.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Janie Har \u2022 June 16, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on this item.\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
