Most of them did not object to this fact, saying it was a necessary anti-fraud measure. We had previously estimated it to be \"right\" \"claimed by Milwaukee Ald.\" \"In its current state, this law is the country's most restrictive voter identification law.\" He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2021, however, the Republicans made several changes that cast doubt on whether it was still more restrictive, or just one of the most restrictive. However, in the weeks leading up to the approval by the State Assembly of the amended procedure on May 11, at least one of the supporters of the photographic identity cards in the State Senate placed Wisconsin in a completely different light. (The Senate was on the verge of final approval of the bill on 19 May 2011. \"Wisconsin is one of the few states in the country that currently do not need a photographic identity.\" We heard from two Molton voters -- Gil Hallstad of Chippewa Falls and Jim Dunning of Iaw Claire -- who said they received Molton's messages between late March and mid-April. Both said that they questioned the need for an identity card for photographs in the ballot boxes. Similar statements were made by others, including Sinn. Alberta Darling and R-R-R-R-R-Hales. \"I think most people just want to get the case off the table and say, yes, we must have an identity for voting. Most states have an identity to vote.\" Darling said WTMJ-TV (channel 4) a reporter for the 11 May 2011 story. Darling did not say \"Foto,\" so her statement cannot be equated with Multon's statement. However, this is what the bill requires and supports, so its suspension may have left the viewers with the impression that it means that most states have a photo identity for voting. The Molton statement was simple and frank. As well as our assessment, since we've come this way before. The final source of updated information on voter identification requirements in each state is the electronic directory of the non-partisan National Congress of state legislatures, \"Conditions for the identification of voters.\" So is it true that Wisconsin is one of the few states that lacks a photo ID base to vote? In fact, it's the opposite. According to the group, only eight states are currently requesting or requesting an identity card with a photo of the vote. The 9th state, Kansas, will require a photo ID as of 2012, which we found. (The Wisconsin Act will also enter into force in 2012, unless the court issues an injunction. There are 18 other States that need some form of identification, but they do not have to include a picture. This number will move to 19 in July 2011 when Oklahoma election officials begin to request an identity photograph, according to the group. These figures can change further in the coming months. According to the Brennan Research Centre for Justice, 37 states, including Wisconsin, have considered or considered the Voter Identity and/or Citizenship Act in recent months. But Wisconsin is currently in a very large group of states that don't need a photo ID to vote -- not \"one of the few\" who don't vote. Most States do not require or require an identity card with a photograph. The Multon office told us that they accidentally erred in the founding speech and ignored the allegation in recent letters. Elise Nelson, one of Molton's assistants, gave us a copy of the revised letter that she said was out on May 10, which does not include the previous claim. However, it does not correct it either, so the recipients may have the impression that the previous allegation is a fact. Nelson said she didn't know where Multon's office came from with the original claim. - The bottom line? - Mm-hmm. As Wisconsin was about to enact the photo identification requirement to vote, Multon said the state was only one of a few without one. However, since senators are ready to cast their final votes, most states still do not need a photo ID to vote. According to his office, Multon &apos; s claim to the voters was a distant goal. We assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13076"}
