Romney says \"I\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anyone.\" As he says that, these words appear on the screen: \"Under President Obama: $4,000 tax hike on middle class families.\"\n\nThe ad doesn\u2019t say when this tax hike will take place or point to any plan from Obama to raise taxes on the middle class. In this fact-check, we\u2019ll explore the roots of this claim and whether it\u2019s what the middle class can reasonably expect from a second Obama term.\n\nThe ad references a study from the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. The study focuses on the national debt, and in particular, on the payments needed to cover the interest on that debt. What the authors, Matt Jensen and Aspen Gorry, try to do is figure out how those payments might be spread across different income groups.\n\nThe $4,000 figure comes from the results for households making between $100,000 and $200,000 a year. The study found that interest payments on the new debt added in Obama\u2019s first term equal $1,600 for this group. It then takes the president\u2019s 2013 budget plan and projects it out to 2022. It calculates that the added payments during this period would total $2,400. Add the two and you get the number in the ad, about $4,000.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem with saying the study describes a tax hike: It doesn\u2019t. It describes a cost that must be paid, but that is entirely separate from the question of how it is paid, by whom and when. We\u2019ll get into some of the details in just a bit.\n\nA quick way to see the gap between the study and reality is to look at the $1,600 figure for Obama\u2019s first term. By the logic of the Romney campaign, these households already would have seen an increase in their tax bills by that amount. In reality, those families enjoyed a variety of tax breaks during that period, from lower payroll taxes to tax credits for college tuition.\n\nThe ad also puts responsibility for the whole $1,600 amount on Obama. As PolitiFact has shown, even with full accounting for the cost of the stimulus, the rising debt stems in part from policies that predate Obama, such as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the economic recession that began before he took office.\n\nLet us note, none of this is a criticism of the study. One of the authorities on economic modeling is economist Alan Auerbach at the University of California Berkeley. The study\u2019s lead author, Matt Jensen, cites Auerbach. We asked Auerbach what he thought of the study.\n\n\"I don\u2019t see any obvious flaws in the way the calculations are done,\" Auerbach said. But he also called the work \"hypothetical\".\n\nThe Romney campaign took an analytic exercise and presented it as concrete reality.\n\nThis shift shows up in the different words used by the American Enterprise Institute and the campaign. The headline on the institute\u2019s web site is \"Obama\u2019s big budget deficits could mean a $4,000 a year middle-class tax hike.\" \u00a0The operative word is \"could\". The Romney campaign web site is less restrained. It says the cost of the debt under Obama \"would require an additional $2,500 in taxes.\"\n\nMore reasons to be cautious with the study\n\nOne of the study\u2019s assumptions is that tax revenues will cover future deficits. That drew a criticism from Jason Peuquet, research director with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors strong efforts to reduce deficits. \u00a0Peuquet calls the study a useful exercise but says its approach is too narrow.\n\n\"It only looks at the tax side of the equation,\" Peuquet said. \"In reality higher debt could mean much lower spending on certain programs. Including spending in the equation could produce very different distributional outcomes from these illustrative scenarios.\"\n\nWilliam Gale, a Brookings Institution economist who worked in the first Bush White House, expands on that point. Obama \"might cut spending, he might raise taxes differently than the study's assumptions, he might let the debt ride,\" Gale said. In short, the study is not a prediction of the future.\n\nOur colleagues at Factcheck.org have noted that deficits would continue to rise under the House Republican budget plan championed by Romney\u2019s running mate, Paul Ryan. In their fact-check, they fault the Romney campaign for glossing over that Republicans too would add to the portion of taxes that would need to go to service the debt. The increase under the GOP plan would be much less than under Obama but it would still be an increase.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Romney campaign ad says Obama\u2019s policies are a $4,000 tax hike on the middle class. But their evidence is a study from the American Enterprise Institute that looks at public debt.\n\nThe campaign makes a giant leap when it assumes the debt will be serviced with increased taxes on all income levels and in the time frame it suggests. We actually don\u2019t know how the tax code will spread around the pain of paying for the debt; right now, Obama is proposing tax increases only on higher income households.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
