Hemant Mehta, whose pen name is \"The Friendly Atheist,\" \u00a0had this to say after reading that Banks School District students are released from classes in the middle of the day for religious instruction:\n\"In Oregon, students are skipping math class to learn about the Bible.\" He added, \"There\u2019s a law in Oregon -- it\u2019s been around for decades -- that allows public school students to skip classes for up to two hours a week (or five if they\u2019re in high school) in order to get \u2018instruction in religion.\u2019\"\nStudents are skipping math for religious instruction? PolitiFact Oregon took a look.\nThe Analysis\nWe emailed Mehta, who saw mention of a religious instruction law in a story that ran in The Oregonian on March 10, 2014.\nMehta said he didn\u2019t doubt the law existed. His problem with it, he said, is missed instruction time. \"In my experience, most students who miss significant time do not perform as well as their classmates,\" he said.\nTo find out more about the law itself, we emailed Portland attorney Warren Foote, local chapter president of the Christian Legal Society, a group of legal professionals who incorporate Christian principles into their practices.\nFoote, noting that his practice doesn\u2019t focus on First Amendment or religious freedom issues, said he hadn\u2019t heard of the law. His subsequent research showed that ORS 339.420 was enacted by the 1965 Oregon Legislature.\nThe law, amended twice since, requires parents to apply to have a child excused from school \"for periods not exceeding two hours in any week for elementary pupils and five hours in any week for secondary pupils to attend weekday schools giving instruction in religion.\"\nFoote said he could find no other legislative history on how it came into being.\nWe called Judy Busch, executive director of PREP4Kids, a Portland-based nonprofit that coordinates release-time religious instruction for about 30 area schools, Banks among them.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor legal specifics, she referred us to Herb Grey, a Beaverton attorney active in conservative causes such as Oregon Right to Life.\nGrey said he lacked detailed information on the origins of ORS 339.420 but suspects it was a reaction to the landmark 1963 U.S. Supreme Court case that banned Bible-reading in American public schools.\n\"Ever since then, courts have generally ruled that these release-time laws are legal,\" he said. \"They\u2019ve said you can\u2019t get school credit for them, but you can certainly have them.\"\nCrystal Greene, the state Education Department's communications director, said no numbers are kept on total student involvement in these programs statewide. However, an Internet check shows that numerous Oregon school districts incorporate the law into their policies.\nWe visited the Multnomah County Law Library and learned that ORS 339.420 was part of House Bill 1020, introduced and eventually passed in 1965.\nThe records we examined turned up no detailed information, such as House Education Committee minutes for any hearings held on the bill. We did learn that a young Portland state senator, Vic Atiyeh, sat on the Senate Education Committee that eventually approved the bill. Then-Gov. Mark O. Hatfield signed it into law March 25, 1965.\nHaving at least blown some of the dust off the law, we wondered about the other part of Mehta\u2019s claim: Are students skipping math to get that instruction?\nWe called Banks schools Superintendent Bob Huston, who has the final say in the amount of time students spend in religious study since it\u2019s specified in the law. What he can\u2019t control, he said, is exactly which part of the day the instruction takes place.\nHuston, working with district parents, has agreed to carve out the last hour of the day for students to receive off-site religious instruction. Asked whether students are missing math to do that, he replied, \"No math class is at the same time for every student.\"\nIn other words, a student whose math class is at the end of the school day would miss that class, while other students are missing other subjects.\nIt\u2019s important to note that parents must grant their permission for students to miss school for religious instruction. As part of that, we looked at Mehta\u2019s use of the word \"skipping\" to see whether that implies students are truant. But none of the definitions we consulted directly equated \"skipping\" with an unexcused absence.\nThe Ruling\nHemant Mehta, a Chicago teacher and moonlight blogger, recently wrote that a decades-old Oregon law has resulted in public school students \"skipping math class to learn about the Bible.\"\nAn Oregon law passed in 1965 does let children out of school for weekly religious instruction. Under ORS 339.420, hundreds of students are receiving anywhere from two to five hours of religious instruction a week, depending on their age.\nWe also found that at least some of the students who miss classes for religious study are missing math class, with their parents\u2019 permission.\nWe rate Mehta\u2019s claim True.\nReturn to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on our ruling.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08114"}
