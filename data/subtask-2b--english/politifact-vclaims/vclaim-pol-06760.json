Walker's statements to date at that time. Subsequently, the governor disavowed his previous endorsement of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. We revisted his position in an item published March 6, 2015, with a new ruling of Full Flop.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0The left-wing group Media Matters for America cried flip-flop after Gov. Scott Walker bluntly told ABC News he opposed \"amnesty\" for illegal immigrants living in the United States.\nWalker, the group said in blog post, previously had supported a pathway to citizenship advocated by lawmakers in Washington, D.C.\nWith Walker garnering plenty of attention amid a crowded field of potential 2016 GOP presidential candidates, let\u2019s put this one to the Flip-O-Meter.\nOur standard disclaimer applies: The Flip-O-Meter is not designed to say whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. Rather, it strictly looks at whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views on a topic.\nIn this case, we have visited Walker\u2019s statements on immigration before, notably in August 2013, when we examined how Republicans were framing the issue in the wake of President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election win with strong support from Hispanics.\nIn the past, Walker has been hard to pin down on the question, and has made seemingly contradictory statements.\nSo we were struck by Walker\u2019s direct language and tone Feb. 1, 2015 in the \"This Week\" interview with ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz.\nRaddatz: \"We know you want to fix the border and fix the immigration system, but what would you do about the 11 million undocumented who are still here?\nWalker: \"I think for sure, we need to secure the border. I think we need to enforce the legal system. I'm not for amnesty\u2026\"\nIn making the comments, did Walker change his position?\nHere are some key past statements he\u2019s made, all in 2013:\n-- At a February 2013 national conference hosted by Politico, Walker said fixing the legal immigration system should come first, but said the next step is we \"gotta embrace\" a \"legal pathway\" for those here unlawfully. He did not elaborate on what he meant.\n-- In a July 2013 interview with Wausau (Wis.) Daily Herald staffers, Walker said \"it makes sense\" that people could not only stay here but get citizenship with the right mix of penalties and waiting periods and other requirements.\n-- In 2013 and later, Walker didn\u2019t endorse any specific bill in Congress that would have allowed illegal immigrants to stay here. But at the Politico conference, he didn\u2019t dismiss legislative action if some \"nuances\" were addressed.\n-- At that conference he flatly opposed deporting people who are here unlawfully, saying \"you\u2019ve got to find a way to make it legally possible for people moving forward.\"\nSoon after Walker\u2019s reported comments sympathetic to some kind of path to citizenship made headlines, he started to walk back the idea he had supported such a thing.\nHis spokesman told us in August 2013 that Walker had endorsed no specific policy or bill. And Walker said in November 2013 on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe that he had not meant to back a pathway.\nNow let\u2019s revisit the recent ABC interview in more depth.\nIn that interview, Walker also said, \"I\u2019m not an advocate of the plans that have been pushed here in Washington\" to allow those here to remain.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s arguably more dismissive than he\u2019s been before. But Walker added that he would roll out a plan of his own to address the issue.\nAnd he tossed in what sounded like softening remarks, saying \"we\u2019ve got to have a healthy balance. We\u2019re a country both of immigrants and of laws. We can\u2019t ignore the laws in this country, can't ignore the people who come in, whether it\u2019s from Mexico or Central America.\"\nFinally, Walker told Raddatz he was not advocating deporting the estimated 11 million undocumented residents in the country.\nHe summed up his position this way: \"I am saying in the end, we need to enforce the laws in the United States, and we need to find a way for people to have a legitimate legal immigration system in this country, and that does not mean amnesty.\"\nWhat to make of Walker\u2019s remarks?\nWalker campaign spokesman Tom Evenson said they were consistent with his past comments on what to do with those living here illegally. Walker does not consider the penalty-laden pathway to legal status that he endorsed in 2013 \"amnesty,\" and he\u2019s not advocating amnesty now, he said.\nFor help, we turned to two groups advocating on this issue.\nAn advocate with a group that backs a path to citizenship agreed Walker\u2019s comments were vague, but detected a change in his words and actions.\nLynn Tramonte, deputy director of America\u2019s Voice, noted Walker said nothing in the spirit of his 2013 comments on finding a way, eventually, to allow people to stay.\nHis goal \"is to be as vague as possible so that he can court hard-right anti-immigrant voters while remaining viable in the general election,\" she said.\nTramonte said Walker has indirectly backed deportations by joining a lawsuit challenging President Obama\u2019s authority to issue a November 2014 executive order on immigration.\nThat order protected from deportation some 4.1 million parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents who have lived in the U.S. for at least five years, and hundreds of thousands more young people.\nWe also spoke with Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). The group is a leading critic of legalizing the status of people who jumped the line to get in.\nWalker\u2019s description of his views as anti-amnesty doesn\u2019t necessarily mean much, Mehlman said. Republicans, even if they want to find a way to let illegal immigrants remain here, reject the \"amnesty\" label for political reasons, he said.\nOn the substance of Walker\u2019s remarks, Mehlman said that, coming in such a brief exchange, Walker\u2019s comments were too cryptic to really evaluate his position.\nMehlman\u2019s view: Walker really hasn\u2019t backed away from his 2013 statements, so in they eyes of FAIR, he still supports what some might term amnesty.\n\"Politicians from both parties who support granting legal status to millions of illegal aliens go to great pains to define what they support as something other than amnesty,\" he said.\nOur rating\nWe don\u2019t see a Full Flop by Walker here.\nWalker didn\u2019t directly disavow his 2013 remarks -- or repeat them for that matter. And the truth is that we don\u2019t really know whether he has a completely new position, because he wasn\u2019t asked to clarify his views in detail. All we know is he\u2019s not going to call his plan \"amnesty\" when it comes out.\nWe do see inconsistencies in Walker\u2019s framing of his views and the tone of his remarks as he begins to court conservative GOP primary voters -- including leaving a tough-sounding impression about handling illegal immigrants.\nOn the meter, inconsistent statements or a partial change of position earn a Half Flip. That fits here.\u00a0\n------\nMore on Scott Walker\nFor profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06760"}
