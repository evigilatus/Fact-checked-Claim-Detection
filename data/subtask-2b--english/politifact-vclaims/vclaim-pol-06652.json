The vote was a blow to a GOP-led threat to strike back at President Barack Obama for his executive action on immigration.\nAll 10 Georgia Republicans voted \"No\" on the funding bill, which passed 257 to 167.\nSome Republicans wanted to add provisions to the bill to gut the legal protections that the president, by executive order, called to provide to as many as five million illegal immigrants.\nBut after threat of a partial agency shutdown created a backlash, House Speaker John Boehner and the majority quietly capitulated Tuesday. They passed a ''clean'' funding bill with no immigration provisions.\nU.S. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Gainesville, was among those who voiced frustration.\n\"It\u2019s not what I would like to see,\" Collins said.\nWhy, Collins asked, was the president willing to jeopardize funding for the Department of Homeland Security for \"a proposal that frankly he himself has said 22 times he couldn\u2019t do?\"\nSound familiar?\nIt\u2019s a claim PolitiFact has checked more than once and one that Republicans have repeated multiple times. The 22 citations were included in a blog posted by Boehner\u2019s office in November and shared with us this week by Brendan Thomas, Collins\u2019 spokesman.\nOn Nov. 20, Obama announced he would delay deportations of illegal immigrants who have lived in the country more than five years, have children who are citizens or who have green cards. This would allow more than 4 million people to qualify for work permits and avoid deportation for three years, provided they each pass a background check and pay a fee.\nThe president\u2019s decision, which the GOP has denounced as an abuse of power, is on hold based on a temporary injunction from a federal judge in Texas.\nOur PolitiFact Texas colleagues checked the list for claims by politicians from that state.\nAll of the citations in Boehner\u2019s post were compared by PolitiFact Texas to transcripts and news stories. The majority of the examples are of Obama saying he did not have power to do more on immigration without Congress. Others, as we\u2019ll explain in a moment, say something more nuanced or aren\u2019t specific to immigration.\nWe won\u2019t go through every quote that supports Boehner\u2019s point here, but here are a few we culled from a document created by PolitiFact Texas:\n\n\nIn September 2012, Obama was asked if he would follow up his recent protective move for students by doing something similar for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that \"as the head of the executive branch, there\u2019s a limit to what I can do\u2026 we\u2019re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally,\" as in parents deported. (No. 13 on Boehner\u2019s list.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a presidential debate in October 2012, Obama and Mitt Romney were asked: \"What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society?\" Obama said: \"I've done everything that I can on my own.\" (No. 14 on Boehner\u2019s list.)\n\n\n\n\nIn a January 2013 Telemundo interview, Obama was asked why he couldn\u2019t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had served law-abiding students. \"I\u2019m not a king,\" Obama replied, akin to his response the same month to a similar query from Univision. \"You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. And-- you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws-- we\u2019ve got some discretion. We can prioritize-- what we do. But we can\u2019t simply ignore the law.\" (No. 16 on Boehner\u2019s list.)\n\n\nSo clearly there are examples of Obama saying he couldn\u2019t do more with executive action, then later doing exactly that. That\u2019s why PolitiFact previously rated Obama\u2019s claim that \"my position hasn\u2019t changed\" as False.\nWhat should not be counted\nAlso included on the list of 22 are quotes where Obama was either suggesting his executive powers did not have hard limits or was silent on his executive power on immigration. Here are a few problems with quotes included on Boehner\u2019s list.\n\n\nIn two instances during his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama criticized \"signing statements\" used by President George W. Bush that interpret laws, but he did not bring up immigration. Immigration was also not part of his reply to a question at a 2010 MTV/BET event when he said, \"I can\u2019t simply ignore laws that are out there,\" in response to a question about \"don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\" \u00a0(Nos. 1, 2 and 5.)\n\n\nIn September 2011, with his deferred-action plan on the horizon, Obama reiterated that he cannot just change laws unilaterally in response to a question about possible administrative relief for students who don\u2019t have legal residency. But he hinted that there might be room within his authority, saying, \"what we can do is to prioritize enforcement, since there are limited enforcement resources.\" (No. 12 on Boehner\u2019s list.)\n\n\nStephen W. Yale-Loehr, a New York immigration attorney, reviewed the GOP citations for PolitiFact Georgia and concluded a number referred to \"deferred action,\u2019 which, he said, \u2018is not changing the law.\n\"It is simply prioritizing who should be targeted for deportation, for example serious criminals,\" he said. \u00a0\"... most legal scholars believe that these executive actions fall within the limits; they do not exceed them.\"\nKennesaw State University political science chair Kerwin Swint said the 22 statements \"do indicate the president felt, at the time, that immigration authority should go through Congress.\n\u2018But, funny how circumstances change change one's principles,\" Swint said. \u2018When his party lost control of the Senate in 2014, he felt like he had no other choice but to use executive authority.\" \u00a0\n\u00a0Our ruling\nCollins \u00a0said this: President Obama said \"22 times\" he could not authorize immigration reform by executive order.\nObama did say that more than a dozen times. Other times it was something more nuanced or not specific to immigration.\nThe broader point -- that Obama said one thing about executive action but did another -- is accurate.\nWe rate Collins\u2019 statement as Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06652"}
