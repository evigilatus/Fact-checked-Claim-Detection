Emissions need context.", "text": "In a speech at the annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council in Austin on 14 August, United States Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said that the United States was on the right track when it came to balancing energy needs and environmental concerns. \"The United States is now leading the world in both oil and natural gas production, while reducing energy-related emissions,\" said Perry, addressing those present at the meeting. The Council is a business-supported organization that writes model legislation for conservative legislators in different states. He said, \"This is a story that no one often tells.\" \"These 190 countries that signed this Paris Agreement, I say to them, \"when you follow us around reducing emissions, then you talk to me about joining.\" Our attention was drawn to Perry's claim for energy production and emissions. Could the United States lead other countries in energy production and reduce emissions? Michael Webber, director of the Webber Energy Group at the University of Texas in Austin, said that Perry's claim on oil and gas production was accurate, but his comment on emissions could use some context. \"It's exciting. In any case, as I understand it, that first phrase is quite correct, \"Wiper said, the author and professor who specializes in energy and mechanical engineering. \"Statement II can be true, but the boy, there are many details and warnings on this subject.\" We have resorted to energy information management to obtain international data on energy production. Environmental impact assessment is an independent entity within the Ministry of Energy that produces data on energy use. The Environmental Energy Agency spokesman Dennis Messina refused to comment specifically on Perry &apos; s claim, but provided available data on energy production and emission reductions from countries around the world. One source provided by Messina showed that the United States produced more oil and natural gas - both independently and in aggregate - than any other country in 2018. In fact, the United States has led natural gas production since 2011, when it crossed Russia. In 2018, Saudi Arabia exceeded oil production, according to environmental impact assessment information. At the same time, however, the United States remained the largest energy consumer in 2018 and experienced a 3.5 per cent increase in consumption compared to the previous year, the fastest energy consumption growth in the country in 30 years, according to the analysis of the World Energy Statistical Review 2019. This increase in demand has been seen worldwide, with China, the United States and India achieving the greatest growth, according to analysis. However, the Director of the Environmental Energy Agency, Linda Capuano, said that the country's energy industry was entering a \"transformational time\" to testify before the Sub-Committee on Energy and Water Development of the United States House in February. \"More than decades after the United States has imported energy than it has exported, the environmental impact assessment now expects our country to become a net exporter of energy in 2020,\" according to its prepared comments. Notwithstanding this prediction, the most recent data available show that the United States produces more oil and natural gas than other countries, as Perry said. Part two of Berry &apos; s claim lacks details. It did not provide a baseline or timetable for its claim - does it consider year-to-year emission reductions? Is he looking at reductions over five years? We can look at different periods of time to feel progress, and we can look at the transformations of the past five, ten or fifteen years. But we can also consider the emission reductions that occurred during the period of time when the United States led to oil and gas production, as Perry said in his claim. The United States has led natural gas production since 2011, but has led to gas and oil production since last year. Shelain Heinz, Press Secretary of Berry, referred to a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) detailing the long-term trend towards emission reductions as well as projections for future emission reductions. \"The United States is leading the world in actual volume reductions of energy-related emissions compared to any other country since 2005,\" Heinz said in a statement. \"Yes, there have been fluctuations and flows (as in many years under Obama's administration), but the overwhelming trend is a decline.\" And Heinz is right that, in large-scale strokes, the United States reported a downward trend in CO2 emissions that increased CO2 emissions in volume compared to other countries. But there are more contexts that we must take into account. \"In the end, I think that's true,\" said Weber about Perry's claim. \"But if I was studying a class, I'd say it's not that simple and we have more to discuss.\" The environmental impact assessment referred to the global emission data of agencies, which consider CO2 emissions by country per year, 1980-2016. CO2 accounts for the largest percentage of GHG emissions. Using these figures, we have considered how the United States has reduced emissions over periods of five to ten to fifteen years (using the latest year in 2016) and how the United States compares with other countries. * From 2011 to 2016, the United States reduced its CO2 emissions by about 273.7 million metric tons, or by 5 per cent. * From 2006 to 2016, the United States reduced its CO2 emissions by approximately 738.6 million metric tons, a reduction of 12.5 per cent. * From 2001 to 2016, the United States reduced its CO2 emissions by about 586.9 million metric tons, or by 10 per cent. During each of these time periods, the United States achieved the largest reduction in 1 million metric tons of CO2, but dozens of countries achieved larger percentage reductions. It is important to take the absolute figures into account, but the percentages provide a different perspective when comparing the United States with the other nations, as they represent factors such as population, economic status and energy production levels. The EIA has not published emissions data since after 2016, but the World Energy Statistical Review 2019 contains figures up to 2018, which allow for analysis of emission reductions since the United States became a leader in both oil and natural gas production. Notwithstanding this, BP has an incorrect declaration stating that its data \"cannot be compared with official national emission data,\" but is considered a reliable resource by industry experts. From 2017 to 2018, when the United States became the main producer of oil and natural gas, the country experienced a 2.6 per cent increase in CO2 emissions. At the global level, there has been a 2 per cent increase in emissions, the fastest growth in the world in seven years, according to the report. Heinz referred to an environmental impact assessment report predicting future CO2 emissions - although the Berry Statement is limited to the present. The report predicted that these emissions would decrease by 2.3 per cent in 2019 and 0.5 per cent in 2020. Our rule, Perry, said: \"The United States is now leading the world in producing both oil and natural gas, while reducing energy-related emissions.\" It is true that the United States is the main producer of oil and natural gas as of 2018, but the second part of Perry &apos; s claim needs more context. When we retreat and consider transformations over the past five, ten and fifteen years, the United States has reduced total CO2 emissions more than other countries, but dozens of other countries have made larger percentage reductions. From 2017 to 2018, the United States has already increased its CO2 emissions. We're assessing this claim half right. The truth is now - the statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or leaves things out of context. In an interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \"falled in Houston in five days more than in Niagara Falls in one year.\" These additions did not affect the provision.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00223"}
