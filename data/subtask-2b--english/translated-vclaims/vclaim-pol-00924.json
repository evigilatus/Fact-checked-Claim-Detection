Ron Desantes gets a \"historic commitment\" from Trump to help Hurricane Michael?", "text": "The White House issued a press release stating that President Donald Trump ordered on March 10 that the federal government would cover 100% of the costs eligible for debris removal and emergency protection measures for 45 days after Hurricane Michael. This doesn't affect our judgment. In his campaign for governorship, Ron Desantes promised Florida voters that his personal relationship with President Donald Trump would bear fruit for the state. Just over two months after Desantes took office, he claims he already got it. DiSantis used part of his first state speech on March 5 to broadcast \"historic commitment\" news from the Trump administration to help repair parts of the Panhandle hit by Hurricane Michael in October. \"I have already travelled to Washington, D.C., and obtained a historic commitment from the Trump administration to help the communities that Michael hit,\" said Desantes. Is that right? Part of the answer, Polyte Fact Florida, was found, depending on a handshake agreement between the Governor and the President. The other part of being \"historical\" is easier to understand and wrong. DiSantis met with Tramp after Michael entered the surroundings of Mexico Beach, and Federal Emergency Administration officials said that the Federal Government would pay 100 per cent of the costs of debris removal and emergency protection measures for a period of five days. Thereafter, 75 per cent of the costs will be covered by the Federal Government. Desantes asked Trump to extend federal coverage by 100% for 45 days. Desantes wrote to Trump that the country had already spent $1 billion. Disantis met with Trump at the White House in January and said that Trump agreed to his request. However, the agreement between Tramp and Desantes remains oral. The spokesman for Desantes Helene Aguirre Ferry told Paulette Fact Florida that the state had no written confirmation, and the Union Media Relations headquarters had not responded to our requests for days. Shortly after the publication of our initial examination of the facts, a Federation spokesman told us that the Agency was aware of the Desantes Declaration on the increase in the share of federal costs and that the request was under implementation. She did not provide details. The local governments we talked to are moving forward as if the deal had been made. For example, Bay County was provided for reimbursement on 8 March. The provincial spokesman for Valerie Sally expected that the project would be covered by the current federal quota of 75 per cent and that it would be adjusted to subsequent projects if or when the federal quota was adjusted. According to Sally, her district was heard from an official of the Cuban Armed Forces, Nelson Santos, who said that the Federation was working to record the change in the federal register. We contacted Santos via e-mail to confirm that. \"The only assurance I have made to Bay County Councillors is the extension for 5 to 45 days,\" Santos, FEMA delivery manager, said Politi Fact in e-mail. \"The cost share has not yet been formally identified or determined.\" The best answer we can get from the Federation of Cuban Women by the deadline is that Desantis &apos; s application is still in progress and is pending. On January 11, 2021, in Nancy Belusi's newspaper, the Speaker of the House of Representatives was no longer Samantha Butterman. On January 12, 2021, the extension will be \"the game changer,\" the chairman of the Bay Philip County Committee \"Gruff\" Griffiths told Polity Fuckett, saving the county's taxpayers there's an estimated $85 million. Tanya Castro, director of Mexico Beach, who had suffered serious damage, said that her city had received oral advice from State officials and the Federation of Cuban Women that she would receive the full amount she would pay, but did not have any official documents. The mayor of Mexico Beach Al Kahwa praised the efforts of Desantes to assist his coastal community, including $2.8 million in State funds to clean up the debris. To date, the Foundation has provided approximately $2 million for cleaning. But Kahm said his city needed more money. \"We need it quickly,\" he said. \"History \"? It doesn't really assume that the extension will happen, it's not as historical as Desantes abandoned. In 2017, Trump authorized 100 per cent coverage for Puerto Rico for 180 days after Hurricane Maria. The period of time was subsequently extended to 90 days for debris and 60 days for emergency preventive measures. It also authorized 100 per cent coverage of emergency protection measures by the Virgin Islands for 30 days after Hurricane Irma. Trump then extended his request for 60 days, either to remove the debris or to take emergency preventive measures in response to Hurricanes Maria and Irma. Trump wasn't the first boss to do this. President George W. Bush gave permission to extend it, which provided 100% coverage for months in Louisiana and Mississippi. Steve Ellis, Vice-President of the Public Awareness Taxpayers, said that the Stafford Federal Act allowed the President to reduce or eliminate the share of costs incurred by local or state entities, as Ellis had said. Ellis said, \"I don't call that historical.\" \"It's been done before.\" When the DiSantis office told us what we knew, it made it clear that this was the first time in Florida's history that a newly elected Governor had received the President's commitment to increase coverage by 100% from five days to 45 days. \"We are not aware of any time in Florida's history where the hurricane received this number of days versus 100 percent other than the three storms of 2005, which were considered a group,\" said Ferrie. \"This is a historic extension of Florida. (Joff) Desantis has the obligation of the President of the United States, who is the only one who can authorize it.\" At the same time, some federal legislators expressed frustration that, despite the efforts of the two chambers, the budget package signed by Tramp in February to end the closure did not include any disaster relief. \"Florda Panhandle needs help now, not six months on the road,\" said the U.S. Republic of Neil Dan, a Republican from northwest Florida. \"I have already travelled to Washington, D.C., and received a historic commitment from the Trump administration to help the communities that Michael hit.\" DiSantis did not provide any details in his speech, but he was referring to his efforts in January to make Tramp extend the Federal Government's period of time for debris removal and emergency protection measures from five days to 45 days. DiSantis got an oral commitment from Trump to make it happen, but we couldn't confirm it with FEMA. The spokesman for Desantes says that \"historic obligation\" is that such an extraordinary extension of Florida. But we found that it's not unusual for the president to lay out extensions even for months that the federal government will receive the entire account. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong. This fact-finding process was updated shortly after its publication with an official comment from the Federal Department of Women &apos; s Affairs. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/125fd840-1bff-4f8e-871f-da10d3146307", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00924"}
