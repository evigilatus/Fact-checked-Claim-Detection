The \"University of Wisconsin Oskosh\" programme for English Professor Duke Biesta, which describes himself as an educator. \"The state of California now moves on to the assumption that kindergarten teachers teach 15 different sexes at every kindergarten school in California,\" says Biesta. This article has been circulated since it was first published by the media in Freedom Project in January. One of the videos we found, shared by another group on May 28, was highlighted as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that the video claim was old and misleading. The video prepared by the Duke of Health Education in California stems from the framework of the Health Education Curriculum developed by the California Department of Education, which provides guidance to school districts K-12. In 2018, the Department issued draft revisions that were open to public comment. The document, which takes hundreds of pages, provides guidance on many health topics, such as nutrition and physical activity, injury prevention, alcohol and drugs, and, yes, gender. While the LGBT community commended the new recommendations, the sections on sexual and gender education raised some criticism. For example, a video of Biesta was recorded in a section on the gender lessons of kindergartens through third-grade students. However, it does not properly explain the guidance. The framework states that many children have faced gender stereotypes in kindergartens. \"The goal is not to cause confusion about the child's sex but to develop awareness of the existence of other expressions,\" says the Framework. The framework proposes lessons and activities, such as showing pictures of children who do not conform to stereotypes, and inviting adults who may be home-based parents or firefighters to visit the classroom. The purpose of these lessons is to dispel mythology and link families with resources to help prevent bullying. The document mentions many books that can help, and Dr. Duke's presentation focused on one in particular. On February 8, 2021, in the Facebook newspaper Michelle Obama, she received a PhD after leaving the White House. \u2022 February 9, 2012, book : Who are you? The children's guide to gender identity, \"Some people say there are only two sexes. But there are many sexes. I'm... a girl boy alike not just me! You're the one who says, 'cause you know the best. For some people, adults have guessed right about their body and gender. This is called cisgender when the identity of a person corresponds to his or her sex at birth. For some people, there are more than two options. These are just a few words used by people: transsexuals, non-mixed people, sexual fluids, transsexuals, gender neutrals, genders, neutros, pride, third sex, spirits... and there are more words that people use to describe their experiences. This is called the gender spectrum.\" Melina Severefer, a psychiatrist with a gender identity programme in Colombia, said that there were in fact more than 15 terms to describe gender identity and some overlap. The idea of the proposed book did not continue. On 8 May, following objections by some parents to sex education or gender lessons, the State Council for Education removed several recommended books on sex or gender, including \"Who are you?\" While the book is still mentioned in the framework document as of April, a spokesman for the State Ministry of Education told us that he would add a concession saying that he was in the process of making the expected revisions within two months. However, even when the book was included in the document, there was no indication that it was a compulsory kindergarten lesson throughout the state. That wasn't the point. The book was cited as a potential resource that could be shared with parents and caregivers: \"parents, guardians or pastoralists receive a charity that includes suggestions on how to initiate a dialogue on growth and development with their children. Books like it's not Stark! A book on girls, boys, children, bodies, families and friends by Ruby Harris (2008) or who are you? The Children &apos; s Guide to the Gender Identity of Brooke Bissen Wedby (2017) can be shared.\" The Free Media Project went beyond the proposed draft reading list, writing that the gender lesson is mandatory and referring to State policy that parents cannot choose their children from gender identity programmes. But that's not true either. Under the California Youth Health Act, parents can choose not to engage in sex education. The law does not provide a means for parents to opt out of general LGBT education if the same lesson does not fall under the umbrella of sex education, which is sex activity education itself. For example, a lesson about Harvey Milk, who was the first elected gay official in California, will not be described as a sexual publication. Our Facebook article said, \"California teaches kindergarten there are 15 sexes.\" The recently published video in January criticized the California Health Curriculum Framework Project. At that time, the state document included some recommended books for parents, including \"Who are you? :: Children &apos; s guide to gender identity The book contains a list of different terms of gender identity. However, it was not included in the State Directive as a compulsory school for teachers of all kindergarten students in California. The debate is also out of date, which some Facebook groups may not know. On May 8, the California Board of Education decided to remove the book, among other things, and the State is in the process of updating the document containing the book list. We're assessing this statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00577"}
