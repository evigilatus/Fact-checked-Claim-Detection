They are suffering from the EPA, which places enormous burdens on farms,\" Cruz said, \"On March 29, CNN said a municipal hall in Milwaukee, Wes. \"For example, the water in the U.S. is the base (he) where EPA tried to define a drainage pond or trench on your farm as navigable waters and thus subject to huge environmental rules.\" Is the ponds and the drain trenches organized by the EPA? We'll go through the search to find out. Cruise's spokesman didn't answer our questions to check the facts. What the water base said about the pond is the Clean Water Act, passed in 1972 following major disasters and pollution problems, including the Koiahuga River fire in Ohio and fish killed in Lake Tunutussa in Florida in 1969. The aim of this law was to regulate the discharge of water, but over the years, industry groups and environmental advocates discussed which water bodies should be included. The decisions of the United States Supreme Court in 2001 and 2006 created uncertainty as to the applicability of the law. In May 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency announced a new rule aimed at clarifying which water bodies fell under the law. However, within months it was suspended throughout the country pending litigation and remained pending until the writing of this fact check - a key point that Cruz ignored. The essence of the base was not the size of the aquatic bodies, but whether the water body could carry pollution into other larger waters. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wishes to regulate tributaries, pools, streams and wetlands to prevent businesses, farms or other entities from dumping waste into water. Before finalizing this rule, EPA called on the public to make comments, and the Al-Barakah became a point of discussion for conservatives and business defenders who destroyed Al-Qaida as federal abuses. In order to clarify matters, the latter rule explicitly addressed the question of the pool: \"The proposed rule did not expressly exclude the pool because the agencies never considered the pool to meet the minimum standards of 'United States water', which is an inaccurate term. The pond is usually considered a very small, shallow, and very expressive pond of water formed on a pier or heights during or after a rain storm or similar precipitation event. However, many commentators requested that agencies explicitly exclude them in a rule. The last rule does that.\" The U.S. Farmer &apos; s Union argued that Al-Qaida language was so loose that it could eventually include something that wasn &apos; t much larger than a pond. According to spokesman William Rodger, the ponds can be classified as \"sea basins\" or \"wetlands\" and thus fall under the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. \"We stand by our assertion that the pond - as the average person usually understands - can be organized under the US Water Rule,\" said in response to our questions about Cruz's statement, but many environmental experts told Politi Fact Florida that they were skeptical that EPA would end up organizing the pond. In his interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry said that Hurricane Harvey \"more water fell in Houston in five days than he went over Niagara Falls in one year.\" \"There are no cases in this regard because agencies have never confirmed their jurisdiction in such remarkable cases.\" The Environmental Protection Agency had previously interpreted the Clean Water Act to include jurisdiction over trenches but sought to clarify the new rule that also excluded the pool. Most trenches are not regulated by the rule, according to EPA. Here's what he says about the trenches: \"Al-Qaida continues with the current policy of regulating trenches built in rafts or transferred to other rafts or, under certain circumstances, draining wetlands, or which science clearly proves to be working as rafts. These waters under jurisdiction affect the chemical, physical and biological safety of watercourses. This rule also reduces the confusion and inconsistency with regard to the regulation of trenches by excluding certain categories of trenches, such as trenches that flow only after the rains.\" Farmers fear that trenches that flow only during or after the rains will be classified in a way that puts them under enforcement. This concern was raised by Dave Lobsack of the United States at a congressional hearing on 22 March. The Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy, said that even if it rained hard and looked like tables everywhere, these tables were not counted. \"It must only be something built or natural that can really affect sewage. After that, there was no connection, \"McCarthy said. The Environmental Protection Agency wrote in response to comments on trenches: \"The agencies do not intend to increase the number of trenches under jurisdiction. In fact, by clarifying and expanding specific exceptions to trenches, agencies expect that more trenches will be clearly excluded compared to previous regulations and guidelines relating to United States waters. \"Our government said Cruz, \"An EPA has attempted to define a drainage pond or trenches on your farm as navigable waters and therefore subject to huge environmental rules.\" The environmental protection agency &apos; s water base specifically excludes the ponds. It applies only to trenches that are built outside streams or trenches that operate such as streams that can carry pollution into sewage. Cruz ignores the courts &apos; suspension of the water base in 2015 pending litigation. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05182"}
