That\u2019s one we hadn\u2019t examined yet, so we decided to check it out.\n\nFirst, we contacted Obama\u2019s campaign to get sources behind the claim. They didn\u2019t get back to us. We also reached out to Romney\u2019s people, who\u00a0had no\u00a0response.\n\nThe Urban-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center did give us an answer, however.\n\nThrough the Romney campaign website and email exchanges with campaign policy advisors, the Tax Policy Center has issued an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of\u00a0Romney\u2019s \"Fairer, Flatter, and Simpler\" tax plan.\n\nAccording to the center, Romney\u2019s economic advisers say that the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) would be reverted back to the Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE) tax credit if Romney is elected president this year.\n\nHOPE was\u00a0among\u00a0higher education tax\u00a0incentives\u00a0initiated\u00a0in 1997 to combat soaring college expenses. Along with the Lifetime Learning Credit, and a deduction for tuition and fees, federal tax subsidies for college students jumped from zero -- before their enactment -- to roughly $6 billion in 2005-2006.\n\nIn 2009, an Obama-backed Congress enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which temporarily replaced the 1997 tax\u00a0credits with\u00a0the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which was\u00a0worth more, and available to more families, through a few changes:\n\n- It increased the amount of student expenses that were eligible for the credit and the types of expenses allowed; the\u00a0AOTC\u00a0credit includes expenses for course-related books, supplies and equipment that are not necessarily paid to the educational institution.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- It extended coverage to a student\u2019s first four years of school--versus just the first two years allowed by HOPE. After the first two years under the HOPE plan, the student switches over to the Lifetime Learning Credit for their last two years of college.\n\n- It made the tax credit partially refundable. The tax credit is worth up to $2,500 of the cost of tuition, fees and course materials paid during the taxable year, or $10,000 over four years. A cool 40 percent of it, up to $1,000 a year, is refundable, so money became available to more low-income students, even if they owed no taxes. In contrast, the HOPE and LLC credits are nonrefundable.\n\n\"It's basically more generous,\" said Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate with the Tax Policy Center, referring to the American Opportunity Tax Credit.\u00a0\n\nBoth of the tax credits currently exist, but they can\u2019t be used together.\n\n\"No one would\u2019ve opted to take the HOPE over\u00a0AOTC,\" Rosenberg added.\n\nIRS statistics show that in one year, the number of tax returns claiming education credits increased, from\u00a02008, when 7,740,979 households claimed some education tax credit totaling $7.6 billion, with HOPE, to\u00a02009, when 10,598,706 households claimed total credits of $10.8 billion, with\u00a0AOTC.\n\nAlthough the American Opportunity Tax Credit was only intended to be temporary, President Obama\u2019s annual budget proposals extended the tax credit through 2012 and proposed making it permanent, Rosenberg said.\n\nIf Romney were elected, however, he would allow it to lapse as scheduled under current law.\n\n\"The\u00a0AOTC\u00a0was only ever enacted as a temporary provision, so that\u2019s slated to expire with a lot of other tax related things at the end of this year,\" Rosenberg said. \"Absent of any further legislative changes, the\u00a0AOTC\u00a0would expire. Without anything else happening, the HOPE would again be available for people to take up.\"\n\nBut does allowing a tax credit to expire warrant Obama\u2019s characterization as \"elimination?\"\n\n\"There\u2019s always a sort of debate,\" Rosenberg said. \"People change the way they phrase it depending on how they want it to look, whether an expiring tax provision, to expire as scheduled, is action or not.\"\n\nEither way, if no action is taken on the American Opportunity Tax Credit, it puts an end to to the program.\n\nObama has used this a major talking point in his campaign. In some\u00a0ads, he has been as vague as to say that Romney will \"eliminate the tax deduction for college tuition.\" And he has tried hard to characterize Romney\u2019s budget as favorable to the rich and weakening the middle class, including on the topic of\u00a0education.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that even though Romney would allow the credit to expire, that doesn\u2019t mean all tax deductions for college students would be lost.\n\nIf Romney does not renew the American Opportunity Tax Credit, students would revert back to using the less generous, nonrefundable alternatives. Because the four-year program is refundable -- it gives something back to students who don\u2019t have enough income to owe taxes -- losing it would impact the lower income population.\n\nBefore the American Opportunity Tax Credit was created, low-income students could get little or no benefit from the two nonrefundable tax credits available. And critics complained that they didn\u2019t really impact college enrollment, because it provided subsidies for people who would have pursued secondary education anyway.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRomney\u2019s campaign has said that the former Massachusetts governor will not renew the American Opportunity Tax Credit if he is elected in November. And because it\u2019s slated to expire at the end of 2012, it would no longer be available to college students and their families if no action is taken to extend it, as Obama has done since it was enacted in 2009.\n\nBut the AOTC is not the only tax deduction out there for students, as Obama\u2019s ads may lead voters to believe. So while Romney would allow the deduction to end, it does not mean all college tax deductions would be lost. In fact, it would revert back to a previous program that has been in place since 1997. As a result, we rate Obama\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10468"}
