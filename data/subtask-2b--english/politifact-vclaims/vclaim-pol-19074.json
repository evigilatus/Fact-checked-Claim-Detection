Or did he?\nIn a Feb. 2 post, one user wrote that her student loan debt had mysteriously vanished.\n\"Wow, just checked my Credit Karma and Biden really did wipe away my student loans $20k worth of debt,\" the user wrote. \"God is good!\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A few other Facebook users shared in the celebration, so we wanted to check this post out.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nDuring his presidential campaign, Biden promised to make federal student loan payments more affordable for Americans \u2014\u00a0particularly people with low incomes and public servants. But those plans have not yet come to fruition, and Biden hasn\u2019t said he\u2019d cancel student loans for everyone.\nHere\u2019s what Biden promised:\n\n\n\"Forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities and private HBCUs (historically Black colleges and universities) and MSIs (minority-serving institutions) for debt-holders earning up to $125,000.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Include in the COVID-19 response an immediate cancellation of a minimum of $10,000 of federal student loan debt.\"\n\n\nForgive \"$10,000 of undergraduate or graduate student debt for every year of national or community service, up to five years.\"\n\n\n\"More than halve payments on undergraduate federal student loans by simplifying and increasing the generosity of today\u2019s income-based repayment program.\"\n\n\nBiden has extended a pause on federal student loan payments, but none of the executive orders he has signed so far follow through on his campaign promises. In December, he said it\u2019s \"pretty questionable\" whether he\u2019d have the power to forgive up to $50,000 of debt via executive order.\nCongress has not passed legislation canceling student loan debt, either.\u00a0\nOn Jan. 20, the day of Biden\u2019s inauguration, the president introduced a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. Among its provisions are $1,400 stimulus checks for most Americans, an unemployment insurance supplement of $400 per week and an increase in the federal minimum wage.\u00a0\nStudent loan debt forgiveness is not mentioned in the plan. Neither loan forgiveness nor a payment pause were included in the December relief package.\nWe can\u2019t speak to what may have happened to the Facebook user\u2019s student loan debt, but the post that credits Biden for wiping it away is inaccurate.
