Jabbard, the representative of the United States of America from Hawaii, Mahir, said: \"We must take seriously the security of our elections because of the weaknesses that exist - which still exist - and which have the capacity to undermine our democracy. There is a piracy conference held each year in Las Vegas, where I believe a 14- or 15-year-old girl from Florida hacked into the same version of Florida's electoral system in less than 15 minutes. What we found were some signs of weakness - even if it was not a direct threat to the voting system itself. At least one kid did some quick hacking. However, there are two points that pose a problem for Jabbard's claim. First, there was no piracy on a replica of the electoral system - there was a website that seemed to be the website of the Foreign Minister of Florida reporting on the results of the initial elections. In other words, it is not the system that obtains and calculates actual votes. Secondly, what was hacked was not even a replica - as in a precise version of the site - because it did not contain the special security features of the Secretary of State's website. As the National Association of State Secretaries stated at the time: \"while undeniable websites are vulnerable to pirates, websites reporting on elections at night are used only to publish preliminary and informal results for the public and the media. Locations are not associated with counting equipment and the actual results of the elections cannot be altered.\" In addition to the fact that Russia is breaking through Florida, in addition to being a large swinging state, Florida is important because Russian pirates were able to access at least one electoral computer network in Florida District during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on Russian intervention in that campaign. The province was not named. (Florida Goff) Ron Desantes said that two local electoral offices had been breached prior to the 2016 elections, but he was not allowed to name the provinces. The Republican Governor confirmed that while the provinces had experienced \"interference in the supervision of election networks,\" no information had been manipulated or altered, and that voter information that had been a public record could be obtained in any case. In August 2018, her campaign released a news article on DEFCON 26, an event on piracy and cyber security held in Las Vegas in August 2018. As part of the annual event, children between the ages of 8 and 16 could try to break through what DEFCON described as replicas of election sites in 13 battle states, including Florida. On January 17, 2021, President Donald Trump stated in an interview with Fox News that he \"cannot say anything (about riots in the American Capitol Building) because the platforms have removed it.\" Both ended in less than 15 minutes. :: Children &apos; s states have not been designated As Devkon said, the purpose was not to: \"By exposing the cyber-vulnerability of these sites, young contestants will compete for awards in a number of categories, including proposing the best plan to defend the Secretary of State's websites from cyber attacks.\" However, let us be clear: while websites may report election results and have other voting information, they are not used to obtain or count actual votes. One of the articles, from PBS Newshor, said an 11-year-old boy hacked into the Florida website and changed the voting results in less than 10 minutes. An 11-year-old girl tripled the number of votes in the same location in about 15 minutes. In other words, penetration of the State's electoral website could cause confusion if the results were manipulated. But this isn't the same hack into the election system and actually changing votes. With regard to the compatibility of hacked sites with actual sites, ProPublica published an article shortly after the DEFCON conference confirming that the sites hacked by children were not replicas of state electoral sites. \"Instead, the students worked with the similarities created for the event that had weaknesses trained to find it,\" said ProPublica. \"The organizers provided them with fraudulent papers, and the adults walked the students through the challenges they would face.\" Josh Franklin, a former electoral expert at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and a spokesman at the DEFCON, was quoted as saying that websites were \"fake.\" He said, \"When I learned that they didn't use microcopies and pains weren't taken to replicate basic infrastructure better, I certainly felt sad.\" Similarly, after interviewing Jabbard, the oversight agency reported that the organizers of this department gave participants \"words\" from government election sites \"with weaknesses introduced by the organizers. In particular, sites have been designed to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, one of the oldest - yet still very common - ever.\" \"There is a piracy conference held every year in Las Vegas, where I believe a 14- or 15-year-old girl from Florida hacked into the same version of Florida's electoral system in less than 15 minutes. In less than 15 minutes, two 11-year-olds attending a piracy conference in 2018 were able to hack into a website that was similar to that of the Florida Foreign Minister's office reporting election results. Despite news reports using terms such as clones and faxes, the hacked site was not a copy of the Florida site and did not contain the same security features. Furthermore, the site that the pirates intended to target does not include the system used to receive and tabulate actual votes. The loose memory of the readers of Jabbard may give the wrong impression of the weakness of Florida's electoral system. We assess her statement mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00464"}
