William Westmoreland in 1969 when Carson was a\u00a0ROTC student leader in Detroit \u2014 in his books and comments throughout the years. But Carson never applied to West Point nor does Westmoreland\u2019s schedule place him in Detroit at the time Carson said he was, according to Politico.\nWhat\u2019s more, there\u2019s no such thing as a \"full scholarship\" to West Point, as everyone accepted to the five federal service academies receives free tuition in exchange for their service. When asked about discrepancy on ABC\u2019s This Week by host George Stephanopoulos, Carson said the academy itself uses the terminology.\n\"Wait a minute George, go look on the West Point website, and you\u2019ll see those specific words, \u2018full scholarship to West Point,\u2019 \" Carson said\u00a0Nov. 8. \"So even though it is, you know, given as a grant for anybody who gets in, those words are used. And if a recruiter or somebody who\u2019s trying to get you to come there or trying to get you to do that, those are the very words they will use. It\u2019s on their website.\"\nWe wondered if the words really are advertised on West Point\u2019s website.\nWe could not reach the military academy. Searching for the \"specific words \u2018full scholarship to West Point\u2019\" turned up no results on West Point\u2019s own website or on Google.\nThe official admissions page also makes no mention of a scholarship of any kind. Instead, it simply notes that \u00a0tuition, room and board, and expenses are fully paid for those who are selected to attend West Point.\u00a0The academy\u2019s diversity page, however, states that \"this four-year college experience is a fully funded scholarship.\"\nCarson\u2019s spokesperson told us that\u00a0West Point has referred to their benefits as a full scholarship in publications, a point Carson made in a Nov. 8 Facebook\u00a0post. He uploaded two West Point recruitment ads targeted at African-Americans that contain the word \"scholarship,\" including one from the 1960s, when he was a student. \u00a0\nWe also found examples of the words \"full scholarship\" used in publications that are linked on West Point\u2019s website, as well as some old recruiting advertisements:\n\u2022 A dataset from 2014: \"At the United States Military Academy all students receive a full scholarship, including room & board and medical- and dental-care are provided by the U.S. Army.\"\n\u2022 A prospectus from 2012: \"As a cadet, you are a member of the U.S. Army and receive a full scholarship and an annual salary of more than $10,000 from which you pay for your uniforms, textbooks, a laptop computer, and incidents.\"\n\u2022 An ad in a 1991 issue of Black Enterprise magazine: \"Each year about 1,400 young men and women take advantage of the opportunity to attend West Point on a full government scholarship, which includes tuition, room and board and medical care.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 An ad that appeared in a few issues of Ebony magazine in 1990: \"You receive a full scholarship, earn a degree from one of the country\u2019s finest colleges, and build a foundation for a challenging career of service to the nation.\" \u00a0\nThe financial benefits to attending military academies have been essentially described as scholarship-like or equivalent to a scholarship by USA Today, a West Point spokesperson in Forbes, and the Naval Academy.\nBut the term \"full scholarship\" is an inaccurate description, experts told us. The phrase typically refers to a college providing financial aid to allow a candidate to attend a college free of charge, but that doesn\u2019t really apply to West Point\u2019s across-the-board zero-tuition policy, said Antonio Buehler, a West Point alumnus who founded the admissions coaching service Abrome.\n\"No such scholarship is named, every cadet is treated the same and there is an eight-year military commitment after graduation. Hence, not free,\" Buehler said.\nThe proper terminology is \"appointment,\" said Vu Tran, a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy who runs the Denver-based admissions consulting firm Service Academy Coach. But because that\u2019s not apparent from the get-go, Tran says he can\u2019t fault Carson for using the term loosely, albeit incorrectly.\n\"I can definitely see where parents and students who are beginning the process can misconstrue it to be a scholarship,\" he said. \"But for those who have gone through the admission process and through the nomination process, they would never call it a scholarship.\"\nCarson\u2019s use of the words \"full scholarship\" is even more inaccurate if he\u2019s describing his own experience, experts agreed. Tran told us it\u2019s conceivable a\u00a0ROTC commander or even a general would encourage a student to apply to West Point, touting the free tuition, but noted that anyone familiar with the process understands that that\u2019s contingent upon nomination and acceptance.\n\"(Carson) would not have been \u2018offered\u2019 the opportunity to attend West Point at no cost, like all other cadets, until he applied and received an appointment, which he never did,\" Buehler said.\nOur ruling\nCarson defended his use of the word scholarship in discussing his recruitment to West Point, saying, \"Go look on the West Point website and you\u2019ll see those specific words, \u2018full scholarship to West Point.\u2019\"\nThe military academy has used the words \"full scholarship\" a few times in admissions literature and advertisements and in one place on its website.\nHowever, experts say Carson\u2019s use of the word scholarship doesn\u2019t properly explain the application and appointment process to West Point.\nCarson\u2019s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True.\nCorrection: After this story was published, we found an additional instance of the words \"full scholarship\" on West Point\u2019s website. The article has been updated to reflect that. The ruling remains Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05762"}
