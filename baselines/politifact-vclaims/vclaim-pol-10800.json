Led by Ald. Jim Bohl, in that short time frame, the public heard a barrage of unusual claims about their water, rat poison, and even their toothpaste.\n\nIndeed, we thought the debate over fluoridation of water had long been settled.\n\nSince 1953, the Milwaukee Water Works has added a tiny amount of fluoride to the drinking water. Many cities have done this for years to boost dental hygiene and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers it one of the most important public health efforts of the past 50 years.\n\nSome, including Bohl, have criticized the practice.\n\nThey raise a variety of arguments including that the government is introducing poison into the water supply. Bohl tried unsuccessfully to get the Common Council to end water fluoridation in Milwaukee, arguing the money saved -- about $540,000 a year -- would be better used for dental programs in the central city.\n\nBohl said that fluoride was a dangerous chemical, originally created for use as rat poison. Now, not only is it in the water, but also consumer products including toothpaste, he said.\n\n\"We all know that we do not have children or anyone swallow toothpaste,\" Bohl said at a City Hall news conference May 29, cited in this report on WUWM. \"And the reason we don\u2019t do that is because of the poison substance of fluoride. If fluoride was such an effective and non-harmful substance, why would we not encourage everyone to swallow their toothpaste?\"\n\nBohl elaborated in a May 30 interview with the Journal Sentinel editorial board: \"We\u2019re talking about a substance that\u2019s rated as more toxic than lead.\"\n\nThat got our attention. Poison in our toothpaste? Are folks putting themselves in danger when they polish their pearly whites?\n\nSome -- but not all -- \u00a0toothpaste contains fluoride, a substance known to prevent cavities. If it\u2019s ingested alone, fluoride can cause serious illness in humans. So, toothpaste is regulated by the U.S. \u00a0Food and Drug Administration, which limits the amount of fluoride allowed in the product.\n\nThat\u2019s why tubes of toothpaste with fluoride carry this warning label: \"If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately.\"\n\nApparently Bohl is not the only one who reads the fine print on their toothpaste tubes.\n\nFlouride calls are relatively common at the Wisconsin Poison Center, in part because of the warning label, said manager Cathy Smith. The agency, part of Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin, handles calls from around the state.\n\nExperts who field the calls determine the brand and type of toothpaste used and consult database to determine the concentration of fluoride in that particular product, Smith said. They then factor in the age and weight of the human and see if there\u2019s a problem.\n\nAnd here\u2019s where the scary talk from Bohl meets reality: Toothpaste doesn\u2019t make people sick.\n\n\"We have never, ever had a person who has ingested toothpaste, even a child, who has been referred to the emergency room,\" Smith said.\n\nHow much toothpaste would you have to swallow before you\u2019d be considered in any sort of trouble? A 30-pound child would have to ingest an entire six-ounce tube, according to the Poison Center.\n\n\"Kids, number one, don\u2019t eat that much,\" Smith said. \" And, number two, they\u2019d be puking it up if they did.\"\n\nIn part, that\u2019s because the product includes cleansers, detergents and other substances that would disagree with your stomach.\n\nBy the Poison Center\u2019s calculations, an adult would have to swallow about \u00a0four tubes of toothpaste before they\u2019d be a candidate for the E.R.\n\nWe checked with Froedtert Hospital, which has one of the busiest emergency rooms in the state.\n\nSpokeswoman Kathleen Sieja said that the hospital didn\u2019t track toothpaste-related ailments, but said she\u2019d check with a long-time doctor there to see if he had heard of anything.\n\nSaid Sieja: \"The emergency dept physician responded that in his 17 years, he has never taken care of a fluoride overdose.\"\n\nWe also checked with a few other sources, including toothpaste manufacturers, and found there\u2019s little for people to worry about.\n\n\"The amount of fluoride found in toothpaste is usually not swallowed in large enough amounts to cause harm,\" said an article on the New York Times Health section about how people should handle a possible fluoride overdose.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what Proctor and Gamble, the maker of Crest, says about toothpaste dangers:\n\n\"Occasionally swallowing a small amount of toothpaste is not a safety risk for adults or children. Our label cautions against swallowing because eating a large amount of toothpaste would be expected to cause nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Certain ingredients that are common in toothpastes have the potential to cause stomach irritation if enough is swallowed.\"\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the question of what is a poison. Here\u2019s what a couple of dictionaries say:\n\n-- A substance with an inherent property that tends to destroy life or impair health. Dictionary.com\n-- A substance that causes injury, illness, or death, especially by chemical means. The Free Dictionary.com\n-- A substance that through its chemical action usually kills, injures, or impairs an organism. Merriam-Webster.com\n\nA tube of toothpaste doesn\u2019t seem to fit any of these definitions.\n\nWe asked Bohl why he called fluoride a poison, and he sent us an email with links to more than a dozen websites that \"spell out the toxic nature of the substance.\"\n\nSome are from government sources, such as the Environmental Protection Agency. Others were from groups opposed to fluoride, even one by a blogger who writes about \"Energy healing program to boost the human aura, increase athletic performance and life extension.\"\n\nBohl turned to the dictionary as well -- to define the word toxic: 1) poisonous.\n2. manifesting the symptoms of severe poisoning. The FreeDictionary.com.\n\nFinally, we asked the Poison Center: Is fluoride a poison? Smith\u2019s answer: \"It can be toxic in certain situations.\"\n\nSo, with this item adequately scrubbed, let\u2019s put it to bed.\n\nIn raising a slew of concerns about the use of fluoride in Milwaukee\u2019s drinking water, Bohl said the public was being exposed to a dangerous chemical -- he called it a poison -- that is regulated by the feds.\n\nMany brands of toothpaste do contain fluoride, which is regulated by the feds. But saying toothpaste contains a poison, Bohl overstates his case and the alarm to the public. People generally don\u2019t eat and swallow toothpaste. And if they did, it would take a massive amount to be at risk from fluoride poisoning. In fact, experts say a kid would vomit out the toothpaste long before that point.\n\nWe rate Bohl\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10800"}
