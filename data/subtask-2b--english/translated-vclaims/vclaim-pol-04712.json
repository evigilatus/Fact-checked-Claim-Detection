At a gathering in Phoenix, he accused her of taking money from countries with a bad relationship with women and gays. \"I've given tens of millions of dollars by countries that treat women terribly,\" said Trump June 18. \"And countries that kill gays, kill gays, push them away from buildings.\" It appears that Trump, whose campaign did not respond to a request for comment, refers to contributions to the Clinton Foundation. Trump referred to her founding ties in the past, saying that she needed to \"refund $25 million\" Saudi Arabia gave the basis. The William J. Clinton Foundation was established in 1997. The Foundation agreed to disclose its donors when Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State in 2009. We wondered whether Clinton's donor list depended on Trump's claim. But first, it is important to note that political candidates cannot obtain funds from foreign entities. \"The prohibition contained in the Federal Electoral Campaign Act is against candidates or political committees seeking, accepting or receiving contributions from foreign nationals, not just from Governments,\" said Michael Malbin, a professor of political science at the University of Albany. As the spokesman for Hillary Clinton, Josh Schorin, noted, the former First Lady had played no part in the institution while she was the Minister for Foreign Affairs. \"In addition, it did not blink before standing in front of countries that suppressed their people and denied them their rights, from the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons to the rights of women,\" Shorin said. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. In view of the Clinton Foundation donor list, Saudi Arabia provided between $10 million and $25 million. However, the institution reported Saudi money in December 2008, and the amount has not changed since then. The spokesperson for the Clinton Brian Coxtra Foundation noted that Saudi Arabia had not given the Foundation as long as Minister Clinton worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Foundation also received between $1 million and $5 million each from Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. As stated by the Wall Street Journal, several of these contributions were received in 2014, after Clinton's term in the Foreign Office. We verified a similar claim earlier when President Raines Bribos of the National Committee said in April 2015 that Clinton had taken money from the kings of \"Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Oman and Yemen.\" Every country except Yemen has contributed to the Clinton Foundation, but Bribos' claim made it look like Clinton herself took the money. We've evaluated it half right. Women &apos; s Human Rights Watch tracks how women are treated in each of these countries. In Saudi Arabia, women need the approval of the \"male guardian\" for everything from obtaining a passport to applying for higher education. Nor do they enjoy divorce rights. The consent of the same man is required for marriage in the United Arab Emirates, in addition to the laws allowing the husband to assault his wife and children. In Qatar, marital rape is permitted. A woman needs a male guardian to agree to a marriage contract, and one of the laws provides that a wife must obey her husband. Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. \u2022 On 29 January 2021, in Oman, Human Rights Watch notes that despite the existence of a non-discrimination law, women continue to face discrimination when it comes to domestic issues such as child custody and divorce. According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual and Transsexual Association, in Saudi Arabia all non-marital sex, including same-sex intercourse, is punishable by death. For married men, the penalty is death by stoning. An unmarried man faces 100 strokes of whip. In Qatar, any sexual act outside marriage is punishable by the death penalty. The United Arab Emirates also prohibits sex outside marriage, and the death penalty may be applied to consensual \"sexual relations.\" With regard to Oman, homosexual acts are punishable by up to three years &apos; imprisonment. As for Tramp's claim that these countries are throwing homosexuals \"outside buildings,\" he may refer to the Islamic State. There is evidence that ISIS was involved in these acts, but in Syria. Executions in Saudi Arabia have increased specifically recently, but it is difficult to measure specific convictions and whether they relate to homosexuality. Not Clinton from the direct experts we talked to, they wondered if the Foundation's donations were directly attributable to Hillary Clinton. The Honorary Professor of Public Affairs at Indiana Leslie Linkosky University stated that Trump &apos; s claim was excessive. \"These were not donations to Minister Clinton per se, but to an organization with which she was closely involved (when she was not in office or looking for him), including acting as manager,\" Linkovski said. According to Brian Metendorf, an accounting professor at Ohio State University, non-profit organizations often have to take into account donor action when providing money. Risks are usually higher when non-profit organizations involve a political personality. \"These are not gifts for Clinton herself but for the institution that shares her name,\" he said. The United States remains allies with some of these countries, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, despite its poor human rights record. The Governor Trump said Hillary Clinton has given tens of millions of dollars by countries that treat women terribly... and countries that kill gays. Trump's comment oversimplifies the donations to the Clinton Foundation to make a quick attack against his democratic rival. It makes it seem as if Clinton personally received money from foreign governments with weak human rights records. However, political candidates cannot accept donations from foreign governments. However, many countries that have harsh rules for women and kill homosexuals have contributed to the Clinton Foundation before and after assuming office in the Foreign Ministry. We're assessing Trump's claim of half the integrity.
