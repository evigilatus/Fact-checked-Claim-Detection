He was buried in his hometown of Hope, Ark.\nConspiracy theories have raged for years that the Clintons actually had Foster killed for his knowledge of the Whitewater real estate deal or some other insight. President Donald Trump is among those who have questioned whether Foster actually committed suicide, despite five different investigations concluding he suffered a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nThe post, meanwhile, is fake, and has ended up on other fake news websites.\nIt says that U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., had ordered Foster\u2019s body exhumed. It cited a U.S. Navy officer as saying the forensics lab at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Va., determined Foster suffered two gunshot wounds, and his death should be reclassified as a homicide.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoster\u2019s body has not been exhumed, and there is no Naval Hospital in Norfolk \u2014 although there is a Naval Medical Center across the Elizabeth River in Portsmouth, which used to be known as Naval Hospital Portsmouth.\nThe post is accompanied by a photo that purports to be of naval forensics specialists, but actually is a handout photo from the Sacramento County (Calif.) Coroner\u2019s Office.\nThe story first appeared on March 22 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site that has been the source of several fake news stories that we\u2019ve previously checked. Their posts often end up being repurposed by many other websites that don\u2019t credit its origin, as is the case here.\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn\u2019t indicate this story or any other post is fake, but its About Us link notes that \"all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org has developed a regular cottage industry of writing about Foster\u2019s death. The site has previously written posts that said Gowdy had Foster\u2019s body exhumed, then that it went missing from the morgue in Norfolk, or that WikiLeaks has proof of a conspiracy surrounding Foster\u2019s death.\nThe assertion that Foster\u2019s body has been dug up, autopsied again and his death ruled a homicide is completely made up.\nWe rate this statement Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts   Politifact    6 7  Politifact Rating: Pants on Fire   \"Autopsy results from Vince Foster\u2019s exhumed body \u2014 Cause of death to be changed!\"    Internet rumors bloggers   in a headline Friday, March 24, 2017 03/24/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03475"}
