Both claim Ryan\u2019s budget cuts veterans programs by 24 percent, but The Atlantic cites as its source a March 2012 item in The Washington Post Wonkblog.\n\nThe Post article says that over 10 years, Ryan\u2019s budget would spend 13 percent less on veterans than Obama\u2019s budget.\n\nGanapathy said the two articles he cited claimed a 24 percent cut because that was the figure Post originally used. The Post article does say it was updated, but refers only to the 13 percent figure, so it\u2019s not clear whether 24 percent had been cited previously.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nBoth the Ryan budget and the Obama budget cited by the Post actually raise -- not cut -- spending on medical, disability, housing and other services for veterans by billions of dollars. It\u2019s just that Ryan\u2019s budget doesn\u2019t increase spending for veterans as much as Obama\u2019s does.\n\nTo be sure, there are fears that Ryan\u2019s long-term budget plans -- which largely aim to reduce federal spending -- could necessitate dramatic reductions in services.\n\nZerban\u2019s spokesman cited a March 2012 article by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington, D.C. think tank, about the long-term spending \"path\" traced by Ryan\u2019s budget. By 2050, the article claimed, \"most of the federal government aside from Social Security, health care and defense\" -- including veterans programs -- \"would cease to exist.\"\n\nBut Zerban didn\u2019t say Ryan\u2019s plan would someday cause veterans programs to \"cease to exist.\" What\u2019s more, that sweeping prediction is a measure of long-term outcomes, not actions in one-year budget increments.\n\nIndeed, many budget watchers point out that Ryan\u2019s long-term plan lacks enough detail to know where, and to what degree, specific cuts would occur.\n\nIn an August 2012 analysis, University of Maryland public policy professor Philip Joyce said the level of proposed spending cuts \"will require the federal government to stop doing lots of things that it does now.\" The cuts could be realized through a two-thirds reduction in, for example, doctors and nurses in veterans hospitals, the professor said.\n\nBut Joyce also said the lack of detail on cuts to federal services makes it \"impossible to know what the actual impact\" of Ryan\u2019s long-term budget would be.\n\nSimilarly, our friends at FactCheck.org observed in August 2012 that \"Republicans boast of cutting the deficit more than the president, but don\u2019t detail how what programs would have to be eliminated or reduced to achieve that. And the Democrats fill in the details, claiming popular programs like education are on the chopping block.\"\n\nOur rating\n\nZerban said Ryan supports \"cutting funding for veterans by 24 percent.\"\n\nBut Ryan\u2019s short-term budgets provide for spending increases for veterans services. And even if his long-term plans lead to spending reductions, there isn\u2019t enough detail to know whether and how much programs for veterans would be trimmed.\n\nWe rate Zerban\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10333"}
