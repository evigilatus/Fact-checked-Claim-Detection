That said, there have been some misconceptions about the mass graves.\nPosts about the grave site were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nFirst, mass burials didn\u2019t begin on Hart Island during the COVID-19 pandemic. The city has used the location as a public cemetery for over 150 years, burying unclaimed people and those whose loved ones can\u2019t afford private burials.\u00a0\nSecond, not all locals who die from COVID-19 are being buried there, as some posts have suggested. The site is still designated for deceased people with no known next of kin.\nBut as the city struggles with the mounting death toll amid the pandemic, burials on the island have dramatically increased in recent weeks.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are usually about 25 burials on the island each week, the New York mayor\u2019s press secretary Freddie Goldstein told CNN. But that number has climbed to nearly 25 each day.\nThe island\u2019s interment operation is managed by the city\u2019s Department of Correction, and inmates usually assist in the burials. But that has changed since the pandemic.\nDOC spokesperson Jason Kersten has said that city inmates are not currently involved with the burials: \"For social distancing and safety reasons, city-sentenced people in custody are not assisting in burials for the duration of the pandemic. Contracted laborers are performing this important work under DOC supervision,\" according to a report by the Gothamist.\nBodies are ordinarily held at the city\u2019s morgues anywhere from 30 to 60 days, Goldstein said. But to make room for the influx of deceased individuals during the pandemic, the city\u2019s medical examiner\u2019s office announced a new policy of holding unclaimed bodies for only up to 15 days before they are transferred to the island.\nOur ruling\nNew York City\u2019s Hart Island has been used as a public cemetery for unclaimed bodies since the 1800s, but the city\u2019s staggering death toll amid the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically increased the number of burials on the island.\u00a0\nSocial media posts about the burials are mostly accurate, but many need additional information.
