Trump for President, Inc., sent PolitiFact an email that corroborated the sisters\u2019 claim about reimbursement:\n\"The issue regarding Diamond and Silk is merely one of semantics, resulting from a reasonable misunderstanding of the Campaign\u2019s reporting obligations. The Campaign\u2019s payment to Diamond and Silk for field consulting was based on an invoice they submitted reflecting their costs for air travel to a Campaign event. The invoice was not supported by accompanying receipts, so as a technical matter, could not be reported as a reimbursement even though its purpose was to make them whole for their out-of-pocket costs.\"\nCraig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group, said, \"The payment sounds like a reasonable reimbursement of travel costs.\"\nBut he noted because the payment was not accompanied with receipts and was thus declared as payment for services by the Trump campaign, the activists \"are obligated to declare it as income and pay taxes on it.\"\nThat said, reasonable people can disagree about whether reimbursement for travel expenses constitutes \"pay\" or not.\nOur ruling\nPro-Donald Trump activists Diamond and Silk said, \"We have never been paid by the Trump campaign.\"\nThe social media ensemble received $1,274 from the Trump campaign.
