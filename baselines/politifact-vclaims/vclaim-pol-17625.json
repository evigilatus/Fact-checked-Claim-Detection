It is backed by a group of union and social justice organizations.\u00a0\nIf approved by voters, the\u00a0measure would hike taxes on factories, stores and other commercial and industrial real estate by requiring they pay property tax based on current market value rather than the value of the property when it was purchased. \u200b\nIt would raise an estimated $7.5 billion to $12 billion annually, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. The money would be distributed to schools and local governments.\u00a0\nThe proposed ballot measure, however, would not touch tax protections for homeowners.\u00a0\nYet many claims on social media suggest the initiative would repeal all parts of Prop. 13, stoking concerns that residential property taxes could spike.\nHere\u2019s one example posted on Facebook Dec. 31, 2019:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA similar Facebook post by Bakersfield Tuff, a media company focused on racing and rodeo, was shared more than 2,200 times. Others have appeared on the platforms Next Door and We Chat, according to the campaign for the initiative.\u00a0\u00a0\nDo these claims distort the truth? We set out on a fact check to find out.\nBackground on Prop. 13\nIn 1978, voters approved Prop. 13, which slashed property taxes and limited how much they could go up. It also tied tax rates to a property\u2019s purchase price, rather than to the fluctuations of California\u2019s real estate market, ensuring homeowners greater financial stability.\nThe law remains popular among homeowners and business groups, who argue it allows neighborhoods to stay intact and older residents on fixed-incomes to remain in their homes rather than being forced out by high tax bills.\u00a0\nGroups such as Californians to Stop Higher Property Taxes have warned that removing Prop. 13\u2019s commercial tax protections will lead companies to pass along any increased tax burden to consumers.\u00a0\nCritics of Prop. 13, on the other hand, say the law has cut too deeply into the foundation of tax revenue for local governments.\u00a0\nSocial Media Claims \u2018Completely False\u2019\nThe campaign spearheading the November ballot measure contacted PolitiFact about the social media claims.\n\"They are completely false,\" said Alex Stack, spokesperson for the initiative. \"It would completely protect and exempt all residential property, that means homeowners, renters and seniors.\"\nThat\u2019s backed up by the initiative\u2019s official title and summary prepared by the Attorney General\u2019s office. That document says the measure exempts \"residential properties; agricultural properties; and owners of commercial and industrial properties with combined value of $3 million or less.\"\n\u00a0\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra\u00a0(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)\nBecerra's Role\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe social media posts claimed Becerra \"was putting together plans\" to \"eliminate\" Prop. 13. There\u2019s no evidence to substantiate that.\u00a0\nBecerra and others attorneys general, however, have been criticized for drafting misleading ballot measure titles and summaries. For example, Becerra was accused of giving an earlier version of this measure a friendly write-up. But attorneys general do not initiate ballot measures. A spokesperson for Becerra declined to directly address the social media posts.\u00a0\nWesley Hussey, a political science professor at Sacramento State University, said the claim about Becerra planning to repeal Prop. 13 is clearly wrong and described the rest of the information as \"cleverly fuzzy.\"\n\"It\u2019s very intelligently written,\" he said of the posts, suggesting they may have originated with a political operative. \"Only one or two spots are wrong. A lot is political opinion.\"\nThere\u2019s no doubting the ballot measure\u2019s significance, Hussey added.\nIt would be \"a dramatic revision\" to Prop. 13. \"If passed, it would be by far the biggest change we\u2019ve seen\" since voters approved the law, he said.\u00a0\nKeith Smith is a political science professor at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, where he studies elections and voting behavior.\u00a0\nHe agreed the claim about Becerra was technically wrong. But given that the initiative represents a big change to Prop. 13, some voters may see it as \"a gateway\" to repealing the measure altogether.\u00a0\nAsked if social media posts were accurate, he replied: \"It depends on your perspective. Is [Prop. 13] going away? No, it\u2019s not going away. Is [the ballot measure] proposing to do away with some aspect of Prop. 13 that currently exists? Yes.\"\nThe claims published on Facebook and other sites, Smith explained, could be more convincing to voters than any details in the ballot measure.\u00a0\nEarlier this month, ABC 10 Sacramento examined similar claims and found there\u2019s no effort to eliminate Prop. 13.\nAdding to the confusion about the proposed November ballot measure, there\u2019s a voter initiative on California\u2019s March primary ballot called Proposition 13, the School and College Facilities Bond. But it has nothing to do with the landmark measure of the same name passed four decades ago. A spokesman for the California Secretary of State\u2019s Office said that the numbers assigned to propositions are reused through the years, sometimes leading to duplicates.\u00a0\nOur Ruling\u00a0\nSocial media posts claimed a November ballot measure would repeal California\u2019s Prop. 13, and that Attorney General Becerra \"is putting together plans\" to eliminate the historic law.\u00a0\nThe proposed measure would undo Prop. 13\u2019s tax protections for commercial and industrial properties with a value over $3 million.\u00a0\nIt would be a major change to the law.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut homeowners, small businesses and agricultural properties would not lose their Prop. 13 tax safeguards. That\u2019s spelled out in the measure\u2019s official state title and summary document.\nWhile Becerra\u2019s office writes the legal titles and summaries for voter initiatives, the attorney general does not put forward ballot measures. There\u2019s no evidence Becerra is trying to eliminate Prop. 13.\u00a0\nIn the end, the social media posts capture the real concern about potential changes to Prop. 13, but they also greatly misrepresent the specific changes the November ballot measure would make to it.\u00a0\nWe rate their claims about repealing Prop. 13 as False.\u00a0\n\nFALSE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nRead more about Prop. 13, its history and efforts to change it in 'The Block That Prop. 13 Built,' a collaboration between CapRadio, CALmatters\u00a0and public radio stations across California.\u00a0\nEmail us at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0with feedback or contact us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0Facebook.\nAlso, we\u2019re starting a new project called\u00a0\u2018Ask PolitiFact California.\u2019\u00a0Is there something in California government or politics that we should fact-check next?
