Leonard Lance says government debt has grown by $3.4 trillion during the first 29 months of the Obama administration", "text": "Rep. Leonard Lance recently criticized the Washington establishment for spending the nation into a fiscal crisis.\n\nIn a July 17 column, Lance (R-7th Dist.) blamed both sides of the political aisle for driving up government debt , but also singled out President Barack Obama.\n\n\"Recently we have seen our government debt grow by $3.4 trillion during the first 29 months of the Obama administration -- the equivalent of about $4 billion per day,\" \u00a0Lance wrote in the column published on CourierPostOnline.com.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey checked whether government debt has increased that much since Obama took office -- and whether the president is responsible. We found Lance\u2019s statistics are correct, but Obama\u2019s role in debt growth is more difficult to pin down.\n\nThere are two types of government debt: one includes debt held by the public and the other includes debt held directly by the government, such as in trust funds for Social Security and Medicare. Collectively, those two types of debt make up gross national debt.\n\nLance\u2019s spokeswoman, Angie Lundberg, said the congressman was referring to debt held by the public.\n\nObama took office on Jan. 20, 2009. From then until July 15 -- the most recent data available at the time Lance made his statement -- publicly held debt increased more than $3.4 trillion, from more than $6.3 trillion to more than $9.75 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury Department data.\n\nThat\u2019s a $3.75 billion increase per day. Round up and it\u2019s \"the equivalent of about $4 billion per day.\"\n\nSo, Lance had his numbers right. But is Obama responsible for that increase?\n\nLundberg said Lance didn\u2019t \"lay blame on how we acquired that debt, just stated the fact.\" But Lance highlighted the debt growth during Obama\u2019s tenure, so we\u2019ll look at how much the president is at fault.\n\nLet\u2019s note that when Obama took office he inherited all the debt accumulated by his predecessor, President George W. Bush.\n\nAn April report by the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative analyzed the difference in the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s projections of publicly held debt and the actual debt from 2001 to 2011. The report found that about two-thirds of debt growth -- expressed as a percentage of the gross domestic product -- during that time resulted from new legislation, some of which was enacted under Bush.\n\nThe report said the Bush tax cuts, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the 2009 stimulus are three of the five \"most significant legislative drivers\" of the debt, but also notes that \"no single policy or piece of legislation, however, is overwhelmingly responsible\" for the increase.\n\nWe also spoke with five experts from different Washington, D.C.-think tanks. The general consensus was that while Obama can\u2019t be saddled with all of the growth in debt since taking office, he is responsible for some of the increase.\n\nMichael Linden, director for tax and budget policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, argued that the debt attributable to Obama would be the amount accrued from legislation Obama signed, including: the stimulus package, extension of the Bush tax cuts -- though he notes that was a bipartisan deal -- and his budgets.\n\n\"It\u2019s difficult to tease out exactly how much\" that\u2019d account for, Linden said, \"but it\u2019s definitely not the whole $3.4 trillion.\"\n\nKevin Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Obama\u2019s policies are to blame for most of the change in spending that contributed to debt growth, but not most of the change in revenues. Assigning blame for either entirely to the president would be wrong, he said.\n\nIsabel Sawhill, a budget expert with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution said Obama and factors outside his control are to blame for rising debt. \"Obama\u2019s actions to fight the financial crisis and the recession did add to the deficits and debt but are not the major culprits,\" she said in an email, citing \"a persistent gap between spending and revenues, largely because of the aging population and the growing cost of health care.\"\n\nMarc Goldwein, policy director of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, highlighted some legislation Obama signed that added to the debt, but said the economy is a factor.\n\nLet\u2019s review.\n\nLance correctly stated that government debt held by the public grew by $3.4 trillion during Obama\u2019s tenure.\n\nBut experts said that while Obama can be blamed for some of that increase, he isn\u2019t responsible for it all. \u00a0\n\nWe rate Lance\u2019s statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Codey\n\n\nstated on July 13, 2011 in an interview on Hannity on Fox News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every president has raised the debt ceiling.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill Wichert \u2022 July 21, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12666"}
