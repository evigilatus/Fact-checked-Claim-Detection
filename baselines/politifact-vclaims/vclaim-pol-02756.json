Bruce Rauner by a former business associate has piqued the interest of those who follow Illinois politics.\nBut the substance of the suit remains unknown because, in a highly unusual move, the complaint and three exhibits in the case filed in Cook County Circuit Court are sealed. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney says he wants the records made public and says they\u2019re under wraps at Rauner\u2019s request.\nWhen asked about the lawsuit after a public appearance on Oct. 20, Rauner said he knew nothing about it.\n\"To be clear, all my investments are in a trust that I don\u2019t control. I did that when I became governor,\" Rauner said. \"I can\u2019t comment on any business disputes. That gets settled in its own process.\"\nThis lawsuit is likely to draw more interest as it plays out, which makes this a good time to look into Rauner\u2019s claim that he has no control over the business interests that predate his term as governor.\nBig business\nRauner\u2019s vast wealth had been a point of contention in his 2014 campaign against incumbent Gov. Pat Quinn, who consistently tried to portray Rauner as economically out of touch with the vast majority of voters. After winning the election, Rauner sought to allay concerns that his extensive business portfolio -- which would generate $279 million in income in his first two years in office -- would make him vulnerable to conflicts of interest as governor.\nSo shortly before his inauguration on Jan. 12, 2015, Rauner announced he was turning over control of his financial affairs to New York-based Roundtable Investment Partners and released a document detailing the \"blind trust commitments\" by which he would abide.\n\"To avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest, I am designating an investment adviser under a power of attorney and establishing specific blind trust procedures during my service as governor to eliminate my day-to-day involvement in any company or issuer in which I hold any security interest or investment,\" Rauner said in the document. \"At all times during my service as governor, any information regarding the business and affairs of the issuer, including information on the financial performance of the issuer, or otherwise related to my status as a security holder in the Issuer, will go to the investment adviser and not to me.\"\nBut while Rauner invoked \"blind trust procedures\" in his explanation, the business arrangement he entered into was a power of attorney, not a blind trust.\nThe Chicago Tribune explained the difference in an article that appeared shortly before Rauner\u2019s inauguration:\nWhat Rauner did instead (of creating a blind trust) was create a different, less rigorous structure known as a power of attorney that granted management authority over much of his wealth to a New York investment adviser\u2026.\nIf Rauner had set up an actual blind trust, he would have had to transfer to it ownership of most of his wealth. Rauner would still have been the beneficiary of the trust, but he would have relinquished control over his assets to an independent trustee pledged to keep the governor in the dark about transactions.\nRauner\u2019s press secretary, Patty Schuh, said Rauner was speaking colloquially when he spoke of a \"trust\" rather than a \"power of attorney\" in his statement about the lawsuit.\nEven if Rauner had wanted to created a blind trust, however, a quirk in Illinois ethics law would have prevented it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before Joe Biden signed an order \u201cfor all federal vehicles\u201d to be electric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegally blind\nUnder Illinois law, state officeholders are required to file annual statements of economic interest in which they must list all their business interests in the state.\nIn a blind trust like those used by federal officials, an officeholder turns over ownership of financial interests to a trustee who is prohibited from communicating with the official on investment matters. Such a setup would prevent Rauner from fulfilling the state economic disclosure requirements.\nRauner\u2019s then-press secretary Lance Trover explained the compromise arrangement to the Tribune:\n\"This is the strongest possible structure that both established blind trust procedures and allows the Rauners to fully comply with the state's economic disclosure laws moving forward,\" said Trover, who noted that blind trusts can be used to shield a politician's assets from public view. \"Doing this ensures to the people of Illinois that Gov. Rauner will not try to hide his financial assets behind a blind trust.\"\nThe reporting aspect of Rauner\u2019s setup is a key distinction between it and a blind trust. Because Illinois requires that he submit an annual summary of his economic interests, Rauner can\u2019t legally blind himself to knowledge of his investments as would be required in a blind trust.\n\"If you still have to report it, it does defeat the purpose of a blind trust,\" said Larry Noble, senior director and general counsel of The Campaign Legal Center, a Washington, D.C., campaign ethics watchdog group.\nNoble believes voters would be better served if Illinois law didn\u2019t favor mandatory disclosure over true blind trusts.\n\"If you know what assets are in there, even though you\u2019re not calling the shots you still have a conflict,\" Noble said.\nThere are two other significant differences between Rauner\u2019s arrangement and a blind trust as defined by federal law.\nIn a blind trust, there can be no relationship between the officeholder and the trustee. Rauner is an investor in Roundtable and its CEO, Geoffrey Boisi, donated $50,300 to Rauner\u2019s 2014 campaign.\nEven though Rauner has pledged to leave all business activities to Roundtable, his pledge is not legally binding. There is no legal prohibition on his communicating with or receiving reports from Roundtable, and he retains the right to make investment decisions if he so chooses.\nThat could be significant in relation to the current court case, Noble said, because it gives Rauner a convenient way to quickly dispel any controversy that develops over the alleged secrecy.\n\"He could say, \u2018In the interest of disclosure I authorize my trustee to make it public,\u2019 \" Noble said.\nOur ruling\nRauner said, \"To be clear, all my investments are in a trust that I don\u2019t control.\" He was not being clear when he said his investments were held in trust.\nA quirk in Illinois ethics law means candidates can\u2019t establish blind trusts like those used by federal officials, so Rauner\u2019s investments are handled through a power of attorney granted to Roundtable Investment Partners. It\u2019s not technically a \"trust,\" as Rauner called it, but if he is following his \"blind trust commitments\" pledge, the power of attorney arrangement appears to come as close as Illinois law permits.\nThe power of attorney system he established doesn\u2019t legally prohibit him from contact with Roundtable, however, so he\u2019ll have a hard time hiding behind it if pressure mounts to make the substance of this month\u2019s lawsuit public.\nRauner\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out some important details.
