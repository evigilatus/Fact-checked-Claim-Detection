Here's a typical version of his weekly press briefing on January 5, 2017: \"We're gonna repeal this law, we're gonna replace this law, and we're gonna have a transition period so that the carpet isn't pulled from under them while we get to a better place. The Obamaker program has failed, it's getting worse, and we have to provide relief. We'll have a transition period so people don't get hurt.\" Ryan was often given a real appreciation for his claim in November 2016 that Obamacare \"is not a popular law\" -- although it should be noted that a survey in January 2017 by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading non-profit research group in health care, found a division, with 49 per cent saying Congress must repeal the law and 47 per cent saying Congress should not do so. Our assessment was wrong when, in January 2017, the Wisconsin republic said that Obamakari \"in what the actuaries call the death spiral,\" since the circumstances did not correspond to the definition of what is a constant term. But maybe Ryan's attack on the law wasn't as daring as Obamakari failed an announcement he made several times. He even went so far as to say in January 27, 2017 that he was basically \"an amazing failure,\" although three days later he became softer, saying in a tweet: \"For many Americans, I have already failed.\" So, let's put Ryan's claim to the test. There are, of course, many ways to evaluate the Affordable Care Act, which became law in 2010, despite many changes in stages later. But two of the most important are coverage (do more people have health insurance?) What is the amount you pay for insurance and what is the amount you cover? According to Donna Friedsam, Director of Health Policy Programmes, Institute of Population Health, University of Wisconsin. The economist Gale Wilensky, Senior Health and Welfare Adviser to President George H.W. Bush: \"Saying that he failed is a problem because it requires a more precise answer.\" This table highlights some of our findings. It is followed by a more detailed analysis. The cost of coverage is 20 million Americans who have acquired health insurance. By Eric Letk \u2022 January 15, 2021 he achieved more coverage: the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimated that during the first six years of Obama's care, 20 million Americans received health insurance as a result of the law - a figure recognized by Donald Trump's administration. Similarly, the non-partisan Budget Office of Congress in January 2017 expected that the 2015 bill, which would have eliminated key parts of the law, would have increased the number of insured persons by 18 million in one year. On the other hand, the United States President &apos; s Council of Economic Advisers appreciates the law &apos; s statement that it has decreased by one third nationwide since 2010 in the share of Americans who have reported that they have abandoned medical care because of cost. Even less is not insured: as one may expect, the number of persons who are not insured is much lower. To defend Obama's welfare during the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton said that 90% of Americans have health insurance. \"Bolivi Fruit National\" classified that as true. A month later, in November 2016, the report of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on the annual survey, showed that 8.9% of Americans had no health insurance in 2016. This was less than 16 per cent in 2010, the year in which the anti-corruption law was passed. How this has been done: 20 million people who have acquired insurance include persons covered by the expansion of the law in Medicaid, the establishment of the health insurance market, where individuals buy insurance policies, and changes in private insurance - which allow young adults to remain in their parents' insurance schemes, and which require insurance companies to cover people who already have health conditions. When Carly Fiorina, a former presidential candidate at the General Democratic Party, said in December 2015 in a Milwaukee debate that \"Obamakari doesn't help anyone,\" she won pants on fire. At that time, 10 million people had been placed on Medicaid as a result of Medicaid &apos; s expansion by law; 9.5 million people were enrolled in policies purchased in the market (including 8 million people receiving subsidies under the law). In addition, the law as it stands now means that millions of Americans are no longer at risk of being denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions (a promise held by Obama); or they are no longer at risk of being expelled from policies aimed at developing costly medical conditions. \u2219 Broken promises: It should be noted that not all of the gains in coverage went as planned. Obama and others had repeatedly said about ACA -- \"If you want your health care plan, you can keep it\" -- which became the 2013 National Lie Polity Vak. The Obamacari rules were strict, so even if the existing plans deviated slightly, the plans did not work under the law, and by autumn 2013, the insurers cancelled the coverage of millions of Americans. \"According to the La Avrils plan is a major improvement on what low-income people went through before the markets,\" said cash fox of ACA. \"But it is still far from what health imagined only a few years ago when they saw the health-care markets reshaping the industry. Whelinski, now a senior colleague in the HOPE project, an international health institution, referred to $20 million, and said about ACA: \"The success of this failure is extremely harsh because he accomplished that part.\" During the 2008 campaign, Obama &apos; s pledge to reduce the cost of the regular family health insurance premium by up to $2,500 per year broke the promise. As in years, health-care costs continued to increase, but there was some moderation. :: Higher exchange rates: exchange rates rose - a cumulative 11 per cent ratio between 2013 and 2016 relative to the average of the full-family plan, sponsored by staff; and 38 per cent between 2014 and 2017 relative to Obama &apos; s care plans. But the results are mixed, given the amount of premiums raised prior to the Comprehensive Agreement against Corruption: in employer-sponsored plans, family premiums increased by a cumulative 99 per cent under the eight-year period of Obama's predecessor, President George W. Bush, while the increase was 59 per cent less than eight years from Obama, according to Kaiser. According to the latest annual survey of employers conducted by Caesar, the average family allowance in 2016 for their plans increased by only 3 per cent over 2015, while the individual coverage allowance remained essentially constant. This does not mean that premiums are not large: workers contribute an average of $5,277 per year to their families. With regard to individual market policies, the average insurance premiums in the three years preceding the FCA increased by 9.9 per cent in 2008, 10.8 per cent in 2009 and 11.7 per cent in 2010, according to the Commonwealth Non-Profit Fund. The highest increases under Obama &apos; s auspices include an expected 22 per cent increase at the national level in 2017 in the average cost of Obama &apos; s Medium-Level Care Plan, which is the most popular option, although Kaiser says the increase will be high to 145 per cent (for clients in Phoenix). Critics also pointed out that persons buying insurance on their own in the federal market had fewer options. Some major insurance companies, having suffered losses, withdrew from the market, leaving nearly one in five Americans eligible for Obama care with only one insurance company in 2017, according to research conducted by the McKenzie Health System Reform Center of the United States of America for The New York Times. In terms of the large picture, total expenditure on health care at the national level has increased at low rates compared to 2011, 2012 and 2013, the first three years after the adoption of the Anti-Corruption Act, according to the President &apos; s Council of Economic Advisers - even if there is debate on a number of factors. The cost of health care is rising much more slowly than it has been in the past 50 years, with two former health-care advisers from Obama writing in the Washington Post. However, Whelinski said that much of the slowdown could be attributed to the global recession, given that health spending increases were on average lower in other industrialized countries. The discount rates are rising: Ryan and other Republicans said that many people feel that they really don't have health insurance because their earnings are too high. It should be noted that one of the provisions of the Anti-Corruption Act ensures that almost all Americans with coverage from employers have their annual expenditure limit of their own funds. However, the Caesar &apos; s survey of employers found that the average deductibles for workers covered by the employers &apos; plan were $1,221 in 2016, an increase of 13 per cent over $1,077 in 2015. Reductions can be high for Obama &apos; s care plans. In a story entitled \"Many high discounts make their health law insurance all but useless,\" The New York Times found that in many states, more than half of the plans offered through health care. Our evaluation Ryan said, \"Obamacker has failed.\" The Affordable Care Act has not fulfilled all his promises, including big promises -- that you can maintain your insurance plan if you wish. However, health-care costs have increased more slowly since the law came into force and the law has achieved its main goal of securing more people - an estimated 20 million people. This is not a failure. The biggest problem with Ryan's statement is that, with Obama's critics, they take an accurate position and turn it into a black and white statement. The same problem will be faced with those who say that \"Obamacker\" is a great success. Our definition of \"often a liar\" is \"a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.\" That fits me right here.
