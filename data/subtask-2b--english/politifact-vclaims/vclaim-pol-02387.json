He appeared on the Feb. 18, 2018 edition of \"UpFront with Mike Gousha,\" a Milwaukee-based public affairs TV show. Nicholson responded to the question, in part, with a statistical claim, saying:\nThe reality is, we're a nation of 300-plus-million people. There are more guns in this country than there are people. If somebody wants to obtain a firearm to commit a crime -- a heinous crime, a disgusting crime like this that puts children in harm's way and ends up taking innocent life -- they're going to do it.\"\nAre there more guns than people in the United States?\nThe estimates\nWe found in our first fact check related to the shooting at the high school in Parkland, Fla., that bad numbers related to guns can spread fast. We rated as Mostly False a claim that there had already been 18 U.S. school shootings in 2018, but only 18 in the rest of the world over past 20 years.\nHard numbers on the number of guns in the United States are also elusive.\nIn the past few years, headlines in the Washington Post and on Vox have declared there are more guns than people in the United States. Both noted a surge of gun sales following the 2008 election of President Barack Obama.\nBut the headlines suggest the figures are certain when they\u2019re not, given that there is no record keeping that would produce an actual count of guns in the United States. As the Pew Research Center has observed: \"Gun ownership is one of the hardest things for researchers to pin down.\"\nAt the same time, there have been studies to produce estimates on the number of civilian guns in the nation.\nBoth the Post and Vox noted an estimate on the high end -- 310 million guns -- that was cited in a 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The report said the estimate was based on U.S. Department of Justice data and was the \"total number of firearms available to civilians\" as of 2009.\nThat 310 million count is higher than the U.S. population in 2009 of about 305 million.\nBut one gun-statistics expert, Philip Cook at Duke University, told the Post that the actual figure then was probably closer to 245 million guns, not 310 million, to take into account circumstances such as guns that break down or are lost or destroyed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Cook and two other experts -- Tom Smith at the University of Chicago and Daniel Webster at the Johns Hopkins at the Center for Gun Policy and Research -- told us the best, most recent estimate is in a study published in October 2017 by researchers from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. A total of 3,949 adults, representative of the U.S. population, were surveyed online.\nThe lead author of that study, Deborah Azrael, told us the respondents were asked if they owned guns and how many, and were instructed not to count BB guns, replicas or other guns that were not functioning. \"There are clearly guns we miss,\" Azrael said, noting that some people might lie about owning guns. \"My guess is we probably miss more than we undercount.\"\nThe estimate: 265 million civilian guns in the United States, as of when the survey was taken, in January 2015.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. population at that time, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, was about 320 million.\nOther highlights of the Harvard study:\n\n\nOf the estimated 265 million total civilian guns, 113 million were handguns.\n\n\n\n\nThe typical gun owner (the median, in the survey) owned two guns.\n\n\n\n\n39 percent of the estimated 265 million guns were owned by 8 percent of the gun owners -- that 8 percent of all owners owned 10 or more guns.\n\n\nPrior fact check\nThe claim made by Nicholson was also made in 2013 by Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, the non-voting delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives representing the District of Columbia. PolitiFact National, noting the lack of firm numbers, gave her a rating of Half True.\nThat fits here.\nOur rating\nNicholson says: \"There are more guns in this country than there are people.\"\nThere is no official count of the number of firearms in the United States. In one estimate, for 2009, the number of guns exceeded the population. But the most recent estimate cited by gun-statistics experts puts the figure at 265 million guns as of January 2015, when the population was 320 million.\nWe rate Nicholson\u2019s statement Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-02-20 19:24:39 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  \"There are more guns in this country than there are people.\"     Kevin Nicholson Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate, Republican https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiZbQgCMOGo   In an interview Sunday, February 18, 2018 2018-02-18    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02387"}
