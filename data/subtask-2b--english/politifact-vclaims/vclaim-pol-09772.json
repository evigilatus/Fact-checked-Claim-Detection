Bob McDonnell\u2019s plan to expand revenues for transportation includes a $15 increase in the state\u2019s car registration fee.\n\n\"Right now, $41 is our average registration. This will change it to $56,\" McDonnell said at a Jan. 8 news conference. \u00a0\"This registration fee, even at an average $56, still puts us at a rate equal to or lower than most states in the country.\"\n\nWe asked the governor\u2019s office to back up McDonnell\u2019s claim that, even with the 37 percent increase, Virginia\u2019s registration fee would compare equally or favorably to most states.\n\nJeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the governor, said it\u2019s difficult to get an apples-to-apples comparison of how Virginia\u2019s registration fee measures up to other states, because of differences among the states in how the those fees are assessed.\n\n\"However, when looking at the common vehicle fees that most states use, such as vehicle license fees (registration), title fees and title taxes (sales tax), Virginia is clearly one of the lowest in our region of the country even with the proposed $15 increase,\" Caldwell said in an e-mail.\n\nWhen comparing just registration fees, Caldwell said, Virginia\u2019s proposed new fee would still be lower than states such as Maryland, Wisconsin, Montana, Illinois, Oklahoma and Vermont.\n\nWe note that McDonnell\u2019s statement compared registration fees to \"most states\" in the U.S. -- not one region or group of states. The governor\u2019s statement also specifically focused on the $41 average registration fee for a passenger car -- a standard registration cost that doesn\u2019t include the expense of getting a title or paying the sales tax.\n\nGiven the narrow focus of McDonnell\u2019s statement, we looked at how Virginia\u2019s basic registration fee -- assessed annually at $40.75 for vehicles up to 4,000 pounds -- would compare to other states if it were increased by $15.\n\nAs Caldwell wrote, it is difficult to get an apples-to-apples comparison among all 50 states. While Virginia and 25 other states levy a uniform registration fee for cars up to a certain weight, other states use an assortment of calculations that consider factors such as a vehicle\u2019s horsepower, selling price, weight and the year it was first registered.\n\nWe examined a list of registration fees from the National Conference of State Legislatures and one compiled by the American Automobile Association.\n\nThe lists show 28 other states have registration fees that are lower than the $56 annual charge McDonnell seeks for Virginia. These states either had a set rate that is lower than the proposed new fee in Virginia, or a formula that put the maximum charge for a 4,000-pound vehicles below $56.\n\nBy contrast, only seven states would have higher registration fees than Virginia -- the six Caldwell mentioned in his email and Hawaii.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion on how Virginia\u2019s proposed new fee would compare to 14 other states because of variables in their formulas for computing registration costs. For example, New Jersey\u2019s fee ranges from $35.50 to $84 based on the age and weight of the car. South Dakota\u2019s fees range from $30 to $92, again based on how old the car is and how much it weighs while Louisiana\u2019s registration ranges from $20 to $82 based on a vehicle\u2019s selling price.\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcDonnell said that if his proposed $56 car registration fee is approved, Virginia\u2019s annual registration costs would still be \"equal to or lower than\" most states. The governor\u2019s office, when asked, offers no proof to this claim.\n\nInformation from AAA and the National Conference of State Legislatures shows the governor is wrong. Under McDonnell\u2019s plan, Virginia\u2019s registration would be higher than 28 states and lower than seven. The 14 other states have variables in their formulas for computing car registration fees that could result in charges that are higher or lower than the $56 McDonnell has proposed.\n\nThe bottom line is that Virginia would have a higher car registration fee than most states. McDonnell\u2019s claim has no basis and we give it our lowest rating, Pants of Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09772"}
