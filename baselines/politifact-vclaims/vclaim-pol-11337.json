Agriculture is Georgia\u2019s largest industry. So Georgia lawmakers wrote House Resolution 1561, which said the federal agency \"seeks to impose harsh, extreme, and uncalled for regulations attempting to ban students from working on farms.\"\n\nNot so, said Rep. Rashad Taylor, an Atlanta Democrat who opposed the resolution. Taylor said he\u2019s worried about the safety of children working on some farms. He offered several amendments to the resolution, claiming portions of it were incorrect. Taylor\u2019s argument included a claim that some lawmakers quickly disputed.\n\n\"More children die in agricultural jobs than in any other industry,\" he said.\n\nOne lawmaker suggested more children die playing football than from agricultural work. Another suggested the numbers may be higher because more children work in agriculture than other industries.\n\nRep. Penny Houston, a Republican from South Georgia, asked Taylor several pointed questions that suggested she didn\u2019t think the lawmaker from the big city understood the issue. Her questions included a query wondering if Taylor had ever picked peas.\n\nWe dug deep on Taylor\u2019s claim.\n\nCurrently, minors may be employed by their parents at any time in any occupation on a farm owned or operated by his or her parents.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s not much research on child labor deaths. The most recent data came to us from a department within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They put together a spreadsheet using Bureau of Labor Statistics data to determine the number of children 18 and under who died on the job between 2003 and 2010. During that time, there were 311 deaths nationwide. Nearly half of those deaths, 151, were in the agriculture industry, the data showed.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that 73 percent of all work-related deaths for children 15 and under were in the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries. They did not have a more specific breakdown for all industries.\n\nA 2006 study by two CDC researchers reached similar conclusions. The study was based on two sets of data from 1992 to 2002. In that report, they noted research that found an astounding 79 percent of all work-related deaths for youths 10 years of age and younger occurred in agriculture production.\n\n\"As a proportion of all young workers, young workers in agriculture production incur a disproportionate share of fatalities,\" the 2006 report says.\n\nThe National Consumers League puts out an annual list of the most dangerous occupations for teenagers. In 2011, the most dangerous industry for young people 18 and younger was agriculture, with a death rate of 21.3 per 100,000 full-time employees, according to the report.\n\nAnother report we saw, using BLS data, showed between 1992 and 1998 that nearly 43 percent of work-related fatalities for children 18 and younger were due to agricultural work. The second-highest percentage of fatalities was in retail trade.\n\nSo why are a high proportion of children losing their lives in agriculture industries?\n\nOne report found the most common cause of death of youths in agriculture is from farm\nmachinery, such as a harvester or tractor. Between 1992 and 1997, 51 deaths of youths in agriculture nationwide could be specifically attributed to overturned tractors.\n\nOther research shows a high number of falls from moving vehicles or mobile equipment and being struck by the same.\n\nThere are few reports on this subject, and there are very few deaths to study.\n\nBut everything we\u2019ve seen shows a high percentage of work-related deaths among children occur in agriculture. The most recent data shows it is nearly 50 percent. The numbers seem to back up Taylor\u2019s claim.\n\nFor the record, Taylor\u2019s efforts to amend the resolution failed. The resolution passed.\n\nMaybe PolitiFact\u2019s ruling will give Taylor some solace. Maybe not.\n\nWe rate his claim True.\n\nUpdate\nThe following section was inadvertently edited out of the print version of Tuesday\u2019s PolitiFact Georgia regarding a statement by state Rep. Stacey Abrams on Georgia\u2019s per-capita spending: (This item will not evaluate Abrams\u2019 moose claim, though we warn her that she may receive calls from irate fans of South Dakota elk. Elk are common there. Their moose cousins tend to live farther north.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNathan Deal\n\n\nstated on October 15, 2010 in a press release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoy Barnes voted against a bill in the state Senate that would have made it easier to convict child abusers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 October 27, 2010", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11337"}
