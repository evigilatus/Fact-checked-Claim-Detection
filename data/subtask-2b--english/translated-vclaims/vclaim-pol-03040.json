Under previous administrations, the borders did not fall, but rose. But if you drop 1%, it was as if this was a great thing. 78 percent fell, \"Trap said in New York on July 28. \"In fact, the southern border of Mexico, we did them a great favor -- believe me. They're getting a little traffic there anymore, because they know they won't cross the border to the United States. So this whole group was amazing, led by General John Kelly.\" He congratulated Tramp Kelly on his \"an amazing job\" as Secretary of Internal Security, and at a meeting of the Council of Ministers on 31 July - the first meeting of Kelly as the new Chief of Staff of Tramp - he reaffirmed his pride in reducing illegal immigration. \"You know, the boundaries were a huge problem, and they're almost 80 percent down. And even the president of Mexico called me -- they said that their southern border, a few people are coming because they know they won't cross our border, which is the utmost courtesy. Based on previous statements by Tramp, his remarks that \"the borders have fallen by 78 per cent\" point to the fears of migrants trying to enter the country illegally. However, calculations of different time periods do not show a 78 per cent decrease. The allegation that concerns have not been reduced under previous administrations is inaccurate. Trump uses different time frames to demonstrate a decrease in irregular migration. He looked at the March border arrest data from year to year to say that there was a 64% drop; compared to February 2017 to November 2016, let's say it was a 61% drop; he said there was a 40% drop from January, the month it opened, to February. Where does 78% come from? We asked the White House, but we didn't get a reply. From June 2016 to June 2017, concerns on the south-west border fell by 53 per cent. The United States Customs and Border Protection data also show that between November and June (the latest figures available), arrests of border patrol personnel decreased by approximately 66 per cent. From January to June, the proportion fell to 49 per cent. From the first full month in Trump in his post, February, to June, this number fell by 14 percent. Although they are still low, the number of arrests actually occurred in May and June. As the fact checker noted in the Washington Post, Trump &apos; s claim of concerns is close to 80 per cent more evident when comparing cherry-chosen figures: the highest point in fiscal year 2017 (November) to the lowest point (April). This results in a decrease of 76.4 per cent. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverdi, 3 February 2021 'the border did not fall, but 'Tramb also rose, 'under previous administrations, the border did not fall, but rose. But if you drop 1%, it was such a great thing.\" In fact, concerns have occurred under previous administrations. Unauthorized migration also declined significantly during the administration of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, as said by Christopher Wilson, Deputy Director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. Analysis of monthly and annual concerns statistics shows decreases in both the Bush and Obama administrations. \"It doesn't matter how you look at it, Trump is away from the first President of the United States to head big drops in unauthorized immigration,\" said Wilson. The fear rates on the southern border have declined since the 1980s. In 1986, there were 1.6 million cases of fear - 1.2 million more than in 2016. However, this decline has not been as steady as in previous years. During the 1980s, there was an annual average of 1 million arrests of border patrols on the south-west border. During the Obama administration, the average was less than 500,000. Valitcheck.org also indicated that concerns had decreased by 75 per cent of fiscal years 2000 to 2016. Our judgment, which refers to border concerns, said Trump, \"the borders have dropped 78 percent. Under previous administrations, the borders did not fall, but rose.\" The latest figures available from customs and border protection in the United States do not show a 78 per cent reduction in concerns. The closest figure will be based on the selected numbers of cherry from the highest number of concerns in November to the lowest number in April. Although there have been fluctuations over the years in the number of concerns, they have certainly declined under previous administrations. We appreciate Trump's claim that it was wrong.
