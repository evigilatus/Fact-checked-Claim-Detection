Do millions of American families spend more on housing than anything else combined? We looked into the housing burden of American families. Sanders was talking about tenants, spokesman for the Sanders 2020 campaign, telling Polity Fuckett. According to a study by the National Low Income Housing Alliance, the campaign said that 10.7 million rental households spent more than half of their income on housing in 2017. In 2016, households spending more than half of their total housing income included some 11 million tenants (out of 43.76 million rental households) and 7.5 million owners (out of 75 million owned households) nationwide, according to the Joint Centre for Housing Studies at Harvard University. The Centre checked the figures from the American Community Survey data. The Department of Housing and Urban Development considers these families to be \"highly burdened with housing.\" The group of families with moderate costs (with 30-50 per cent of income spent on housing) adds another 9.8 million to rental households and 7.5 million to owner households. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On 11 January 2021, HUD uses the 30 per cent threshold to determine whether the household is expensive - a rule that has long been applied in academic research that requires families to spend no more than 30 per cent of income on housing. The burden of rent, or the share of rent in household income, measures the affordability of housing costs and refers to the quality of life. The average rental burden for American households was 25.4 per cent in 2014, an analysis found by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The average mortgage burden is 15.9 per cent. The United States has a higher 15 than average rent and mortgage burden among its OECD counterparts. Over the years, the burden of tenants has not improved. In 2014, former Housing Minister Sean Donovan pushed for housing finance reforms: \"This is the worst rental price crisis this country has ever known,\" according to Housing Wire Corporation reports. The heavy rental burden has not only affected low-income households. According to the report of the Harvard Joint Centre for Housing Studies, higher-income families have become burdened with costs. Studies carried out by the Harvard Joint Centre for Housing Studies indicate that 42 per cent of American rental households spent more than 30 per cent of their income in 2001 to put a roof over their heads. In 2016, the percentage of households rose to 47 per cent. Our rule, Sanders, said that \"millions of families\" pay \"40, 50, 60% of their limited income to put a roof over their heads.\" The most recent data show that he is right about both homeowners and tenants throughout the United States: there were about 18.5 million households spending more than 50% of their income on housing alone in 2016. We're assessing his statement right.
