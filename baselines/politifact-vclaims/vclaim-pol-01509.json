Bruce Rauner has run numerous re-election ads attempting to tie Democratic rival J.B. Pritzker to high taxes, public corruption and powerful Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan. In Rauner\u2019s telling, Madigan is the ultimate puppet-master of Illinois politics, controlling Pritzker and everyone and everything the governor deems bad.\nNow Rauner has yet another ad that not only hits on the same themes but dispenses with all subtlety by using actual puppets to deliver his points.\n\"For decades, Madigan kept property taxes high and made a fortune helping cronies like Pritzker dodge them,\" the talking puppets claim as they ask viewers to take it from them that Madigan is pulling Pritzker\u2019s strings.\u00a0\nMadigan, a Chicago Democrat who has served as speaker for all but two of the past 35 years, undeniably wields considerable power.\nOn the side, he also is a partner in a law firm that, like many others, does lucrative work contesting appraisals for commercial and industrial property to secure real-estate tax reductions for clients. So the ad\u2019s reference to the money he\u2019s made in the field is clear.\nBut property tax levies are set at the local level, not by lawmakers in Springfield. That makes the main beat of Rauner\u2019s contention a head-scratcher.\nHow could Madigan, as a state lawmaker, take action to ensure local property taxes remain high? And what about his work suggests his clients are \"cronies\" out to game the system?\nA property tax primer\nUnderstanding the thrust of the ad\u2019s claim requires a brief journey into the weeds of property taxes in Illinois.\nThe state itself stopped taxing property a decade before the 76-year-old Madigan was born.\nSince then, the taxing of property has been largely a local affair, with municipal and county officials determining assessments, tax rates and levies. The state isn\u2019t totally divorced from the process, however.\nDuring Madigan\u2019s lengthy tenure as speaker, lawmakers and the governor imposed a cap on how much most local governments in the state could raise property tax levies in a given year. Last decade, Springfield responded to soaring home values in Cook County by temporarily imposing limits on the growth of assessments for tax purposes.\nDespite that history, Justin Giorgio, a Rauner campaign spokesman, said Madigan had \"consistently\" opposed legislation that would prevent local officials from increasing their levies.\nDuring a two-year state budget standoff between Rauner and Madigan\u2019s Democrats, both backed property tax freeze plans, though the speaker\u2019s was not as sweeping. Neither plan became law.\nBut the biggest impact the state has on the size of property tax bills is what it doesn\u2019t do. Few states chip in as little to cover school costs as does Illinois, forcing school districts to rely on local revenue streams to cover more than 60 percent of education costs.\n\"In just about every other state in the union, the state itself puts more into local public schools than we do in Illinois,\" said Charles N. Wheeler III, a state budget expert and director of the Public Affairs Reporting program at the University of Illinois-Springfield.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat practice has been reinforced for decades by the spending policies set by state Republicans and Democrats alike, despite a goal laid out in the Illinois Constitution for the state to assume \"primary responsibility\" for funding K-12 schools.\nTwo decades ago, then Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican, pushed to change that. He proposed a \"tax swap\" that would increase the state income tax, using the extra funds to support schools and provide property tax relief.\nThat plan passed Madigan\u2019s chamber with the speaker\u2019s support, but was spiked in the Senate by members of Edgar\u2019s own party.\nCommonplace practice\nThe ad also accuses Madigan of capitalizing on high property taxes in order to line his pockets by helping \"cronies like Pritzker\" avoid them.\nMadigan has been elusive about his personal wealth, but he once said that he makes at least $1 million \"in a good year.\" And in 2015, his practice ranked second among law firms for total property tax refunds in Cook County, according to a Reuters report.\nGiorgio, Rauner\u2019s spokesman, pointed us to county records showing a lawyer from Madigan\u2019s firm has represented a company owned by the investment group Pritzker co-founded, securing reductions in its property value assessments.\nBut there are tens of thousands of property assessment appeals filed in Cook County each year by a multitude of law firms, so it is unclear what makes the clients of Madigan\u2019s firm \"cronies.\"\nWhen asked, Giorgio pointed only to why the campaign pinned the term on Pritzker.\n\"It has been shown that Madigan's law firm has received a large number of tax reductions from (Cook County Assessor Joseph) Berrios. Berrios is the head of the Cook County Democratic party, former Democratic State Rep. and an ally of Madigan,\" Giorgio wrote in an email. \"Pritzker has been a donor to Madigan and Berrios. Pritzker has received successful reductions through hiring Madigan's law firm from Berrios. That's clearly a \u2018crony\u2019 connection.\"\nThat\u2019s besides the point, however, because state lawmakers do not set property assessments.\nOur ruling\nA recent Rauner ad stars puppets that declare \"for decades, Madigan kept property taxes high and made a fortune helping cronies like Pritzker dodge them.\"\nThat claim suggests Madigan, the powerful House speaker, took action as a lawmaker to ensure Illinois property taxes remain some of the nation\u2019s highest.\nFor support, Rauner\u2019s campaign said Madigan has kept property taxes high by \"consistently\" opposing legislation to provide property tax relief, even though Madigan\u2019s record says otherwise. The claim also ignores the reality that state lawmakers play no direct role in the assessment process, which takes place at the local level.\nThere is a glimmer of truth in the ad\u2019s contention that Madigan is a partner in a law firm that conducts property tax appeals work for those who can afford it, including a Pritzker-owned company. And it\u2019s a lucrative business because property taxes are extraordinarily high in Illinois.\nBut skyrocketing property taxes are part of a long and bipartisan legacy in Springfield of foisting the lion\u2019s share of public school funding on to local property tax payers.\nThe responsibility for that phenomenon is broadly shared by decades of governors and lawmakers, Madigan included.\nWe rate the ad\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-10-15 16:12:23 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"For decades, Madigan kept property taxes high and made a fortune helping cronies like Pritzker dodge them.\"    Bruce Rauner Illinois Governor  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6qyhziJ0Aw   in a TV ad Monday, October 1, 2018 2018-10-01    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01509"}
