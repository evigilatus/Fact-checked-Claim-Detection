Chris Christie hits his revenue targets in the coming months, but the Republican governor has a warning for New Jerseyans:\n\n\"Be very suspicious.\"\n\nAfter offering such advice at a June 26 town hall meeting in Ocean County, Christie suggested that Paul Sarlo, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, had broken a promise not to have any tax hikes in the new state budget.\n\n\"Oh, and by the way, that same senator, Paul Sarlo, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who said in February on NJTV, \u2018there will be no tax increases in this budget,\u2019 voted \u2013 voted the other night in the Senate Budget Committee to raise income taxes $800 million,\" said Christie, according to a video posted June 26 on YouTube.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey found that the governor\u2019s statement is mostly accurate, but missing a couple of critical details.\n\nSarlo (D-Bergen) vowed to not include new taxes in the upcoming budget during a February TV interview and then voted last month to raise income taxes by around $800 million in the new fiscal year.\n\nBut the governor failed to mention two points: that tax hike technically was separate from the budget bill approved by the Legislature, and it only would have affected taxpayers with more than $1 million in taxable income.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s discuss Sarlo\u2019s earlier comments and recent vote.\n\nIn a Feb. 22 interview on NJToday, Sarlo said the following in regard to the spending plan for fiscal year 2013, which started July 1: \"There will be no new taxes in this budget.\"\n\nBut at the June 21 meeting of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, Sarlo voted for a bill raising the state income tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million.\n\nThat tax hike -- known as the so-called \"millionaires tax\" -- would generate between $754 million and $836 million in fiscal year 2013, according to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. The money would be used to boost property tax relief payments.\n\nBy June 28, the Legislature -- with Sarlo voting yes -- had approved the tax hike. Christie conditionally vetoed the legislation on July 2 and called on legislators to amend the bill to implement a tax cut.\n\nDemocrats, who set aside $183 million in the fiscal year 2013 budget for a possible tax cut, have said the reduction only would occur if Christie meets his revenue projections between now and December.\n\nNow, let\u2019s address the points missing from Christie\u2019s claim.\n\nWhen discussing Sarlo\u2019s vote \"to raise income taxes $800 million,\" the governor failed to mention that the tax hike only would apply to taxable income exceeding $1 million. Unless they\u2019re millionaires, the people at that town hall meeting would not pay higher income taxes.\n\nAlso, Christie\u2019s statement suggests that the tax hike was part of the budget sent to him by the Legislature. But it technically wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe millionaires tax bill was separate from the fiscal year 2013 budget bill approved by the Legislature on June 25. Christie approved the budget, with various changes, on June 29.\n\nThe millionaires tax would have added money to the fiscal year 2013 budget, but it was still considered separately.\n\nIn a statement issued before Christie\u2019s conditional veto, Derek Roseman, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats, said: \"This bill was not considered in conjunction with the budget, is not part of the budget, and whatever happens to it will have no impact on the budget.\"\n\nThe governor's office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAt a town hall meeting, Christie claimed Sarlo \"said in February on NJTV, \u2018there will be no tax increases in this budget\u2019\" and \"voted the other night in the Senate Budget Committee to raise income taxes $800 million.\"\n\nIt\u2019s accurate that Sarlo said \"there will be no new taxes in this budget\" and later voted to increase income taxes by around $800 million in the new fiscal year. But Christie failed to mention that the tax hike was considered separately from the budget bill and that it only would have affected millionaires.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10804"}
