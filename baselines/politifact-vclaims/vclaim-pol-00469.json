But a more granular look at drug maker political money delivers a lower number, and the tweet gives no hint that Booker stopped taking pharmaceutical money in 2017.\nBooker\u2019s pharma cash\nThe Trump campaign sent us to Booker\u2019s career summary page on the Open Secrets website, a reliable source of federal political money data. Booker first ran for Senate in 2013. Since then, people and groups tied to the pharmaceutical/health products industry have given Booker $411,948.\nThe number is actually higher. Booker runs a leadership PAC, a common device on Capitol Hill to raise money for a variety of uses, from travel expenses to helping other candidates fund their campaigns. Booker\u2019s PAC got $56,000 since 2014, for a grand total of $468,000.\nThere\u2019s an important caveat: That industry group includes much more than drug makers. Drug wholesalers, medical equipment makers and dietary supplement companies all fall under this category. The wholesalers would have a stake in bills aimed at lowering prescription drug costs, but many other companies, such as Nestl\u00e9, which owns several dietary supplement brands, and Medtronic, maker of insulin pumps and much more, would go untouched by such legislation.\nBoiled down to drug makers alone, according to data pulled by the Open Secrets staff, Booker\u2019s total is $327,000. That includes both donations to his campaign committee and his leadership PAC.\nOne last wrinkle would add some money back in. The Trump campaign tweet was based solely on Booker\u2019s federal receipts. But as mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013, Booker raised millions. Some of that came from people tied to drug makers. A notable example is Jonathan Sackler, a member of the family behind Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. In 2009, Sackler gave $26,000 to Booker Team for Newark, a joint campaign committee to help elect Booker and a slate of city councilors.\nAt the end of the day, we found that drug makers gave Booker\u2019s campaigns upwards of $350,000. That\u2019s less than the tweet claimed, but still a hefty amount. And if drug wholesalers are added in, the gap largely disappears.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

I\u2019ve said I would not take contributions from corporate PACs, from pharma executives \u2014 they are part of this problem.\"\u00a0\nBig pharma companies need to be held criminally liable for the opioid crisis.

Chip in to help us run a people-powered campaign\u2014 Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) June 27, 2019\n\nAs far as his PAC money, that revenue stream has died for Booker.\nUp through 2016, drug makers had given him $202,000.\nSince then, as the chart below shows, the amount from drug makers directly is zero, with some ongoing donations from individuals who work for drug makers.\n\nNew Jersey is home to many large pharmaceutical companies, including Merck, Novartis and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Individuals who work for them have continued to give to Booker, but since 2016, that has fallen from nearly $100,000 to about $26,000.\nBooker\u2019s campaign noted that he joined with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on a drug importation bill. Booker also put forward legislation that would allow the Medicare program to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs. These and other measures have drawn strong opposition from the drug industry.\nOur ruling\nThe Trump campaign said that in the course of his career, Booker has accepted over $400,000 from the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe number is close.\nWhat the tweet ignores is that Booker stopped taking money from pharmaceutical industry PACs and top executives. Since 2016, Booker received zero dollars from drug makers and individual contributions have fallen by 75%.\nThe average reader of the tweet would have no idea that Booker has shunned pharmaceutical money for the past two years.\nThat\u2019s additional context, but Booker did accept the money in years past.
