Cody McGregor, campaign manager for Staples, pointed us to a July 5 column in the Houston Chronicle that quotes Combs\u2019 political consultant Reggie Bashur as saying that Combs \"wants Roe v. Wade overturned\" and is against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy.\n\nHas Combs flip-flopped on abortion?\n\nSome background: Combs, Staples and others who may vie for lieutenant governor in 2014 are drawing attention now because the incumbent, David Dewhurst, recently joined the 2012 field of candidates for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison. That means Dewhurst hopes he won\u2019t be seeking another term as lieutenant governor two years later. Staples has said that he will compete for the post overseeing the Texas Senate as long as Dewhurst doesn\u2019t. And Combs is considering jumping in, according to Bashur.\n\nCombs, in her second term as comptroller, previously served as state agriculture commissioner and in the Texas House, where she represented an Austin-area district.\n\nWe first looked into Combs\u2019 past position on abortion.\n\nIn his letter, Staples says Combs\u2019 \"pro-choice position is well documented\" through \"quoted comments in several news reports.\"\n\nReporter Peggy Fikac\u2019s July 5 Chronicle column cites two earlier news articles. The first is a May 1995 Austin American-Statesman story in which Combs, then a House member, discussed her belief that government had grown too large and powerful. \"We are so casual about government intrusion in our lives,\" Combs is quoted as saying. \"I'm pro-choice for the same reason.''\n\nThe second news article cited in the Chronicle column was an Associated Press story from November 2003, when Combs was agriculture commissioner. \"Combs supports a woman's right to choose, with exceptions,\" the story says. \"She opposes \u2018partial-birth\u2019 abortions and third-trimester abortions and favors parental notification for minors seeking abortions.\"\n\nIn an interview, Brooke Botello, communications director for the comptroller's office, told us that the AP story accurately covered Combs' earlier position on abortion. Botello also told us that Combs' position had not shifted significantly during her years as a House member and agriculture commissioner.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaples\u2019 campaign also sent us a February 2011 Texas Tribune story that kicks off by asking whether it\u2019s possible for a pro-choice candidate to win a \"high-profile\" statewide Republican primary in Texas. \"Susan Combs might try,\" it says. The article describes Combs\u2019 position as \"anti-abortion but pro-choice\" and says that Combs \"has said Roe v. Wade should stand.\"\n\nThat Supreme Court ruling, issued Jan. 22, 1973, struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before viability, the time at which a fetus can survive outside a woman's body. It noted that viability \"is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks)\" of pregnancy \"but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.\"\n\nAfter fetal viability, the court said, states could limit abortions provided that their policies met certain requirements, including an exception to protect the life of the woman. Since then, other Supreme Court rulings have affirmed states' rights to impose further restrictions.\n\nThe first sign we found of a possible shift by Combs was in a May 22 Houston Chronicle article on the 2011 regular legislative session. It reported that at Combs\u2019 request, state Rep. Jim Landtroop, R-Plainview, added an amendment to a budget-related bill that would have prohibited businesses from claiming money spent on elective abortions through its employee health plans as an exemption from the state\u2019s franchise tax. When calculating how much they owe under the tax, qualifying companies are permitted to deduct from total revenue certain costs, including health care benefits.\n\nThe article quotes Rep. John Otto, R-Dayton, as saying that Combs sought the change \"to remove what she would consider public subsidies of insurance policies covering abortions. ... In her view, that is subsidizing abortion because that is public money.\"\n\nBotello confirmed that Combs had asked Landtroop to propose the amendment. The overall proposal died, though, and the Combs-backed amendment did not become law.\n\nAbout six weeks later, in July, Bashur\u2019s statement that Combs is now against most abortions appeared in the Chronicle column. On Aug. 2, Staples shared his letter to Combs with news organizations, and the next day, Combs was interviewed by the Tribune, which reported that she had \"switched her position on abortion rights, from pro-choice to pro-life.\"\n\nIn the interview, Tribune reporter Ross Ramsey says: \"Let\u2019s talk about choice. I understand that your position on this has changed.\"\n\nCombs replies: \"Uh huh.\" She continues: \"Twenty years ago, I was pro-choice \u2026 because I had concerns about the role of government.\" She then says that she changed her mind after \"looking at studies and data and reading books\" and concluding that abortion is being used as \"birth control.\"\n\n\"It is stunning to me that we are at the point in this country where in 2011, you have incredibly high numbers of women choosing to abort rather than have a baby or to have avoided the problem in the first place,\" she told the Tribune. \"So I am unequivocal about it. I was wrong, and it's 20 years later, and I feel very strongly about it.\"\n\nCombs\u2019 newly articulated position \u2014 in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade and against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when a woman\u2019s life is threatened \u2014 mirrors Staples\u2019. And Austin consultant Wayne Hamilton, a former executive director of the Republican Party of Texas, told us that Texas candidates have generally been considered pro-life if they oppose abortion except in those three cases, though some candidates rule out exceptions.\n\nSo, how does Combs\u2019 acknowledged shift rate on the Flip-O-Meter?\n\nPreviously, Combs was in favor of allowing abortions in most cases, excluding those in the final trimester of pregnancy. Now, she opposes abortion in most cases, with the exception of those involving rape, incest or when a woman\u2019s life is threatened. Full Flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12542"}
