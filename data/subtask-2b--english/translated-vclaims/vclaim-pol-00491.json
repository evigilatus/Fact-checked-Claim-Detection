Outside the American Capitol on Monday, Sanders set out his plan to cancel $1.6 trillion in student loans by taxing financial transactions on Wall Street. During the announcement, Senator Vermont used a preferred old speech - that the university in the United States was mostly free of study throughout the 20th century - but with an addition. Sanders said that a federal financial assistance programme for low-income students, unlike non-reimbursable loans, covered almost the entire cost of the College in the late 1970s. \"40 years ago, Bill's federal scholarship paid about 80% of the tuition, room and food in college for four years,\" said Sanders. Sanders went on to say that although Bill &apos; s grant was no longer close to covering the costs of the college, his proposal to forgive the student would give the grant of financial assistance a substantial boost. And that makes us wonder -- did Bill's scholarships actually cover almost the entire cost of college four decades ago? We have contacted the Sanders campaign as well as many higher education funding experts to find out. We referred a spokesman for the Sanders campaign to a 2017 policy brief of the Centre for Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank that examines federal and state budget policies. In this analysis, the authors wrote that in 2017, \"Bill was covered only 29% of the average costs of education, fees, rooms, and food in the four-year public colleges,\" which were \"lowest in more than 40 years and far less than 79% in 1975. Spyros Protopestes, author of the summary and assistant professor of education policy at George Mason University, said he believed the Sanders statement was accurate. Protopestes explained that in 1975 the average cost of education, fees, accommodation and food at a four-year public institution was $1,779, according to the College Board data collected by the authors. The maximum bill grant in that year was $1,400 - or 79 per cent of the total cost. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2021, here the president and vice-president of academic affairs at the University of San Francisco, who examined the financing of higher education, boasts what Sanders said on Monday - with one important warning. The protopestase analysis, which shows grants covering 80% of college costs, applies only to public universities, not private institutions. \"This is an important distinction, because it covers less than the cost of a private college or university for four years,\" said Heller. According to college council data shared by Protopestes, the maximum bill grant in 1975 would have covered only about 38 per cent of the total cost of attending a four-year private non-profit school, with an average cost of education, fees, accommodation and food of $3,682. It is important to keep that in mind. Because the high cost of college, where public higher education is concerned, is also associated with the deep funding of the college system by state governments. \"It's not only that Bill was completely pulled in. A large part of this driver was that the states also retreated, pushing the study up, \"Wesley Wesler, a senior adviser in the New America educational policy program, said. The Governor Sanders said that 40 years ago, \"Bill's federal scholarship paid about 80% of the tuition fees, seats and seats at a four-year college.\" While this is true for public colleges that last four years, it does not apply to private enterprises that last four years. Based on the data cited by Senator Vermont for his testimony, the Bill Grant will cover only 38% of the cost of a private university in the late 1970s -- While the Sanders statement is precise, it ignores the important context in which this figure refers to a public college of only four years. We're mostly assessing this statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00491"}
