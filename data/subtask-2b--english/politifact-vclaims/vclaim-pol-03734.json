Spicer, in his daily press briefing on Jan. 30, 2017, pushed back by claiming that the presidential memorandum announcing the makeup of the council hadn\u2019t really changed dramatically.\n\"The language that's part of the president's memo is identical to the language for Presidents Bush's 2001,\" Spicer said, holding up copies of the various memos (around the 6:55 mark of this video). \"The only thing that's changed in this is the addition of the Director of National Intelligence as a position that didn't exist in 2001. For what it's worth, it's the same as Obama's, save for the word \u2018also.\u2019 \"\nFor those who don\u2019t know, the National Security Council was established in 1947 and gathers foreign and domestic policy and military officials to advise the president on national security.\nThe two issues with Trump\u2019s restructuring concern the makeup of the full council and its principals committee, a subset of senior officials that is also \"literally 100 percent the same,\" according to Spicer.\nSo is Spicer right that the Bush, Obama and Trump memos are nearly \"identical\"?\nWe read Bush\u2019s 2001 memo, Obama\u2019s 2009 memo and Trump\u2019s 2017 memo, and found that Spicer\u2019s claim is misleading.\nThe regular council\nSpicer is right about the makeup of the full National Security Council, albeit in a limited way.\nThis sentence \u2014 \"The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as statutory advisers to the NSC, shall also attend NSC meetings\" \u2014 appears pretty much verbatim in each president\u2019s memo. (The Director of National Intelligence was a position created in 2004, so Bush\u2019s memo says the CIA Director instead.)\nBut in a broader sense, Spicer is off the mark. Each president has invited different government officials to sit on the council, but neither Bush nor Obama added his chief strategist. Trump appears to be the only president since the establishment of the council to include his, Bannon, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\nBy statute, the members of the council are the president, vice president, secretary of state, secretary of defense and, as of 2007, secretary of energy. As noted in the memos, the chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor are statutory advisers.\nHere are the additional members each president has requested to join the council (positions unique to each president are bolded):\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nBush 2001\n\n\nObama 2009\n\n\nTrump 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Regular attendees\" or \"members\"\n\n\n\u2022 Secretary of treasury\n\u2022 National security adviser\n\n\n\u2022 Secretary of treasury\n\u2022 National security adviser\n\u2022 Secretary of homeland security\n\u2022 Homeland security adviser\n\u2022 Representative to the United Nations\n\u2022 Chief of staff\n\u2022 Deputy national security adviser\n\n\n\u2022 Secretary of treasury\n\u2022 National security adviser\n\u2022 Secretary of homeland security\n\u2022 Homeland security adviser\n\u2022 Representative to the United Nations\n\n\n\n\n\"Invited to attend any meeting\"\n\n\n\u2022 Chief of staff\n\u2022 Economic adviser\n\n\n\u2022 Counsel to the president\n\n\n\u2022 Chief of staff\n\u2022 Chief strategist (Bannon)\n\u2022 Counsel to the president\n\u2022 Deputy counsel for national security\n\u2022 Director of the Office of Management and Budget\n\n\n\n\nInvited when appropriate\n\n\n\u2022 Counsel to president\n\u2022 Attorney general\n\u2022 Director of the Office of Management and Budget\n\n\n\u2022 Secretary of \u00a0commerce\n\u2022 U.S. Trade representative\n\u2022 Economic adviser\n\u2022 Chair of Council of Economic Advisors\n\u2022 Homeland security adviser\n\u2022 Director of the Office of Science and Technology\n\n\n\u2022 Secretary of \u00a0commerce\n\u2022 U.S. Trade representative\n\u2022 Economic adviser\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe principals committee\nSimilarly, Bannon\u2019s addition to the principals committee undercuts Spicer\u2019s claim that the senior interagency group, first established by former President George H.W.

Bush\u2019s or Bill Clinton\u2019s).\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the organization of the principals committee under each president (positions unique to each president are bolded):\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nBush 2001\n\n\nObama 2009\n\n\nTrump 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Regular attendees\" or \"members\"\n\n\n\u2022 Secretary of state\n\u2022 Secretary of treasury\n\u2022 Secretary of defense\n\u2022 National security adviser\n\u2022 Chief of staff\n\n\n\u2022 Secretary of state\n\u2022 Secretary of treasury\n\u2022 Secretary of defense\n\u2022 National security adviser\n\u2022 Chief of staff\n\u2022 Secretary of homeland security\n\u2022 Representative to the United Nations\n\u2022 Director of the Office of Management and Budget\n\u2022 Director of national intelligence\n\u2022 Chairman of the joint chief of staff \u00a0\n\n\n\u2022 Secretary of state\n\u2022 Secretary of treasury\n\u2022 Secretary of defense\n\u2022 National security adviser\n\u2022 Chief of staff\n\u2022 Secretary of homeland security\n\u2022 Chief strategist (Bannon)\n\u2022 Homeland security adviser\n\n\n\n\nInvited to or shall attend all meetings\n\n\n\u2022 Vice president\n\u2022 Deputy national security adviser\n\n\n\u2022 Deputy national security adviser \u00a0\n\u2022 Deputy secretary of state\n\u2022 Counsel to the president\n\u2022 National security adviser to the Vice President\n\n\n\u2022 Deputy national security adviser\n\u2022 Counsel to the president\n\u2022 National security adviser to the Vice President\n\u2022 Director of the Office of Management and Budget\n\u2022 Deputy counsel for national security\n\u2022 Executive secretary\n\n\n\n\nInvited when appropriate\n\n\n\u2022 CIA director\n\u2022 Chairman of the joint chief of staff\n\u2022 Attorney general\n\u2022 Director of the Office of Management and Budget\n\u2022 Counsel to President\n\u2022 Secretary of commerce\n\u2022 U.S. Trade Representative\n\u2022 Economic adviser\n\u2022 Secretary of Agriculture\n\n\n\u2022 Secretary of \u00a0commerce\n\u2022 U.S. Trade representative\n\u2022 Economic adviser\n\u2022 Chair of Council of Economic Advisors\n\u2022 Homeland security adviser\n\u2022 Director of the Office of Science and Technology\n\n\n\u2022 Director of national intelligence\n\u2022 Chairman of the joint chief of staff\n\u2022 Secretary of commerce\n\u2022 U.S. Trade representative\n\u2022 Economic adviser\n\u2022 Representative to the United Nations\n\u2022 Intergovernmental and technology initiatives adviser\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\nSpicer said, \"The language that's part of the president's memo (on the National Security Council) is identical to the language for Presidents Bush's 2001\" as well as President Obama\u2019s 2009.\nWe reached out to the Trump administration but did not hear back.\nSpicer is right in a limited sense: each memo specifies that the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National Intelligence are statutory advisers to the regular council.\nWhile both the Bush and Trump memos stipulated they attend principals committee meetings when appropriate, both were regular members of the subcommittee under Obama.\nTrump also includes one major departure from both Bush and Obama: adding the position of chief strategist as a member of both the regular council and principals committee.\nSpicer\u2019s claim that the memos are identical rates Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3b66fd71-c0f3-4b31-863b-eefc0a689f2e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03734"}
