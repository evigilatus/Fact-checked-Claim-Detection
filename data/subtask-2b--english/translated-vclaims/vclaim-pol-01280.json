How many? The news articles indicate that this figure exceeds 1 million people. An observer - a business professor at the University of New York - compared him with the population of several states: \"The number of people who have just obtained their voting rights in Florida is greater than the population of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Rose Island, Montana, Maine and New Hampshire.\" Professor Scott Galloway, who told Polity Fuckett that he was not involved in the Fourth Amendment in Florida. Galway was talking about states individually, not community. We found it difficult to determine how many criminals are now eligible to vote, but estimates put it above the resident population in many smaller states. In addition to amendment 4 for eligible offenders, which was approved by about 64 per cent of voters, the State Constitution amends the Constitution to restore the voting rights of Florians with convictions for a felony upon completion of their sentence, including parole or parole. It does not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offences. Florida was previously one of the most difficult operations in the country for offenders to regain their voting rights, which involved waiting years and then appearing before the Governor and the State Department. The Palm Patch Post found that the current cabinet, made up entirely of Republicans, restored voting rights to twice the number of whites like blacks. Two of the leaders of the organizations that called for amendment 4 - Mark Maurer in the sentencing project and Howard Simon in the European Union for Freedom in Florida - wrote a memorandum in February that estimated the number of criminals who could regain the right to vote. Their conclusion: Up to 1.4 million. Here, how did they reach this figure: they began with the total population of Florida deprived of its rights, estimated at 1.7 million. They then brought in unqualified criminals, including those convicted of murder or sexual offences, those who were in prison or prison, under supervision or supervision, or who did not pay fees, fines or rehabilitation to the victims. This ultimately leaves a group of about 1.4 million people. However, there are some factors that can reduce this number, including the fact that many of these offenders have not paid compensation, fines or fees. In Florida, an analysis carried out by the Department of Corrections in 2007 found that of the 80,000 persons awaiting restitution, approximately 40 per cent had not completed recovery payments, and the Arab Union for the Liberation of Uganda (ALU) and the sentencing project had been found. Failure to pay compensation would render them ineligible to vote. If we apply a 40% level of non-payment, it can reduce the number of eligible people from 1.4 million to about 840,000. Several news outlets mentioned 1.4 million. We have asked some State officials about this figure and have not received any responses that have been challenged. On the day after the approval of the amendment, the State Electoral Division did not disclose any details of how the amendment would be implemented, except for its continued operation in January. (Several state and county election officials focused on the anticipated post-election recounts.) The Galloway census tweet stated that the number of criminals who could regain the right to vote was greater than the population of 10 states, ranging from some 579,000 (Wayoming) to 1.3 million (Min and New Hampshire). If an estimated 1.4 million criminals in Florida are eligible to vote, the Galloway tweet is correct. If we assume that the number of eligible offenders is lower because of non-payment of fines - about 840,000 - six states in this list have a larger population. The state census estimates 1 July 2017 and Eoming 579,315 investigate the facts cited by Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says that Joe Biden is in the middle of the year. By Bill McCarthy, 12 January 2021 Vermont, 657,623 Alaska, 795 739 North Dakota, 869,666 Delaware, 939,961 Rhode Island, 1,639,059 Montana, 1,493,050 Main, 1,335,907 New Hampshire, 3,342, 3 795,795 Gallway, \"The number of people who have just obtained their voting rights in Florida is greater than the population of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Road Island, Montana, Maine, New Hampshire.\" The population of Galawi states is approximately 579,000 to 1.3 million. The number of offenders now entitled to vote is 1.4 million, according to the Competition and Consumer Protection Act and the Sentencing Project. However, failure to pay fines can reduce this number to 840,000. In that scenario, six of the 10 states included in the Galloway List have a larger population. It appears that the Galloway tweet is usually in order, although the final number of eligible offenders could be lower than the number of some of the state residents he mentioned. We're mostly assessing this claim right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6d212fd7-acec-49ab-bad2-a994b22b7ed", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01280"}
