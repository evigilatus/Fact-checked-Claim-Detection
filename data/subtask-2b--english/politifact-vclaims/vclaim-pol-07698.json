I have no savings accounts. But I got a great pension, and I got a good salary,\" he said.\nEven though Biden was known as one of the poorest members of Congress while he was a senator, the statement raised some eyebrows.\nJust last week, we rated Clinton's claim that she and former President Bill Clinton were \"dead broke\" when they left the White House as Mostly False.\nSo how do Biden\u2019s finances stack up?\nAt the North American International Auto Show in January, Biden said that when he first ran for office in 1972, he promised he would never own any stocks or bonds.\nBiden\u2019s office declined to comment on the record about his finances and whether or not he lived up to that promise. But we were able to look at Biden\u2019s 2013 executive branch personnel public financial disclosure report, which was submitted just last month.\nThe report lists about a dozen investments, all of which fall into the $1,001 - $15,000 range.\nHowever, they're not strictly his.\nAll 11 are designated by the letter \"S\"-- used to indicate that the holding belongs to the filer\u2019s spouse. That means the 11 investments are owned by Jill Biden, his wife of 37 years.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the savings accounts are a different story.\nAccording to the disclosure documents, the Bidens have five savings accounts, which fall into a larger range. Some amounted to less than $1,001, while others fell into the $50,001 - $100,000 category.\nFour of the five accounts belong to the vice president's wife, while the final one has the classification \"J\" -- a joint account that belongs to both of them. This U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union account's holdings fall into the $1,001 - $15,000 range.\nEven if the investments aren't in the vice president's name, they are part of his household wealth, and he stands to benefit from their success, said George Pennacchi, a finance professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\nJeffrey Hoopes, an accounting professor at Ohio State University, compared the situation to a household with two cars -- where each spouse drives a car, but both titles are only in the husband's name.\n\"For (the wife) to say she did not own a car would be slightly disingenuous, even if legally true,\" Hoopes said.\nAdditionally, pension funds invest in stocks and bonds or other assets, Pennacchi said.\n\"Thus, it is inescapable that Mr. Biden\u2019s wealth is both directly and indirectly linked to stock and bond investments,\" Pennacchi said.\nBiden also holds four checking accounts, two of which he shares with his wife. In addition, he holds six life insurance policies with Mass Mutual. The Bidens reported an adjusted gross income of $407,099 last year, including his vice presidential salary of $230,700.\nOur ruling\nBiden said, \"I don't own a single stock or bond... I have no savings accounts.\"\nBiden was wrong to say that he doesn't have a savings account because he shares one with his wife. However, he doesn't have ownership over any stocks and bonds -- those all belong to his wife. We rate his statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07698"}
