Try to defend that.\"\nPence responded, \"Well, he never said that, senator.\"\n\"He has absolutely said it,\" Kaine said. \"Saudi Arabia. South Korea. Japan.\"\nTrump\u2019s stated positions on nuclear proliferation are often contradictory, so we decided to lay them out for you here.\nBut reading through these exchanges, it\u2019s clear that Trump thinks it might not be such a bad thing if South Korea and Japan were to develop their own nuclear weapons, given the threat posed by North Korea.\n\"Mr. Trump has indicated that countries need to defend themselves and that nuclear weapons are an option that they have, but not that he supports them having those weapons,\" said Trump spokesman Steven Chung.\nHere are some of Trump\u2019s key comments about whether more countries should have nuclear weapons.\nMarch 27, 2016\nThe New York Times asked Trump if he\u2019d object to Japan or South Korea having nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea.\nTrump responded, \"At some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world. And unfortunately, we have a nuclear world now. And you have, Pakistan has them. You have, probably, North Korea has them. ... And, would I rather have North Korea have them with Japan sitting there having them also? You may very well be better off if that\u2019s the case. In other words, where Japan is defending itself against North Korea, which is a real problem.\"\nHe added later in the same interview: \"If Japan had that nuclear threat, I\u2019m not sure that would be a bad thing for us.\"\nMarch 29, 2016\nCNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper asked Trump, \"If you're concerned about proliferation, letting other countries get nuclear weapons, isn't that proliferation?\"\nAs part of a winding response, Trump said that he both opposes nuclear proliferation (\"No, no, not proliferation. I hate nuclear more than any;\" \"I don't want more nuclear weapons\") and supports some countries obtaining nuclear weapons for the first time.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
