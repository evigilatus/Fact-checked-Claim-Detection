Bush has returned to the circulation of social media. The Facebook article says that Bush revealed to a news journalist in the early 1990s that if the American public finds out what we've done, they're gonna \"screw us.\" The article depicts the forty-first President with the following words: \"If the American people discover what we have done, they will hunt us down on the street and execute us. \"I refer to the article as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) With regard to the allegation, it appears that the alleged quotation arose from the Bush decision to pardon six former officials of President Ronald Reagan &apos; s administration who were involved in the Iran-Contra Aver case. This is because one of the oldest quotes can be found in a question quoted as 10 July 1995, an interview on a conservative radio program: \"[The next interview with the first lieutenant. Commander Alexander Martin (retired) appeared in Tom Valentine's Radio Free America programme on July 10, 1995. The comments of Valentine 'Q' will be followed while following 'A' Martin.] Q: I don't see how that was possible. On January 10, 2021 in Facebook, it says that Nancy Belusi sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after she demonstrated there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" I think George Bush said it very well in an interview with Sarah McLindon, the big lady in the press in Washington. When Bush agreed to an interview with Ms. Maclindon in June 1992, he said in the record, which she published in her newsletter that month, when she asked him about Iran-Contra and said, \"If people ever find out what we did, we will hunt down the streets and kill.\" This was a public comment by George Bush. Q: George Bush actually admitted it? A: He said so and was printed in Ms. McLendon &apos; s June 1992 newsletter.\" The White House has been covered by Sarah McLendon for more than 50 years, at which time it notably managed the Single Women &apos; s News Service, which produced a newsletter entitled \"Sara McLendon Report on Washington.\" However, in a review of the June 1992 McClindon newsletters, there is nothing close to the quote that Martin attributed to her. So let us list the flaws of this allegation: First, it is unlikely that Bush, who publicly and strongly denied any involvement in the scandal (discovered while serving as Vice-President), would say such a self-incriminating statement, especially to a journalist. Second, we found no mention of this quote in the McLindon newspapers archives. Thirdly, if the President had made such an inflammatory statement and self-incrimination of the press about a prominent scandal (especially when it was of great interest), it would have been captured and republished by the media throughout the country. But the search for quotes through the Nexis news archive also came short. We're assessing this quote of pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00424"}
