Barack Obama as untested in general elections, Sen. Hillary Clinton pollster Mark Penn asserted during a Feb. 11 conference call with reporters that the first-term Illinois senator has \"never had a serious Republican challenger.\"\n\nCritics have frequently tried to hang the \"short on experience\" rap on Obama, but in this instance, Penn is correct.\n\n\nObama's toughest battles at the state and national level have been in Democratic primaries. As a community organizer and civil rights lawyer on Chicago's South Side, Obama won his first political race in 1996 by successfully challenging the nominating petitions of four primary rivals in the overwhelmingly Democratic 13th Senate district.

The GOP, desparate for a quick replacement, turned to social conservative Alan L. Keyes, who moved from Maryland to Illinois for the race.\n\n\nObama wound up capturing 70 percent of the vote, buoyed by the national exposure he received from delivering the keynote speech for presidential nominee John Kerry at the Democratic National Convention in Boston.\n\n\nBecause Obama has faced only token Republican opposition, when he's faced any at all, we deem this claim to be True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16342"}
