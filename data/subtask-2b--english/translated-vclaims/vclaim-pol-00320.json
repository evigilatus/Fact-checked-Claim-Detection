The American people have spoken with one voice, and they say that this is not true.\" McCain is right that the ruling in Kilo v. New London, a Supreme Court decision in 2005 allowing local governments to seize land from real estate owners for economic development purposes, is unacceptable in the United States. However, some of the figures he uses to clarify his point of view are unreliable and inflationary. McCain's numbers were collected from a list drawn up by the Castle Alliance, an activist group launched to combat the capture of high-profile ranges following Kilo's decision. Of the figures he mentions, only Ohio's character comes from an uninterested scientific survey. The remaining figures are derived from interest group surveys or non-scientific opinion polls conducted by local news organizations on their websites. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, McCain did not ignore the most reliable polls, but he did not get them. There has been little, if any, national vote on the prominent area since the Kilo decision. An opinion poll was conducted in Gallup immediately after Kilo &apos; s decision found that the judgement had contributed to a decrease in American approval of the Supreme Court. In 2006, 12 states considered initiatives to vote on legislation limiting the authority of the prominent domain. Ten of these measures became law, most of which were more than 60 per cent of the votes: Louisiana (55 per cent), Nevada (63 per cent), Arizona (65 per cent), Oregon (67 per cent), North Dakota (68 per cent), Florida (69 per cent), Michigan (80 per cent), Georgia (83 per cent), New Hampshire (86 per cent) and South Carolina (86 per cent). Update: We have previously reported that no ballot has been approved by more than 68 per cent of the votes. We were wrong. Five of them did. See the above figures.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00320"}
