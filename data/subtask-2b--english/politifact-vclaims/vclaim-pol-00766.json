Tony Evers\u2019 budget than any time in the recent past.\n\"Governor Evers' budget would increase property taxes by the largest amount in a decade,\" the Wisconsin Assembly GOP\u00a0tweeted March 27, 2019. \"Republicans have worked hard over the past 8 years to provide $3.56 billion in property tax relief to Wisconsin homeowners.\"\nSo Republicans are asserting not just that property taxes are going up, but that Evers\u2019 budget is to blame for that increase.\nWe checked it out.\nProperty tax increase would be largest in a decade\nThe Republicans\u2019 claim, as noted in the tweet, is based on a hypothetical median-valued home. It\u2019s a standard metric used to evaluate budget impact since it represents a \"typical\" Wisconsin homeowner.\nWe\u2019ve previously used that metric to examine numerous property tax claims, including state Rep.\u00a0John Nygren, R-Marinette, and then-Gov.\u00a0Scott Walker saying in recent years that property taxes are lower than in 2010. Both were rated Mostly True.\nUsing the median value \u2014 which for 2019-\u201920 is $173,646 \u2014 the numbers do show a property tax increase, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\n\nIf Evers\u2019 budget were passed as proposed, property taxes for the median-valued home would be an estimated $2,927 in 2019-\u201920. That\u2019s an increase of $56 or 2 percent from the 2018-\u201819 level. That would be the largest year-over-year increase since an $87 jump in 2009-\u201910.\nProperty taxes would rise another $45 or 1.5 percent in 2020-\u201921, the second year of the budget.\nRemember that these are statewide average rates \u2014 the changes on an individual tax bill won\u2019t match these numbers because of the taxing decisions made by local municipalities, differing values of homes and other factors.\nEvers\u2019 budget just one of many factors in increase\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Republicans\u2019 claim goes awry blaming Evers\u2019 budget for the increase.\nKit Beyer, communications director for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, said the March 27 claim relied on Evers\u2019 own Department of Administration estimate of the tax impact. The DOA numbers did show the largest increase in a decade, but they didn\u2019t detail what was behind the \u00a0increase.\nA\u00a0fiscal bureau report released April 9, 2019, showed the increase isn\u2019t simply due to changes in the governor\u2019s budget. It\u2019s largely a result of current law \u2014 decisions made by local municipalities, voters and state government under Walker.\nIn fact, while some of Evers\u2019 individual proposals would raise taxes, the overall budget would actually reduce the property tax level from what it would have been under current law alone. Fiscal bureau calculations say current law on its own would mean property taxes would go up by $72 on the median home in 2019-\u201920; under Evers\u2019 budget the increase drops to $56.\nUnder current law, tax levies for school districts, technical colleges, municipalities and counties are expected to grow by 2 percent to 3 percent each in 2019-\u201920, according to the fiscal bureau. Some of those increases will be offset by new construction.The rest could affect the tax rate.\nMeanwhile, Evers\u2019 budget would increase the property taxes districts are able to impose by $123 million in 2019-\u201920, but that would be offset by a $205 million increase in general school aids from the state. That would create a net drop in school-related taxes.\nMelissa Baldauff, a spokeswoman for Evers, also noted some factors that significantly impact the property tax level are outside the governor\u2019s control. Those include school district tax levies implemented under current law and an unprecedented level of school spending approved by referendum, such as for new building projects or expanding annual spending beyond the typical limits.\nIn 2018 alone, Wisconsin voters approved a\u00a0record $2 billion in K-12 school spending statewide through referendums, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum.\nBeyer argued Evers deserves the blame for any increases under his budget plan.\n\"If he didn\u2019t want (property taxes) to go up by this much, he could have taken actions to reduce it,\" she said in an email. \"As a comparison, over the last eight years, Governor Walker and the Legislature took numerous actions to keep property taxes low.\"\nOur rating\nRepublicans claimed in a tweet that Evers\u2019 budget would increase Wisconsin property taxes by the largest amount in a decade.\nThe estimate they relied on does show the largest year-over-year increase since 2009-\u201910. But the increase is not solely a result of Evers\u2019 budget. Rather, it is based, in part, on a host of decisions by voters in referendums, by local units of government and by Walker and Republican leaders in years past.\nIndeed, the overall impact of Evers\u2019 budget is to help keep the increase in check.\nWe rate the claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00766"}
