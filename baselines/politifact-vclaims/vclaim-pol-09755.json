Rick Scott trumpeted his \"Florida Families First\" budget as providing record-breaking money for schools, including $2,500 raises for teachers.\n\n\"This total includes $10.7 billion in state funding for Florida K-12 schools, the highest state funding level in history,\" Scott said in a Jan. 31, 2013, news conference about his 2013-14 budget recommendations.\n\nThe crowd of teachers and university presidents huddled around Scott applauded his comment. We thought it merited another look.\n\nOverall education spending vs. state spending\n\nScott was very careful to specify state funding for education would be higher than ever in his proposed budget. But schools are funded by more sources than the state. The complex school-funding formula includes local taxes and, in recent years, federal stimulus dollars, too.\n\nScott\u2019s press team directed us to a\u00a0breakdown of state and local school funding\u00a0for the past 10 years. It does not include federal stimulus funding.The blue bar represents state funding, the green bar represents local funding, and the orange horizontal line at the top represents per-pupil funding.\n\n\nLooking at education spending this way excludes $1.78 billion in economic stimulus money Florida received to bolster its 2009-10 and 2010-11 budgets, so spending in those years should actually appear slightly closer to Scott\u2019s new proposal.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the education spending Scott proposed. He wants the state to spend $18.47 billion for education during the 2013-14 school year. Again, the state\u2019s share of that would be about $10.7 billion.\n\nSo if the Legislature passes a budget that precisely mirrors Scott\u2019s education proposals, the state\u2019s share of education spending would be its highest since 2007-08, when it was $9.71 billion. In terms of the state\u2019s actual dollar investment, Scott is right that it would be the highest.\n\nHowever, total state and local education spending in Scott\u2019s budget would be $280 million smaller than the 2007-08 budget signed by\u00a0Gov. Charlie\u00a0Crist.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the\u00a0$1.2 billion increase\u00a0from last year\u2019s education spending? About $480 million would go toward teacher raises and $300 million would go toward the unfunded liability of the state\u2019s retirement system. There\u2019s some debate as to whether the pension funding should be considered part of an education increase, but a couple experts told us it\u2019s reasonable because past calculations of the state\u2019s per-pupil funding have included the cost of teacher wages, part of which goes to the retirement system.\n\nBreaking\u00a0it down per student\n\nOf course, there are other ways of looking at state education spending. One is to look at spending per student.\n\nAs a whole, counting state and local funding, per-pupil funding under Scott\u2019s new budget would be $6,799. That\u2019s short of what it was before the economic recession, when per-pupil funding peaked in 2007-08 at $7,126. So back then, the state had fewer students and was providing more money for each. Now we have 85,000 more students, according to DOE numbers, but less money for each one.\n\nBut if you only look at the state\u2019s per-pupil level of $3,941 in Scott\u2019s new budget, it does exceed funding levels for the past 10 years in terms of actual dollars.\n\nAnd inflation?\n\nWe\u2019ll close with a point about inflation. When adjusted for inflation, does Scott\u2019s budget still stand up as the state\u2019s biggest education investment?\n\nWe used a\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0calculator\u00a0from\u00a0the Bureau of Labor Statistics to compare Scott\u2019s proposal with state spending on education for the past 10 years. (BLS\u00a0has not released\u00a0CPI data for January 2013, so the comparisons use 2012 inflation rates.)\n\nThe takeaway is that state spending on education, when adjusted for inflation, would not be significantly different than it was from 2004 to 2007.\n\nStill, even the Florida Education Association, the state teachers union that sued Scott over the 2011 merit pay plan, conceded the state has never invested more, and that it is reasonable to consider the proposed $300 million contribution to the state\u2019s retirement system as part of the $1.2 billion increase for education.\n\n\"Added money spent on public schools always helps grow our economy,\" said\u00a0FEA\u00a0President Andy Ford in a statement. \"We look forward to the governor\u2019s strong advocacy of this proposal.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nScott said his budget \"includes $10.7 billion in state funding for Florida K-12 schools, the highest state funding level in history.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFloridians hearing this statement might think that means education funding for Florida schools has never been higher. That's not the case.\n\nActually, Scott is referring only to the state government's specific contribution to overall spending. Scott drums up the state share as an historic investment, and it is in terms of actual dollars.\n\nBut there are also local and federal dollars that fund Florida schools. When you consider those, Scott's overall recommendation for education spending is still short of what Florida students received before the economic crash. It's about the same as it was under Gov. Jeb Bush when considering inflation.\u00a0\n\nScott\u2019s claim is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details that would give a different impression.
