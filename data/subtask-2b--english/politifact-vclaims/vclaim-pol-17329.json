It was designed to help plan for a global pandemic by bringing together business, government, and public health leaders.\n\"Nobody has been able to explain why they gave out stuffed souvenir Coronavirus toys at #Event201 yet,\" the post reads. \"Almost like this is big fun \u2014 for them. Or maybe it\u2019s to commemorate the virus that\u2019ll make them a fortune on vaccines & other treatments we will be forced to buy \u2014 Thoughts?\"\nUnderneath the post are three photos: a screen grab of Jan. 27 tweet from the Daily Mail showing images of the coronavirus under a microscope and two images showing small, stuffed toys shaped like orange suns with red rays and black eyes.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We noticed that there have also been many tweets speculating about Event 201\u2019s pandemic simulation.\nSo is it true that this plushie was distributed in commemoration of the coronavirus outbreak? Did the organizers of Event 201 have insider knowledge about this global health scare?\u00a0\nNo.\nHere\u2019s what we know.\u00a0\nThe toy at the center of the controversy is supposed to be a microbe.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo months before the outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was detected in Wuhan, China, the Event 201 scenario \u2014 which was organized by John Hopkins Center for Health Security World Economic Forum and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014\"simulated a novel zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from bats to pigs to people that eventually becomes efficiently transmissible from person to person, leading to a severe pandemic,\" according to the Event 201 website.\u00a0\nThe fictionalized scenario, which was planned in part because there have been two worldwide outbreaks of coronaviruses in the last 20 years, also included 65 million related deaths in 18 months from the pretend coronavirus.\nJohns Hopkins Center for Health Security on Oct. 16, 2019, tweeted a picture of the stuffed microbe as part of its Event 201 registration drive: \"Have you registered for the #Event201 virtual pandemic exercise yet?\" the tweet read. \"See the story of #Event201 play out in real-time and answer tough questions that could arise in a severe pandemic.

For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction.\"\nA World Economic Forum article stated that the Event 201 simulation of a pandemic was meant to \"bring together public and private leaders to inform multi-stakeholder cooperation for pandemic preparedness and response.\" The article argues there needs to be pandemic simulations like these to prepare for the average of 200 epidemics that take place annually. Johns Hopkins has hosted other simulations in recent years, including Dark Winter in 2001, Atlantic Storm in 2005, and Clade X in 2018.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says that Event 201 in October 2019 gave out stuffed coronavirus plushies to commemorate a coronavirus outbreak that didn\u2019t start until December 2019.\nYes, these plushies are meant to represent coronavirus microbes. They were given out in October \u2014 two months before the first cases of the current 2019 coronavirus outbreak appeared \u2014 but this was not because the event\u2019s organizers had predicted the Novel Coronavirus to come. They were distributed as part of the registration for a New York event that was centered on preparing for a new coronavirus pandemic because of the history of outbreaks. These plushies were not intended to commemorate the toll that outbreak would bring.\nContext is everything. We rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17329"}
