She's in fifth place.", "text": "At a business round table on his visit to the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump said that there was a great opportunity to expand the trade relationship between the two countries. \"We're your biggest partner,\" said Trump June 4th. \"You're our biggest partner. A lot of people don't know that. I was surprised. I made that statement yesterday, and a lot of people said, \"Oh, my God, I didn't know that.\" But that's the way. Trump was right that the United States was Britain's largest trading partner, according to British government data. But he is quite wrong that the UK is America's largest trading partner. We contacted the White House and didn't answer it. United States trade data show that the United Kingdom ranks fifth in common trade - total exports and imports of goods and services - behind Canada, China, Japan and Mexico. The United Kingdom moves to the fourth largest export level. It falls to the sixth in terms of goods and services imported into the United States. In any way you look at it, Professor of Finance at the University of Notre Dame Jeffrey Bergstrand said Trump was wrong. On January 13, 2021, General David Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines in the launch security, and said to her, \"We are not working for you.\" \"He's a big partner, but not nearly among the biggest.\" Gary Hoffbauer, a senior colleague at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said that the figures were unambiguous, and called the United Kingdom a \"small partner\" of the United States. The United Kingdom-United States trade is at the top compared to other major European economies. However, in the context of America &apos; s conclusion of a separate trade deal with the United Kingdom in the post-Brussels era, it should be noted that Germany, France and Italy are part of the European Union &apos; s trade bloc. Their combined trade with the United States dwarfs that of the United Kingdom. Our Governor Trump said that the United Kingdom is the largest trading partner of the United States, which is wrong. The United Kingdom ranks fifth behind Canada, China, Japan and Mexico in joint trade with the United States. As a market for United States exports, it ranks fourth after Canada, Mexico and China. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00571"}
