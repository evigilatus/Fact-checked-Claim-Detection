0001	Donald Trump	Look, he's a showboat.
0002	Donald Trump	He's a grandstander.
0003	Donald Trump	The FBI has been in turmoil.
0004	Donald Trump	You know that.
0005	Donald Trump	I know that.
0006	Donald Trump	Everybody knows that.
0007	Donald Trump	You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil.
0008	Donald Trump	Less than a year ago.
0009	Donald Trump	It hasn't recovered from that.
0010	Lester Holt	Monday, you met with the Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosenstein.
0011	Lester Holt	Did you ask for a recommendation? What I did is, was I going to fire
0012	SYSTEM	[James]
0013	Lester Holt	Comey.
0014	Donald Trump	My decision.
0015	Donald Trump	It was not...
0016	Lester Holt	You had made the decision before they came over...
0017	Donald Trump	I...
0018	Donald Trump	I was going to fire Comey.
0019	Donald Trump	There is no good time to do it by the way.
0020	Donald Trump	They...
0021	Lester Holt	Because in your letter you said I...
0022	Lester Holt	I accepted...
0023	Lester Holt	I accepted their recommendation.
0024	Lester Holt	So, you had already made the decision.
0025	Donald Trump	Oh, I was going to fire regardless of recommendation. So there
0026	SYSTEM	[inaudible]
0027	Donald Trump	He made a recommendation He is highly respected.
0028	Donald Trump	Very good guy.
0029	Donald Trump	Very smart guy.
0030	Donald Trump	The Democrats like him.
0031	Donald Trump	The Republicans like him.
0032	Donald Trump	He made a recommendation, but regardless of recommendation I was going to fire Comey, knowing there was no good time to do it.
0033	Donald Trump	And in fact, when I decided to just do it I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a madeup story.
0034	Donald Trump	It's an excuse by the Democrats having lost an election that they should have won.
0035	Donald Trump	And the reason they should have won it is, the electoral college is almost impossible for a Republican to win.
0036	Donald Trump	Very hard.
0037	Donald Trump	Because you start off at such a disadvantage.
0038	Donald Trump	So, everybody was thinking they should have won the election.
0039	Donald Trump	This was an excuse for having lost an election.
0040	Lester Holt	Are you angry with Mr. Comey because of his Russia investigation?
0041	Donald Trump	I just want somebody that's competent.
0042	Donald Trump	I am a big fan of the FBI.
0043	Donald Trump	I love the FBI.
0044	Donald Trump	I love the people of the FBI.
0045	Donald Trump	but when you have a land of people taking on that investigation I think that.
0046	Lester Holt	But were you a fan of him taking up that investigation?
0047	Donald Trump	I think that... about the Hillary Clinton investigation?
0048	Lester Holt	No, about the Russia investigation and possible links between...
0049	Donald Trump	No, I don't care... look, look, let me tell you.
0050	Donald Trump	As far as I'm concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done properly.
0051	Donald Trump	When I did this now, I said I probably maybe, will confuse people.
0052	Donald Trump	Maybe I'll expand that, you know, I'll lengthen the time because... it should be over with, it should... in my opinion, it should have been over with a long time ago, because all it is, is an excuse, But, I said to myself I might even lengthen out the investigation, but I have to do the right thing for the American people.
0053	Donald Trump	He's the wrong man for that position.
0054	SYSTEM	[Break]
0055	Lester Holt	Let me ask you about your termination letter to Mr. Comey.
0056	Lester Holt	You write I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions and I am not under investigation.
0057	Lester Holt	Why did you put that in there?
0058	Donald Trump	Because he told me that.
0059	Donald Trump	I mean, he told me...
0060	Lester Holt	He told you you weren't under investigation with regard to the Russia investigation?
0061	Donald Trump	Yeah, and I've heard that, I've heard that from others.
0062	Lester Holt	Was it in a phone call?
0063	Lester Holt	Did you meet face to face?
0064	Donald Trump	I had a dinner with him.
0065	Donald Trump	He wanted to have dinner, because he wanted to stay on.
0066	Donald Trump	We had a very nice dinner at the White House very early on.
0067	Lester Holt	He asked for that?
0068	Donald Trump	That dinner was arranged.
0069	Donald Trump	I think he asked for the dinner.
0070	Donald Trump	And he wanted to stay on as the FBI head.
0071	Donald Trump	And I said, I would, you know, consider will see what happens.
0072	Donald Trump	But we had a very nice dinner.
0073	Donald Trump	And at that time, he told me you are not under investigation, which I knew anyway.
0074	Lester Holt	That was one meeting.
0075	Lester Holt	What were the other two?
0076	Donald Trump	First of all, when you are under investigation, you're giving all sorts of documents and everything.
0077	Donald Trump	I knew I wasn't under... And I heard it was stated at the committee, at some committee level that I wasn't.
0078	Donald Trump	Number one.
0079	Lester Holt	So that didn't come directly from him.
0080	Donald Trump	Then during the phone call, he said it, and then doing another phone call he said it.
0081	Donald Trump	So, he said it once at dinner, and then he said it twice doing phone calls.
0082	Lester Holt	Did... did you call him?
0083	Donald Trump	In one case, I called him.
0084	Donald Trump	In one case, he called me.
0085	Lester Holt	And did you ask am I under under investigation?
0086	Donald Trump	I actually asked him, yes.
0087	Donald Trump	I said, if it's possible, would you let me know if I am under investigation?
0088	Donald Trump	He said you are not under investigation.
0089	Lester Holt	But he's... he's given sworn testimony that there is an ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign, and possible collusion with the Russian government.
0090	Lester Holt	You were the centerpiece of the Trump campaign.
0091	Lester Holt	Is he being truthful when he says you're not under investigation?
0092	Donald Trump	Well, all I can tell you is... all, well, I know..
0093	Donald Trump	I know that I'm not under investigation, me personally.
0094	Donald Trump	I'm not talking about campaigns.
0095	Donald Trump	I'm not talking about anything else.
0096	Donald Trump	I'm not under investigation
0097	Lester Holt	Did you ask him to drop the investigation?
0098	Donald Trump	No, never.
0099	Lester Holt	Did anyone from the White House...
0100	Donald Trump	No, in fact I want the investigation speeded up.
0101	Lester Holt	Did anyone from the White House ask him to end the investigation?
0102	Donald Trump	No, no, why would we do that?
0103	Lester Holt	Any surrogates on behalf of the White House?
0104	Donald Trump	Not that I know of.
0105	Donald Trump	Look, I want to find out if there was a problem with an election having to do with Russia, or by the way any, but... anybody else.
0106	Donald Trump	Any other country.
0107	Donald Trump	And, I want that to be so strong and so good.
0108	Donald Trump	And, I want it to happen.
0109	Donald Trump	I also want to have a really competent, capable director.
0110	Donald Trump	He's not.
0111	Donald Trump	He's a showboater.
0112	Donald Trump	He's not my man, or not my man, and I didn't appoint him.
0113	Donald Trump	He was appointed long before me.
0114	Donald Trump	But I want somebody who's going to do a great job, and I will tell you, we're looking at candidates right now who could be spectacular and that's what I want for the FBI.
0115	Lester Holt	What you said a moment ago about supporting the idea of investigation a lot of people would find it hard to believe that the man who just said that tweeted very recently it's a total hoax.
0116	Lester Holt	It's a taxpayer charade.
0117	Donald Trump	Oh, I think that looking into me and, the campaign...look, I have nothing to do.
0118	Donald Trump	This was set up by the Democrats.
0119	Donald Trump	There is no collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians.
0120	Donald Trump	The other thing is the Russians did not affect the vote.
0121	Donald Trump	And everybody seems to think that.
0122	Lester Holt	There is an investigation under way though, an FBI investigation.
0123	Lester Holt	Is that a charade?
0124	Donald Trump	Well, I don't know if it's an FBI, or if it's, there's so many investigations.
0125	Donald Trump	I don't know if it's an FBI investigation or if it's a Congress, if it's the Senate, or the House...
0126	Lester Holt	Well, James Comey testified there was an an FBI investigation.
0127	Donald Trump	Yeah, but I think they're also helping the House and the Senate.
0128	Donald Trump	So, you probably have FB.. FBI, but you have House, you have Senate.
0129	Donald Trump	They have other investigations.
0130	Lester Holt	But when you put out tweets it's a total hoax, it's a taxpayer charade, and you're looking for a new FBI director, are you not sending that person a message to lay off?
0131	Donald Trump	No.
0132	Donald Trump	I'm not doing that.
0133	Donald Trump	I think that we have to get back to work, but I want to find out...
0134	Donald Trump	I want to get to the bottom.
0135	Donald Trump	If Russia hacked, if Russia did anything having to do with our election,
0136	Lester Holt	Well, there's already, already intelligence from virtually every intelligence agency that yes, that happened.
0137	Donald Trump	I'll tell you this.
0138	Donald Trump	If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it's a horrible thing, and I want to get to the bottom of it, and I want to make sure it will never ever happen.
0139	Lester Holt	Were angry with James Comey when he went public and said he can't support your unsubstantiated charges of wire tapping... that your your predecessor wiretapped you?
0140	Donald Trump	I was surprised he said it but I wasn't angry.
0141	Donald Trump	There's a big thing going on right now which is spying, and it's.... you can call it anything you want.
0142	Donald Trump	The, the unmasking, and the spying, and to me, that's the big story right now.
0143	Donald Trump	That's a very very big story.
0144	Lester Holt	You didn't take that as a sign of disloyalty that came out and contradicted you?
0145	Donald Trump	No, I didn't...
0146	Donald Trump	I didn't.
0147	Donald Trump	I don't think of it is loyalty.
0148	Donald Trump	I mean, I want, whoever the director is, I want them to do the right thing.
0149	Lester Holt	And what about when he went public and said that there was in fact an FBI investigation looking at your campaign and Russia.
0150	Lester Holt	Did that anger you?
0151	Lester Holt	I ask that because there's... there is a sense that there was a building anger here.
0152	Donald Trump	Well, you know, I have that.
0153	Donald Trump	I have that.
0154	Donald Trump	No, no, no.
0155	Donald Trump	I..
0156	Donald Trump	I know, every once in a while you'll see that in the newspaper, anger, somebody will report, or they'll have fall sources that maybe don't exist, because of the media, the way the media is.
0157	Donald Trump	No, I will tell you I think that, um, I want, very simply a great FBI director.
0158	Lester Holt	And we expect that they would would continue on with this investigation?
0159	Donald Trump	Oh yeah sure, I expect that.
0160	Lester Holt	General Flynn is a part of his investigation.
0161	Lester Holt	You know, Sally Yates recently testified that the White House was notified that he had been compromised, he was at risk of being blackmailed.
0162	Lester Holt	It was eighteen days later that he was finally fired.
0163	Lester Holt	During that eighteen days he had access, I assume, to all the nation's top secrets.
0164	Lester Holt	One day, you meet on the issue of Comey...
0165	Donald Trump	Right.
0166	Lester Holt	...and you fire in a humiliating way while he's sitting in a room with his colleagues and it's appearing on the TV.
0167	Donald Trump	Cause my White House Counsel Don McGahn, came back to me, and did not sound like an emergency of any... it didn't make it sound like he was, you know... and she actually didn't make it sound that way either, in the hearings the other day, like it had to be done immediately.
0168	Donald Trump	This man has served for many years.
0169	Donald Trump	He's a general.
0170	Donald Trump	He's a, in my opinion, a very good person.
0171	Donald Trump	I believe that it would be very unfair to hear from somebody who we don't even know and immediately run out and fire a general.
0172	Donald Trump	Now...
0173	Lester Holt	She was the acting Attorney General at the time.
0174	Donald Trump	Uh, my White House counsel came to me.
0175	Donald Trump	They had, I believe two meetings.
0176	Donald Trump	And we ultimately fired, but was fired for a different reason.
0177	Lester Holt	You're talking about General Flynn.
0178	Donald Trump	General Flynn, yes.
0179	Lester Holt	Because of, because of lying to the Vice President.
0180	Donald Trump	Yeah, but everything plays in.
0181	Donald Trump	Everything plays into it.
0182	Donald Trump	But we fired him because he said something to the vice president that was not so.
0183	Lester Holt	Did you know that he had had that received payments from the Russian government, that he had received payments from the Turkish government?
0184	Donald Trump	No, no but Obama perhaps knew because he had clearance from the Obama administration.
0185	Donald Trump	And his clearance... and, and this is something they never want to report.
0186	Donald Trump	He had clearance from the Obama administration, the highest clearance you can have.
0187	Donald Trump	And, I think it's a very unfair thing that the media doesn't talk about that.
0188	Donald Trump	You know you're talking about 2015.
0189	Donald Trump	I don't know that I knew him in 2015.
0190	Lester Holt	The Senate intelligence committee wants, wants info... information from the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Unit about your finances, your business' finances.
0191	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0192	Lester Holt	Can you tell us whether you, your family, your business is... your surrogates have accepted any investments, any loans from Russian individual or institutions?
0193	Donald Trump	Yeah, in fact I just sent a letter sent to Lindsey Graham from one of the most prestigious law firms.
0194	Donald Trump	in the country, a tremendous, highlyrated law firm that I have nothing to do with Russia.
0195	Donald Trump	I have no investments in Russia.
0196	Donald Trump	None whatsoever.
0197	Donald Trump	I don't have property in Russia.
0198	Donald Trump	A lot of people thought I owned office buildings in Moscow.
0199	Donald Trump	I don't have property in Russia.
0200	Donald Trump	And I am in very...
0201	Donald Trump	I'm, I mean...
0202	Donald Trump	I'm in total compliance in every way.
0203	Donald Trump	Now I have to tell you, I file documents, hundreds of pages worth of documents, with the Federal Elections Bureau.
0204	Donald Trump	Everybody's seen that.
0205	Donald Trump	I built a great company.
0206	Donald Trump	But I'm not involved with Russia.
0207	Donald Trump	I have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian, many years ago.
0208	Donald Trump	I had the Miss Universe pageant, which I owned for quite a while, I had it in Moscow, long time ago.
0209	Donald Trump	But other than that, I have nothing to do with Russia.
0210	Lester Holt	And one last a question on this matter, did you ever...
0211	Donald Trump	And I have a certified letter, just so you understand.
0212	Donald Trump	It...
0213	Donald Trump	I'm not just saying that.
0214	Donald Trump	I've given the letter.
0215	Donald Trump	I've given a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham.
0216	Donald Trump	He has the letter, and I think frankly...
0217	Donald Trump	I assume he's going to give the letter out.
0218	Donald Trump	But it says, I am not involved in Russia.
0219	Donald Trump	No loans.
0220	Donald Trump	No nothing.
0221	Lester Holt	Did you worry at all when you made the decision to fire Comey when you did, the day before Lavrov was here in the White House, and the Russian ambassador.
0222	Lester Holt	Did you think through the optics of the way this would look?
0223	Donald Trump	I never thought about.
0224	Donald Trump	It was set up a while ago.
0225	Donald Trump	And frankly I could have waited but, what difference does it make?
0226	Donald Trump	I'm not looking for cosmetics.
0227	Donald Trump	I'm looking to do a great job for the country.
0228	Donald Trump	I'm looking to create jobs.
0229	Donald Trump	I'm looking to create strength and security.
0230	Donald Trump	I'm looking to have strong borders.
0231	Donald Trump	I'm looking for things like that.
0232	Donald Trump	I think it's really a good thing that I meet with people.
0233	Donald Trump	Now, this is a public meeting, because you know, when you cover this, the people watching may say, oh he met with Lavrov.
0234	Donald Trump	Well, this was announced that I'm meeting with Lavrov, just like the number of days ago I spoke... had a very good conversation, very public in the sense that everybody knew this was taking place.
0235	Donald Trump	I meet, I...
0236	Donald Trump	I talk all the time.
0237	Donald Trump	I just spoke, with the head of, the new head of South Korea, who just got elected.
0238	Donald Trump	I speak with the head of India.
0239	Donald Trump	I speak with the head of China.
0240	Donald Trump	I have to speak with Putin also.
0241	Donald Trump	It's called Russia.
0242	Donald Trump	But when I spoke with Putin, he asked me whether or not I would see Lavrov.
0243	Donald Trump	Now what, should show I say, no I'm not going to see him?
0244	Donald Trump	I said I will see him.
0245	Donald Trump	During that discussion with Lavrov, I think we had a great discussion having to do with Syria, having to do with the Ukraine, and maybe that discussion will lead to a lot less people getting killed, and will lead ultimately to peace, so I'm...
0246	Donald Trump	I'm okay with those discussions Lester, I think it's a good thing, not a bad thing.
