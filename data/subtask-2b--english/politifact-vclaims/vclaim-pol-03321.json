Although Fox has reported the incident, the local media is working real hard on not covering that little fact. Imagine that!\"\nIhavethetruth.com doesn\u2019t describe itself as a news source--or much otherwise. Its \"About\" web page says only: \"I Have The Truth is where you show up every day for your marching orders.\"\nNo evidence, newspaper says\nA day after the site said a student intervened with a gun, the Austin American-Statesman published a news story finding no confirmation that a gun-toting student got involved. The prospect of someone pulling a gun had seemed especially possible because the Texas law allowing individuals with state-issued permits to carry a handgun on public college campuses took effect in August 2016.\nThe American-Statesman\u00a0story, partly headlined \"VIRAL ITEM DEBUNKED,\" said chatter about a student possibly brandishing a gun to help police end the incident appeared to have originated in an anonymous Twitter feed, whose user posted a screenshot of a conversation thread in which someone \u2013 whose name was blurred out \u2013 claims to have \"grabbed my gun and ... chased the kid briefly.\"\nAccording to the\u00a0story by reporter Marty Toohey, UT police termed the rumor of help from an armed student false and said they\u2019d found no corroborating evidence, be it video or first-hand accounts. \"It\u2019s a rumor and there\u2019s nothing to verify it,\" campus spokeswoman Cindy Posey said.\nMeanwhile, the student-with-a-gun account also was trumpeted on\u00a0the InfoWars web site under the headline \"Report: Student with gun stops mass stabbing at University of Texas.\" Its post pointed to a May 1, 2017, tweet by @TexasRebel56, who appears to have shared a screenshot of a private message of someone \u2013 the names of the people on thread are obscured \u2013 claiming: \"I ran inside and grabbed my gun out (sic) and came back and chased the kid briefly but I wasn\u2019t comfortable shooting because people were around.\"\nAlso on May 1, a UT student who arrived at the scene after the attack told the American-Statesman that another student told him he had \"flashed\" a gun at the suspect. But police said they couldn\u2019t confirm that story, adding that it was unlikely based upon the incident's brief timeframe.\nThe same day, UT Student Government Vice President Binna Kim was among those who repeated the rumor, though after sending it via GroupMe she promptly tweeted an apology that stated the rumor had not been confirmed.\nPolice chief a day later\nAt a May 2, 2017, press conference, a reporter asked UT Police Chief David Carter: \"There was a rumor on social media that someone with a concealed handgun prevented further attacks. Is there any validity to that?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarter replied: \"So one of the things that bedevils police departments on occasion is the information that comes across social media.\n\"Yes, we\u2019ve heard that,\" the chief said. \"We have no verification of that. I will tell you, if you look at the sequence of events and the timeline, it doesn\u2019t appear likely.\"\nCarter said that a minute and a half elapsed between the stabbings and before the student accused of the knife attacks, Kendrex White, was apprehended as he moved toward a campus dormitory knife-in-hand.\nA day earlier, Carter specified\u00a0that that about 1:49 p.m. May 1, his department got a call about an individual who \"actually attacked or assaulted somebody\" near a gym. In less than two minutes, an officer was on the scene.\nThe officer observed the individual walking away from an individual who was down on the ground,\" Carter said. \"He was armed with a large, Bowie-style hunting knife.\" The officer confronted the man, Carter said, drawing his weapon and ordering the man to the ground. Then the suspect was taken into custody.\nOn May 4, 2017, the debunkists at Snopes.com found \"unproven\" the idea that a student with a concealed handgun stopped the knife attacks.\nThen an Associated Press\u00a0news story, published May 7, 2017, said that during the UT incident, \"no gun-toting student or professor pulled a pistol to stop the man in his tracks. No shots were fired and no gun was even drawn until police swarmed in to subdue the suspect.\"\nNo changes, UT says\nWe asked UT if there were developments since the knife attacks suggesting a\u00a0student with a gun helped quell the attacker.\nBy email, Shilpa Bakre replied: \"This is an incorrect rumor.\" Bakre said a UTPD officer \"took the suspect down and arrested him \u2013 no civilians with guns were involved. Police have interviewed over 40 witnesses thus far, as well as reviewed video footage to support this.\"\nOur ruling\nA web blog said a UT student used a concealed gun to help police stop knife attacks on the campus.\nIn a\u00a0week-plus after\u00a0the attacks, there were no credible news reports or law-enforcement confirmations of this claim which looks to us like it was bandied by pro-gun advocates presuming or perhaps wishing it was so.\nPants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
