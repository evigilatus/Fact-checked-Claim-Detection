Roy Cooper\u2019s mandate that people wear masks in public.\nOne Facebook post, which was viewed hundreds of times, said the mandate will infringe upon North Carolinians\u2019 Second Amendment rights.\n\"For those of you like myself that has your concealed carry permit and carry, you can be charged with a class H felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying,\" it says, adding: \"Once you have a felony(,) you can no longer carry.\"\nIs that true?\nNo. A spokesman for Cooper, who is a Democrat, a spokesman for the Republican state Senate leader, and the leader of the state\u2019s leading gun rights group all agree: North Carolinians are allowed to wear a mask and carry a concealed weapon.\n\nMask laws\nThe Facebook post references North Carolina\u2019s General Statute 14-12.\nThat statute, specifically 14-12.7, forbids adults from concealing their identities in public. But it doesn\u2019t mention guns at all. And it passed decades ago to target the Ku Klux Klan, according to WRAL.\nThe mask law was suspended in May when state lawmakers passed their coronavirus relief package.\u00a0\nThe law now says \"any person wearing a mask for the purpose of ensuring the physical health or safety of the wearer or others\" is exempt from state law prohibiting masks in public. It\u2019s set to expire Aug. 1.\nBut even when it does expire, experts told us they don\u2019t believe there will be a conflict between mask laws and concealed carry laws.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat experts said\nPat Ryan, a spokesman for Senate leader Phil Berger, told PolitiFact that the anti-mask law applies \"irrespective of whether a person is carrying a weapon or not.\"\n\"No statute exists that treats carrying a concealed weapon while masked differently than any other activity while masked,\" Ryan said.\nGrass Roots North Carolina, one of the state\u2019s leading advocates for Second Amendment rights, interprets the mask laws the same way. Paul Valone, president of Grass Roots NC, told PolitiFact in a phone interview that he\u2019s aware of the rumors.\u00a0\nHe says they\u2019re inaccurate and could potentially discourage someone from carrying their concealed weapon and protecting themselves. Valone posted a letter from the group\u2019s lawyer on its Facebook page.\n\"At your request, I have investigate(d) the rampant rumors that NC law makes it a felony to carry a firearm while wearing a mask \u2013 even if the individual holds a valid Concealed Handgun Permit,\" wrote Ed Green, the group\u2019s Director of Legal Affairs. \"There is no such law.\"\nGreen explained the mask and concealed carry laws this way:\n\"There is no law that makes wearing a mask illegal because one is carrying a firearm, and there is no law that makes carrying a firearm illegal because one is wearing a mask.\"\nAsked if it\u2019s illegal to carry a concealed weapon while wearing a mask, Cooper spokesman Ford Porter said: \"Having reviewed the concealed carry statute, our office does not believe this is the case.\"\nA fact check by the Associated Press also found the Facebook post to be False.\nOur ruling\nA viral Facebook post says \"you can be charged with a class H felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying\" in North Carolina.\nThe state\u2019s top Democrat, top Republican and leading gun rights group agree: the claim is inaccurate and unfounded. We rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17998"}
