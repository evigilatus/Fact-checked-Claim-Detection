We found only a handful that surveyed people about candidates\u2019 leadership qualities, and just one that asked respondents to compare candidates in terms of leadership.\nAs far as polling goes, that\u2019s a fairly small sample. But Trump does have a point. Here\u2019s what we found:\nWashington Post/ABC poll, conducted Oct. 15-18\nThis poll asked Republican-leaning respondents who among six candidates is the strongest leader. Nearly half of respondents -- 47 percent -- selected Trump.\nTwelve percent said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (11 percent), Carson (9 percent), Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (8 percent), and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina (6 percent).\nThis poll comes the closest to matching Trump\u2019s talking point: Nearly four times as many respondents said Trump is the strongest leader compared to Bush, the candidate with the next-highest results. However, this is the only poll we could find that asks people to choose the best leader among several candidates.\nTrump led the Washington Post/ABC poll overall with 32 percent support; Carson was second with 21 percent.\nQuinnipiac University poll, released Nov. 1\nThis poll asked, \"Would you say that (candidate) has strong leadership qualities or not?\" When presented this question about Trump, 60 percent of respondents answered \"yes\" -- the highest percentage of yes answers. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed, each receiving 56 percent. Rubio and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., each received 48 percent. Carson got 47, and Cruz got the lowest with 45 percent.\nCBS News poll, released Oct. 11\nCBS asked Republican voters about various qualities held by the three outsider candidates: Trump, Carson and Fiorina. Among respondents, 84 percent said Trump has strong qualities of leadership. Carson followed, at 72 percent, and 60 percent said Fiorina has strong leadership qualities.\nQuinnipiac poll, released Sept. 24\nLike the other Quinnipiac poll, this one asked, \"Would you say that (candidate) has strong leadership qualities or not?\" When presented this question about Trump, 58 percent of respondents answered \"yes\" -- the highest percentage of yes answers. \u00a0\nClinton followed, receiving 55 percent. Next was Vice President Joe Biden (54 percent), Bush (52 percent), Fiorina (52 percent), Carson (48 percent), and Sanders (45 percent).\n(Quinnipiac has released a few other polls that ask this question over the past few months, with similar results.)\nWhat about that CNN poll\nTrump specifically mentioned a CNN poll, but searching through Real Clear Politics\u2019 collection and on the CNN website, we couldn\u2019t find one that asked about leadership qualities. We also reached out to Trump\u2019s campaign but didn\u2019t hear back.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that in polls about 2016 candidate leadership skills, he comes out \"two and three and four times higher than anybody else.\"\nOnly a few polls so far have asked about candidates\u2019 leadership qualities, but Trump has a point that he usually comes out on top. One poll in particular supported Trump\u2019s claim: Compared to the candidate with the next-highest results, about four times as many people said Trump had the best leadership skills among a group of candidates.\nBut that was just one poll. Most polls have asked respondents to say whether each individual candidate has strong leadership qualities -- not comparing the candidates against each other. In these polls, Trump beats out his opponents by a handful of percentage points, not two, three or four times higher.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05763"}
