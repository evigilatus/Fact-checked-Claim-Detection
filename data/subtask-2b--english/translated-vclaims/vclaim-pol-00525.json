But did the Western movie star see the American flag and whether the population should wonder where it is in public? \"If you don't want an American flag flying in your town yard or in your school, then why the hell are you living in the United States?\" On April 7, he read an article on Facebook that attributed the quote to Wayne.

Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook article Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. On January 12, 2021, we contacted the John Wayne Museum of Birth in Winterst, Iowa, who responded to an e-mail from Polity Fuckett, saying: \"In our search, John Wayne didn't mention it.\" He didn't say it in Playboy in 1971, and his search for the exact quote that appeared in Facebook appeared eight pages on the Internet, most of them Mimi's sites, but there are no reliable original sources. We found similar results to the search for a short version of the quote. We then searched the Nexis database for quotations in all publications available in English and found nothing. The search for \"John Wayne,\" \"American Science\" and \"City Square,\" we couldn't find a quote or anything like that, even though the 2003 story of Texas Country Fairs in the Los Angeles Times quotes a man who wants a full American flag mixed with Wayne's image. We will reconsider the verification of the facts if a source of this statement appears. In the meantime, we assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00525"}
