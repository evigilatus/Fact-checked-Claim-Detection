Written by civil rights activist James Weldon Johnson in 1900 and set to music by his brother, John Rosamond Johnson, the song was adopted by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\u00a0as its official song in 1918 and is often referred to as the Black national anthem.\u00a0\nDuring the Chiefs-Texans game, Chiefs players and coaches stretched across one of the end zones while a video of Alicia Keys singing the Black anthem played on video boards, USA Today reported, while the Texans remained in their locker room.\u00a0\nWhen the song ended, the Chiefs jogged off the field and players stood on the sideline for the national anthem. One player, defensive end Alex Okafor, took a knee. The Texans continued to remain in their locker room until the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" ended. At that point, the Texans ran onto the field and \"both teams came together at the center of the field for what the public address announcer called \u2018a moment of silence to support racial equality in our country,\u2019\" according to USA Today.\u00a0\n\"The Texans had discussed staging a protest during both anthems in an attempt to continue to draw attention to the ongoing problems of police brutality against people of color and systemic oppression,\" the newspaper said.\nWhile this Facebook post is correct that the Texans stayed in their locker room for the national anthem, it\u2019s wrong about the team\u2019s actions during the song known as the Black national anthem, and it misleads readers into thinking the players pointedly took the field for one song and not the other.\nWe rate this Facebook post Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18930"}
