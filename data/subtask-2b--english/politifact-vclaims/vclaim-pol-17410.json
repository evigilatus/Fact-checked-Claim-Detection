Since prayer wasn\u2019t banned at schools before Trump\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s not possible that he returned prayer to schools.\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nOn National Religious Freedom Day, Jan. 16, 2020, Trump announced constitutional guidance on school prayer, which was posted by the U.S. Education Department. The video called the document a \"bill,\" which it isn\u2019t.\u00a0 A bill would require congressional action.\nTrump said he was \"announcing historic steps to protect the First Amendment right to pray in public schools. So you have the right to pray.\"\nThis guidance was not \"historic,\" as there was a similar one issued in 2003 during President George W. Bush\u2019s tenure. Both guidance documents explain that students may pray when not engaged in school activities or instruction and that teachers in their official capacities can\u2019t encourage or discourage prayer, or actively participate in prayer with students.\u00a0\nWe sent a copy of the 2003 and 2020 guidance documents to Richard Layton, associate professor of religion at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Layton found no significant shift in the legal terrain. He found modest differences, most notably that the 2020 document expands on reporting requirements related to complaints.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This seems to be potentially a mechanism that will support more aggressive intervention into state and local educational policies/practices,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, the main purpose of the new guidelines seems to be to advertise to Christian communities that the administration will advocate for them.\"\nThe ACLU concluded that both the 2003 and 2020 guidance documents \"affirm a core constitutional protection: School officials are prohibited from imposing their faith on students.\"\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation concluded that the guidance \"reiterates the state of law.\"\nTo be clear, religion has not been banned from public schools. In 1962, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that school-sponsored or state-organized prayer violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. But the decision does not prohibit prayer or religious expression at school.\u00a0\nRELATED FACT-CHECK: Rafael Cruz, father of Ted Cruz, says 'everybody prayed,' read Bible at schools prior to 1962\nOur ruling\nA video on Facebook said, \"President Trump signs bill returning prayer in schools.\"\nTrump didn\u2019t sign a bill; his administration issued a guidance. But that guidance didn\u2019t return prayer to schools. It's nearly the same as a 2003 guidance that explains when students can pray at school of their own initiative. For decades, school-sponsored prayer has been banned, but that doesn\u2019t ban religious expression at schools entirely.\nThe overall message about Trump and school prayer in this video is misleading.
