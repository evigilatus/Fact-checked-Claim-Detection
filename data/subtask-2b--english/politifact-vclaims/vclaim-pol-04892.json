Dale Kooyenga, a military intelligence officer in the Army Reserves and a veteran of the Iraq War, it says this:\n\"Today, it is more difficult to enlist in the United States military than it is to enroll in college.\"\nThat\u2019s a broad claim from Kooyenga, a suburban Milwaukee Republican who made the statement in his April 1, 2016 constituent newsletter. He was asserting that \"if we are going to continue to be the world\u2019s military leader, we must also become a leader in education.\"\nKooyenga seems to have a compelling talking point.\nBut, as defense manpower specialist Beth Asch told us, it\u2019s also \"a mashup of a lot of ideas in one sentence.\"\nPost-high school\nBoth the military and college are post-high school pursuits that require a high school diploma. But the similarities more or less end there.\n\n\nThe military is looking for soldiers; colleges are looking for students.\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum requirements to get into the military are pretty standard, even if they vary somewhat by branch. But the entrance requirements to get into Harvard are much different than those for getting into a community college.\n\n\n\n\nThe military will pay you; but most students need to pay for college.\n\n\nSo, in terms of Kooyenga\u2019s claim: More difficult for whom?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult for an overweight person with good grades to get into the military; but it\u2019s more difficult for a fit person with bad grades to get into college.\nAll that being said, Kooyenga does have some numbers on his side.\nThe statistics\nAsch, an economist with the RAND Corp. think tank, said statistics Kooyenga cited to us to back his claim are generally on target.\nMilitary: Defense Department estimates dating back to at least 2009 say roughly 75 percent of Americans ages 17 to 24 would not qualify to enlist in the military.\nOne reason is being overweight. Indeed, when first lady Michelle Obama said in 2011 that more than one-quarter of America\u2019s young adults are too fat to serve in the U.S. military, PolitiFact Georgia rated her claim True.\nOther common reasons for being barred from the military, besides lacking a high school diploma: Conviction of a felony or serious misdemeanor; prior drug or alcohol abuse; and current prescription-drug use for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nCollege: Federal statistics, including one Kooyenga cited, show that roughly 66 percent of people who graduate from high school go onto college. (For 2015 high school graduates, 69 percent had enrolled in colleges or universities by October 2015, according to a federal report.)\nBut, the two sets of figures reinforce the point that, while Kooyenga\u2019s claim was broad, it really comes down to individual characteristics as to whether it\u2019s more difficult for a person to get into the military versus college.\nOur rating\nKooyenga said: \"Today, it is more difficult to enlist in the U.S. military than it is to enroll in college.\"\nThere isn\u2019t definitive evidence to prove the claim, given that it mixes apples and oranges: The military and college are entirely different pursuits with different sets of minimum standards for getting in, and among colleges, the entrance requirements vary widely.\nAt the same time, there are credible estimates saying that roughly 75 percent of young adults in America wouldn\u2019t be eligible to enlist if they tried, while roughly two out of three high school graduates go on to a two- or four-year college.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04892"}
