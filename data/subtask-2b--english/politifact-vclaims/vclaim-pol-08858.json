Soon after, CNN provided us with additional information. After we looked into their data, we rewrote and republished the story the same day, changing the rating to Half True. The original item has been archived here.\nA faceoff on CNN\u2019s Crossfire between Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, and Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, a Democrat, produced a robust debate over how best to promote a state\u2019s economic growth and quality of life. It also produced a blizzard of statistics with varying degrees of accuracy.\nOne of the disputes focused on the two states\u2019 population growth, with co-host Newt Gingrich suggesting that Texas was growing and Maryland shrinking because of their economic performance.\nHere\u2019s the exchange:\nO\u2019Malley: \"One of the key differences between our two states, Newt, is that our state was ranked among the top three in upward economic mobility. Texas was ranked among the worst states in terms of downward economic mobility.\"\nGingrich: \"Let me ask you this. As an objective fact, in the five years you've been governor, Texas has gained 440,000 people. According to the U.S. Census, Maryland has lost 20,000. Now, if we're having all this upward trajectory, why is Texas doing 22 times better in population migration over the last five years than Maryland?\"\nO\u2019Malley: \"Actually, you need to check your facts. We've actually added 230,000 people. And we've actually grown by 4 percent. But that fact is dubiously put out by some blogs.\"\nGingrich: \"This is the U.S. Census.\"\nWe turned to the source Gingrich cited: the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bureau not only counts the United States\u2019 population every 10 years but also estimates population every year in between. We looked at the population estimates for the five-year period between 2007, the year O\u2019Malley took office, and 2012, the most recent year available. Here\u2019s the summary:\nUsing these numbers, O\u2019Malley is correct. Maryland didn\u2019t lose 20,000 people in the past five years; as O\u2019Malley correctly noted, Maryland gained just over 230,000 people during that period. O\u2019Malley was also essentially correct about the percentage increase for Maryland -- 4.1 percent.\nMeanwhile, Texas didn\u2019t gain 440,000 people over the past five years, as Gingrich had said. The Lone Star State actually gained many more -- upwards of 2.2 million new Texans over five years.\nHowever, Gingrich can also claim accuracy by looking at a different set of statistics. He can point to numbers for migration -- that is, the net change in people who moved into or out of a state from other states. This number, unlike the one O\u2019Malley used, excludes births, deaths and foreign immigration.\nThe Census figures show that between 2007 and 2012, Maryland has lost a net of 22,774 people. Over the same period, Texas has gained 423,273 people. That\u2019s less than Gingrich had indicated, but all in all, it\u2019s pretty close.\nOur ruling\nGingrich said that since 2007, \"Texas has gained 440,000 people\" while \"Maryland has lost 20,000.\" O\u2019Malley countered that Maryland has added 230,000 people.\nEssentially, they\u2019re both right -- they just used different measurements. O\u2019Malley is right if you use overall population figures, while Gingrich is right if you look at migration from other states. We\u2019ll split the difference and call this one Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e7b3a23e-187f-4d5d-b760-b22d0934aafb", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08858"}
