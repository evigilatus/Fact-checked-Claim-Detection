Rick Perry's long tenure in public office, Lone Star First, an organization that's funded and supported by the Democratic Governors Association, unleashed an attack ad called \"Cracks.\" It features a photo of Perry that splinters more with each charge the association levels against him.\n\n\"Twenty-five years as a politician changes you,\" a narrator says in the ad posted on YouTube Sept. 28. \"You think injecting 11- and 12-year-old girls with a controversial drug, without a parent's consent, is a good idea. You think it's right to use a government takeover of Texas homes and property so foreign companies can get rich. You spend taxpayer money on a fancy mansion while Texas faces an $18 billion deficit. On the issues, 25 years as a politician has changed Rick Perry, for the worse.\"\n\nWe've previously touched on Perry's past advocacy of a toll-road network, his rental digs and the budget\u00a0shortfall. Now we wondered about Texas girls receiving a \"controversial drug\" without parental consent.\n\nOn Feb. 2, 2007, Perry issued an executive order that required the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules mandating that Texas girls entering sixth grade receive a vaccine against the human papillomavirus. Certain types of HPV, a sexually-transmitted virus, can cause cervical cancer and genital warts.\n\nCritics said the vaccine, Merck & Co.'s Gardasil, was too new to declare safe. Some said too that Perry's order would infringe on parental rights or give girls a false sense of security, leading them to be sexually active too young.\n\nLawmakers blocked the plans, and earlier this year, Allison Castle, Perry's press secretary, told us that the governor's office considers the mandate \"null and void.\" She said Perry \"will not pursue it in the future.\" At the time, we rated\u00a0Barely True\u00a0Perry's statement that his executive order didn't make the vaccine mandatory.\n\nBut did Perry's move mean children would receive shots without parental consent?\n\nBrannon Jordan, a spokesman at the Democratic Governors Association, pointed us to three news articles to back up the statement.\n\nWhile the articles quoted parents expressing anger at Perry for requiring something they considered none of his business, none of the clips mention parental consent.\n\nThe mandate, which was scheduled to go into effect for the 2008-09 school year, included an opt-out \"in order to protect the right of parents to be the final authority on their children's health care.\" It ordered the Department of State Health Services to allow parents dissenting for philosophical or religious reasons to request a conscientious objection affidavit form. That form enables parents to enroll their children in public school even if they lack state-required immunizations. It's automatically granted as long as parents provide all required information.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman at the Health and Human Services Commission, told us that \"the child would only get the vaccination if the parent took the child to get it.\"\n\nCarrie Williams, a spokeswoman at the Department of State Health Services, said: \"Vaccines cannot be given to children without consent of a parent or a legal guardian.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTexas law lists two primary people who can consent the immunization of a child \u2014 the guardian and a person authorized under the law of another state or a court \u2014 and secondary people if the former are unavailable, including a grandparent, stepparent, or aunt.\n\nJanet Realini, a physician and president of Healthy Futures of Texas, a San Antonio-based nonprofit striving to reduce teen and unplanned pregnancies, told us that the mandate would have been no different than state requirements for numerous immunizations that Texas requires children need to attend public school, such as the polio vaccine, measles and hepatitis B.\u00a0\n\nWhen we checked back with the DGA, spokeswoman Emily Bittner told us that she wasn't familiar with the ad. We asked to speak with someone who was, but no one had gotten back to us as we were wrapping up our research.\n\nWhere does that leave us?\n\nPerry's executive order would have required Texas girls to receive a vaccine against HPV before entering sixth grade. The order included an opt-out for parents who objected to the vaccine.\n\nBut there's no evidence \u2014 not a scintilla of proof \u2014 that shots would have been given without parental consent, and saying so preys on the fears of parents who objected to Perry requiring the vaccine.\n\nParents and guardians are gatekeepers for children getting the vaccinations required for students to go to Texas schools. Perry's failed mandate would not have changed that, and the ad sounds like Perry endorsed forcing families against their will to vaccinate their children with a scary drug.\n\nWe rate Lone Star First's statement Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14321"}
