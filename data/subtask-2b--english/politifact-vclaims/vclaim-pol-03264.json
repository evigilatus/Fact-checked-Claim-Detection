Trip has been very successful. We made and saved the USA many billions of dollars and millions of jobs,\" Trump tweeted.\nJust arrived in Italy for the G7. Trip has been very successful. We made and saved the USA many billions of dollars and millions of jobs.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2017\n\nMillions of jobs? That would be a massive shot in the arm for the economy. For a sense of scale, Wal-Mart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, has 2.3 million employees; the second-largest, Yum Brands, which includes Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, has about 500,000.\nThe problem is, the White House has been cagey about exactly where this projection comes from.\nFor starters, Trump\u2019s use of the word \"millions\" represents a thousand-fold expansion from what Trump had said just days earlier, when he told the audience in a speech in Saudi Arabia: \"Yesterday, we signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia.\"\nMeanwhile, over two days of inquiries to the White House, officials were unable to provide us with full details of the $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, which itself is just a portion of the $400 billion investment package Trump cited in his speech.\nWhen the Washington Post Fact Checker asked the White House for details about Trump\u2019s tweet, a White House official responded that Trump was referring to \"benefits to trade from the entire trip from Saudi Arabia to the G7\" -- that is, including Trump\u2019s meetings with the heads of other advanced industrialized nations in Europe toward the end of the trip. (It\u2019s not clear what trade deals were discussed in the European portion of the trip.)\nIn any case, assuming \"millions\" of jobs from unspecified investments is not justified, economists say.\n\"There\u2019s not enough information to substantiate his claims on millions of jobs,\" said Chris Lafakis, senior economist at Moody\u2019s.\nIn the meantime, here\u2019s what we know and don\u2019t know.\nThe arms deal\nThe Defense Security Cooperation Agency issued a news release on May 20 saying that the United States and Saudi Arabia agreed to a $110 billion package on five main areas: border security and counterterrorism, maritime and coastal security, air force modernization, air and missile defense, and cybersecurity and communications upgrades.\nThe release detailed six specific areas, with links to documents that offered a dollar amount. They were:\n\u2022 Munitions and support: $6.8 billion;\n\u2022 Multi-Mission Surface Combatant ships: $11.25 billion;\n\u2022 Ammunition for the Royal Saudi Land Forces: $500 million;\n\u2022 Saudi Abrams Main Battle Tanks and HERCULES Armored Recovery Vehicles: $1.15 billion;\n\u2022 Chinook cargo helicopters: $3.51 billion;\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Persistent Threat Detection System Aerostats: $525 million.\nThat totals $23.74 billion, leaving $86 billion from the package unspecified.\nUsing other available data, John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, told PolitiFact that he can estimate perhaps $50 billion in arms sales, \"most of which was initiated under Obama,\" he said.\nBloomberg calculations\nReporters at Bloomberg have written several articles about the deals signed in the Saudi portion of the trip, focusing on agreements outside the $110 billion arms deal.\nThey include:\n\u2022 Agreements signed by Saudi oil company Aramco: $50 billion;\n\u2022 Commitments by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund to an infrastructure investment fund with the Blackstone Group. (Blackstone, Bloomberg reported separately, has close ties to the family of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.) $20 billion;\n\u2022 General Electric memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia: $15 billion;\n\u2022 Honeywell International memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco: $3.6 billion;\n\u2022 McDermott International memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco: $2.8 billion;\n\u2022 Jacobs Engineering Group memorandum of understanding: $250 million;\n\u2022 Rowan Companies memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for offshore drilling rigs: $7 billion;\n\u2022 Rowan memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for its supply chain: $1.2 billion;\n\u2022 Nabors Industries memorandum of understanding on well and rig services on an existing joint venture worth $9 billion;\n\u2022 Nabors memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for its supply chain: $1.6 billion;\n\u2022 Weatherford International memorandum of understanding: potential value of $2 billion.\nThat works out to about $112 billion, coming on top of the $110 billion in arms sales. Bloomberg cited a few more items without specific dollar amounts, including a jet purchase from Boeing by SaudiGulf Airlines, and a joint venture between National Oilwell Varco and Saudi Aramco for the manufacture of drilling rigs and equipment.\nThat leaves more than half of Trump\u2019s $400 billion figure -- just for the Saudi leg of the trip -- undisclosed, to say nothing of what deals may have been struck in the European portion of the trip.\nAnd for now, the Washington Post reported that several key CEOs of companies that signed deals have been a lot more restrained than Trump about promising specific numbers of jobs.\n\"There is absolutely zero chance that the trip created millions of jobs,\" said Dean Baker, a liberal economist. Even if jobs were created -- possibly in the thousands, not the millions --\u00a0\"this may or may not lead to any net job creation, since the Fed could easily offset it with higher interest rates.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said that deals struck on his first foreign trip as president created and saved \"millions of jobs.\"\nWe can\u2019t know for sure how many jobs will be created or saved -- nor, despite the certainty of his language, does Trump -- but the evidence at this point is so thin and so premature as to be little more than puffery or wishful thinking.
