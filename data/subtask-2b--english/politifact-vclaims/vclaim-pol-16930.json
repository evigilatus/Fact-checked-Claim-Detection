A recent warning on social media advises users to be careful.\u00a0\n\n\"\u2018Private\u2019 messages sent to individual people during a Zoom meeting show up in the end-of-meeting transcript along with all other public messages,\" reads the screenshot of a tweet. \"Tell your friends, save a life.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nWe emailed Zoom about the Facebook post and heard back from a public relations firm working for the company. An associate told PolitiFact that if a person with recording privileges \u2014\u00a0i.e., the person hosting the meeting \u2014 decides to record a Zoom meeting to the cloud, then public messages\u00a0are saved. Public messages are those sent to everyone in the meeting.\nBut if a person with recording privileges records a meeting locally, on their computer, the chats that are saved include those that were sent publicly \"as well as any private chat exchanges that the person recording participated in during the session.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short: If you send a private message to the person recording the meeting, it could end up on a transcript. If you send a private message to another person in the meeting \u2014\u00a0someone who isn\u2019t able to record the meeting \u2014 those messages won\u2019t end up in the transcript.\u00a0\nSome PolitiFact staffers recently tested this and found it to be true. \u00a0\nOne editor, who had downloaded the Zoom app on his Apple computer, recorded a meeting with other employees. After downloading the transcript of the meeting to his computer, he could only see private messages that were sent to him \u2014 not private messages between the participants.\u00a0\nIf the person who recorded the meeting decided to share the transcript, people could then see any private messages you or others sent that person.\n\"Remember that hosts can record audio and video from meetings in full, as well as keep a record of public chats,\" says one Wired story. \"If you (the meeting host) save the chat log for yourself, it will also include private chats you\u2019ve been involved in, so be very careful about sharing that file with anyone else. Don\u2019t just post it in the group chat for everyone to read. If a host chooses to enable this setting, Zoom will notify you and give you a chance to opt out.\"\nThere is no evidence that messages between people who don\u2019t have recording privileges will show up in a transcript, however.\nWe rate this post Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16930"}
