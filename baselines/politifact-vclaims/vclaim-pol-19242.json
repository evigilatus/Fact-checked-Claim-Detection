The text above the photo, which misspells Buffett\u2019s name, says:\n\"The Keystone pipeline. Cancelled by Biden on first day. Warren Buffet owns the railroad that is now transporting all that oil. Warren Buffet donated 58 million to Biden campaign. Warren Buffet would lose billions in transport fees if the pipeline is completed. See how politics works? It is not an environmental issue, it is a money issue.\"\nThe image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe thrust of the claim \u2014 that Buffett donated $58 million to Biden\u2019s campaign and benefits from Biden\u2019s decision \u2014 is wrong. Buffett didn\u2019t make any contributions to Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign.\nBiden and the pipeline project\nThe Keystone XL pipeline, first proposed more than a decade ago during a period of high oil prices, was to have carried up to 830,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries.\u00a0\nThe Trump administration backed the project in the face of objections from environmental groups. The company building it announced in March 2020 that it was launching construction, saying it would invest $8 billion in the project, with service expected to begin in 2023.\u00a0\nBut continuing court challenges over environmental reviews soon brought the project to a halt.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly a 1.2-mile section had been completed before Biden on Jan. 20 signed an executive order revoking the pipeline\u2019s construction permit, saying the pipeline would \"not be consistent with my administration\u2019s economic and climate imperatives.\"\u00a0\nBuffett\u2019s campaign donations\nRecords from the Federal Election Commission and the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics show that Buffett, a donor to Barack Obama\u2019s and Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaigns, did not contribute to Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign.\nIt\u2019s not clear where the $58 million figure in the claim originated.\u00a0\nAll contributions to Biden\u2019s campaign by employees of Buffett\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway, and its subsidiaries totaled $313,510, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nA Buffett spokeswoman has said that Buffett voted for Biden and that he does not have a position on how the pipeline might have affected BNSF Railway, a freight railroad network owned by Berkshire Hathaway that transports crude oil.\u00a0\nIn the past few years, Buffett expressed support for the pipeline.\nOur ruling\nAn image shared on Facebook claims Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline because Buffett \"donated $58 million\" to his campaign.\nRecords show Buffett contributed no money to Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. Biden cited economic and environmental reasons for signing an executive order that effectively halts construction of the pipeline.\nWe rate the post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19242"}
