0002	Melania Trump	Let us pray.
0003	Melania Trump	Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed is your name.
0004	Melania Trump	Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
0005	Melania Trump	Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us.
0006	Melania Trump	Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
0007	Melania Trump	For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever.
0008	Melania Trump	Amen.
0009	Melania Trump	Good afternoon.
0010	Melania Trump	It is my honor and great pleasure to stand here before you as the First Lady of the United States.
0011	Melania Trump	The mid the America we envision is one that works for all Americans, and where all Americans can work and succeed.
0012	Melania Trump	A nation committed to a greater civility and unity between people from all sides of the political divide.
0013	Melania Trump	I will always stay true to myself and be truthful to you, no matter what the opposition is saying about me.
0014	Melania Trump	I will act in the best interest of all of you.
0015	Melania Trump	I am committed to creating and supporting initiatives geared to my heart, which will have impacts on women and children all around the world.
0016	Melania Trump	My husband is creating a country of great safety and prosperity.
0017	Melania Trump	Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to introduce the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
0018	Donald Trump	Thank you, everybody, thank you.
0019	Donald Trump	I didn't know that Melania was going to be saying the Lord's Prayer, but I thought that was very beautiful, thank you, thank you.
0020	Donald Trump	It's so great to be here in Florida.
0021	Donald Trump	My second home with you.
0022	Donald Trump	This is a state I truly love.
0023	Donald Trump	This is a state where we all had great victory together.
0024	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0025	Donald Trump	It's now been a month since my inauguration.
0026	Donald Trump	And I am here to tell you about our incredible progress in making America great again.
0027	Donald Trump	I'm also here to tell you about our plans for the future and they're big and they're bold and It's what our country is all about, believe me.
0028	Donald Trump	I'm here because I want to be among my friends and among the people.
0029	Donald Trump	This was a great movement, a movement like has never been seen before in our country our probably anywhere else.
0030	Donald Trump	This was a truly great movement And I want to be here with you, and I will always be with you.
0031	Donald Trump	I promise you that.
0032	Donald Trump	I want to be in a room filled with hard working American patriots who love their country, who salute their flag and who pray for a better future.
0033	Donald Trump	I also want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news.
0034	Donald Trump	The dishonest media which has published one false story after another with no sources, even though they pretend they have them, they make them up in many cases, they just don't want to report the truth and they've been calling us wrong now for two years.
0035	Donald Trump	They don't get it.
0036	Donald Trump	By they're starting to get it.
0037	Donald Trump	I can tell you that.
0038	Donald Trump	They've become a big part of the problem.
0039	Donald Trump	They are part of the corrupt system.
0040	Donald Trump	Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln and many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out often times on their lies.
0041	Donald Trump	When the media lies to people, I will never, ever let them get away with it.
0042	Donald Trump	I will do whatever I can that.
0043	Donald Trump	They don't get away with it.
0044	Donald Trump	They have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda.
0045	Donald Trump	In fact, Thomas Jefferson said, nothing can be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself, he said, becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle, that was June 14, my birthday, 1807.
0046	Donald Trump	But despite all their lies, misrepresentations, and false stories, they could not defeat us in the primaries, and they could not defeat us in the general election, and we will continue to expose them for what they are, and most importantly, we will continue to win, win, win.
0047	Donald Trump	We are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe.
0048	Donald Trump	We are free and independent people and we will make our own choices.
0049	Donald Trump	We are here today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
0050	Donald Trump	I hear your demands, I hear your voices and I promise you I will deliver.
0051	Donald Trump	I promise that.
0052	Donald Trump	And by the way, you've seen what we've accomplished in a very short period of time.
0053	Donald Trump	The White House is running so smoothly.
0054	Donald Trump	So smoothly.
0055	Donald Trump	And believe me, I and we inherited one big mess.
0056	Donald Trump	That I can tell you, but I know that you want safe neighborhoods where the streets belong to families and communities, not gang members and drug dealers who are right now as I speak being thrown out of the country and they will not be let back in.
0057	Donald Trump	We will have strong borders again, and I mean that.
0058	Donald Trump	You've seen it in television.
0059	Donald Trump	You've seen it on television.
0060	Donald Trump	General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, he's really doing the job.
0061	Donald Trump	You're seeing it.
0062	Donald Trump	The gang members, bad, bad people.
0063	Donald Trump	I said day one, and they're going out.
0064	Donald Trump	Or they're being put in prison, but for the most part, get them the hell out of here.
0065	Donald Trump	Bring them back to where they came from.
0066	Donald Trump	The fact is, you want great schools for your children.
0067	Donald Trump	You want good high paying jobs for yourselves and for your loved ones and for the future of your families.
0068	Donald Trump	You want a health care system and by the way, we are going to be submitting in a couple of weeks a great healthcare plan that's going to take the place of the disaster known as Obamacare.
0069	Donald Trump	It will be repealed and replaced.
0070	Donald Trump	For those people.
0071	Donald Trump	The people put into rooms where Republicans are talking about the plan, and it wouldn't matter what they say, for those people just so you understand, our plan will be much better health care at a much lower coast.
0072	Donald Trump	Okay?
0073	Donald Trump	Nothing to complain about.
0074	Donald Trump	Obamacare remember, it is a disaster.
0075	Donald Trump	You want low cost American energy also, which means lifting the restrictions on oil, on shell, on natural gas and on clean, very clean coal.
0076	Donald Trump	We're going to put the miners back to work.
0077	Donald Trump	The miners go back to work.
0078	Donald Trump	You want us to enforce immigration laws and defend our borders.
0079	Donald Trump	You want fair trade deals and a level playing field.
0080	Donald Trump	We don't have a level playing field.
0081	Donald Trump	Because you understand that when American workers win, America as a country wins and wins big. And every country over the last long period of time has been taking advantage of the
0082	SYSTEM	[inaudible]
0083	Donald Trump	of our politicians.
0084	Donald Trump	It's not going to happen any longer.
0085	Donald Trump	You want lower taxes.
0086	Donald Trump	Less regulation.
0087	Donald Trump	Millions of new jobs and more product stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, Made in the USA. You want to make it easy for companies to do business in America.
0088	Donald Trump	And harder for companies to leave.
0089	Donald Trump	We don't want companies saying, everybody is fired.
0090	Donald Trump	We're moving to another country.
0091	Donald Trump	We're going to make the product.
0092	Donald Trump	Sell it across the border and isn't that wonderful.
0093	Donald Trump	Not going happen anymore.
0094	Donald Trump	We're going to have strong borders and when they want to sell that product back across our border, they're going to pay a 35% tax and you know what, they're never going to leave.
0095	Donald Trump	They will never, ever leave.
0096	Donald Trump	And you've seen that because I've already displayed it for the last two months even before I got into office.
0097	Donald Trump	They're not leaving.
0098	Donald Trump	And if they do, they're going to pay a big price for terminating the relationship with our workers.
0099	Donald Trump	You want a government that serves the people not the donors and special interest.
0100	Donald Trump	You want a government that keeps its promises.
0101	Donald Trump	A great spirit of optimism is sweeping and you see it.
0102	Donald Trump	it's sweeping all across the country.
0103	Donald Trump	Look at what's happening to the stock market.
0104	Donald Trump	Look at what's happening to the every poll when it comes to optimism in our country.
0105	Donald Trump	It's sweeping across the country.
0106	Donald Trump	And, in fact, every day for the last long period of days this stock market means, companies, have been hitting new highs.
0107	Donald Trump	They're going to start highs.
0108	Donald Trump	It's going to be a new day in America.
0109	Donald Trump	You're going to be proud again.
0110	Donald Trump	Jobs are already starting to pour back in.
0111	Donald Trump	They're coming back in like you haven't seen in a long time.
0112	Donald Trump	Ford, General Motors, Fiat, Chrysler are bringing in and bringing back thousands of jobs investing billions of dollars because of the new business climate that we are creating in our country.
0113	Donald Trump	In Arizona, Intel, great company, just announced it will open a new plant that will create at least 10,000 brand new beautiful American jobs.
0114	Donald Trump	I followed through on my promise to withdraw from the job killing disaster known as the TransPacific Partnership.
0115	Donald Trump	TPP, we have just terminated our relationship to it.
0116	Donald Trump	We're going to have tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be bilateral or as we would say, oneonone.
0117	Donald Trump	None of these deals where we get caught in quicksand.
0118	Donald Trump	Get mired in and we can't do anything about it.
0119	Donald Trump	By the way, NAFTA and so many others.
0120	Donald Trump	My administration has begun plans to crack down on foreign cheating and currency manipulation which is killing our companies and really, really hurting our workers.
0121	Donald Trump	We're going to end it.
0122	Donald Trump	Within a few days of taking the oath of office, I've taken steps to begin the construction of the Keystone and the Dakota Access Pipelines.
0123	Donald Trump	Anywhere from 3040,000 jobs.
0124	Donald Trump	And very importantly, as I was about to sign it, I said who makes the pipe?
0125	Donald Trump	Who makes the pipe?
0126	Donald Trump	Something this audience understands very well, right?
0127	Donald Trump	Simple question.
0128	Donald Trump	The lawyers put this very complex document in front.
0129	Donald Trump	I said, who makes the pipe?
0130	Donald Trump	They said, sir, it can be made anywhere.
0131	Donald Trump	I said not anymore.
0132	Donald Trump	I put a little clause in the bottom.
0133	Donald Trump	The pipe has to be made in the United States of America if we're going to have pine line.
0134	Donald Trump	We believe in two simple rules.
0135	Donald Trump	I can tell you everybody in this massive, this is a massive hanger.
0136	Donald Trump	For the big planes.
0137	Donald Trump	And by the way, do you think that one media group back there, one network will show this crowd.
0138	Donald Trump	Not one.
0139	Donald Trump	Not one.
0140	Donald Trump	They won't show the crowd.
0141	Donald Trump	You know, coming in on the plane, and that plane represented so much.
0142	Donald Trump	And just so you know, they were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One.
0143	Donald Trump	Can you believe this?
0144	Donald Trump	I said no way.
0145	Donald Trump	I said I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion airplane.
0146	Donald Trump	I refuse.
0147	Donald Trump	So I got Boeing and it is actually  a lot of people don't know.
0148	Donald Trump	The Air Force One project is actually two planes.
0149	Donald Trump	Why they need to planes, we'll have to talk about that, but they have two planes, but we've got that price down over a billion dollars and I probably have it spoken to be honest with you for honest probably an more than an hour on the project.
0150	Donald Trump	I got the generals in who are fantastic.
0151	Donald Trump	I got Boeing in.
0152	Donald Trump	I told Boeing it's not good enough.
0153	Donald Trump	We're still not going to do it.
0154	Donald Trump	The price is still too high.
0155	Donald Trump	On the fighter jet.
0156	Donald Trump	We were hundreds of billions of dollars over budget.
0157	Donald Trump	Seven years late, great plane.
0158	Donald Trump	A great plane.
0159	Donald Trump	So think of it.
0160	Donald Trump	They're seven years late.
0161	Donald Trump	Hundreds of billions of dollars overbudget.
0162	Donald Trump	Other than that by the way the project is going extremely well.
0163	Donald Trump	And I got the folks in from Lockheed Martin who are terrific people and a terrific product by the way.
0164	Donald Trump	I also got Boeing in.
0165	Donald Trump	I said do me a favor, give me a competing offer.
0166	Donald Trump	And now they're competing and fighting and we've gotten hundreds of millions of dollars off the price of a plane that was going to be ordered, in other words, if my opponent got in, there would have been no calls made to them.
0167	Donald Trump	They would have signed contracts.
0168	Donald Trump	So they're going to make plenty of money, but it's going to be a lot less than they would have made without Trump.
0169	Donald Trump	That I can tell you.
0170	Donald Trump	You might as well know about it.
0171	Donald Trump	Nobody talks.
0172	Donald Trump	By the way, that's for fighter jets.
0173	Donald Trump	One of the biggest orders in the history of aviation.
0174	Donald Trump	The order for the F35.
0175	Donald Trump	You've been reading about it because it was a disaster.
0176	Donald Trump	Under the last administration.
0177	Donald Trump	A disaster.
0178	Donald Trump	And now we have it running beautifully.
0179	Donald Trump	In fact, when the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Abe, was great.
0180	Donald Trump	Great guy.
0181	Donald Trump	When he came over, he said, thank you.
0182	Donald Trump	I said for what.
0183	Donald Trump	You saved us many, many millions of dollars on the F35 fighter jet.
0184	Donald Trump	Because when I negotiated, I took our allies into the same negotiation.
0185	Donald Trump	So the first thing he did was thanked med for saving them money and that's good.
0186	Donald Trump	Okay.
0187	Donald Trump	That's good.
0188	Donald Trump	I know the media will never thank me so at least Japan is thanking me, right?
0189	Donald Trump	But we believe in two simple rules.
0190	Donald Trump	Buy American and hire American.
0191	Donald Trump	We believe it.
0192	Donald Trump	We've just issued a new order which requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.
0193	Donald Trump	And by the way, a new director was just approved.
0194	Donald Trump	Can you imagine the length of time it's taken to Democrats and I actually think it's an embarrassment to them, but this is getting in to be record setting time.
0195	Donald Trump	Incredible people.
0196	Donald Trump	Scott Pruitt was just approved, just now approved for the Environmental Protection Agency.
0197	Donald Trump	He'll do so good.
0198	Donald Trump	He won't have projects going ten and 12 years and getting rejected.
0199	Donald Trump	They may be rejected, but they'll be rejected quickly.
0200	Donald Trump	For the most part, they're going to be accepted.
0201	Donald Trump	They're going to be environmentally friendly and he is going to be a great Secretary.
0202	Donald Trump	He will be amazing.
0203	Donald Trump	We're very happy.
0204	Donald Trump	That took place yesterday.
0205	Donald Trump	That's going to be a big difference because they were clogging up the veins of our country with the environmental impact statements and all of the rules and regulations.
0206	Donald Trump	It was impossible to navigate for companies.
0207	Donald Trump	And what did it really mean?
0208	Donald Trump	Forget about the companies?
0209	Donald Trump	What did it mean.
0210	Donald Trump	It meant no jobs.
0211	Donald Trump	It meant companies leaving our country and going to foreign countries to do things they would rather do here.
0212	Donald Trump	So we're going to have a whole big situation.
0213	Donald Trump	We are going to unfreeze all of those companies.
0214	Donald Trump	They are going to be  they're going have freedom.
0215	Donald Trump	Be able to build what they want to build.
0216	Donald Trump	It will be environmentally friendly and we're going to start producing jobs like you've never seen before.
0217	Donald Trump	That's going to happen.
0218	Donald Trump	That was a big thing.
0219	Donald Trump	We're standing up for the incredible men and women always of law enforcement.
0220	Donald Trump	We're standing up.
0221	Donald Trump	And I can tell you, the military and law enforcement they stood up.
0222	Donald Trump	I don't say for me.
0223	Donald Trump	I'm the messenger folks.
0224	Donald Trump	I'm the messenger.
0225	Donald Trump	They stood up for us in this last election.
0226	Donald Trump	We got numbers that nobody believed were possible from law enforcement and from military.
0227	Donald Trump	Basically people they wear uniforms like us.
0228	Donald Trump	Isn't that nice.
0229	Donald Trump	I saw this man on TV just now, you.
0230	Donald Trump	I just saw him on television.
0231	Donald Trump	He said I love Trump.
0232	Donald Trump	Let Trump do what he has to do.
0233	Donald Trump	That's my guy right there.
0234	Donald Trump	Come here.
0235	Donald Trump	Come here.
0236	Donald Trump	No, I just.
0237	Donald Trump	I'm coming in.
0238	Donald Trump	That's okay.
0239	Donald Trump	Let him up.
0240	Donald Trump	I'm not worried about him.
0241	Donald Trump	I'm only worried he's going to give me a kiss.
0242	Donald Trump	I'm not worried about anything else.
0243	Donald Trump	This guy is so great.
0244	Donald Trump	He was one of many people.
0245	Donald Trump	They're interviewing people in the line.
0246	Donald Trump	And I have to say, there was a tiny group of protesters out there and they were given as much publicity as this massive room packed with people, but they interviewed this man.
0247	Donald Trump	Come on up here.
0248	Donald Trump	Come on up.
0249	Donald Trump	Guy was great.
0250	Donald Trump	Hop over the fence.
0251	Donald Trump	Come on.
0252	Donald Trump	He can do it.
0253	Donald Trump	He's in good shape.
0254	Donald Trump	Look at him.
0255	Donald Trump	Look at this guy.
0256	Donald Trump	Come on.
0257	Donald Trump	This guy is great.
0258	Donald Trump	Don't worry about him.
0259	Donald Trump	No, no.
0260	Donald Trump	Come here.
0261	Donald Trump	They're going to  come on up.
0262	Donald Trump	Come here.
0263	Donald Trump	This guy.
0264	Donald Trump	So he's been all over television saying the best things and I see him standing and didn't you get here at like 4 in the morning.
0265	Unidentified Male	I did sir.
0266	Donald Trump	Say a couple of words to this crowd.
0267	Unidentified Male	Mr. President, thank you sir.
0268	Unidentified Male	We the people, our movement is the reason why our President of the United States is standing here in front of us today.
0269	Unidentified Male	When President Trump during the election promised all these things that he was going to do for us, I knew he was going to do this for us.
0270	Unidentified Male	Thank you so much, sir.
0271	Donald Trump	A star is born.
0272	Unidentified Male	A star is born.
0273	Unidentified Male	That's fine.
0274	Donald Trump	I wouldn't say that Secret Service was thrilled with that, but we know our people, right?
0275	Donald Trump	We know our people.
0276	Donald Trump	Great guy.
0277	Donald Trump	And so many others.
0278	Donald Trump	I see some others.
0279	Donald Trump	Being interviewed.
0280	Donald Trump	I see them over here.
0281	Donald Trump	They started.
0282	Donald Trump	They came at 4 in the morning.
0283	Donald Trump	The media will give them no credit.
0284	Donald Trump	The media, as I told you, won't show this crowd.
0285	Donald Trump	All the way outside of this  this is a big a hanger as you get.
0286	Donald Trump	All the way outside.
0287	Donald Trump	Way back to the fences.
0288	Donald Trump	Amazing.
0289	Donald Trump	I want to thank you, but I want to thank everybody.
0290	Donald Trump	I've directed the Department of Justice to take a firm, firm stance to protect our cops, sheriffs, and police from crimes of violence against them.
0291	Donald Trump	We will work with our police not against our police, our police do a great job and they've never been troubled like they're troubled now.
0292	Donald Trump	It's very unfair what's happening.
0293	Donald Trump	So we want to cherish our law enforcement.
0294	Donald Trump	We will always protect those who protect us.
0295	Donald Trump	We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including our inner cities.
0296	Donald Trump	We're going to make our inner cities safe again.
0297	Donald Trump	Look at what's going on.
0298	Donald Trump	Look at what's happening in Chicago.
0299	Donald Trump	Hundreds of shootings, hundreds of deaths.
0300	Donald Trump	I'll tell you what's happening in Chicago and many other places.
0301	Donald Trump	Safety is a civil right.
0302	Donald Trump	And we will fight to make America totally safe again.
0303	Donald Trump	I've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy transnational criminal cartels which are all over the United States and we are going to stop the drugs from pours into your country, into your community, into your cities and poisoning our youth.
0304	Donald Trump	We're stopping it.
0305	Donald Trump	We're stopping it.
0306	Donald Trump	We've taken historic action to secure the southern border and I've ordered the construction of a great border wall, which will start very shortly.
0307	Donald Trump	And I've taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country.
0308	Donald Trump	So you probably read where we want to enforce the laws as existing.
0309	Donald Trump	And so we signed an order a couple of weeks ago, and it was taken over by a court originally by a judge and then a  yes, it's very sad.
0310	Donald Trump	The reason is for protection and safety.
0311	Donald Trump	So the statute is so plain and so clear.
0312	Donald Trump	I said last week, I was speaking to a great group of sheriffs, the sheriffs group in Washington, and I said if you have a college education, you can understand its.
0313	Donald Trump	If you have a high school education, you can understand it.
0314	Donald Trump	If you were a bad student in high school, you can understand it.
0315	Donald Trump	I was told.
0316	Donald Trump	I'll check, but I found it hard to believe, over 30page decision by the appellate court.
0317	Donald Trump	Three judges.
0318	Donald Trump	And you could tell by the way they were reacting because it was broadcast on television.
0319	Donald Trump	Everything we do gets a lot of people watching.
0320	Donald Trump	So you could tell by the way that phone call went, wasn't looking good.
0321	Donald Trump	When they wrote their decision, as I understand it.
0322	Donald Trump	Maybe I'm wrong.
0323	Donald Trump	They didn't write the statute they were making the decision about because every word of the statute is a total kill for the other side.
0324	Donald Trump	So I thought I would read it.
0325	Donald Trump	And here's what it says.
0326	Donald Trump	This is what it says Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States  okay.
0327	Donald Trump	So essentially.
0328	Donald Trump	Whenever somebody comes into the United States.
0329	Donald Trump	Right.
0330	Donald Trump	If it would be detrimental to the interest of the United States  okay.
0331	Donald Trump	Now you know the country's we're talking about and these were countries picked by Obama.
0332	Donald Trump	They weren't even picked.
0333	Donald Trump	They were picked by Obama.
0334	Donald Trump	He may, so the President may, by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary  now, because it should have said he or she, right.
0335	Donald Trump	They were not politically correct when they drew this.
0336	Donald Trump	In fact, that's the only thing that was actually wrong with it.
0337	Donald Trump	He or she.
0338	Donald Trump	I don't think the women care too much about that.
0339	Donald Trump	Right?
0340	Donald Trump	I don't think so.
0341	Donald Trump	By the way, we did very well with women.
0342	Donald Trump	You know, my wife said when some of these phony polls were put out, the CNN poll was so far off, the phony polls.
0343	Donald Trump	When some of these, she said, what's wrong with you and women.
0344	Donald Trump	We did very nicely with women.
0345	Donald Trump	We did nicely with a lot of groups they didn't think we were going to do so nicely with.
0346	Donald Trump	I guess we had to.
0347	Donald Trump	That's why we're all here tonight.
0348	Donald Trump	Right?
0349	Donald Trump	So and it goes, for such as he shall seem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on aliens any restriction he may deem to be appropriate. So basically it says the president has the right to keep people out if he feels it's not in the best interest of our country.
0350	Donald Trump	Right?
0351	Donald Trump	Unbelievable.
0352	Donald Trump	Unbelievable.
0353	Donald Trump	And I listened to these judges talk and talk and talk.
0354	Donald Trump	So unfair.
0355	Donald Trump	So we'll be doing something over the next couple of days.
0356	Donald Trump	We don't give up.
0357	Donald Trump	We never give up.
0358	Donald Trump	We had a court that I disagree with.
0359	Donald Trump	I disagree with big league  and by the way, whether you read it or whether you watch it on television when other lawyers come on, many of them can't even understand.
0360	Donald Trump	They're saying how do you come up with that decision.
0361	Donald Trump	It cannot be more simple.
0362	Donald Trump	So they're ruling on what I just read you and they don't even quote it in their ruling because you can't because it's too obvious.
0363	Donald Trump	So we will do something next week.
0364	Donald Trump	I think you'll be impressed.
0365	Donald Trump	Let's see what happens.
0366	Donald Trump	Here's the bottom line.
0367	Donald Trump	We've got to keep our country safe.
0368	Donald Trump	You look at what's happening.
0369	Donald Trump	We've got to keep our country safe.
0370	Donald Trump	You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden.
0371	Donald Trump	Sweden, who would believe this.
0372	Donald Trump	Sweden.
0373	Donald Trump	They took in large numbers.
0374	Donald Trump	They're having problems like they never thought possible.
0375	Donald Trump	You look at what's happening in Brussels.
0376	Donald Trump	You look at what's happening all over the world.
0377	Donald Trump	Take a look at Nice.
0378	Donald Trump	Take a look at Paris.
0379	Donald Trump	We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people.
0380	Donald Trump	There was no documentation.
0381	Donald Trump	There was no nothing.
0382	Donald Trump	So we're going to keep our country safe.
0383	Donald Trump	And we all have heart, by the way.
0384	Donald Trump	And what I want to do is build safe zones in Syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country, that mess that I was left by Obama and everybody else  folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn't believe, but we're going to build safe zones.
0385	Donald Trump	We're going to have those safe zones.
0386	Donald Trump	We do owe $20 trillion.
0387	Donald Trump	Okay.
0388	Donald Trump	So we're going to have the gulf states pay for those safe zones.
0389	Donald Trump	They've got nothing, but money.
0390	Donald Trump	We're going to do it that way instead of taking massive numbers.
0391	Donald Trump	Tens the of thousands of people into our country and we don't know anything about those people.
0392	Donald Trump	We want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us.
0393	Donald Trump	We want people that can cherish us and the traditions of our country.
0394	Donald Trump	We want people that are going to be great for our country.
0395	Donald Trump	We don't want people with bad, bad ideas.
0396	Donald Trump	We don't want that.
0397	Donald Trump	I've also directed the defense community headed by General, now  you know, he said it, he said it  and now Secretary Mad Dog Mattis, to develop a plan to totally destroy ISIS.
0398	Donald Trump	I have ordered the department of defense to begin plans for the great rebuilding of the united states military.
0399	Donald Trump	We will pursue peace through strength.
0400	Donald Trump	Our military is badly depleted.
0401	Donald Trump	You have planes in the military.
0402	Donald Trump	Where the father flew them and now the son is flying them.
0403	Donald Trump	Their so old.
0404	Donald Trump	We make the best equipment anywhere in the world.
0405	Donald Trump	We're going to start using our best and most modern equipment.
0406	Donald Trump	And we're going to make sure our veterans have the care they need when they come home.
0407	Donald Trump	We love our veterans.
0408	Donald Trump	We're going to do a great job for our veterans.
0409	Donald Trump	Our veterans have been very, very sadly treated.
0410	Donald Trump	These are our great great people.
0411	Donald Trump	We owe them so much.
0412	Donald Trump	Our veterans are going to be taken care of for once and for all.
0413	Donald Trump	Our system and our country has led down our veterans.
0414	Donald Trump	We are not going to let that go on any further.
0415	Donald Trump	You wait and you see what we're going to be doing for our great veterans.
0416	Donald Trump	Thank you veterans.
0417	Donald Trump	Who is here?
0418	Donald Trump	Who is a veteran?
0419	Donald Trump	We're going to take care of our veterans.
0420	Donald Trump	We're going to downsize the bloated, bloated bureaucracy which make the government lien and accountable.
0421	Donald Trump	We're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.
0422	Donald Trump	I've already imposed a five year lobbying ban on the executive branch officials and lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.
0423	Donald Trump	And there's another major promise I have kept to the American people.
0424	Donald Trump	I've nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late great Justice Scalia.
0425	Donald Trump	His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch.
0426	Donald Trump	He comes from my list of 20 very, very highly qualified judges.
0427	Donald Trump	He's incredible and has an incredible resume.
0428	Donald Trump	He's respected by all.
0429	Donald Trump	His education is as good as it can get.
0430	Donald Trump	His writings are truly amazing.
0431	Donald Trump	He will be a true, true defender of our constitution.
0432	Donald Trump	So let's tell the Senate Democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country because what's happening with the Democrats  no wonder they're doing so badly.
0433	Donald Trump	No wonder they're doing so badly.
0434	Donald Trump	You take a look, race after race, I just want the tell you, in case you didn't read it, of course you're reading the fake news, but the Democrats were supposed to win the presidency.
0435	Donald Trump	That didn't happen.
0436	Donald Trump	They were supposed to take over the Senate.
0437	Donald Trump	That didn't happen.
0438	Donald Trump	And they were supposed to take over potentially even the House.
0439	Donald Trump	It was going to be four weeks out the greatest defeat in the modern history of American politics.
0440	Donald Trump	And it was, but it was for the Democrats, not for the Republicans.
0441	Donald Trump	So we have to tell the Democrats, because they're doing the wrong thing for the American people, to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction.
0442	Donald Trump	They got to get on with it.
0443	Donald Trump	My administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform.
0444	Donald Trump	We are working to lower tax rates in the middle class to reduce tax rates big league on businesses and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all Americans so it's understandable by everyone.
0445	Donald Trump	Senate Democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs, but the Democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially.
0446	Donald Trump	We're not going let that happen.
0447	Donald Trump	Also time for the Senate Democrats to take responsibility for Obamacare and to work with us to replace it with new reforms that reverse this nationwide healthcare tragedy.
0448	Donald Trump	It's a tragedy.
0449	Donald Trump	You look at some states, Arizona, up 116%.
0450	Donald Trump	Your deductibles have gone so high you can never use it.
0451	Donald Trump	Obamacare doesn't work.
0452	Donald Trump	It's become totally unaffordable.
0453	Donald Trump	Remember they said the healthcare, it's unaffordable.
0454	Donald Trump	It doesn't work.
0455	Donald Trump	And I said to the Republicans, I said you want to do something great politically don't do anything.
0456	Donald Trump	Sit back for two years, let it explode.
0457	Donald Trump	The Democrats will come and beg for us to do something, but we can't do that to the American people.
0458	Donald Trump	We have to fix it.
0459	Donald Trump	And we will.
0460	Donald Trump	We need members of both parties to join hands and work with us to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to build new roads and bridges and airports and tunnels and highways and railways all across our great nation.
0461	Donald Trump	You're all part of this incredible movement.
0462	Donald Trump	This movement that we talk about so much.
0463	Donald Trump	That's been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world.
0464	Donald Trump	It's a movement that is just sweeping.
0465	Donald Trump	It's sweeping across our country.
0466	Donald Trump	It's sweeping frankly across the globe.
0467	Donald Trump	Look at Brexit.
0468	Donald Trump	Look at Brexit.
0469	Donald Trump	Much smaller example, but it's still something you can look at.
0470	Donald Trump	People want to take back control of their countries and they want to take back control of their lives and the lives of their family.
0471	Donald Trump	The nation state remains the best model for human happiness and the American nation remains the greatest symbol of liberty, of freedom and justice on the face of god's earth.
0472	Donald Trump	And now we have spirit like we've never had before.
0473	Donald Trump	It's now that we have our sacred duty and we have no choice and we want this choice to defend our country, to protect its values and to serve its great, great citizens.
0474	Donald Trump	Erasing national borders does not make people safer.
0475	Donald Trump	It undermines democracy and trade prosperity.
0476	Donald Trump	We're giving it away.
0477	Donald Trump	The socalled global elite have done well for themselves, but left working families with shrinking wages.
0478	Donald Trump	Really they are shrinking.
0479	Donald Trump	18 years ago though many of you in this room made more money working one job than you're making right now working two and three jobs.
0480	Donald Trump	Instead of peace, we've seen wars that never end and conflicts that never seem to go away.
0481	Donald Trump	We don't fight to win.
0482	Donald Trump	We fight politically correct wars.
0483	Donald Trump	We don't win anymore.
0484	Donald Trump	We don't win at trade.
0485	Donald Trump	We don't win in any capacity.
0486	Donald Trump	We don't win anymore.
0487	Donald Trump	We're going to start winning again.
0488	Donald Trump	Believe me.
0489	Donald Trump	And we have the chance now working together to deliver change for the ages.
0490	Donald Trump	This will be change for the ages.
0491	Donald Trump	Change like never before.
0492	Donald Trump	To pursue real peace, real stability, and real prosperity.
0493	Donald Trump	We want to secure our borders and protect our workers.
0494	Donald Trump	To rebuild our military and our infrastructure.
0495	Donald Trump	To fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods.
0496	Donald Trump	To bring hope and opportunity to our inner cities.
0497	Donald Trump	To ensure a level playing field for all women in the workforce.
0498	Donald Trump	To reform our tax code and remove the regulations that undermine growth and innovation.
0499	Donald Trump	And to replace chaos and distrust with community and cooperation.
0500	Donald Trump	The tired echoes of yesterday's fights.
0501	Donald Trump	We're fighting battles that no longer help us.
0502	Donald Trump	We're fighting battles that other people aren't treating us fairly in the fight.
0503	Donald Trump	I'm a NATO fan, but many of the countries in NATO, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries.
0504	Donald Trump	They're not paying their bills.
0505	Donald Trump	They're not paying their bills.
0506	Donald Trump	They have to help us.
0507	Donald Trump	No longer are we chained down by the discredited approaches of the past.
0508	Donald Trump	No longer must we listen to those who have nothing to brag about, but failure.
0509	Donald Trump	New circumstances demand new solutions.
0510	Donald Trump	Americans have fought and won wars together.
0511	Donald Trump	Our heroes have shed their blood together and lost their lives.
0512	Donald Trump	Our citizens have raised their children together, fought for justice together, and shared common hopes and dreams from one generation to the next.
0513	Donald Trump	Stretching back to the first day of our American independence.
0514	Donald Trump	This is our legacy.
0515	Donald Trump	It belongs to all of you.
0516	Donald Trump	And it belongs to every man, woman, and child in our nation.
0517	Donald Trump	Now is the time to call upon these deep ties in the name of bold acts.
0518	Donald Trump	Let us move past the differences party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country.
0519	Donald Trump	We are all brothers and all sisters.
0520	Donald Trump	We share one home.
0521	Donald Trump	One destiny and one glorious American flag.
0522	Donald Trump	We are united together by history and by providence.
0523	Donald Trump	We will make America strong again.
0524	Donald Trump	I promise.
0525	Donald Trump	We will make America proud again.
0526	Donald Trump	We will make America safe again.
0527	Donald Trump	And we will make America great again.
0528	Donald Trump	Greater than ever before.
0529	Donald Trump	May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America!
0530	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0531	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0532	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
