While Biden\u2019s statement did call out guns that use 9 mm ammunition, he was referring to the high-capacity magazines that sometimes come standard, or are added onto, those types of guns. A pistol, according to federal regulations, is a handgun that has its chamber integrated with the barrel.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe NRA article cites a Seattle Times story on two Biden campaign fundraisers in the region. At one point the story says:\n\"While saying he supports the Second Amendment, Biden called the absolutist arguments of some gun-rights supporters 'bizarre.' Noting people can\u2019t own machine guns or bazookas, Biden said, 'Why should we allow people to have military-style weapons including pistols with 9-mm bullets and can hold 10 or more rounds?'\"\u00a0\nSo, does that mean Biden wants to ban those pistols?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFred Thompson\n\n\nstated on August 21, 2007 in article on his campaign Web site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe live in \"a time of historically low violent crime rates and historically high gun ownership rates nationally.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy David Baumann \u2022 August 29, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis campaign says no.\u00a0\n\"Predictably, the NRA is lying about the only candidate in this race who has taken them on and beaten them twice,\" Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates told PolitiFact.\u00a0\n\"His statement here, as he has often said, is about banning high-capacity magazines for use in any type of weapon. The NRA's support for these magazines, despite the carnage that could not have taken place and the innocent lives that would not have been lost without them, is a moral crisis for that organization.\"\nThere is no mention of banning any type of traditional handgun on Biden\u2019s presidential campaign website. Among other measures, his gun control policies include: Banning the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and initiating a buyback of these weapons; closing loopholes in the background check system and requiring checks on all gun sales; and ending the online sale of firearms and ammunitions.\nBiden has voted on amendments to ban certain rifles, guns considered assault weapons and semi-automatic weapons. But he has no record of supporting measures that would ban traditional pistols.\nWe reached out to the NRA but did not receive a response.\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18155"}
