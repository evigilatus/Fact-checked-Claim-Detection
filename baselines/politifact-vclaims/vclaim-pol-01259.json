We did not hear back from Ojeda\u2019s campaign, but we located the data to answer this question.\nPolitifact has previously placed the number of U.S. service members who were killed in the Vietnam War at 58,220.\nThe most precise statistic we could find is for the number of opioid deaths, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined as deaths from opioid analgesics, heroin or illicit synthetic opioids. The data does not cover 2018, so we took \"the last two years\" to mean the last two years for which data is available, which are 2016 and 2017.\nIn 2016, the CDC found that 42,249 Americans died from opioid overdoses. In 2017, according to preliminary CDC figures released in August 2018, the number of overdose deaths from opioids rose to 49,068.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombined, the number of opioid overdose deaths in 2016 and 2017 was 91,317 -- well beyond the number of U.S. deaths in the Vietnam War.\nOjeda\u2019s reference to 60,000 deaths two years ago appears to involve a broader statistic -- the number of overdose deaths for all drugs, not just opioids. The number of deaths in this category for 2016 and 2017 was 63,632 and 72,306, respectively.\nUsing this broader statistic, Ojeda would still be correct: The number of overdoses from all drugs totaled 135,938 over those two years, far higher than the number of service member deaths in Vietnam.\nOur ruling\nOjeda said, \"We have lost more lives in the last two years\" due to opioids \"than all of the lives lost during the Vietnam War.\"\nMore than 90,000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2016 and 2017 combined, and more than 135,000 died from all drug overdoses in those two years. Both are higher than the 58,220 U.S. service member deaths in Vietnam.\nWe rate the claim True.\n Share the Facts 2018-11-15 19:00:21 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  \"We have lost more lives in the last two years\" due to opioids \"than all of the lives lost during the Vietnam War.\"    Richard Ojeda Candidate https://www.facebook.com/RichardOjeda2020/videos/250343298940994/   a Facebook video Wednesday, October 24, 2018 2018-10-24    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01259"}
