The labor force is fluid, so people who lose their jobs often move quickly into another one. Instead, economists use the concept of net jobs gained or lost -- how many more (or fewer) people were employed on Date B than on Date A.\n\nWhen we asked the Romney campaign for backup material, they confirmed that they were talking about net jobs lost under a given president. So that\u2019s the measure we used.\n\nWe found that Obama is indeed the only president to have a net job loss if you count from inauguration day until the end of the presidency. But it\u2019s not necessarily fair to credit or blame presidents for jobs created or lost during the first year on the job, since the president\u2019s policies have not had time to take effect.\n\nInstead, if you start the count at one year into a president's term and end it one year -- a somewhat arbitrary method, but a defensible one -- it turns out that the Obama administration has presided over a net increase in jobs. So using this method, the premise of the Romney claim -- that the net jobs change for the nation as a whole under Obama was negative -- evaporates. In fact, using this method means that Obama\u2019s predecessor, George W. Bush,\u00a0becomes the only\u00a0president to lose jobs on his watch.\n\nLet\u2019s dig deeper into the numbers.\n\nThe numbers starting at\u00a0inauguration day\n\nAs we noted, the numbers provided by the Romney campaign used jobs figures for the president\u2019s first and last days\u00a0in office. To replicate the campaign's math, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that tracks employment figures going back decades. Due to BLS data constraints and Romney\u2019s use of the term \"modern\" presidents, we limited our search to presidents from Harry Truman on.\n\nIn previous fact checks, we\u2019ve tried to adjust for the time each president has spent in office. But since the Romney tweet was clear about referring to total numbers of people who lost jobs, rather than the rate at which people were losing jobs under each president, we did not take that additional step for this item.\n\nWe first calculated how many jobs were gained or lost during each president\u2019s tenure on a net basis. We also tried to adjust for the size of the population by dividing the net job gain or loss by the nation\u2019s estimated population during the president\u2019s first year in office. (Comparing jobs gained or lost under Obama, when the U.S. population is more than 300 million, to the changes under Truman, when the population was below 140 million, is comparing apples and\u00a0oranges.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

The presidents are listed in descending order by most jobs created:\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\nBill Clinton\n\n+ 22,744,000\n\n+8.8 percent of population\n\n\n\n2.\n\nRonald Reagan\n\n+ 16,102,000\n\n+7.0 percent of population\n\n\n\n3.\n\nLyndon B.

This means it\u2019s reasonable for him to say that \"more Americans have lost their jobs under Barack Obama than any president in modern history.\"\n\nBut, as we noted, that\u2019s not the only way to look at it.\n\nThe numbers starting one year into each president\u2019s term\n\nIf you use the one-year-into-the-term yardstick, the numbers don\u2019t change dramatically -- except for Obama and his predecessor. Here\u2019s the same breakdown, again in descending order by net jobs gained or lost:\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\nRonald Reagan \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n+18,594,000\n\n+8.1 percent of population\n\n\n\n2.\n\nBill Clinton \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n+18,117,000\n\n+7.0 percent of population\n\n\n\n3.\n\nLyndon B.

Kennedy \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n+4,326,000\n\n+2.4 percent of population\n\n\n\n10.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush\n\n+3,323,000\n\n+1.3 percent of population\n\n\n\n11.\n\nBarack Obama \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n+2,619,000\n\n+0.9 percent of population\n\n\n\n12.\n\nGeorge W. Bush \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n- 1,310,000\n\n- 0.5 percent of population\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo by this measurement, Obama doesn\u2019t have a net loss of jobs at all -- in fact, the only president who does is George W. Bush. (Lest our readers think that using this methodology is some kind of liberal plot, we\u2019ll also note that using this method gives almost 2.5 million extra jobs to Reagan, vaulting him over Clinton into the top spot in job\u00a0creation among modern\u00a0presidents.)\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Obama\u2019s record on jobs through December 2011 is positive unless you start counting during the first three months of his administration -- January (as Romney did), February or March 2009. \u00a0We might also note that\u00a0Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009, and got Congress to pass his stimulus bill in mid February, a bill that took months to start pumping money into the economy.\n\nWe won't argue that counting from one year into a president\u2019s term (or four months, or nine months) is a better solution than counting from day one; that\u2019s a matter of opinion. But we do think it underlines an important reality -- that making small changes to methodology can produce significant deviations in the results and weakens the black-and-white certainty of Romney\u2019s claim that \"more Americans have lost their jobs under Barack Obama than any president in modern history.\"\n\nIt really depends on when you start counting.\n\nA final note: It\u2019s PolitiFact\u2019s policy not to focus solely on the numbers in political attacks (or claims of political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit is justified. For job-creation and job-loss claims, we've talked to many workforce experts who tell us that politicians\u2019 policies are just one factor in employment levels, making even statistically accurate claims less than True on our Truth-O-Meter.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRomney\u2019s claim is accurate if you count from every president\u2019s first day in office to his final day -- by those standards, Obama is indeed the only president since World War II to have presided over a net job loss. But if you compare each president from one year into his term to one year after the end of the administration -- a plausible approach if you hope to capture what kind of impact their policies had on the economy -- Obama\u2019s job statistics shift into positive territory, while George W. Bush\u2019s fall into negative territory.\n\nThe fact that Obama\u2019s -- or any other president's -- numbers can change dramatically depending on what timeline you use suggests that Romney\u2019s conclusion isn't as telling as it sounds. Throw in PolitiFact\u2019s perennial reminder that no politician is the sole cause of either jobs lost or jobs created, and we arrive at a ruling of Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11779"}
