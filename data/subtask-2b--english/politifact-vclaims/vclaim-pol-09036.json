During a \"Talking Points\" segment, the conservative white commentator took aim at the breakdown of the African-American family, drugs and the entertainment industry\u2019s promotion of \"gangsta culture.\"\nThen CNN anchor Don Lemon took O\u2019Reilly\u2019s commentary a step further. Lemon, in a response that has since gone viral, launched his own rant last weekend during an on-air \"No Talking Points\" segment.\nLemon, who is black, outlined five points for African-Americans to fix their problems, a kind of free self-help session. They included: pull up your pants, respect where you live and finish school.\nLemon threw out a couple of statistics to cement his points. So we decided to check out his numbers referenced in his education argument.\n\"You want to break the cycle of poverty?\" Lemon says in the rant. \"Stop telling kids they're acting white because they go to school or they speak proper English. A high school dropout makes on average $19,000 a year, a high school graduate makes $28,000 a year, a college graduate makes $51,000 a year. Over the course of a career, a college grad will make nearly $1 million more than a high school graduate. That's a lot of money.\"\nA lot of money, indeed. Enough money to warrant a check of the facts.\nThe CNN anchor\u2019s rant led immediately to a huge blowback from people across the country, and much of it unfolded on social media. Atlanta political insider-turned MSNBC contributor Goldie Taylor even referred to Lemon as a \"turncoat\" in a series of fiery Twitter posts.\nLemon\u2019s opinions are his own and not up for checking. PolitiFact looks at statements of purported fact, not opinions.\nBut what of Lemon\u2019s educational attainment stats?\nThere are several sources that have examined Americans\u2019 earnings by education level.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics found that weekly median annual earnings in 2012 for a high school dropout were $471; $652 for a high school graduate; and $1,066 for a college graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree. Multiplying those weekly figures by 52, and the annual earnings for a high school dropout were $24,492, compared with $33,904 for a high school graduate and $55,432 for a college graduate.\nThe BLS data, last modified in May, is for people age 25 and over, and earnings are for full-time wage and salary workers.\nA study by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal economics think tank, found that the average hourly wage in 2012 for people without a high school diploma was $11.75, compared with $15.78 for high school graduates and $28.28 for college graduates. In 2012, the BLS reported that Americans at private, nonfarm companies worked an average of 34.5 hours per week. Do the math on those numbers, and high school dropouts earned $21,080 for the year; high school graduates, $28,309; and college graduates, $50,734.\nSeveral university and economic studies have used 2010 census data of median annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers age 25-64. The data, released in 2011, found that non-high school graduates made $25,705; high school graduates, $35,035; and college graduates with a bachelor\u2019s degree, $55,864.\nOver the course of a lifetime, a Georgetown University study found that high school graduates would make $1.3 million, while college graduates with a bachelor\u2019s degree would make $2.3 million. The report, and others, note that occupation, gender, race and ethnicity can influence outcomes. Those influences, along with a tough economy, have caused some researchers to lower the lifetime gap to between $280,000 and $450,000.\nSo, does Lemon\u2019s claim pay off?\nDepending on what data is collected, how that data is collected and what data set you consider, Lemon\u2019s claim could be correct, or at least within a few thousand dollars for each educational level.\nBut use other data, and his claim could be off by several thousand dollars. Also of note, several factors -- including gender, occupation, age and the economy -- can influence annual and lifetime earnings for workers at all education levels.\nStill, his overall theme that higher educational attainment equals higher wages seems to be correct no matter which data set is considered.\nWe rated Lemon\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09036"}
