Donald Trump financed it!\"\nThis is somewhat accurate, but it exaggerates Trump\u2019s contribution and misstates the city\u2019s role.\u00a0\nTrump has been credited by organizers for saving the parade, but the post exaggerates the extent of Trump\u2019s monetary contribution and appears to misstate\u00a0the city\u2019s role.\u00a0\nTrump didn\u2019t fund the entire event, but he did donate money to the organization that hosted the parade, and was credited by organizers in news reports for saving the parade that year by kick-starting fundraising efforts.\u00a0\nWe found no evidence that the city of New York refused to pay for the event, which was put on by a private, nonprofit organization. A search of news archives and databases turned up no dispute between the city and parade organizers over funds for the event, and then-mayor Rudy Giuliani expressed dismay over the lack of support for the parade.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

(McGowan told CNN in that same 2016 interview that Trump was never grand marshal because he\u2019s not a veteran, but the Times reported that he was in a follow-up story published a day after the parade.)\u00a0\nTrump didn\u2019t fund the entire event. And while the post seems to be wrong on the city\u2019s involvement, it does appear that Trump\u2019s contribution and efforts enabled the parade to go on as planned.
