Could Cutter be right about this one?\n\nWe contacted Obama campaign officials, who did not respond immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGenerally, home mortgage interest is any interest you pay on a loan on your home or a second home. The loan may be a mortgage to buy your home, a second mortgage, a line of credit or a home equity loan. In most cases, you can deduct all of your home mortgage interest, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe mortgage interest deduction is a popular policy with millions of American homeowners, particularly middle-income earners. Nearly 50 percent of Americans who take advantage of the mortgage interest deduction make annual incomes between $100,000 and $200,000, according to the Tax Policy Center. As president, Ronald Reagan famously promised in a 1984 speech to the National Association of Realtors that he would \"preserve the part of the American dream which the home mortgage interest deduction symbolizes.\"\n\nSome argue the deduction is the federal government\u2019s way of paying Americans to buy a house.\n\nOver the years, there have been complaints that some wealthy Americans have abused the system, such as claiming deductions for yachts by claiming them as second homes. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in a 2010 report that the mortgage interest deduction will cost the federal government about $98.5 billion this fiscal year.\n\nRomney\u2019s idea is that tax rates could be lowered if the tax code was scrubbed of loopholes and exemptions. That way, the government would get the same amount of tax revenue coming in. But Romney won\u2019t say which loopholes and exemptions he would like to target.\n\nDemocrats have argued that Romney\u2019s tax plans would require him to make changes to the federal tax code, such as eliminating the mortgage interest deduction. The Tax Policy Center released an analysis of Romney\u2019s tax plans that concluded Romney would raise taxes on middle-income Americans if he eliminated the mortgage interest deduction and ended other policies, such as the charitable deduction.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in April that Romney said at a fundraiser that he wants to stop allowing deductions on second homes. The Romney campaign later said the candidate was floating ideas and that it was not a firm proposal.\n\nSeveral news outlets reported earlier this month that the GOP was not going to support the mortgage interest deduction in its party platform. There was a battle over the deduction between the real estate industry, which wanted to keep it in the platform, and some conservative activists, who desired a simpler tax code, according to those reports. The Wall Street Journal later reported there was a compromise.\n\nThe Republican Party platform lays out its position in a section called \"Protecting The Taxpayers: \u2018No More Too Big to Fail.\u2019 \" It says at the top of Page 25 that \"we strongly support tax reform; in the event we do not achieve this, we must preserve the mortgage interest deduction.\"\n\nThat wording does not explicitly back up Cutter's point. But it leaves open the possibility that eliminating the deduction could possibly be included in tax reform. Still, it's a stretch to conclude from that wording that Romney would eliminate the deduction.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ruling\n\nCutter said, \"Mitt Romney's platform \u2026 won't protect the mortgage interest deduction for middle-class families.\" Romney wants to limit some tax deductions in exchange for rate cuts, but he hasn\u2019t said which deductions he wants to end.
