Wolf is not allowing companies that distribute U.S. flags to ship out orders to be placed at veteran\u2019s graves for Memorial Day,\" Pa. House Rep. Brad Roae posted on Facebook on May 11.\nWe wondered whether Wolf had really blocked Pennsylvania-based American flag distributors from operating during the pandemic.\nRoae, a Republican, did not return a call seeking comment on his Facebook post, which has now been shared more than 7,000 times. But it looks like he was right.\nNot only did Wolf exclude FlagZone, a manufacturer located in Gilbertsville, from his original list of life-sustaining businesses permitted to operate during the pandemic, his administration doubled down and rejected the company\u2019s application for a waiver.\u00a0\nFlagZone is one of the only American flag manufacturer in Pennsylvania and one of only a half dozen across the country. The company typically distributes more than six million small stick flags annually.\u00a0\nCasey Smith, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Community & Economic Development, told The Reading Eagle that the Wolf administration\u2019s top priority is protecting the health and well-being of Pennsylvanians, and that flag-making, while patriotic, simply wasn\u2019t \"life-sustaining.\"\n\"Memorial Day celebrations and ceremonies are a staple in our nation, and many Pennsylvanians will need to adjust their routine this year to accommodate our new normal,\" Smith said. \"We encourage all Pennsylvanians to honor our nation\u2019s fallen in their own special way.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurns out the flags had already been manufactured and were sitting in a warehouse.\nFlagZone President Daniel Ziegler said it would only take a few workers to ship 400,000 flags that had been ordered by 24 different Pennsylvania counties in anticipation of Monday\u2019s federal holiday. Bucks, Chester and Delaware counties were among those waiting to receive their orders.\u00a0\nWhen State Sen. Scott Hutchinson learned about FlagZone\u2019s woes, he also called on Wolf to ease restrictions imposed on the company.\n\"I see no reason why the time-honored and solemn tradition of placing flags at veterans\u2019 graves could not be continued this year,\" Hutchinson, a Republican who represents Butler and other Western Pennsylvania counties, said in a statement sent to reporters via email. \"Certainly placing the flags in cemeteries could be done while practicing the social distancing Gov. Wolf recommends.\"\nOn Monday, FlagZone got some good news.\nThe state cleared the way for the company to ship some flag orders even as it held firm that flag manufacturing is not essential during the pandemic.\n\"We\u2019re just excited to get these flags out after months of being shut down,\" Ziegler told The Reading Eagle. \"Hopefully, when a family goes to the gravesite of a loved one who was a veteran they will now see that they were not forgotten.\"\nSmith, of the community and economic development department, said in an interview that special approval from the state is not required for limited shipping activities and communicated\u00a0 that to FlagZone.\nOur ruling\nRoae posted on Facebook that Gov. Wolf had blocked companies that distribute American flags from shipping orders ahead of Memorial Day. Wolf initially blocked FlagZone from operating during the pandemic and then rejected the company\u2019s request for a waiver. A state official later said the company did not need special permission to ship limited numbers of flags. However, the company didn\u2019t understand this until the state said so, especially since the clarification came days after the Wolf administration rejected FlagZone\u2019s application to resume operations.
