Their evidence: a grainy black-and-white video.\nThe video, which was posted by a Facebook page called Red Pill Radio on Dec. 28, shows the outline of buildings and a highway in Nashville. Then, a plume of smoke rises behind three light poles.\n\"You can see as there\u2019s a line flying in, there\u2019s a little bit of a glow and then there\u2019s the explosion,\" a narrator says in the video. \"Very, very interesting.\"\n\"Nashville explosion a missile strike??\" reads the post caption from Red Pill Radio, a Facebook account that bears the slogan of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory on its \"About\" page.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar claims have been shared in hundreds of public posts, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.\nIn its video, Red Pill Radio cites a Dec. 26 article from WorthyPolitics.com whose headline claims the video \"proves Nashville explosion was actually a missile strike.\" We have seen\u00a0 similar claims from others who say the missile was aimed at the AT&T Building.\nThere is no evidence to substantiate that theory. We rated Pants on Fire a similar claim that AT&T was targeted in the bombing as part of an election cover-up.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 30, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump assassination foiled, Deep State in panic mode!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 4, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile federal investigators are still looking into the bombing, law enforcement officials have said a man named Anthony Warner was responsible and died in the blast. The bomb was located in a recreational vehicle that Warner owned. Fact-checkers have debunked claims that the explosion was the result of a missile strike.\u00a0\nThe video in the Facebook post is security footage obtained by WKRN-TV, a station based in Nashville. It shows smoke from the explosion over the skyline. The clip does not show a missile hitting the city.\nVideos from law enforcement officials and local businesses show that the explosion occurred on 2nd Avenue North in downtown Nashville. The explosion injured three people and damaged several businesses, including the AT&T Building.\nThis is video of Friday morning's explosion recorded by an MNPD camera at 2nd Ave N & Commerce St. pic.twitter.com/3vaXhoUOAR\u2014 Metro Nashville PD (@MNPDNashville) December 28, 2020 \nOne clip captured an audio message warning people to evacuate the area seconds before the explosion. The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department identified the RV at the center of the blast in a Dec. 25 tweet.\nOn Dec. 27, U.S. Attorney Don Cochran said the explosion appeared to be a suicide bombing carried out by a Warner. DNA from human remains found at the scene matched Warner, and investigators found financial records for components that he may have used to construct the bomb.\u00a0\nFBI agents are investigating whether Warner may have been paranoid about 5G technology. Conspiracy theories about the cellular data networks have blossomed on social media over the past year, falsely claiming that 5G spreads COVID-19 and could be used as a spying tool by the government.\u00a0\nThe investigation of the Nashville bombing is ongoing, but the Facebook post is inaccurate and ridiculous.
