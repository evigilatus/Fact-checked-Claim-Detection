The post featured an image of the vessel the Carnival Sunshine.\n\"Carnival is now offering Free Cruises to those effected (sic) by the Hurricane,\" the post read. \"Just call Carnival or Message John Heald and say you want a stress free cruise with ( hash tag) Carnivalfamily and they will have you set up on a 4-7 night cruise of your choice. Just pay taxes and port fees. You also will receive $100 per cabin OBC.\"\nThere\u2019s no mention of which 2017 hurricane sparked the offer, whether it be Harvey, which drenched Texas, or Irma, which blew through Florida (the \"OBC\" stands for on-board credit).\nBut Carnival isn\u2019t offering such a deal, because the story is fake.\nIt\u2019s not readily apparent, but BreakingNews247.net is one of a gaggle of websites that allow users to create their own stories, labeling them as \"prank\" articles.\nBelow the text and some advertisements is a button that reads \"Create a Prank.\" Clicking on it allows a user to build their own fake story.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitiFact has written about similar sites before. A range of websites allowing people to generate these kinds of stories have been reported by Facebook users for all manner of faux stories, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to curb fake news.\nWhile some people may look at the sites as a way to create jokes, they open up the potential for a scam known as \"like farming.\" That\u2019s when users create posts to gain as many likes as possible. The scammers then use highly ranked links to spread malware, gain readers\u2019 personal information or otherwise make money.\nThis particular post first appeared sometime before Sept. 15, according to the Miami Herald. It drew Carnival\u2019s attention after being posted on Facebook.\nThe post suggested readers contact Heald, who is a real British Carnival cruise director. Heald addressed the hoax on his own Facebook profile, in which he engages Carnival customers.\n\"It is a fake page and we have reported the author accordingly,\" Heald wrote in a Sept. 15 Facebook post.\n\nHeald said on the post that he was aware which Facebook group was spreading the fake story but didn\u2019t elaborate. He also called the original poster a \"soulless, heartless wanker\" and further talked about the issue in a video posted to his profile later that day.\nA Carnival spokeswoman confirmed that the story was false, although the company is making monetary donations and helping ferry supplies to storm-affected areas. Carnival reported the original Facebook post, which appeared to have been removed.\nBut the fake story was still available at BreakingNews247.net. As of this writing, a counter on the article said it had been shared more than 83,000 times.\nDon\u2019t pack your bags just yet, because there\u2019s no free pleasure cruise for hurricane victims.
