She\u2019s an incompetent, third-rate politician!\" Trump tweeted April 16.\nCrazy Nancy Pelosi deleted this from her Twitter account.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2020 \nBut there\u2019s no evidence Pelosi ever tweeted that video of herself in Chinatown. So she could not have deleted it, as Trump said.\nThe video Trump tweeted is 17 seconds long, a snippet of a Feb. 24 report by KPIX, a San Francisco Bay Area CBS affiliate. Pelosi in the KPIX report is shown walking through San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown District and encouraging people to visit its shops and restaurants, which were seeing a decline in business since the coronavirus outbreak began in China.\nAt the time, KPIX reported, there were no active cases of coronavirus in San Francisco. There were 21 active cases in California, but they were in hospital isolation or in quarantine.\nPelosi says in the video: \"You should come to Chinatown. Precautions have been taken by our city. We know that there is concern about tourism, traveling throughout the world, but we think it\u2019s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come.\"\nWe wondered if Trump was right that Pelosi deleted that video from her Twitter account. PolitiFact\u2019s fact-checking process includes asking a person who makes a claim for the evidence that supports their statement. So we asked the White House press office and Trump\u2019s re-election campaign for the date of the original post, which account posted it, and when it was deleted. We did not get any information.\nPelosi\u2019s office told PolitiFact that they never posted the video that Trump claimed was deleted.\nWe did our own digging and found no trace of the video posted from her account.\nPolitwoops, a project of ProPublica, tracks deleted tweets by elected officials. According to that tracker, @SpeakerPelosi\u2019s latest five deleted tweets span from Feb. 22 to April 13. Not one is about going to Chinatown.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also reviewed what Pelosi\u2019s Twitter page looked liked since Feb. 24, based on the history saved by Wayback Machine, an initiative of the Internet Archive. The archived pages of Pelosi\u2019s Twitter account do not show the video Trump tweeted. (Wayback Machine did not have archives of the page as they looked on Feb. 24-26, but any deletion of that video would presumably be more recent.)\nTrump suggests that Pelosi is hiding her actions from Feb. 24. But a transcript of her comments that were captured in Trump\u2019s video appear on both her House Speaker website and congressional website. As of April 16, the Chinatown visit was one of the featured photos in the homepage of her congressional website.\nPelosi\u2019s Twitter page currently has a video of her Feb. 24 visit to Chinatown. It shows her making a fortune cookie. Text accompanying the video says: \"It was a pleasure to try my hand at making fortune cookies at the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory (with a little guidance from owner Kevin Chan, of course). The message inside? \u2018United We Stand.\u2019\"\nOn Feb. 25, she posted a series of tweets saying Americans needed a coordinated response to the coronavirus and that the House would advance a funding package \"that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis.\"\nIt\u2019s worth noting that throughout January and most of February, U.S. officials said that the coronavirus risk to the American public was low and that they were not seeing community spread of the virus. By Feb. 25, there were 53 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States and no deaths, according to data compiled by the World Health Organization.\nOn Feb. 28, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doctor said it was possible that a reported case in California \"could be the first instance of community spread \u2014 meaning the illness was acquired through an unknown exposure in the community.\" But it could also be that the patient was exposed through contact to a traveler who was infected, said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The immediate risk to the general American public remained low, she said.\nThe cancelling of mass gatherings was not yet common in the United States in February, the CDC noted in an April report.\nRELATED: Louisiana governor is right, there was no suggestion Mardi Gras had to be canceled\nTrump\u2019s messaging around this time also did not suggest that people avoid large crowds. The same day of Pelosi\u2019s trip to Chinatown, Trump tweeted: \"The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\"\nOur ruling\nTrump tweeted that Pelosi deleted a video of her telling people to go to Chinatown.\nPelosi on Feb. 24 did encourage people to go to Chinatown in San Francisco. But we found no trace of her posting or deleting the video Trump shared.\nAt the time of Pelosi\u2019s remark, U.S. health officials said the risk of the coronavirus was low to the American public since they had no reports of community spread. Trump during this time also said the virus was under control in the United States.\nNeither the White House nor Trump\u2019s re-election campaign provide evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim. In the absence of evidence, we rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16953"}
