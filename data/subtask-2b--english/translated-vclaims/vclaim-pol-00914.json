One quote from conservatives and liberals, who are often attributed to President Theodore Roosevelt, reappeared on social media after the Internet was circulated for years.

Barry Bobick, a literary scientist and consultant editor of the English Oxford dictionary, also researched the quote in 2013 and found no evidence that Roosevelt said so. Bobk discovered this expression for the first time in print at some point around 2007, long after Roosevelt's life. In e-mail boards and blogs dating back to 2002, the quotation was simply attributed to nobody, appearing in signatures or in the middle of text objects without a source. Also, the quotation is not included in the list of verified and unverified Roosevelt quotations of Theodore Roosevelt. We're assessing this fake Roosevelt pants quote on fire!
