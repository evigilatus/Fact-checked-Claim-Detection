One operator had apparently enlarged the font size on their computer screen, perhaps cutting off Buttigieg\u2019s name from the list of options, according to two people interviewed by the Times.\u00a0\nOther news media, including Politico, also reported that Buttigieg\u2019s campaign had raised the issue and that the font change apparently was the problem.\nThe Register\u2019s executive editor, Carol Hunter, explained the decision in a Feb. 1 article, saying \"it appears (Buttigieg\u2019s) name was omitted in at least one interview in which the respondent was asked to name their preferred candidate,\" and that the omission \"could have compromised the results of the poll.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCause of caucus count problems unclear\nThe second part of the statement undoubtedly refers to the unprecedented delay in the reporting of the results of Democratic caucuses.\u00a0\nBy midday the following day (Feb. 4), the Iowa Democratic Party was saying it expected to release some results by 5 p.m. that day.\u00a0\nAt that point, news organizations were reporting that the delays were caused by technical problems \u2014 both with an app and with a telephone system that had been set up as a backup for the electronic reporting of caucus tallies. People who called experienced long delays or couldn\u2019t get through at all.\u00a0\nNo evidence had surfaced that the delay was due to Democrats \"blocking\" the poll or caucus.\nWe messaged Organizers for Bernie 2020, but didn\u2019t get a reply.\u00a0\nA Sanders campaign spokeswoman told us the group has no relationship with the campaign. She had no comment on the claim we\u2019re checking.\nOur ruling\nA social media post said Democrats \"blocked the Iowa poll\" and \"blocked the Iowa caucus.\"\nResults of the final Des Moines Register poll before the caucuses were not released because of a possible error by one operator who did the telephone polling.\u00a0\nTechnical problems with an app and a phone system were blamed for the unprecedented delay in reporting the Democratic caucus results.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17332"}
