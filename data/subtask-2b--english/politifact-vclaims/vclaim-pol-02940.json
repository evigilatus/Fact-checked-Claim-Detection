Sean Duffy recently argued for an increase in military spending, claiming the U.S. military\u2019s air fleet is antiquated and leaves the nation at risk.\nDuffy\u2019s push for more military spending came during a July 20, 2017, interview on The World Over with Raymond Arroyo on EWTN, days before Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed in the U.S. Senate. Duffy\u2019s claim arose from a question by Arroyo about whether the U.S. spends too much on defense.\nDuffy (R-Wisconsin) responded with a firm \"no,\" then rattled off a series of familiar talking points about the nation\u2019s military: the military is depleted; there\u2019s peace through strength; and it\u2019s vital to stay ahead of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.\nTo drive his message home, he made a very specific claim about the U.S. air fleet.\n\"We're flying 1987 planes with 1987 technology,\" Duffy said.\nDuffy\u2019s wider point about a depleted military is one PolitiFact has addressed in fact checks of other politicians, such as Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan.\nIn this item, we\u2019ll look at whether the U.S. is really flying planes from 1987 that have 1987 technology and what that says about the state of the military.\nAging aircraft\nIn 2015, Duffy did a fly-along in an F-16 with the Wisconsin Air National Guard\u2019s 115th Fighter Wing in Madison. On the visit, staffers from the Air National Guard told him the planes were built in 1987 and had 1987 technology, aides to Duffy told us.\n\"He received that information from the Wisconsin Air National Guard and took their professional guidance on the matter,\" said Duffy spokesman Mark Bednar.\nCapt. Joe Trovato, deputy director of public affairs for the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs, confirmed the fly-along happened and that Duffy recalled the conversation correctly. The F-16\u2019s assigned to that specific fighter wing were built between 1986 and 1988, with the bulk in 1987.\nThe conversation, however, was specifically about the F-16 and how peer or near-peer nations such as China and Russia are catching up and can match or exceed F-16 technology.\nIn the EWTN interview, Duffy offered a broad statement about the nation\u2019s military aircraft, without limiting it to specific planes or providing a sense of how many planes may fit the criteria.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn any case, there is more to the story.\nThe body and engines on the F-16\u2019s in question remain largely the same as they did when they rolled off the assembly line. But in the years since, the government has upgraded weapons, sensors and software on the planes, Trovato said.\nFor instance, they now have better GPS locator systems and better weapons and munitions.\nThe aerospace policy experts we spoke with agreed with Duffy\u2019s general sentiment, but said it passes over important context, such as the upgrades to the fighters.\n\"These older aircraft have been upgraded and modernized over time,\" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies -- a nonpartisan Washington, D.C., think tank. \"While the airframe may be old, the cockpit, navigation systems, sensors, and other electronics have been modernized.\n\"An F-16 flying today is much more capable and technologically advanced than when it rolled off the assembly line in the 1980s.\"\nStill, Harrison and others said, there are limits to the upgrades: The F-16 can\u2019t be upgraded to have the stealth capabilities common in the much newer F-22 Raptors or F-35 Lightnings.\nLaura McAndrews, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Air Force, said in an email that the average age of aircraft in the Air Force is 27, and fighter and attack aircraft specifically have an average age of 25.\nTypically, when the military wants to introduce a new generation of aircraft, it can take two decades to get an aircraft from the conceptual stage to test stage and finally full integration into the nation\u2019s air fleet, according to Harrison and other policy experts.\nThe F-22 Raptors, which first got off the ground in tests in the 1990s, are among the most recent additions. The Air Force has 183 of them, according to fact sheets.\nThe F-35 Lightnings, a program started in 2001, are part of a controversial $400 billion order that, over 20 years, aims to replace aging aircraft across three branches of the military, according to the Department of Defense.\nOur rating \nDuffy said, \"We're flying 1987 planes with 1987 technology.\"\nIn the case of the airplanes Duffy based his claim on, the engine and body remain largely the same as in 1987, but experts and the military say the F-16 has undergone other technological upgrades. In addition, Duffy\u2019s statement is more general, which ignores ongoing efforts to modernize the fleet and purchase and design new craft.\nWe rate his claim Half True.
