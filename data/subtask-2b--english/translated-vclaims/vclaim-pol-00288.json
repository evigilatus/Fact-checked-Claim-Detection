He said that one of the groups founded by former white and neo-Nazi fanatics, \"Life after hate,\" was to receive grant funds but the offer was cancelled under the Trump programme. But there's more than one story than Butageg described. \"The picture is more accurate than, \"The Obama administration has been after white fanatics and the Trump administration has stopped doing so,\" Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Center for Freedom and National Security programme, who has already told Polyte Fact. \"None of them went after white fanatics.\" We've already evaluated a similar claim by Sin. Corey Booker is often wrong. The Putrjig wording is not as problematic as the Booker version, which referred to mismanagement and used stronger language, but is still inaccurate. The action taken by Tramp on combating violent extremism gives the programme against violent extremism launched during the Obama administration to work with local leaders to deter residents of the United States from joining violent extremist groups. In the last days of Obama, the Department of Homeland Security announced that 31 groups would receive a total of $10 million in grants. Once Trump took office, his administration frozen the grants. Then, in June 2017, Homeland Security released a list of 26 grantees. Some of the winners named Obama withdrew, citing fear of prejudice against Muslims under Trump. But the Butig campaign was merged into one group that was cancelled and given $400,000: life after hate. :: Reading about another cancelled grant to the University of North Carolina, which we covered in the verification of various facts. The UNC request stated that it would target extremist messages, including by jihadists, but also stated that it had experience with white fanatics. In its application, life has not yet been singled out for white national hate, although the group is working to help people who want to leave racism or violent extremism behind. The request stated that the group would work with others to communicate online with \"the supporters and sympathizers of extreme right-wing and jihadist extremism.\" The extreme right-wing extremism is not like white nationalism, although some people use terminology interchangeably. \"We have used the term \"violent right-wing extremism,\" which would include the most expressive \"white nationalism,\" the spokesman for \"life after hatred\" told us. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 January 16, 2012. The internal security speakers said that the applicants had been rejected because they had failed to meet new standards such as working with law enforcement agencies - not because of their interest in combating white superiority. Trump was criticized for the fact that the grant programme focused too much on Muslims. (Almost all accepted projects are focused on working with Muslims or immigrants.) However, the Obama administration faced the same criticism, including from the liberal Brennan Center. The evaluation of the \"cuts\" of Butage said the Trump Department \"cuts\" funding to combat violent extremism, but there is more, too. It was a two-year scholarship program that ended in July 2019. The Department did not seek to renew it. Brian Jackson, researcher at RAND, co-author of the 2019 Internal Security Report on the Prevention of Terrorism, said that the renewal of the grant programme required action by both the administration and Congress. At a hearing of the House Committee on White Sovereignty in June, the Assistant Secretary of National Security seemed to leave the door open for possible future funding. \"We are assessing and evaluating future associated funding requests,\" said the official of the Ministry of National Security, Elizabeth Newman, on combating violent extremism granted. The Butigig campaign cited articles on the reduction of staff and funding in the office housing the fight against violent extremism compared to the Obama administration. The programme was based within the Office of Community Partnerships of the Obama Administration. This office is now the Office of Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention, which aims to address all forms of domestic and international terrorism. George Salim, former Director of CPP, said that his office had a budget of $21 million and 16 staff. Salim, now working for the Anti-Defamation Association, said that the Office had since been reduced to approximately $3 million in the budget based on the Ministry of Health &apos; s budget justification document for 2020. The Congress has not yet completed the draft appropriation laws for 2020, so we do not yet know what the budget of the Office will be. Finally, the Butigig campaign also referred to an article in April in the Daily Monster that reported that the Department had dissolved a group of intelligence analysts who had focused on domestic terrorism. An official of the Ministry of National Security told the monster daily that the same people were working on the same issues as part of the restructuring process. The Trump Department defended its strategy on terrorism, as it was issued in October 2018. It states that the country faces threats from domestic terrorists motivated by different ideologies, including \"racial extremism.\" \"The Trump Department reduced funding for the Department of Homeland Security to combat white nationality,\" said our Governor Butig. He refers to the $10 million counter-extremism grant programme, which began under Obama and was not renewed under President Trump. It was supposed to last for two years. When it expired in July 2019, Trump did not renew it. This isn't exactly like \"cut.\" However, a group that was to receive a grant under Obama, life after hatred, was cancelled under Trump's administration while the programme was continuing. The team was one of the only people with experience in white nationality. In general, most grant proposals focused on Muslims or immigrants, not on white patriots. But Stigge ignored part of the story. We're assessing this statement half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00288"}
