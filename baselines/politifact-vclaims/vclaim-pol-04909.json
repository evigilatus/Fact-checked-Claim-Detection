And Gingrich would have been on firmer ground had he stuck to the narrative of Trump's ascension rather than focusing on the timeline.\nBut the speed at which Trump went from his announcement at Trump Tower to becoming the GOP standard bearer isn\u2019t a remarkable achievement.\nTrump announced his candidacy for president June 16, 2015, in New York, and officially clinched the GOP nomination May 26, 2016, after 29 unbound delegates said they would support Trump.\nThat\u2019s a span of 346 days, if you include May 26.\nWe didn\u2019t have too look too far to find shorter spans for non-incumbents.\nJohn Kerry in 2004\nJohn Kerry didn\u2019t announce his run for the White House until Sept. 2, 2003, and he clinched the Democratic nomination May 5, 2004. That\u2019s a speedy 246-day window.\nGeorge W. Bush in 2000\nRepublicans, too, have been much quicker.\nGeorge W. Bush announced his run for the White House June 12, 1999. He clinched the GOP nomination after the primaries of March 15, 2000, \u00a0a span of 278 days.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl Gore in 2000\nIn the same election, Al Gore needed a little less time. Gore announced his run June 16, 1999, while clinching the same day as Bush, March 15, 2000. That\u2019s 274 days.\nBob Dole in 1996\nBob Dole, a senator from Kansas, announced his campaign April 10, 1995, and clinched the Republican nomination March 19, 1996. That\u2019s 345 days, one fewer than it took Trump.\nBill Clinton in 1992\nBill Clinton announced his campaign for president Oct. 3, 1991. Even though he didn\u2019t clinch the Democratic nomination until June 2, 1992, he still only needed a total of 244 days \u2014 more than 100 days quicker than Trump.\nFor the record, Trump took a few weeks less than Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008, and he easily bested Barack Obama, who needed about 16 months in 2008.\nA spokesman for Gingrich, Ross Worthington, said Gingrich's point was that\u00a0no one has won the nomination from a standing-start in such a short period.\n\"The other nominees you mention did not begin running for president on their announcement day,\" Worthington said. \"Instead, they were clearly running, or at least preparing to run, for months or even years before they made an official announcement. They all had significant preexisting political operations and held significant political offices. The achievement that Newt is referring to is starting from zero to winning the nomination outright.\"\nOur ruling\nSpeaking of Trump\u2019s path to becoming the 2016 GOP standard-bearer, Gingrich said: \"No one In American history has moved from a June 16 announcement to a May 26 winning of a majority.\"\nWhatever Gingrich was trying to say, it didn't come out quite right.\u00a0As one person replied to the former speaker\u00a0on Twitter, \"This tweet sounds smart and impressive if someone doesn't have Google.\"\nOf the last eight non-incumbent presidential nominees, five (Kerry, Gore, Bush, Dole and Clinton) went from announcing their candidacy to becoming the presumptive nominee quicker than Trump.\nThis claim is historically wrong.
