Anyone can buy any weapon, at any time without much, if any organization. They buy it online. They can buy machine guns.\" Obama &apos; s summary of American weapons laws was the reason for the rapid appeal to the conservative press. The readers asked us to see how his words were consistent with current law. We found some big slips. He described the regulation as \"without much, if any,\" too broad to verify the facts, but we can verify what he specifically said about the U.S. weapons laws. His comment on the machine guns is especially off the mark. \"Anybody can buy any weapon at any time.\" No, not anyone. Many types of people are prohibited by federal law from buying weapons. The list of the American Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives includes: anyone convicted in any court and sentenced to one year or more imprisonment; anyone released from military service in disgrace; anyone convicted of domestic violence or convicted by court order against the harassment or threat of a intimate partner; and any person addicted to a controlled drug or placed in a mental institution. An article on a conservative federal website noted that \"persons under the age of 21 may not purchase handguns from a firearms dealer,\" and that persons under the age of 18 cannot purchase rifles or rifles. There is a gap with age restriction, though. Informal sales in the same state create an opportunity for a young adult to buy a gun. According to the ATF Manual, \"a person between 18 and 21 years of age may get a gun from an unauthorized person residing in the same situation.\" They buy it online. In short, people can buy firearms online. Under federal law, the order is the same, whether the person sells a weapon through the table or through the network. The same rules apply. If the seller is involved in the firearms trade, he or she must have a federal licence and submit all sales to check his or her federal background. It is not lawful to sell a weapon to a person who is not allowed to buy a weapon, but not every sale requires a background check that would alert the seller. If there are two people living in the same state and the seller is not involved in the firearms trade (federal rules know what this means), then the gun can move its hands without checking its background. This issue lies at the heart of the drive to verify the global background. As the Government Accountability Office described in a 2017 report, potential arms buyers can shop from \"main retailers, online retailers, auctions and electronic markets, Internet-disaggregated lists, electronic forums and social media networks, and dark websites.\" Most Internet transactions are fully legal, with both parties going through all standard regulatory steps. There were illegal sales on the Internet. In 2010, for example, a former FBI agent was convicted of selling more than 50 firearms on the Internet without a licence. However, with the exception of secret \"dark net\" transactions - operations created to evade the law - the General Audit Office found that even informal vendors follow federal rules. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. On January 12, 2021, arms dealers \"were not willing to sell a firearm to someone who, according to GAO, appears to be banned from possession of a firearm.\" \"They can buy machine guns\" This is highly inaccurate. The machine gun is an entirely automatic weapon, which means one simple move to pull the trigger firing multiple shots. (See our work on how the so-called backward stocks can obscure this distinction.) Under federal law, no one can own or sell a machine gun, with the exception of one: machine guns owned prior to 19 May 1986, which are seriously owned. As the law professor at the University of California Adam Winkler told us, any sale or transfer of an old machine gun requires background checks and a special licence. Winkler called Obama's overwhelming language on this subject, \"irritated.\" \"Several weapons are not for sale only to anyone, including the machine guns to which he refers, as well as grenades, shoulder-fired missiles, etc.,\" said Winkler. Illegal transactions can occur. According to the General Accounting Office, someone sold one of his detectives, \"Ozzie, who the seller said was modified to shoot automatically.\" But Obama was talking about what the law allowed, not whether criminals were capable of breaking the law. People sometimes miss a machine gun, an automatic weapon, for a semi-automatic weapon such as AR-15. For example, Don Lemon of CNN made this mistake while talking about Second Amendment issues in 2014. Our Governor Obama said that in the United States, \"anybody can buy any weapon, at any time without much, if there is any organization. They buy it online. They can buy machine guns.\" To say that anyone can buy a weapon that flies in the face of many kinds of people, from criminals to drug users to couples who cannot buy weapons. Internet sales are legal, as he said, and take place under the same rules that govern sales of other weapons. As for machine guns, they are absolutely illegal, except under the legal controls of the models from 1986 onwards. While taking the elements of his statements together, we often assess this claim as false. Update: At first, we didn't hear from Obama's office, but after publication, Obama's spokesman Eric Schultz sent us links to articles, including one from Polyte Vak, describing how people circumvent firearms laws. But a clear reading of Obama's words, by us and by our firearms legal specialists, is that he described the current laws, not whether people broke them. Our assessment is still mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00574"}
