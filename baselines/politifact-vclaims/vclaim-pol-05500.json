Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly asked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about the reluctance of the shooters\u2019 neighbors to report suspicious activity by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik. They didn't want to be seen as using ethnic profiling.\nChristie said what the neighbors saw had nothing to do with profiling.\n\"These folks had weapons, they knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it,\" Christie said. \"That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.\"\nKelly interjected, \"They didn't know they were going to attack the country.\"\n\"They knew they were talking about attacking people,\" Christie shot back.\nWe looked for any reports of the neighbors saying they had an inkling of any plans for an attack. We didn\u2019t find any. We did find second-hand reports that weren\u2019t well sourced, and these were repeated primarily on right-leaning news websites. \nThis excerpt from the conservative website Daily Caller was typical:\n\"A neighbor of Farook\u2019s mother in Redland \u2014 said that another neighbor told him \"they had I guess been receiving packages \u2014 quite a few packages within a short amount of time, and they were actually doing a lot of work out in the garage.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was kind of suspicious and wanted to report it,\" Elswick explained, \"but she said she didn\u2019t want to profile.\"\nThere were many articles of this sort. All of them sourced back to a local ABC news affiliate broadcast and all of them had pretty much the same details.\nNone of these accounts supports Christie\u2019s assertion.\nFirst, they talk about what the neighbors of Farook\u2019s mother saw, not the neighbors of Farook and Malik themselves. The mother lived in Redlands, not San Bernardino. We should also note that this account comes from a neighbor saying what he learned from another neighbor, not what he saw himself.\nSecond, no one was reported as saying that they thought an attack was being planned.\nSoon after the shooting, the Wall Street Journal reported that neighbors and friends described the couple as \"quiet, religious people who didn\u2019t attract attention or suspicion.\"\nOur ruling\nChristie said that neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters knew that they were talking about attacking the country. The most that was reported is that a neighbor of a neighbor of one of the shooter\u2019s mother said there was suspicious activity. There was no mention that a neighbor of the shooters themselves was suspicious, much less that a neighbor thought an attack was being planned.\nChristie jumbled the details in the news. We rate this statement False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/18d28985-9171-4758-ba6d-6f150b004517", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05500"}
