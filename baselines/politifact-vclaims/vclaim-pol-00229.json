White Catholics are more likely to vote Republican, and Hispanic Catholics \"overwhelmingly back Democrats.\"\u00a0\nRepublican and Democratic Catholics both used to admire Pope Francis, according to Pew, but he\u2019s become an increasingly polarizing figure in the church. Democrats and Democratic-leaning Catholics view him more favorably than Republicans and Republican-leaning Catholics. Republican Catholics are much more likely than Democratic Catholics to say he\u2019s \"too liberal\" and \"naive.\" Most Catholic Democrats say he\u2019s doing an excellent or good job of spreading the Catholic faith.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00229"}
