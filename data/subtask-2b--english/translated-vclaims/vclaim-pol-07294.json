This was addressed by CBS sports broadcaster James Brown in a 90-second dialogue addressed to all men on September 11, before the football game on Thursday night, which accidentally exposed the former Rice team, Baltimore Ravens, against Stellers Pittsburgh. Brown urged men to learn \"what is healthy and respectful manhood\" and \"help or get help, because our silence is deaf and deadly.\" And then he pulled up some interesting statistics. \"Look at this: According to domestic violence experts, more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners,\" Brown said. \"This means that since the night of February 15th in Atlantic City (the night Ray Ray Rice hit the wife now Janie Rice on the elevator) more than 600 women have died.\" This figure is used on several web sites of outreach groups, including Futures without Violence, the Florida Domestic Violence Shelter, the National Network to End Domestic Violence and the Arkansas Coalition against Domestic Violence. Experts say the claim is accurate. While the overall validity of crime statistics can be questioned by the lack of reporting by victims and the mislabelling of the investigating officer, homicide statistics are reliable, according to experts. The largest repository of national crime statistics is the Federal Bureau of Investigation annual consolidated report on crime, which is based on data collected from local law enforcement agencies. Callie Renison is a professor of public affairs at the University of Colorado Denver who analyses crime trends. Rennyson found 3.3 women dying by their intimate partners every day in 2010. For this figure, the number of intimate partner murders was divided with female victims (1,192) by the number of days per year. More than three days per day are alarmingly high, but it also falls from the last rate of 4.2 deaths per day in 1993. Renison did not make a similar calculation for recent years available in 2011 and 2012, but this trend still exists. Marco Rubio stated on 27 January 2021 in his remarks \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders.\" \"So in purely scientific terms, it is dangerous to estimate the number of people killed in domestic violence incidents since February 15,\" said Mary Cos, Professor of Public Health at the University of Arizona. \"Anyway, doing that isn't basically wrong and doing the crime experts it over and over.\" Because the number of male victims in intimate partner murders is much lower, as is the daily average. There were 305 such deaths in 2010, a daily average of 0.84. James Fox, Professor of Criminology at the University of the North-East, data department differently for his own account in intimate partner murders. He's considered unsolved murder cases that are believed to have been involved with intimate partners. Outcome: slightly higher deaths per year. Using its figures, the daily average of female mortality was 3.84 in 2010, 3.61 in 2011 and 3.68 in 2012. Brown could have been more precise by saying \"ex-partners and partners\" than just \"partners,\" but Rainison says that the level of discrimination may be more important to academics. \"In general, when we talk in our field (on the figures of the FBI or the Justice Statistics Office), we talk about the current or former spouse, friend or friend, which may also include same-sex partners.\" The Governor Brown appealed to the National Football Union community and beyond to consider alarming statistics: \"According to domestic violence experts, more than three women lose their lives daily at the hands of their partners.\" He went on to estimate the number of women killed by their partners since the day Rice attacked his wife now in an elevator - a practice that was not scientifically accurate but common practice. As to the number of three deaths on the same day, experts said it was accurate. By some measures, the daily average is actually closer to four deaths. There are some ways that Brown could have been more precise, but it doesn't obscure his point of view. So we assess his claim is correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07294"}
