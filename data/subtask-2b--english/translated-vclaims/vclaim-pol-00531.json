But now he's accused of benefiting from it. On 31 May, at the Facebook site, he was called by the McCreedy opposition in the re-elections, Republican Dan Bishop, for support from dark financial organizations, citing an article from the conservative political press site in Free Washington. It turns out McCreedy got nearly a million dollars in support of Nancy Belusi, allied with the dark money in the 2018 election cycle right after he tweeted, \"The dark money has no place in our policy,\" It says Bishop's article. Polyte Fact North Carolina found this allegation particularly interesting because McCreedy was explicit about his opposition to dark money. When we reached out to his campaign, I issued a statement from McCreedy saying that he believed that \"money was ruining our policy and that we had to assume special interests and the status quo, and that is why if I were elected to Congress I would defend the mandatory disclosure of all donors to the dark groups of money.\" \"The Federal Electoral Code explicitly prohibits candidates from coordinating with a non-profit political organization on their own spending, and the McCready campaign has fully complied with the law,\" stated Amanda Sherman, speaking on behalf of the McCreedy campaign, in an e-mail. Sherman also said that McCreedy had already been endorsed by \"United Citizens Group devoted to reversing the Supreme Court decision.\" Therefore, we have decided to conduct further investigations. Turns out McCreedy's already got support from a dark financial group. As for the connection to Pelosi, the truth is more complicated. What's the dark money? The Centre for Responsive Policy defines dark money as \"political spending intended to influence the voter's decision, where the donor and the source of the money are not disclosed.\" Dark money groups are usually either non-profit political groups that are not required to disclose their donors or major financial groups, which are allowed to accept unlimited contributions from non-profit political actors and other companies that may or may not have disclosed their donors. There are dark financial organizations on both sides of the political spectrum - some examples of 501 (c) non-profit political organizations are family planning and the National Gun Association. \"If you look at the total amount spent on elections, (dark money) is a relatively small part, but when you look at the most contentious race, when you see the dark money playing a big role,\" said Brendan Fisher, Federal Reform Director at the legal center of the campaign. \"Dark money and external money, in general, tend to attract towards the most competitive races.\" In Congress in 2018, the McCready race against the Republican Mark Harris was one of those narrow elections that attracted foreign spending. Did McCreedy get back from the black money? The national majority in the United States of America is the least famous, dark, liberal and non-profit money. We found that, as Bishop said, the group supported McCready in 2018. Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. By Tom Kircher: 29 January 2021, the national majority spent $944,060 on Harris. However, the national majority did not send money directly to the McCready campaign. Instead, she published television spots attacking Harris' campaign for being \"out of step\" with the families of North Carolina and claiming that Harris wanted to cut off social security and medical care. The ads didn't say anything about McCreedy. Anna Masoglia, a researcher at the Centre for Responsive Policy specializing in Dark Money, said that this is a common tactic used by these organizations. \"In many cases, spending on political advertising through dark money is actually more common against a candidate than in one support,\" said Masoglia. \"They don't necessarily use dark money, I wouldn't use that term. I'd say they benefit from dark money whether they like it or not.\" If a dark financial organization decides to use its money against a candidate, there is nothing a campaign can do, as Robin Kolodney said, the professor of political science at Temple University, who specializes in political advisers and campaign financing. \" (The mother majority in the United States of America) is completely independent of the campaign and there is no candidate who can do it to stop spending even if they want,\" said Kolodney. The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that people may exercise freedom of expression whatever they want. Is the major Patriu in the United States allied with Nancy Belusi? The claim that McCreedy was cooperating with Nancy Belusi, president of the Council, was in fact the subject of another fact check by Paulette Vack, based on Harris' claim in 2018. \"It is certain that the national majority is a dark financial group, that they support Democrats, and that they are allied with Democrats,\" said Fisher. \"I don't know if that's enough to say that they're specifically allied with Nancy Pelosi, unless they use Nancy Pelosi as supporters of all Democrats.\" While we know that the national majority in the United States of America spent almost all of its money to support the candidates of the Democratic House, we could not find a record of the national majority's association with the United States of America with Belarus. The McCreedy campaign also received support from the majority association at home - a major association that, according to Masoglia, is not considered to be dark money because it reveals her sponsors. It is well known that the majority of the members of the House of Representatives are allied with Belusi. I raised money for it in 2011, when it first started. In 2018, the majority party spent $340,018 at home against Harris, benefiting from McCready. Our deceiving bishop is right that McCreedy was supported by a dark group of money. The McCready campaign did not take money from the group and could not control the independent expenses of external organizations, but that did not change the fact that the campaign had benefited. While we know that the national majority in the United States is allied with the Democratic Party and spent most of its money on Democrats at home, we have found no evidence that Belusi is allied with the national majority in the United States. While the majority party in Beit Belusi supported the McCreedy campaign by spending money on Harris, it is not a dark financial group because it reveals its donors. It is therefore estimated that Bishop's statement is mostly correct. Update: This story was updated after publication to add McCready's position on changing campaign detection laws. This does not change our judgment. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact Review Project, a partnership from Maclachi Carolina, Duke University Reporter Laboratory and Fact Politics.
