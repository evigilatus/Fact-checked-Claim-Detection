In the January 8 interview - held a few weeks before President Donald Trump and Congressional leaders closed down - Machin said that some residents of West Virginia were concerned about the loss of the flow of federal cheques and legal immigration visas. These comments were preceded by a reference to the popularity of President Donald Trump in his case. \"President Trump has the strongest relative support in our state than any other nation,\" said Manchen. \"He has won West Virginia at about 43 percentage points, and he holds almost 60% approval.\" How supportive is Trump of West Virginia? Let us divide the Manchen Statement into three parts. President Trump has the strongest relative support in our state from any other nation. It is clear that West Virginia is at the top or close to it, but it's hard to tell if it isn't. 1. When we contacted the Director of Communications in Manchen, Jonathan Cot, he said that the Senator referred to the results of the 2016 elections. However, Manchen used this assertion to describe the level of support for Trump in the State, and two years after the 2016 elections, the results of the Tramp elections were no longer an updated measure of its support levels. We have therefore moved on to the state-by-state evaluation by Morning Consulting, the only survey group today that presented the final presidential approval scores in all 50 states while Manchin made his observations. The most recent figures are in December 2018. On September 20, 2018, in an interview with Daily Athenaeum in general approval, \"The press is now classified as Congressional, and this is very low; it's in one place.\" By Mary Alice Troitt, October 29, 2018, according to this measure, West Virginia ranks second. Two in the country, according to the latest report. In December 2018, the approval rate for Trump was 61 per cent in West Virginia, but at a few points less than Wyoming, at 64 per cent. This is within the margin of error in the poll, ranging from one percentage point to five percentage points depending on the size of the State. This means that West Virginia and Wyoming are already the neck and neck in Tramp's approval -- but Alabama and possibly Mississippi (58 per cent and 56 per cent, respectively) can also be the neck and neck with West Virginia. \"He won West Virginia at about 43 percentage points.\" This part of his observation refers to the actual election results in 2016. Trump won 67.85 per cent of the vote in West Virginia in 2016, with Hillary Clinton receiving 26.18 per cent. This is a difference of 41.67 percentage points. So it just came out a little bit. \"He had nearly 60% approval\" Manchen's on target here -- in the December consultation survey, Trump got 61 percent in West Virginia, which means Manchen actually underestimated the figure a little bit. Previous polls were in the same range. In a survey of WVMetro/The Dominion Post in September 2018, 60 percent found approval for Trump, while a survey in October 2018 by WSAZ and Gray Television found 58 percent approval. \"President Trump has the strongest relative support in our state from any other nation state, \" said Governor Manshin. He won West Virginia at about 43 percentage points and had almost 60% approval.\" Manchen is close to the three measurements to support Trump in West Virginia. His main view - that Trump is still popular in the State - remains valid. However, we should note that it is difficult to say that West Virginia is at the forefront of all other States in agreeing to Tramp. Wyoming, Alabama, Mississippi also has high levels of support, and each can reasonably claim to be the most supportive country for Trump. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01086"}
