Pretty big, according to a recent article in WVNews.\nThe article, published March 30, 2019, quoted Nikki Bowmar, a spokeswoman for the West Virginia district office of the U.S. Small Business Administration, saying that \"there are approximately 114,391 small businesses in West Virginia. Cumulatively, these businesses make up 99 percent of the total number of businesses in the state and employ 280,213 people \u2014 nearly 50 percent of the state\u2019s workforce.\"\nLast year, a prominent West Virginia lawmaker, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, garbled a related talking point, saying that small businesses \"make up about 96% of our state's economy.\" PolitiFact rated that statement Mostly False.\nManchin was wrong because he used the term \"the economy,\" which refers to all economic output in the state. While small businesses account for nearly 99 percent of businesses in the state, small businesses only account for about half of employees in West Virginia. The other half of workers, who work for a small number of big companies, produce a disproportionate share of economic output due to their large workforces, economists told us.\nSo did Bowmar get it more accurately? Yes, though the data is a bit old.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we contacted Bowmar, she sent us the same data release that we used when we researched Manchin\u2019s statement -- the Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy\u2019s 2018 Small Business Profile.\nBowmar\u2019s remark in the newspaper lined up with the data in the agency\u2019s profile.\nThe only caveat is that the data was collected in 2015. Small businesses are created and fail all the time, making the numbers somewhat volatile. Still, the data she cited is the most recent available.\nOur ruling\nBowmar said that small businesses in West Virginia make up \"99 percent of the total number of businesses in the state\" and employ \"nearly 50 percent of the state\u2019s workforce.\"\nThat\u2019s correct according to the most recent data from the federal Small Business Administration, though the data is a bit old.
