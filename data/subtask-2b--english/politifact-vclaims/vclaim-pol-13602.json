Scott Walker says an alternative to state employee health and pension changes is bumping 200,000 children out of Medicaid", "text": "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has rocked the state Capitol with a host of proposals that would affect state employees, including requiring them to pay more toward their pensions and health care.\n\nThose two moves, part of a budget repair bill introduced Feb. 14, 2011, would raise nearly $30 million. The Republican-controlled Legislature has the measure on the fastest of tracks, and could approve it in under a week.\n\nRaising $30 million would be a big step toward meeting a $137 million budget shortfall before the 2010-2011 budget year ends June 30, 2011 -- and help reduce a larger gap in the next two-year budget.\n\nIn pitching his proposal for the higher pension and health care payments at a Feb. 11, 2011, news conference, Walker presented a stark picture of the options he has:\n\n\"The alternative in this budget alone, in fiscal year 2011, is to look at 1,500 layoffs of state employees or close to 200,000 children who would be bumped off Medicaid-related programs.\"\n\nAs governor, Walker certainly has the power to lay off state workers.\n\nBut can he remove children from Medicaid, the state-federal program that pays medical bills for low-income individuals and families?\n\nTo back up the statement, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie provided a Feb. 8 memo from the state Department of Health Services. It says spending $30 million over three months provides BadgerCare, a Medicaid program, to 194,539 Wisconsin children. \u00a0\n\nThat supports the numbers. But the memo says nothing about whether the state has the authority to cut kids from the Medicaid program.\n\nWe asked Walker directly whether the state has such power.\n\n\"Well, that\u2019s what the equivalent would be,\" the governor replied. \"That\u2019s just one option. The more immediate one -- if I had to, I don\u2019t want to do any of them -- would be the 1,500 layoffs. But that\u2019s what the equivalent cost is.\"\n\nOK, we understand that removing nearly 200,000 kids from Medicaid would save $30 million over three months, but could the state do that?\n\n\"Again, we just picked out numbers in terms of equivalent dollar amounts,\" Walker said. \"I literally did not even go through the mechanics of that because I\u2019m planning on doing what\u2019s in this bill, not the alternatives.\" \u00a0\n\nWe looked at the mechanics by consulting several experts:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families\n\n\n\nJoan Alker, co-executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families\n\n\n\nKaiser Family Foundation, a national research organization that focuses on health care (memo)\n\n\n\nThe Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau\u2019s memo on Walker\u2019s budget-repair bill\n\n\nThey all agreed: The federal health care reform law that took effect in March 2010 prohibits states, until at least 2019, from changing their Medicaid eligibility requirements for children.\n\nIn other words, states can\u2019t take Medicaid away from kids who are receiving it.\n\nIn fact, if a state did cut kids, it would forgo all federal Medicaid funding, according to a Center for Children and Families memo. That would be significant, as Wisconsin \u00a0spent $6.7 billion last year in federal and state money on Medicaid for children and adults.\n\n\"I think when you\u2019re discussing how to balance your (budget) choices that you ought to make comparisons of actual options,\" Peacock said.\n\nLet\u2019s review.\n\nWalker said that if his proposal for state employees to pay more for their benefits is not adopted, alternatives such as removing nearly 200,000 children from Medicaid would have to be considered. But that\u2019s a phony alternative. Legally, the state does not have the option to remove kids from Medicaid; Walker acknowledged he did not check before making the statement.\n\nWe rate Walker\u2019s statement on Medicaid and kids False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13602"}
