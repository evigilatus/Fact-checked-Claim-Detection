Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2018\n\n\nWhether the new embassy is in a good or bad location is matter of opinion. But Trump was off the mark in putting this deal on the shoulders of the Obama administration. The wheels started turning early in the second term of President George W. Bush, and the deal on a new location was announced Oct. 2, 2008, before Bush left office.\nA push for embassy security\nWith an eye on thwarting terrorist attacks, the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations under Bush aimed to harden America\u2019s diplomatic facilities. The embassy in London dated from 1960 and in 2006, the bureau estimated that it would take $550 million and seven years to improve it, and even then it would not meet security needs.\nIn October 2008, then-Ambassador Robert Tuttle, who led the search for a new site, announced the move to a site on the other side of the Thames River from the old location.\n\"We looked at all our options, including renovation of our current building on Grosvenor Square,\" Tuttle said. \"In the end, we realized that the goal of a modern, secure and environmentally sustainable embassy could best be met by constructing a new facility.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe State Department announced that the United States had signed a preliminary contract for the new location, contingent on the sale of the existing chancery.\nThe budget\nThe project had a budget of $1.02 billion. When the plan was announced, officials said the entire cost would be financed by the sale of three State Department properties in London -- the Navy Annex, the existing chancery, and the Marine Security Guard quarters. \u00a0\nIn 2015, the head of the State Department\u2019s bureau, Lydia Muniz, told lawmakers the building was on time and on budget.\nMoney from the sale of the old embassy (technically, the sale of the 999-year lease the United States held on the property) came in August 2013, during the Obama administration. The final terms were not public, but a BBC report estimated the value at somewhere between \u00a3300 million and \u00a3500 million, or about $400 million to $680 million. A Qatari real estate group bought the lease with plans to turn the property into a hotel.\nOur ruling\nTrump said Obama sold the otherwise fine American embassy in London and relocated at a cost of $1.2 billion.\nActually, the Bush administration put the plan in place after concluding that the existing embassy could not meet security requirements. The cost was about $200 million less than Trump said, $1.02 billion rather than $1.2 billion, and was financed through the sale of the old embassy and two other State Department properties in London.\nWhile he is correct that the sale occurred on Obama\u2019s watch, the wheels were turning and preliminary contracts had been signed earlier.\nTrump\u2019s tweet blows past those key details.
