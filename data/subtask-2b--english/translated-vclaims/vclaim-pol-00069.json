Trump once confirmed that the investigation of former Special Advocate Robert Muller was led by \"Radio Democrats\" and \"Peg Croak Hillary supporters.\" It is now alleged that the whistleblowers' lawyers are \"large Democrats\" who are politically motivated and come out to arrest him. In October 3, Trump tweeted a section of Governor Mark Levin's commentator on Fox News, the host of Sean Hannity's TV show. Levin claimed, without evidence, that the whistleblowers hired \"left lawyers, left-wing companies, and Soros were involved in financing one of them.\" Photo.twitter.com/WALS3cL5ng - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 4 October 2019 \"His accessory to the lawyer of Schommer-Clinton, who happens to be working with a group called Whisterfeller Aid,\" told Levin in the video. And Brittart has a great piece of this. They were founded in 2017 for the purpose of overthrowing the Trump administration.\" We reviewed voter registration information, campaign financing files and the \"Linked In\" features of each of the three reported lawyers who did not respond to the requests for suspension. We found little evidence that they are \"lawyers from the left wing\" working for the \"left wing companies,\" and there is absolutely no evidence that their work is funded by George Soros, the billionaire democratic donor. Who are the counsels for whistleblowers? The whistleblower represents the Compass Rose Law Group, a law firm in Washington focusing on security licensing, federal employment and national security issues. According to a statement, the three lawyers of the company - Andrew P. Bakage, Mark S. Zayed, and A. Charles McColo III - represented the whistleblowers \"from the beginning.\" (Maculov did not sign more recent data) Buckage, lead counsel, is a former intelligence officer and criminal investigator who, according to Washington, was himself a whistleblower while working for the CIA Inspector General. In the meantime, Zedd runs his own national security law firm. :: Makolo is a long-standing government official who recently served as Inspector General of the Intelligence Society, working under the supervision of the Director of National Intelligence from 2011 to 2017. Are they liberals? We checked the public records of Maryland, Virginia and Columbia. At present, Bakai is registered to vote in the capital without political affiliation, Zed is registered in Maryland without political affiliation, and Kalog is registered in Maryland as a Republican. So where did Levin and Trump and the others get the idea that they're left lawyers? Levin did not respond to our requests for comments, but his allegations that whistleblower lawyers tend to be left can largely be attributed to reports from conservative news outlets such as Brettbart and Free Beacon in Washington. On 24 September, Brittbart reported that \"Backage's probability includes work for\" former presidential democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and the current minority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schommer. On January 13, 2021, Jake Taber, in his remarks on CNN Radio, stated that Donald Trump's second presidential accusation was \"the most isolated of the two parties in American history.\" The same outlets also drew attention to the tweets published by Bakaj and Zed over Trump, who mocked him in Trump, questioned his suitability for office, urged those responsible to report the misconduct of the Government and offered lower rates to potential informants. It's true that Cage donated to Baiden. According to his deposit with the Federal Electoral Commission, he gave $100 to the Paiden campaign on 26 April. Brittbart's story ignores the fact that Buckage was a trainee, not an employee of Clinton, Schommer, and Sin, the late Daniel Patrick Moyennehan, according to Linked In. Paige was not employed in his full-time staff, nor was he represented as a lawyer. In response to a related criticism from the new host of Fox, Laura Ingraham, Zed refused the Bakage Twitter exercises. Andrew wrote - when he was 19/20 and in college - he was training in the Senate, Schommer and Clinton. \"Almost 20 years ago\" Zed contributed to the Central Democratic Committee of Montgomery District between 2005 and 2014. In an interview with the hill, Zed said that the donations were silent auction bids he made as a guest at the Committee's spring party. We have not been able to find a record of any individual donations from Makolo. On Twitter, Zed listed a number of times when he represented the conservatives. He twice represented members of the Legislative Council of the Republic in cases relating to the Freedom of Information Act and the National Commission of the Republic. He also represented five CIA reporters in the Benghazi case, and represented the Daily Caler, a provincial publication. Zed wrote, \"The party is trying to discredit the legal team as a liberal opposition.\" \"We are anything else.\" The hill quoted two colleagues of Zedd saying that he was not a politician. As far as we know, Paige has not made any similar general statements. Levin also claimed that the whistleblower aid organization, a non-profit legal group supporting whistleblowers, had been established \"for the purpose of overthrowing the Trump administration.\" Zed and Baj are affiliated to this group, which has established a fund to help pay for whistleblower services. Support for Levin's claim appears to come from Brittbart, who noted that an old version of the group's website says \"our Republic is threatened.\" However, apart from that language that has now been abolished and the fact that the group was founded in 2017, during Trump's presidency, there is no evidence that the group is targeting Trump. When it was created, John Tae's founder explicitly stated that it was \"not a party effort.\" The allegation that Soros is involved is far from being made. An article by Brittbart Soros is mentioned several times, but each alleged link appears to be a billionaire after several degrees of separation from the whistleblower's lawyer. We have not been able to find any reliable evidence linking Soros to whistleblower efforts. The governor Levin said the whistleblower hired left-wing lawyers, left-wing companies, and Soros is involved in someone's financing. A lawyer, Bakage, donated $100 to Joe Biden and worked as an intern at Schommer and Clinton about 20 years ago. None of the lawyers are registered Democrats. Moreover, there is no evidence that their company is leaning to the left or receiving funding from Soros. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong. Correction, November 6: We corrected a simple word in Levin's quote; it now reads \"one\" on all references.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00069"}
