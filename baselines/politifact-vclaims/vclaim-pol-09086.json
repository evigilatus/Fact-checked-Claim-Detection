Bartenders. Even \"house moms.\"\n\n\nWe\u2019ll get to the house moms in a minute.\n\n\n\"FACT,\" the ad says in red letters. The ad said the city\u2019s ordinance would put \"300 Pink Pony employees out of work in this economy.\"\n\n\nA colleague saw the ad in a DeKalb County newspaper and forwarded it to us. The ad included a prior fact check we wrote looking into the Pink Pony\u2019s claim that management has never been cited for a violation of a state law or ordinance. That one was rated True.\n\n\nWe at PolitiFact Georgia are typically digging into technical topics and slogging through long reports; so we virtually danced (with our clothes on) at another opportunity to fact-check a claim by the club. Does the Pink Pony really employ 300 people?\n\n\n\"Three hundred might be a conservative number,\" said Aubrey Villines, an attorney who specializes in First Amendment issues who represents the club.\n\n\nIn May, the Pink Pony filed a lawsuit against the DeKalb County municipality claiming Brookhaven\u2019s ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses would put the club out of business. Specifically, the ordinance would prohibit nude dancing, with or without serving alcohol. The city has said it will not enforce the ordinance until a DeKalb County Superior Court judge rules on its legality.\n\n\nThe lawsuit is serious business, Villines says. The Pink Pony claims Brookhaven would lose $450,000 a year in property and sales taxes, along with license and permit fees. It\u2019s also a big deal for Brookhaven taxpayers, who are paying legal fees associated with the lawsuit.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcernedcitizen4U\n\n\nstated on June 10, 2010 in a video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThurbert Baker kept a teen in jail \"who didn't even commit a felony.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Stirgus \u2022 June 18, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty of news coverage over the years about how the strip club business has made it rain with greenbacks in Atlanta. (See: The Gold Club, Adam \"Pacman\" Jones.) Cab drivers, food delivery workers, they all make money off the Pink Pony, Villines said.\n\n\n\"If we leave that area (of Brookhaven), it will cave under,\" Villines said, stressing that was the main point of the ad.\n\n\nVillines estimated the Pink Pony employs about 200 dancers. Some work there a couple of days a week, he said. Others, he said, work as many as five days a week. There\u2019s the bartending staff, servers, the kitchen crew, security, disc jockeys, the janitorial staff. And, yes, house moms.\n\n\nHouse moms, Villines explained, are women who help dancers if they encounter work-related trouble, such as a flat tire en route to the Pony. Their duties include making sure the dancers don\u2019t drive home under the influence.\n\n\n\"They\u2019re the first line of defense,\" Villines said of house moms.\n\n\nThe Pink Pony, though, wouldn\u2019t show us any proof that they have 300 people on the payroll. They couldn\u2019t reveal that sort of information, Villines said.\n\n\nDeKalb County, though, requires strip club dancers, waitresses, bartenders and bouncers to get an annual license to work at adult entertainment establishments. The dancers pay $300 a year; the other occupations pay $200 a year.\n\n\nAs of July 18, there were 352 men and women licensed to work at the Pink Pony, county records show. The records do not show each employee is currently working there.\n\n\nSo, there are more than 300 people currently licensed to work at the club, which is more than what the Pink Pony claimed in its ad.\n\n\nStill, we don\u2019t know if all of them are regularly working there. Do the majority of the 200 or so dancers work two days a week? Once every two months?\n\n\nThe Pink Pony claim is partially accurate, but it ignores a lot of context that would give a reader a different impression.\n\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09086"}
