We confirmed with online court records that the pages are the same as those in the actual lawsuit. The federal case was brought in New York by Jane Doe, a woman who requested to maintain her anonymity. She alleged the two men raped her during parties hosted by Epstein in the summer of 1994, when she was 13. She also alleged that Trump threatened her and her family with physical harm if she told anyone.\nA lawyer for Trump called the lawsuit at the time \"a complete fabrication.\"\u00a0\nThe woman dropped the lawsuit in November 2016. Two days earlier, she had been expected to appear at a news conference, but it was abruptly canceled; her attorney, Lisa Bloom, said the woman had received threats and was too frightened to appear.\nEpstein was charged in July 2019 with running a sex-trafficking ring involving underage girls. His death in his New York jail cell in August 2019 was ruled a suicide, although the circumstances of his death have been disputed.\nOur ruling\nA recent Facebook post says President Donald Trump was \"exposed for raping a 13-year-old\" in retaliation for law enforcement officers \"killing black people.\"\nA 2016 lawsuit accused Trump, then a candidate for president, of raping a minor, but no evidence was put forth before the case was dropped. There\u2019s also no evidence that the allegation was tied to law enforcement officer-involved deaths of African-Americans. We rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17871"}
