He tweeted that he felt \"better than I did 20 years ago!\"\n\"Feeling really good!\" he tweeted. \"Don\u2019t be afraid of Covid. Don\u2019t let it dominate your life.\"\u00a0\nBut there\u2019s no evidence he said doctors found \"USA\" instead of DNA in his cells. Trump has not said \"DNA\" since Jan. 6, 2020, while chatting with Rush Limbaugh, according to Factba.se, which maintains an archive of Trump\u2019s tweets and transcripts of his interviews and speeches.\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18638"}
