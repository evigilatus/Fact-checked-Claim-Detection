In Springfield, Trump mentioned a 90-year-old Minnesota farmer \"brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his home.\" In Kinston, N.C., Trump told the story of a 21-year-old \"viciously murdered in cold blood, shot point blank by an illegal immigrant with a long and vicious criminal record.\" In Tallahassee, Fla., Trump spoke about a 25-year-old shot dead by a man who had been deported four times and \"had a lengthy criminal record.\"\nWe asked Trump\u2019s campaign for more details, wondering if the thousands of killings referred to specific years or regions. We did not get a response.\nWe decided to look into the statement given the key role immigration has played this election season.\nLack of data\nImmigration experts told us Trump\u2019s statement is so vague it is bound to be true.\nWithout time or geographic parameters, the statement is just as accurate as saying \"thousands of Americans have been killed by men,\" said Charis E. Kubrin, a criminology professor at University of California, Irvine.\nThe challenge in finding concrete numbers is due to a shortfall of data. There is no national database or study tracking how many people have been killed by undocumented immigrants or the nationality of the victims.\nAbout 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants accounted for about 3.5 percent of the total national population in 2014, according to Pew Research Center. Certainly some undocumented immigrants do commit violent crimes.\n\"The rate of murder may be lower or higher than other groups, but when we are talking about people, violent crime is never zero,\" said Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring strict immigration policies. \"By the same token it cannot be thousands every year. But adding up a few years then it has to be in the \u2018thousands.\u2019 There are a lot of murders in America and there are a lot illegal immigrants, so the statement has to be true.\"\nOverall, there are about 16,000 murders and 10,000 drunk driving deaths a year (the drunk driver is the person killed more than 60 percent of the time), Camarota said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch on crime activity\nAt his rallies, Trump portrays a picture of undocumented immigrants as a strong force of violent crime.\nAmong the examples he offers is the fatal shooting of 32-year-old Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier in July 2015. Authorities said her killer was an immigrant in the country illegally who had been ordered deported five times.\nSome killings highlighted by Trump\u2019s campaign involved drunk driving incidents. Others went back more than a decade, according to a McClatchy review.\nMcClatchy found that one of the killings Trump has mentioned dates back to 1990 and involved a man who was not in the country illegally, but a legal refugee originally from Vietnam. The man he shot, a police officer in California, ended up a paraplegic and died of cancer 12 years after being shot, McClatchy reported.\nWhile Trump\u2019s discourse suggests waves of immigrants equals violence, scholars say studies don\u2019t substantiate that message.\nResearch on immigrants and crime finds that immigrants are not more likely than U.S.-born individuals to take part in crime, said Christopher P. Salas-Wright, an assistant professor at Boston University\u2019s School of Social Work.\n\"Again and again, we see evidence that they are not,\" Salas-Wright said. \"In fact, it\u2019s the opposite.\"\nStudies show that for the most part, people who migrate are a self-selecting group who want to better their lives, provide for their families back in their home countries and who don\u2019t want to risk getting in trouble with the law, said Kubrin, the criminology professor at University of California, Irvine.\nThe American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit, analyzed data from the Census\u2019 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of immigrant males between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population in that same age group. (The Census does not specify legal status.)\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Thousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants.\"\nTrump puts no timeframe on his comment, leaving his audience to fill in the blanks. In reality, there is no solid data for homicides committed by people here illegally. His implicit suggestion is that people should fear illegal immigrants more than citizens, and we don't see evidence for that. Research shows immigrants are less likely to engage in criminal behavior than the native-born population.\nHowever, like the legal U.S. population, some of the country's more than 11 million undocumented immigrants have committed murders. Trump\u2019s statement was open-ended enough that we rate it Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d5475563-24db-4e90-8690-4d02c81f5bbf", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03987"}
