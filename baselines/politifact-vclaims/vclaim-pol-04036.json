The group, whose members include Common Cause Wisconsin and an affiliate of One Wisconsin Now, says its priorities include seeking changes in voting rights by the year 2020.\nThe early voting at issue here is more formally known as in-person absentee voting -- that is, casting a ballot in person before election day.\nIn July 2016, in a\u00a0lawsuit involving One Wisconsin Now, a federal judge struck down limits on early voting\u00a0that were approved by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and GOP lawmakers. As a result, cities were allowed to offer early voting in more locations, not just at City Hall. Milwaukee and Madison added satellite locations, but so far, Green Bay and most other communities in Wisconsin have not.\n(On election day, you must vote at the designated polling place near your home. But early in-person voting can be done at any location in your city that offers it.)\nThe Green Bay situation\nThe email featured in The Nation\u2019s article, as well as related emails, were provided to the magazine by the One Wisconsin Now affiliate, which the article said obtained the emails through a public records request. The liberal advocacy group later provided the emails to us.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey show that on Aug. 23, 2016, in the weeks after the court ruling, state Rep. Eric Genrich, D-Green Bay, began asking Green Bay City Clerk Kris Teske what her plan was regarding Green Bay offering early voting.\nHe said he would like to see the city offer multiple satellite locations; UW-Green Bay was not mentioned. Teske said in her first reply: \"I\u2019m very reluctant to have a satellite location for (ballot) security purposes and it is not budgeted for.\"\nTwo days later, more emails were exchanged. Teske told Genrich the city would offer early voting at her office, leading Genrich to ask her again about multiple satellite locations.\nTeske replied: \"I don\u2019t know what else there is to discuss,\" she began, reiterating that she lacks staff and money for satellite voting, and adding: \"There is no reason why anyone can\u2019t either vote in our office, ask for an absentee ballot to be mailed to them, or vote on election day.\"\nGenrich persisted, asking for a meeting with Teske, and he evidently somehow conveyed to Teske that he wanted satellite voting at UW-Green Bay. (Long lines at the UW-Green Bay polling site for Wisconsin\u2019s April 2016 primary election were cited as one reason for opening an early voting site on the campus.)\nTeske's reply, in the\u00a0email featured in The Nation article, was sent the next day, Aug. 26, 2016, to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission. It read:\nI have a state representative who is being very persistent about having an alternate polling location at UWGB. I don\u2019t like the idea at all for many reasons: Staffing, ballot security, budget, etc. He is on the ballot for 25 of our wards.\nI was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party. UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on election day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the Democrats and he is a Democrat. I have spoken with our (mayoral) chief of staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn't going to happen.\nA response came two weeks later, on Sept. 9, 2016, from Nathan Judnic, legal counsel for the Wisconsin Election Commission. He wrote that budget and ballot-security concerns are legitimate reasons for not offering satellite locations. But he also told Teske that if the UW-Green Bay polling site \"is OK for election day, and there is no political advantage then, I\u2019m not sure what the difference is for in-person absentee voting at that same location.\"\nTeske, in turn, told Judnic that if she could open a satellite location, it would not be at UW-Green Bay because the campus is difficult to navigate and therefore students would likely be the only early voters in the city using it.\nA final note on the partisanship part of the claim regarding Teske:\nTeske does not show up in a database of donor to state political candidates. She was appointed city clerk by Green Bay Mayor James Schmitt. The mayor\u2019s position is nonpartisan, but Schmitt backed the controversial move by Walker to strip away most collective bargaining rights from most public employees. And in March 2016 he attended a Donald Trump presidential campaign rally in Green Bay.\nOur rating\nOur Democracy 2020 says Teske refused to allow early voting on the UW-Green Bay campus because she \"was afraid it would help Democrats,\" showing \"outrageous partisan bias.\"\nTeske did express concern about giving an advantage to Democrats because of her belief that the site would be in area with more voters who support Democrats, and because the site was requested by a Democratic state lawmaker.\nBut Teske also cited other reasons for not supporting the campus site for early voting -- including a lack of funding, a concern for ballot security and a concern for a state law that prohibits offering a satellite site that gives an advantage to any political party.\nUltimately, the city decided not to open any satellite sites for early voting for the Nov. 8, 2016 election.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b5e9afbc-0447-4b37-991c-a83a8efdd0b4", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04036"}
