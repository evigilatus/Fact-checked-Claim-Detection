It just might not be as serious.", "text": "There are several diseases that are especially tough on kids.\u00a0\nMeasles, chickenpox and even this year\u2019s most common strain of influenza in Wisconsin target children and can cause serious, even life-threatening complications.\u00a0\nSo the world breathed a sigh of relief when the first reports about children and COVID-19 seemed to show that this novel coronavirus wouldn\u2019t be one of those diseases.\u00a0\nA preliminary report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published April 6, 2020, found that children make up only a small portion of U.S. coronavirus cases thus far and are less likely to become seriously ill.\u00a0\nAs the debate continues about how quickly to relax restrictions and reopen the country, that information has become a key part of the reopen-now argument.\nState Rep. Janel Brandtjen, R-Menomonee Falls, dove into the issue in the comments section of an April 28, 2020 post on her Facebook page that criticized Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, for not opening playgrounds and restrooms at parks.\u00a0\nReplying to a commenter, she wrote, \"In fact, New York is considering opening schools because children don\u2019t seem to be getting this virus.\"\u00a0\nA few days later, though, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared that all schools in the state would be closed for the remainder of the academic year. (Evers made the call weeks earlier that Wisconsin schools would be closed through June.)\nBut is Brandtjen right about the rest of her claim \u2014 that \"children don\u2019t seem to be getting this virus\"?\nThe numbers\nAs of May 21, 2020, the CDC reported that 40,457 of the country\u2019s more than 1 million coronavirus cases occurred in patients 17 and under.\u00a0\nTo be sure, that is a tiny fraction of overall cases, clocking in at just 3% of the 1.2 million cases listed by the CDC. But it\u2019s still more than 40,000 children who have gotten sick with COVID-19, in the official count. Others, of course, may have gotten sick and never been tested.\u00a0\nIn Wisconsin, the same pattern holds: 257 cases have been reported in patients 9 and under, and 695 in patients ages 10-19 (the state Department of Health Services uses different age breakdowns than the CDC).\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two age groups account for just 7% of the state\u2019s total coronavirus cases, and even less for whom the disease turned more serious. Just 32 people under the age of 20 have been hospitalized by the virus, according to the DHS website.\u00a0\nAlthough the numbers are small, they\u2019re there \u2014 and there, too, are the rare cases that have turned fatal. Wisconsin has avoided the death of a child from the virus so far, but nationally, a handful of deaths have occurred in pediatric cases.\u00a0\nSo, children do seem to be getting this virus.\u00a0\nThe nuance\u00a0\nBut what early data and the raw numbers show is that they seem to be contracting it far less, and less seriously, too.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s what Brandtjen pointed to when asked to back up her claim. In a phone call with PolitiFact Wisconsin she said her choice of words in saying that children don\u2019t \"seem\" to be getting the virus acknowledged that nuance.\u00a0\nBrandtjen cited a CDC webpage on kids and coronavirus which notes that children don\u2019t appear to be at higher risk, and most U.S. cases appear in adults.\u00a0\nShe also quoted a Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin news release stating that \"one of the main understandings was that (COVID-19) didn\u2019t affect healthy kids as seriously as adults.\" In the release, the hospital wrote that only a handful of children there tested positive for the virus, and all went home after brief hospitalizations.\u00a0\nThe Children\u2019s release, however, brings up another distinction in the conversation about kids and COVID-19: a new, more serious disease known as Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, or PIMS.\u00a0\nNo kids at Children\u2019s have presented with PIMS symptoms, the release says, and research on the link between PIMS and the coronavirus is still limited. But doctors in New York, which as of May 12 was investigating 102 cases of the syndrome and three deaths, suspect COVID is involved. Though rare and treatable, it\u2019s likely another way the virus is affecting kids.\u00a0\nAnd one more bit of nuance: As schools across the country mull over opening their doors this fall, research is still being done on whether and how much children can spread the virus. The answer could be critical to the discussion of what reopening schools, day care centers and other places where kids gather should look like moving forward.\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nBrandtjen claimed \"Children don\u2019t seem to be getting this virus.\"\nHundreds of kids in Wisconsin, and tens of thousands in the U.S., have fallen ill with COVID-19.\u00a0\nThat said, children do not seem to be contracting the virus as much, or as seriously, as the rest of the population. That\u2019s an important nuance, particularly amid such a contentious debate.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate Brandtjen\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18367"}
