Roy Cooper to hand the gavel to a Republican.\nState law mandates that the governor fill judicial vacancies. And Chief Justice Mark Martin is one of only two Republicans on the bench.\nBut Cooper, a Democrat, announced on Feb. 12 his intention to move Supreme Court justice Cheri Beasley, a Democrat, into the chief justice seat.\nRepublicans immediately criticized the move as partisan, arguing that Cooper should\u2019ve appointed Republican Paul Newby, the senior associate justice, to the chief justice position. Many said it\u2019s a \"tradition\" to appoint the senior associate justice.\nNewby himself criticized the move as \"raw partisan politics.\" NC Senate leader Phil Berger said it\u2019s \"reasonable\" to conclude that Cooper passed over Newby \"because of his party affiliation\" and mentioned the appointment on Feb. 25 when he responded to Cooper\u2019s State of the State address.\nNC GOP chairman Robin Hayes released a statement about the issue, suggesting that previous governors appointed chief justices from across the political aisle as part of a \"tradition.\"\n\"One can only believe the reason Cooper decided to ignore the longstanding, nonpartisan tradition of the Court was purely politics,\" Hayes is quoted saying.\nSeveral media outlets \u2014 including the\u00a0Associated Press,\u00a0WRAL\u00a0and\u00a0WTVD\u00a0\u2014 referred to a \"tradition\" of appointing the senior associate justice in their reporting but didn\u2019t provide a history of the appointments.\nWhen it comes to replacing a chief justice, is there a tradition? Has the governor always appointed the senior associate justice? And has the governor\u2019s pick always been nonpartisan?\nPolitiFact consulted news stories and staff in the N.C. Supreme Court Library to review chief justice appointments dating back 50 years \u2014 finding that, while many chief justices were replaced by the longest-serving associate justice, the appointments were hardly nonpartisan.\nA PARTISAN TRADITION\nPrior to Cooper\u2019s appointment of Beasley, North Carolina\u2019s governors made seven appointments to the chief justice position over the last five decades.\nIn six of the seven cases, the appointees were previously the senior associate justice. The last governor to break tradition? Republican Gov. Jim Martin in 1986, who skipped over a Democrat to appoint a Republican.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, in each of the seven instances since 1969 that the chief justice seat became vacant, the governor appointed a member from his own party. So by calling on Cooper to appoint Newby, Republicans asked Cooper to do something no governor had done in the last 50 years.\nNor have Republican governors passed up opportunities to replace a member of the opposing party with a member of their own. They did so twice since 1986, including as recently as 2014.\nContacted by PolitiFact, Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the NC GOP, said Hayes\u2019 statement was mostly intended to highlight the trend of appointing senior associate justices. Republican governors have had far fewer chances to appoint chief justices from across the aisle because Democrats dominated North Carolina politics for about 100 years, Woodhouse argued.\nTHE TIMELINE\nIn 2014, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory replaced Chief Justice Sarah Parker,\u00a0a Democrat, with Martin (the Republican who just announced his resignation in 2019).\nIn 2006, Democratic Gov. Mike Easley appointed Parker to replace I. Beverly Lake Jr., a Republican. (Lake won his seat as chief justice in the 2000 election)\nIn 1999, Democratic Gov. Jim Hunt appointed Henry Frye, a\u00a0Democrat, as chief justice to replace Burley Mitchell,\u00a0also a Democrat.\nIn 1994, Hunt swapped a Democrat for a Democrat when he appointed Mitchell to replace Chief Justice Jim Exum.\nIn 1986, Republican Gov. Martin appointed\u00a0Republican Rhoda Billings\u00a0to replace Chief Justice Joseph Branch, a Democrat. Cooper\u2019s pick aside, this is the only time in the last 50 years that a governor passed over the senior associate justice. Exum, a Democrat, was the senior associate at the time.\nIn 1979, Hunt appointed Branch (Democrat) to replace Democratic Chief Justice Susie Sharp. (Sharp had gained the seat by beating Republican James M. Newcomb and Labor Party Candidate Stanley Ezrol in the 1974 election.)\nIn 1969, Democratic Gov. Bob Scott replaced Chief Justice R. Hunt Parker, a\u00a0Democrat, with Democrat William Bobbitt.\nPOLITIFACT RULING\nThe NC GOP said that Cooper, by appointing Beasley over Newby, ignored a \"longstanding, nonpartisan tradition.\" This statement suggests that North Carolina\u2019s governors have always replaced an outgoing chief justice by appointing the senior associate justice \u2014even if he or she was a member of a different political party.\nOver the past 50 years, governors picked senior associates on six out of seven occasions. But in every case, they picked someone from their own political party \u2014 often replacing a member of another party. The NC GOP claim has a kernel of truth, but distorts the partisan nature of chief justice appointments over the last 50 years. We rate this claim Mostly False.\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
