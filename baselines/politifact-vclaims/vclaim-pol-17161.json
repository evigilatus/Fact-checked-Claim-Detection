(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe image in this Facebook post is about four years old.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a video still of a postal worker who was \"caught on camera allegedly stealing a Donald Trump campaign sign\" in Townsend, Del., about a week before the 2016 election, according to The News Journal in Wilmington.\nThe newspaper reported that the homeowner who displayed the sign had bought a camera after \"the constant removal of Trump signs\" in recent weeks. The paper also quoted Scott Balfour, a spokesperson for the U.S. Postal Investigation Service.\u00a0\n\"Special agent with the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General responded to this issue as soon as it was brought to our attention,\" Balfour said. \"The individual in the photographs was identified and will be dealt with appropriately by postal management after a thorough review of all the facts.\"\nThe Postal Service did not respond to PolitiFact\u2019s questions about what happened in this incident. A spokesperson for the Office of the Inspector General told Lead Stories, which also looked into this claim, that its investigation was completed but provided no further details.\nStealing a campaign sign from private property is a crime, and penalties vary by jurisdiction.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.
