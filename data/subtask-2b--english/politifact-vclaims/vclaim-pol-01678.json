And he has made it clear he\u2019ll criticize Republican Gov. Scott Walker on infrastructure ahead of the general election.\nThere\u2019s room to criticize Walker on infrastructure, particularly when it comes to roads.\nBut Evers went beyond just roads in making his claim. And he cherry picked a ranking that is too-narrow and not up to date.\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook.

That\u2019s where Evers got his statistic.\n\n\n\n\nTens of millions in tax money directed to a Milwaukee streetcar at the expense of police, schools? Mostly False.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBut again, roads are only one part of infrastructure.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there are at least three more recent rankings on infrastructure \u00a0\u2014 including the current one by U.S. News -- where Wisconsin is in the middle, or even higher:\nU.S. News & World Report: In the magazine\u2019s \"2018 Best States\" report, released in February 2018, Wisconsin ranked 26th overall on infrastructure.\nThat included a ranking of 14th in energy \u00a0\u2014 for electricity price, power grid reliability and renewable energy usage; \u00a041st in internet access \u2014 for broadband access and ultra-fast internet access; and 34th in transportation \u00a0\u2014 for road quality and bridge quality, commute time and public transit usage. (Specifically on road quality, Wisconsin ranked 44th, up a bit from 49th.)\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin is \"49th in the country in internet speed.\" Half True.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nCNBC: The business news TV network said it evaluated road and bridge quality, commute time, the availability of air travel and other factors to rank the states on infrastructure. For 2018, Wisconsin ranked 23rd.\n24/7 Wall Street: The financial news website ranked the states in early August 2018 with an index using the share of bridges, roads and dams that are \"in a state of disrepair or potentially hazardous,\" and it looked at state highway spending per person. On that measure of infrastructure, Wisconsin ranked 15th \u00a0\u2014 as in 15th worst, as this ranking was done differently.\n\n\n\n\nAll our fact checks in the governor\u2019s race.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll also note that the American Society of Civil Engineers rates the nation\u2019s infrastructure in 16 categories, including roads and bridges. Its most recent report, for 2017, gave the nation a grade of D+. That report says that in Wisconsin, \"driving on roads in need of repair\" costs each driver $637 per year and 8.7 percent of the state\u2019s bridges are rated structurally deficient. But the report doesn\u2019t give grades to the states and doesn\u2019t rank the states.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting, with regard to roads, that we rated Mostly False a Walker claim that he had invested $3 billion more in the state\u2019s transportation system than his predecessor did. And our rating was Mostly False when Walker said state road projects \"are staying on track or getting done sooner.\"\nOur rating\nEvers says Wisconsin is \"49th out of 50 states in infrastructure.\"\nHis statement relies on a too-narrow ranking that isn\u2019t current, and it ignores other rankings.\nIn 2017, U.S. News & World Report ranked Wisconsin 49th in road quality \u00a0\u2014 but 39th in overall infrastructure, based not only on roads but bridges, renewable energy usage, broadband access and other factors.\nMoreover, the magazine\u2019s 2018 report ranks Wisconsin 26th in infrastructure. And Wisconsin is well above the bottom, though not great, in two other national rankings.\nWe rate Evers\u2019 statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-08-31 14:23:14 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Another thing that\u2019s a Wisconsin value is infrastructure, whether it\u2019s roads or bridges...we are 49th out of 50 states in infrastructure.\"    Tony Evers Democratic candidate for Wisconsin Governor https://realresistanceradio.com/podcast/8-16-18-the-devils-advocates-extended-coverage/   in a campaign speech Thursday, August 16, 2018 2018-08-16    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01678"}
