But prescription drug prices are a major voter concern. So we wanted to take another look, in case things had changed.\nExperts told us the data remains essentially unchanged. Drug prices are still not going down.\nThe old talking point\nLast spring, Trump\u2019s team pulled this claim from two sources: A 2018 report from the president\u2019s\u00a0 Council of Economic Advisers and data comparing the January 2019 Consumer Price Index for drugs to the January 2018 one. The CPI data suggested a decline in drug prices.\nBut when we spoke to experts, they quickly debunked this position. For one thing, CPI data is imperfect \u2014 it shows list prices, rather than what consumers pay at the pharmacy counter. For another, it only covers drugs sold through retail, which accounts for about three-quarters of all prescriptions. That misses high-priced specialty drugs which are only sold through mail.\nPlus, other metrics showed that drug prices had in fact gone up, although by very little. Last April, for instance, the same CPI data indicated an increase \u2014 between April 2018 and April 2019, drug prices had increased by 0.3%. Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation also suggested an increase in total spending on drug prices that year, even if growth had slowed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s changed?\nToday, prices aren\u2019t going up as fast as they were before, said Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University, who studies drug pricing. But they\u2019re still going up.\u00a0\n\"That probably doesn\u2019t provide the average person with much relief,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s the question of individual list price increases. (List prices are defined as what\u2019s charged before rebates \u2014 a number few people pay, but that dictates negotiations.) The CPI data paints with a broad brush, drug pricing analysts said, obscuring just how many drugs have seen and continue to see their prices go up.\u00a0\nIn 2019, 4,311 prescription drugs experienced a price hike, with the average increase hovering around 21%, according to data compiled by Rx Savings Solutions, a consulting group. Meanwhile, 619 drugs had price dips.\nAnd already in 2020, 2,519 drugs have increased prices. The average hike so far this year is 6.9%. Meanwhile, 70 drugs have had their prices go down. Typically, branded drugs increase their prices early in the year, and generics do so later, said Michael Rea, the CEO of Rx Savings Solutions. When generics post their price increases, the 2020 average price hike will likely go up.\n\"As a broad brush stroke, the story remains the same.\u00a0 Drug prices are going up, not down,\" Rea said.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that in 2018, \"for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs went down.\"\nNothing has changed since our previous rulings on this statement. And the continued drug pricing trend suggests that prices may be stabilizing, but they are not coming down. And consumers are not experiencing that relief.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17336"}
