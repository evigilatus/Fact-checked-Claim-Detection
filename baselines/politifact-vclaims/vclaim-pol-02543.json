They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged, must go to Voter I.D.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2018\n\nTrump disbanded the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity on Jan. 3 and asked the Department of Homeland Security to review its initial findings and determine next courses of action. The commission was plagued by infighting, multiple lawsuits and pushback from many states.\nWe will fact-check whether it was mostly Democratic states that refused to hand over the data.\nMany states wouldn\u2019t provide the data\nIn May 2017, Trump issued an executive order establishing the voter fraud commission headed up by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Trump had made repeated misleading claims about massive voter fraud and election rigging during and after the election. While some instances of voter fraud have occurred, national experts have said fraud is isolated and rare.\nThe commission in June asked state election officials for information that included voters' names, registration status, political party affiliation, voting history, partial Social Security numbers.\nMany of states did agree to provide some data to the commission, although many required that the commission meet certain criteria, such as paying a fee. Still, the commission didn\u2019t get all the data it wanted, even from the states that agreed to comply.\nThe AP found that states that agreed to comply did withhold some details that the commission had sought, such as only releasing information considered public under state law. (Even Kobach said that his state of Kansas couldn\u2019t provide Social Security information because it wasn\u2019t available under state law.)\nAccording to the AP as of Oct. 22, the states that denied the request were: California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and Wyoming. Arizona and Illinois were categorized as undecided.\nThere are several holes in Trump\u2019s argument that is was mostly Democratic states.\nSome states that denied or didn\u2019t comply with the commission\u2019s request ultimately voted for Trump. Arizona, Kentucky, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Wyoming all voted for Trump. That undercuts Trump\u2019s portrayal of Democratic states being the only ones fighting the commission.\nSome states don\u2019t fall neatly into one partisan category. In Illinois, the bipartisan state board of elections sent a letter to the commission raising concerns and seeking more information. Illinois is generally thought of as a blue state and voted for Clinton, but the board that acted on the Trump commission request includes both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

She was the one who officially rejected the commission\u2019s request.\nSome Republican officials rejected or didn\u2019t comply with the commission\u2019s request. This includes Arizona, North Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming. Ed Murray, the Republican secretary of state in Wyoming, said in July, \"I am going to safeguard the privacy of Wyoming\u2019s voters because of my strong belief in a citizen\u2019s right of privacy.\" He said that elections are the responsibility of the states and the request could lead to federal overreach. North Dakota also does not have voter registration and state law forbids the state from releasing details about voters.\nIn Arizona, Republican Secretary of State Michele Reagan called the commission's request a \"hastily organized experiment.\"\nEven the states that agreed to comply didn\u2019t provide everything the commission requested. The AP found that states that agreed to comply still withheld some details the commission had sought and only released information considered public under state law. Even Kobach\u2019s own state, Kansas, didn\u2019t allow for the release of Social Security data.\nFlorida Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Republican, said he would only disclose public records and not Social Security or driver\u2019s license numbers.\n\"We absolutely will not provide any information that is not already publicly available,\" he said in July. \"The responsibility for the accuracy and fairness of our elections process in Florida lies with us, not with the federal government in Washington, D.C.\"\nA final note on the part of Trump\u2019s tweet that said states that didn\u2019t comply did so \"because they know that many people are voting illegally.\"\nPolitiFact has repeatedly found no evidence of widespread national voter fraud.\nWhile we were working on this item the Washington Post\u2019s The Fact Checker published their own analysis and used a different methodology but reached similar conclusions.\nOur ruling\nTrump tweeted that \"mostly Democrat states refused to hand over data.\"\nWhile there are multiple ways to define states as Democratic -- and the White House didn\u2019t explain the definition Trump was using -- he has a point that a variety of predominantly Democratic states were among the states that went the furthest in opposing the commission\u2019s request. They include California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont.\nHowever, six states won by Trump -- Kentucky, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Wyoming and Arizona -- didn\u2019t comply with the commission\u2019s request, and other Republican states complied only in part with the commission\u2019s request.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\n'\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/87a240ca-339c-4827-ad78-e54ac752a506", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02543"}
