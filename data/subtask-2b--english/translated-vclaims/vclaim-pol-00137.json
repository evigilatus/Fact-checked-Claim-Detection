Greg Abbott called for a special legislative session to deal with gun violence in the wake of two mass shootings in the state that left 29 dead. :: Excited legislators held a press conference outside the Texas capital building in early September, including the Republic of Jenna Hinojosa, Doo-Osten, which filed an interesting claim for eligibility for arms licences in the state. \"You can get an effective warrant for your arrest for murder and pass the background check system in Texas,\" said Hinogosa. The staff of Hinogosa said that her claim was correct, as the United States Department of Justice had adopted a new interpretation of \"unfair,\" meaning that the classification referred only to persons wanted by law enforcement who had crossed the United States border. Democratic legislators repeated a similar statement during a hearing in the State Parliament on firearms legislation at the end of September. The claim needs more context. In some cases, a person carrying an actual arrest warrant for a murder may legally pass through the background check and buy a weapon in Texas, but depends on where and how the order is issued. How does background checks on arms purchases work? Before we dive into this fact check, let's explore a back check on a potential arms buyer in Texas. The Federal Act requires licensed arms dealers to conduct background checks on potential buyers who do not have a licence to carry weapons. \u2022 (A permit is required to carry a pistol in public places, but a pistol is not required to be purchased). Private vendors are not obliged to carry out background checks prior to the sale. A person who does not hold a licence and buys a weapon in Texas from a licensed trader must first undergo background checks by providing a photographic identification card and filling out a form issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to determine whether the person falls within any category of persons prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Federal and Texas laws provide that a person cannot buy or possess a firearm if the person has been convicted of a specific felony or misdemeanour related to domestic assault and the person &apos; s release from custody or supervision has occurred during the previous five years. Some people with a history of mental illness are also prohibited from buying a weapon, as is the case for anyone considered to be \"misleader of justice\" - a category that we will explore more deeply later. Texas is not a \"point of contact\" of a state, which means that the FBI is verifying the background of potential buyers in the state. Once an application is filed by a dealer, the FBI has three working days to complete the check. After that period, sales can continue - even if the FBI does not complete its review. The FBI can issue a \"delayed refusal\" later if the agency completes the cheque three days later and finds that a sale has been completed for a person who should have been prevented from buying a weapon. The case is then referred to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is responsible for the recovery of the firearm. What constitutes \"the Horseman of Justice,\" Chelsea O'Hara, Chief of Staff to Hinojosa, said that democracy's statement is correct under the new federal interpretation of the fugitive from justice, a classification that prevents anyone from buying a firearm. Before the shift, someone with an actual arrest warrant for a murder would have fit the definition, but the new explanation changes things. O &apos; hara referred to a news story on change and provided a copy of a letter distributed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation &apos; s Division of the National Immediate System for the Verification of Criminal Background, summarizing the claim. It also shared a copy of the ATF form required of potential buyers to complete it. The form includes the updated definition. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 16 January 2021, the Federal Bureau of Investigation disagreed with the Counter-Terrorism Bureau on who has been a fugitive since at least 2008, according to an audit conducted by the Inspector General's Office in the Ministry of Justice in 2016. Under the original definition of the FBI, an individual carrying a suspended arrest warrant will not be able to buy a weapon. However, the Anti-Terrorism Commission considered a fugitive from justice only to be a person with a pending arrest warrant and thus to leave the State where the order was issued. In 2017, the Ministry of Justice stood side by side with ATF, prompting the FBI to clear the names of tens of thousands of persons wanted by law enforcement agencies from its background check database, according to Washington Post. A bunch of states prevent anyone with an arrest warrant from buying a firearm, but Texas is not one of them. What about people with a warrant for murder? The Federal Bureau of Investigation's original definition of a fugitive included individuals with actual arrest warrants for murder and other charges, which prevented them from buying a weapon. However, under the new definition, the existence of an arrest warrant itself is no longer sufficient to refuse the sale or transfer of a firearm to an individual, according to a statement made by the Division of the National Immediate System for the Verification of Criminal Basic Information of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In other words, a fugitive from the Statute of Justice would not necessarily stop a person carrying an actual arrest warrant for a murder committed in Texas from passing a background check to buy a weapon in the state. However, this person may be suspended by another part of the law. In addition to preventing fugitives or persons recently convicted of certain crimes or offences involving domestic violence from purchasing firearms, the law also prohibits the purchase of firearms for persons who have been effectively ordered to arrest \"indicted to commit an offence punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,\" according to the spokesperson for the Counter-Terrorism Agency Caroline Guatme. This includes murder charges. In general, an arrest warrant may be issued at the discretion of the judge or through an indictment issued by the grand jury, depending on the circumstances of the case. In murder cases, it is common for a judge to order more than a grand jury to remove a suspect from the street and lock him up as soon as possible. Jennifer Zimansky, Public Affairs Officer of Texas Joint Law Enforcement Associations and former investigator at Austin Police Department, said that the investigation team might follow an arrest warrant from a judge if they had \"very strong evidence of a crime and the case appears to be severe.\" She said that investigators might follow an indictment from the grand jury if \"most evidence was not strong and circumstantial,\" but the investigators were confident that they had identified the appropriate suspect. So your basic question is, could someone wanted for murder get into a weapons store in Texas and buy a gun? The answer is yes - if that person's order is issued only by a judge and does not involve an indictment, and if there is no readily available evidence to the FBI or the counter-terrorism office which (the person) somehow sought to avoid, \" David Chipman, a senior policy adviser at the Jefords Law Center and a former special agent at the counter-terrorism office, said. The idea behind this policy is that the individual will not lose his or her ability to obtain firearms until he or she is convicted of a crime, according to John Donohue, a law professor at Stanford University. He said: \"It is certainly true that if there is more (in a person's history) than just an arrest warrant, you may be restricted.\" \"But on his face, the statement says if you in Texas buy a gun with an arrest warrant as a resident in Texas, you're probably fine. For me, that sounds completely ridiculous. But that's the law.\" Our verdict, Hinogosa, said, \"You can get an effective arrest warrant for murder and pass a legal background check in Texas.\" The claim of Hinogosa requires further context. It is true that certain persons with actual arrest warrants for murder can legally check the background in Texas and buy a weapon, but only if it is issued before the indictment and if it originates in Texas. If an arrest warrant is issued for murder as a result of an indictment or in another State, the person cannot cross-check his or her background. We're mostly assessing this claim right. It is almost true that the statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00137"}
