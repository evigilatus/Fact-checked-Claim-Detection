Cantor\u2019s staff told us the information came from a report, published by the National Association of State Budget Officers last fall, that tallied where states get and spend their money.\n\nThe study found that states planned to spend a total $1.7 trillion in fiscal 2012. Of the sum, 39.8 percent would come from general fund moneys that are collected through statewide taxes, 31.2 percent from federal grants and the remaining 29 percent from other state funds and bonds.\n\nMedicaid, which provides health care for the poor, was expected to be the most expensive item in the collective state budgets. States were projected to spend $406 billion on the service, or 23.9 percent of their total budgets. Elementary and secondary education came in second, drawing $336 billion, or 19.8 percent of total expenses.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch to these figures: The federal government provides states with about 56 percent of what they spend on Medicaid, according to NASBO report. So Cantor is including as state expenses about $228 billion that Uncle Sam sends to the states for Medicaid.\n\nThe picture changes if we simply examine the portions of Medicaid and public education that states pay out of their general funds. Public schools rise to the top of the expense list, drawing an expected $235 billion last fiscal year, or 34.7 percent of all general fund spending. Medicaid falls to a distant No. 2, receiving an estimated $133 billion, or 19.6 percent of general fund outlays.\n\nExperts we spoke to didn\u2019t express a preference for one accounting method or the other.\n\n\"We include both methods in our report,\" said Stacy Mazer, senior staff associate at NASBO. \"One reason we\u2019ve been using total funds is that some states define their funds differently. And one of the other issues is that even though it\u2019s not all your money, you\u2019re still administering it.\"\n\nTracy Gordon, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said most health care industry analysts use a total figure cited by Cantor, but note that it includes federal dollars.\n\nArturo Perez, a fiscal analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures, said his organization tracks states\u2019 general fund spending and considers K-12 education to be the greatest recipient of state money.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCantor said states are spending more on Medicaid than on education. His statement is correct, although it should be noted that a substantial portion of the dollars states are spending on Medicaid come from the federal government.\n\nWe rate Cantor\u2019s statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09694"}
