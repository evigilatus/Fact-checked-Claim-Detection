In it, Obama sought to warn Americans about the\u00a0perils of economic inequality.\n\nHere\u2019s what he said:\n\n\"Today, the wealthiest Americans are paying the lowest taxes in over half a century. This isn\u2019t like in the early \u201850s, when the top tax rate was over 90 percent. This isn\u2019t even like the early \u201880s, when the top tax rate was about 70 percent. Under President Clinton, the top rate was only about 39 percent,\" he said. \"Today, thanks to loopholes and shelters, a quarter of all millionaires now pay lower tax rates than millions of you, millions of middle-class families. Some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent. One percent.\"\n\nSeveral readers urged us to check Obama\u2019s claim that \"some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent.\"\n\nBefore we can begin answering this question, we\u2019ll need to define \"billionaire.\" It means someone whose wealth is worth $1 billion or more. In 2010, there were slightly more than 400 billionaires in the U.S., according to the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans.\n\nFewer Americans have income of more than $1 billion. Every year, the Internal Revenue Service releases aggregated income and tax data on the 400 filers who had the highest incomes that year. In the most recently released data, covering 2008, to be included required an adjusted gross income of least $110 million. A back-of-the-envelope estimate suggests that somewhere between zero and 100 people had an income of at least $1 billion in 2008.\n\nSo the first thing to point out is that we are talking about a very small pool of people. And one of the consequences of having a very small pool of people to study is that data is scarce. This is especially true given that privacy rules carefully shield income and tax data for individuals from public scrutiny.\n\n\"I don't know of any data that address the question,\" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.\n\nBut we gave it our best shot.\n\nWhen it comes to individuals with wealth of $1 billion or more, you really can\u2019t draw any conclusions at all. Any estimate of how much a Forbes 400 member pays in taxes is pure speculation. And while there\u2019s undoubtedly some overlap between the Forbes and IRS lists, they're not a match.\n\nSo we\u2019re left with the IRS list. (And we're assuming that the White House was not sifting through the IRS data behind the list, since doing so would be illegal.) But the list doesn't really back up Obama\u2019s point.\n\n\u2022 As we indicated, inclusion on the IRS 400 list doesn\u2019t mean you are a billionaire. It means you had an adjusted gross income of least $110 million. The actual number of billionaires on the list is unknowable. It's not possible to say with certainty even how many of them had income of $1 billion or more or how many might have incomes of less than $1 billion but wealth that would put them in the billionaires' club.\n\n\u2022 The IRS data hints at -- but doesn\u2019t confirm -- that some of the 400 tax filers had effective tax rates of 1 percent. (An effective tax rate is not the official tax rate on the books but rather your tax bill measured as a percentage of your total income before deductions, exclusions, exemptions and credits.)\n\nThe IRS offers a breakdown of what the 400 top earners paid in effective tax rates:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 percent to 10 percent: 30 filers\n10 percent to 15 percent: 101 filers\n15 percent to 20 percent: 112 filers\n20 percent to 25 percent: 52 filers\n25 percent to 30 percent: 46 filers\n30 percent to 35 percent: 59 filers\n\nSo 30 of the top 400 filers paid an effective tax rate of between zero and 10 percent.\n\nHow\u00a0many of those paid 1 percent? We have no way of knowing. If the percentages are distributed roughly equally across the range provided, it would mean three to five tax filers paid an effective tax rate of 1 percent or less. But it\u00a0could easily be zero filers paying that little. We simply don\u2019t know -- and we also have no idea whether these filers\u00a0are actually\u00a0billionaires.\n\nWe also tried to extrapolate by looking at a different data set, from Williams\u2019 group. The Tax Policy Center tracks which Americans have zero liability for the federal individual income tax. It found that of 433,000\u00a0tax filers with incomes of at least $1 million, 7,000 of those -- or 1.6 percent -- paid no federal income tax.\n\nBut this data doesn\u2019t help much, either. First, the cutoff is $1 million in income; the data are silent on how many of those people have $1 billion in wealth. And second, this only covers the federal income tax; the 7,000 people in question might be liable for enough other kinds of federal taxes to rise above a 1 percent effective tax rate.\n\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker, Glenn Kessler, reported that the White House offered as backup \"a clip of a conversation on Bloomberg TV, in which correspondent Gigi Stone made this assertion during a discussion about the tax strategies that the very wealthy use to avoid paying taxes. The TV clip was promoted by the left-leaning website Think Progress. Stone quoted froma Bloomberg News article last month that reported on such tax strategies, which mostly involve complicated ways to defer paying capital gains taxes. But the article never made the 1 percent claim. It also noted that the IRS had gotten more hostile to such transactions in recent years.\"\n\nWe watched the clip and read the article and agree with the Fact Checker that the material isn\u2019t strong enough to\u00a0support Obama\u2019s claim.\n\nStone cited the now-famous example of billionaire Warren Buffett paying a lower effective tax rate, 17 percent, than his secretary. \"The real figure for billionaires,\" she continued, \"is often a lot smaller than that. Sometimes they even have a tax rate as low as 1 percent. That\u2019s because they derive the bulk of their income from stock appreciation, and they use complicated strategies -- some of them -- to make sure that some of those gains don\u2019t get classified as taxable income.\"\n\nStone cited the IRS 400 study in her report, and she has a point that tax rates for those very rich filers \"is often a lot\u00a0smaller\" than Buffett\u2019s 17 percent rate. At least 131 of the 400 had a lower rate than Buffett, according to the IRS. Her next comment -- \"sometimes they even have a tax rate as low as 1 percent\" -- is less certain.\n\nFinally, we were unable to get any additional backup from the White House for the figure Obama used.\n\nOur ruling\n\nStone\u2019s remark that \"sometimes (billionaires) even have a tax rate as low as 1 percent\" may be an acceptable shorthand for cable television chatter, but as a linchpin statistic in a major policy address by the president, the claim falls short.\n\nThe best publicly available data, the IRS 400, suggests that it\u2019s possible that some billionaires pay an effective tax\u00a0rate of 1 percent or less. But this data doesn\u2019t confirm it. In addition, the IRS 400 is made up primarily of people with less than $1 billion in annual income, and provides no information about whether a tax filer on the list has $1 billion in wealth.\n\nDespite this, Obama made it sound like a certainty\u00a0 that \"some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent.\" He would have been on safe ground if he\u2019d noted that more than half the filers on the IRS 400 list had an effective tax rate of 20 percent or less. Obama did not have to gild the lily with a statistic this weak. If he wasn\u2019t able to back it up with hard statistics, he shouldn't have said it.\n\nBecause of that same uncertainty, we can't rule out that there isn't a billionaire out there who has a tax rate as low as 1 percent, but we haven't been able to find any evidence that there is. If the White House or anyone else produces evidence that it's true, we'd be open to changing our ruling, but based on what we know, we rule it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11969"}
