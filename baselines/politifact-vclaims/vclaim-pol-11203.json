First came women, then Hispanics, and now youth.\n\nOne of its claims got our attention: \"The youth unemployment rate is double the unemployment rate for all Americans.\" The graphic goes on to say that the unemployment rate is 8.2 percent overall and 16.4 percent for youth.\n\nWhen we looked at data compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that these numbers referred to the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for Americans 16 years and older (the category the graphic calls \"all\") and ages 16 to 24 (the category it calls \"youth\").\n\nWe confirmed that those numbers are correct. However, we wondered the 2-to-1 ratio was unique to Obama.\n\nIt\u2019s not. Not by a long shot.\n\nWe downloaded historical BLS unemployment rate data for the two age ranges, then divided the \"all\" number by the \"youth\" number. Going back to January 2001, the month President George W. Bush took office, the ratio of the two unemployment rates has been remarkably consistent.\n\nOver that 135-month period, the ratio has barely budged, ranging only from 1.9 to 2.4. That\u2019s essentially the same 2-to-1 ratio that the Romney graphic used to criticize Obama\u2019s record on youth jobs.\n\nIn other words, the two statistics essentially move in lockstep, regardless of whether the broader job market is in a period of modest growth, general stability or precipitous decline.\n\nIn fact, if you average together all the monthly ratios under Obama, it\u2019s lower than it was under Bush. The average ratio under Obama was 1.9, compared to 2.2 under Bush.\n\nWhile it\u2019s accurate to say the two unemployment figures are in a 2-to-1 ratio today, \"it\u2019s a meaningless, or perhaps misleading, statistic for people who are unaware that the youth unemployment rate is always well above the unemployment rate of people 25 and older,\" said Gary Burtless, a labor and employment economist at the Brookings Institution. (Burtless contributed $750 to Obama\u2019s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)\n\nRomney does have a point that younger Americans are suffering during the current recession.\n\nWe found that in January 2008 -- a year before Obama took office and right after the most recent recession began -- the unemployment rate for Americans 16 to 24 years of age was 11.7 percent. By January 2009, that had surged to 14.9 percent, and it surged again by January 2010 to 18.7 percent. By January 2011, it had begun to recover, dropping to 17.9 percent and falling again by January 2012 to 16.0 percent.\n\nSo the unemployment rate has recovered from its high point under Obama, but it\u2019s still significantly above its pre-recession level.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRomney has a point that young Americans are hurting in today\u2019s job market. There\u2019s no question that employment prospects have dried up for many recent high-school and college graduates. But bolstering this argument by making the claim that the \"youth unemployment rate is double the unemployment rate for all Americans\" is silly, since that's consistently been the case under both President George W. Bush and Obama. We rate the claim Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
