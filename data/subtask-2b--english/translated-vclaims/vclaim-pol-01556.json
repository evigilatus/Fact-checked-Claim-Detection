Now they're discussing another kind of red fear: socialism. Bill Nelson and Andrew Guillaume. They're socialists, Goff. Rick Scott said in the Titusville event of his campaign in the United States Senate. Scott explained his comments more in an interview with Florida today. \"They want a large and socialist government,\" said Scott. \"Both in high taxes. Gillum said he'd raise corporate taxes by 40%. Nelson said if the Democrats were to control him, he'd come back and raise taxes. They do not believe that the tax cuts we made this year are good for our mandate. If you look at their programs, they just want the government to run everything.\" \"Scott tied the couple up as offering a liberal, extreme, and extremely dangerous direction to our country and our country.\" We have already assessed a claim by the opponent of Gilom Ron Desantes that Gilom has a \"left socialist platform\" similar to Venezuela as false. Scott Nelson's characterization as a socialist is a misguided tactic of red fear - a tactic from the Republican Playbook at this session after the first sudden democratic victory in Alexandria-Cortez, Democratic Socialist, in New York. A political call in Florida is a socialist punch group because some voters of Spanish origin, a demographic battle zone, have fled socialist regimes. What's a socialist in Nelson's record? Nelson praised Gillum, and he might get a boost in his enthusiasm for the voters. However, Gillum does not share his liberal positions. In a press release, Scott's campaign said that Nelson called Gilom's support for higher taxes, government-run health care and the abolition of ICE \"the main route.\" The campaign was linked to an article from the Miami Herald newspaper that did not raise these points. \"The article said that Nelson and Gillum represent two different camps for the Florida Democratic Party.\" Nelson said that Gillum &apos; s policies were not too progressive for Florida, but did not specifically refer to tax lifting, government-run health care or the abolition of the health information system. Here's what Nelson said about the Gillum platform: \"You call it on the left,\" Nelson told journalists. \"You look at his attitudes, they're from the mainstream: promoting education, paying teachers' wages, cleaning the environment. Check all the cases and I think this is where Floridans live.\" In an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board, Nelson showed that he did not share all Gilom's views. On January 13, 2021, Jake Taber, in statements broadcast by CNN, stated that Donald Trump's second presidential charge was \"more isolated between the two parties in American history.\" By Louis Jacobson on January 13, 2021, Nelson said that he did not want to repeal immigration and naturalization law. When Nelson was asked about medical care for all, he did not show interest. \"I've got enough trouble just trying to save Obama's care,\" said Nelson. \"I'm to the results.\" Although it does not check the reality, Scott's campaign also said that Nelson voted \"more than 300 times to raise taxes\" - which we miscalculated. The silence of the number is exacerbated by the inclusion of non-binding budgetary decisions and multiple votes on the same legislation. The list neglects that Nelson sometimes voted for lower taxes. Nelson was critical of the 2017 tax bill, but that does not mean that he wants to raise taxes in general. The bill had not done enough to help the middle class and he supported the reversal of some reductions that benefited the rich. According to Scott's campaign, Nelson \"infiltrated Obama's plan to please Cuban dictators and stumbled with Assad and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\" However, Nelson repeatedly criticized Ch\u00e1vez in 2004 and 2005, describing him as a \"serious threat.\" While Nelson agreed to Obama &apos; s decision to normalize relations with Cuba in 2014, Nelson Castro was criticized. (We verified a similar attack by a group of the General Democratic Party about Nelson's statements about Chavez and the Castro brothers and assessed him on fire.) Experts said that socialist naming did not apply to socialism Nelson when the Government owned (or at least controlled) the means of production. Nelson did not ask for the government to take over the business. \"The allegation that Nelson socialist is silly,\" said Philip J. Williams, professor at the Centre for Latin American Studies at the University of Florida. \"And his opposition to the draft law on tax reduction and in support of the expansion of the Medicaid programme are key democratic positions. (Even some Republican conservatives supported Medicaid expansion, including John Cassich.) While some may describe medical care or assistance as socialist, because the Government provides health insurance to citizens, the health industry remains in the hands of the private sector, as stated by Sean D. Erlich, Professor of Political Science at Florida State University. \"The government does not control the production of health care,\" said Erlich, \"they only organize certain elements and pay suppliers and consumers their own health care costs.\" Professor Merrick Blufield, an expert on politics in Latin America and comparative policy, from the University of Miami, said that Nelson's policy proposals were conservative according to the standards of other rich liberal democracies enjoying public and global health care. The Scott of Governor Nelson's description as \"social\" is an inaccurate tactic of red fear. The definition of socialism is government appropriation of production, and Nelson did not call for it. Scott's campaign referred to Nelson's support for Guillaume, a democracy running to Nelson's left in the Governor's race. While Nelson was excited about Gillum, they weren't planning on all the cases. Gillum called for the elimination of the system of information and medical care for all, and Nelson said he didn't agree. The criticism by Nelson of the Republican Tax Bill does not apply to the call for generally higher taxes. Supporting the expansion of Medicaid is not like advocating for government-run health care. We're assessing this pants claim on fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c29b29f8-a1ed-4504-af6d-47d6026f8e8", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01556"}
