1	Bernie Sanders	When the Congress was debating whether or not we go into a war in Iraq, invade Iraq, I got up on the floor of the House and I said that would be a disaster, it would lead to unprecedented levels of chaos in the region.
2	Bernie Sanders	And I’d not only voted against the wall, I help lead the effort against that wall.
3	Bernie Sanders	Just last year, I helped for the first time in the modern history of this country, pass a War Powers Act Resolution, working with a conservative Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, which said that the war in Yemen, led by Saudi Arabia was unconstitutional because Congress had not authorized it.
4	Bernie Sanders	We got a majority vote in the Senate.
5	Bernie Sanders	We got a majority vote in the House.
6	Bernie Sanders	Unfortunately, Bush vetoed that and that horrific war continues.
7	Bernie Sanders	I am able to work with Republicans.
8	Bernie Sanders	I am able to bring people together, to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table, not through military efforts.
9	Wolf Blitzer	Vice President Biden, you talk a lot about your experience, but some of your competitors have taken issue with that experience, questioning your judgment in voting to authorize the Iraq war.
10	Wolf Blitzer	Why are you the best prepared person in this stage to be Commander in Chief?
11	Joe Biden	I said 13 years ago, it was a mistake to give the President the authority to go to war, if in fact he couldn’t get inspectors into Iraq to stop what thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon.
12	Joe Biden	It was a mistake and I acknowledged that.
13	Joe Biden	But the man who also argued against that war, Barack Obama picked me to be his Vice President and once we were elected President, and Vice President, he turned to me and asked me to end that war.
14	Joe Biden	I know what it’s like to send a son or daughter and like our colleague has gone to war in Afghanistan, my son for a year in Iraq and that’s why I do it very, very reluctantly.
15	Joe Biden	That’s why I led the effort as you know, Wolf against surging tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan.
16	Joe Biden	We should not send anyone anywhere unless the overwhelming vital interest of United States are at stake.
17	Joe Biden	They were not at stake there.
18	Joe Biden	They were not at stake in Iraq and it was a mistaken vote.
19	Joe Biden	But I think my record overall on every other thing we’ve done has been… I’m prepared to compare it to anybody’s on this stage.
20	Wolf Blitzer	Senator Sanders, you have been attacking Vice President Biden’s vote on the Iraq war, but you recently acknowledged that your vote to authorize the war in Afghanistan was also a mistake.
21	Wolf Blitzer	So you’ve both acknowledged mistakes.
22	Wolf Blitzer	Why should the American people trust your judgment more?
23	Bernie Sanders	Well, it’s a little bit of a difference on that particular vote, every single member of the House, including myself voted for it, only Barbara Lee voted against it.
24	Bernie Sanders	But what I understood from right away in terms of the war in Iraq, the difference here is that the war in Iraq turned out to be the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country.
25	Bernie Sanders	As Joe well knows, we lost 4,500 brave troops, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died.
26	Bernie Sanders	We have spent trillions of dollars on that endless war, money which should go into healthcare and education and infrastructure in this country.
27	Bernie Sanders	Joe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and Rumsfeld had to say.
28	Bernie Sanders	I thought they were lying.
29	Bernie Sanders	I didn’t believe them for a moment, I took to the floor I did everything I could to prevent that war.
30	Bernie Sanders	Joe saw it differently.
31	Wolf Blitzer	Vice President Biden.
32	Joe Biden	I was asked to bring 156,000 troops home from that war, which I did.
33	Joe Biden	I led that effort.
34	Joe Biden	It was a mistake to trust that they weren’t going to go to war.
35	Joe Biden	They said they were not going to go to war.
36	Joe Biden	They said they were just going to get inspectors in.
37	Joe Biden	The world, in fact voted to send inspectors in and they still went to war.
38	Joe Biden	From that point on, I was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake and from that point on, I moved to bring those troops home.
39	Wolf Blitzer	Senator Klobuchar, you’ve publicly questioned Mayor Buttigieg’s experience when it comes to being Commander in Chief.
40	Wolf Blitzer	Why is your time as a US Senator more valuable than his time as a US Naval intelligence officer in Afghanistan and as mayor?
41	Amy Klobuchar	Thank you Wolf, and I’ve been very clear that I respect the mayor’s experience very much in the military.
42	Amy Klobuchar	I just have different experience.
43	Amy Klobuchar	I’ve been in the US Senate for over 12 years and I think what you want in a President is someone who has dealt with these life and death issues and who has made decisions.
44	Amy Klobuchar	I will look at my position on the Iraq war first.
45	Amy Klobuchar	I wasn’t in the Senate for that vote, but I opposed that war from the very beginning.
46	Amy Klobuchar	In my first campaign for Senate, I ran against a Republican who ran ads against me on it, but I stood my ground.
47	Amy Klobuchar	When I got to the Senate, I pushed to bring our troops home.
48	Amy Klobuchar	Then I have dealt with every issue from Afghanistan, to keeping our troops with good healthcare, after what we saw with Walter Reed and being part of an effort to improve the situation for our troops in a very big way with their education and with their jobs and also with their healthcare.
49	Amy Klobuchar	I think right now what we should be talking about though, Wolfe, is what is happening right now with Donald Trump.
50	Amy Klobuchar	Donald Trump is taking us pell-mell toward another war.
51	Amy Klobuchar	We have a very important resolution.
52	Amy Klobuchar	We just found out today the four Republicans are joining Democrats to go to him and say, “You must have an authorization of military force if you’re going to go to war with Iran.” That is so important because we have a situation where he got us out of the Iranian nuclear agreement, something I on for a significant period of time.
53	Amy Klobuchar	As President, I will get us back into that agreement.
54	Amy Klobuchar	I will take an oath to protect and defend our constitution and I will mean it.
55	Wolf Blitzer	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
56	Wolf Blitzer	We are going to continue talking about who’s best prepared to be Commander in Chief Mayor Buttigieg.
57	Pete Buttigieg	Well, I bring a different perspective.
58	Pete Buttigieg	There are enlisted people that I served with, barely old enough to remember those votes on the authorization after 9-11, on the war in Iraq, and there are people now old enough to enlist who were not alive for some of those debates.
59	Pete Buttigieg	The next President is going to be confronted with national security challenges, different in scope and in kind from anything we’ve seen before.
60	Pete Buttigieg	Not just conventional military challenges, not just stateless terrorism, but cybersecurity challenges, climate security challenges, foreign interference in our elections.
61	Pete Buttigieg	It’s going to take a view to the future, as well as the readiness, to learn from the lessons of the past and for me, those lessons of the past are personal.
62	Wolf Blitzer	Senator Warren and our new CNN Des Moines Register poll, almost a third of your supporters say your ability to lead the military is more of a weakness than a strength of yours.
63	Wolf Blitzer	Why are you best prepared to be Commander in Chief?
64	E. Warren	I believe the principal job of the Commander in Chief is to keep America safe and I think that’s about judgment.
65	E. Warren	I think it starts with knowing our military.
66	E. Warren	I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
67	E. Warren	I work with our generals, with our military leaders, with our intelligence, but I also visit our troops.
68	E. Warren	I visit our troops around the world.
69	E. Warren	I’ve been to Afghanistan, to Iraq, to Jordan, to South Korea.
70	E. Warren	I’ve been to lots of places to talk with our troops.
71	E. Warren	And I fight for our troops to make sure that they get their pay, that they get the housing and medical benefits that they’ve been promised, that they don’t get cheated by giant financial institutions.
72	E. Warren	I have three brothers who are in the military and I know how much our military families sacrifice, but I also know that we have to think about our defense in very different ways.
73	E. Warren	We have to think about cyber.
74	E. Warren	We have to think about climate.
75	E. Warren	We also have to think about how we spend money.
76	E. Warren	We have a problem with a revolving door in Washington, between the defense industry and the Department of Defense and the Pentagon.
77	E. Warren	That is corruption, pure and simple.
78	E. Warren	We need to block that revolving door and we need to cut our defense budget.
79	E. Warren	We need to depend on all of our tools, diplomatic, economic, working with our allies and not let the defense industry call the shots.
80	Wolf Blitzer	Mr. Steyer, you worked in finance for decades and have never held elected office.
81	Wolf Blitzer	Why should voters believe you have the experience or judgment to serve as Commander in Chief?
82	Tom Steyer	I worked internationally around the world for decades.
83	Tom Steyer	I traveled, I met with governments, I met with business, and I understand how America interacts with other countries.
84	Tom Steyer	And you asked what is the reason that the experience really counts?
85	Tom Steyer	And to me, I believe that Senator Warren made a great point.
86	Tom Steyer	It isn’t so much about experience, it’s about judgment.
87	Tom Steyer	If you’ve been listening to this, what we are hearing is 20 years of mistakes by the American government in the Middle East, of failure, of mistakes.
88	Tom Steyer	So the real question is judgment.
89	Tom Steyer	And if you look who had the judgment, it was a State Senator from Illinois with no experience named Barack Obama who opposed the war.
90	Tom Steyer	It is a Congress woman, Barbara Lee from Oakland, California, who stood up against the original vote, who was the only person in Congress.
91	Tom Steyer	So I would say to you this, an outside perspective looking at this and actually dealing with the problems as they are is what we’re looking for now.
92	Tom Steyer	I agree with Senator Warren, we are spending dramatically too much money on defense.
93	Tom Steyer	The money that we’re spending there, we could spend in the other parts of the budget and it’s time for someone from the outside to have a strategic view about what we’re trying to do and how to do it.
94	Wolf Blitzer	Senator Sanders, in the wake of the Iran crisis, Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei has again called for all US troops to be pulled out of the Middle East, something you’ve called for as well.
95	Wolf Blitzer	Yet when American troops last left Iraq, ISIS emerged and spread terror across the Middle East and indeed around the world.
96	Wolf Blitzer	How would you prevent that from happening again?
97	Bernie Sanders	Okay, let me tell you, but before I tell you that, let me tell you something else.
98	Bernie Sanders	And that is, and I don’t know if my colleagues here will agree with me or not, maybe they will.
99	Bernie Sanders	But what we have to face as a nation is that the two great foreign policy disasters of our lifetimes are the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq, both of those wars were based on lies.
100	Bernie Sanders	And right now what I fear very much is we have a President who is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in Iraq.
101	Bernie Sanders	To answer your question, what we need to do is have an international coalition.
102	Bernie Sanders	We cannot keep acting unilaterally.
103	Bernie Sanders	As you know, the nuclear deal with Iran was worked on with a number of our allies.
104	Bernie Sanders	We have got to undo what Trump did, bring that coalition together and make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.
105	Wolf Blitzer	Vice President Biden.
106	Joe Biden	I was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with Iran, bringing together the rest of the world and including some of the folks who aren’t friendly to us and it was working.
107	Joe Biden	It was working, it was being held tightly.
108	Joe Biden	There was no movement on the part of the Iranian government to get closer to a nuclear weapon.
109	Joe Biden	And look what’s happened, he went ahead and it was predictable from the day he pulled out of the agreement, Trump, what exactly would happened.
110	Joe Biden	We’re now isolated.
111	Joe Biden	We’re in a situation where our allies in Europe are making a comparison between the United States and Iran, saying both ought to stand down, making a moral equivalence.
112	Joe Biden	We have lost our standing in the region, we have lost the support of our allies.
113	Joe Biden	The next President has to be able to pull those folks back together, re-establish our alliances and insist that Iran go back into the agreement, which I believe with the pressure applied as we put on before we can get done.
114	Wolf Blitzer	So just to be clear, Vice President Biden, would you leave troops in the Middle East or would you pull them out?
115	Joe Biden	I would leave troops in the Middle East in terms of patrolling the Gulf, where we are now, small numbers of troops.
116	Joe Biden	And I think it’s a mistake to pull out the small number of troops that are there now to deal with ISIS.
117	Joe Biden	What’s happened is, now that he’s gone ahead, the President and started this whole process moving, what’s happening?
118	Joe Biden	ISIS is going to reconstitute itself.
119	Joe Biden	We’re in a position where we have to pull our forces out.
120	Joe Biden	Americans have to leave the entire region and quite frank, I think he’s flat out lied about saying the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed.
121	Wolf Blitzer	Senator Klobuchar, what’s your response?
122	Amy Klobuchar	I would leave some troops there, but not in the level that Donald Trump is taking us right now.
123	Amy Klobuchar	Afghanistan, I have long wanted to bring our troops home, I would do that.
124	Amy Klobuchar	Some would remain for counter terrorism and training.
125	Amy Klobuchar	In Syria, I would not have removed 150 troops from the border with Turkey.
126	Amy Klobuchar	I think that was a mistake.
127	Amy Klobuchar	I think it made our allies and many others much more vulnerable to ISIS.
128	Amy Klobuchar	And then when it comes to Iraq, right now I would leave our troops there despite the mess that has been created by Donald Trump.
129	Amy Klobuchar	At the briefing we had last week, I was the only person on this stage that asked a question of both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State.
130	Amy Klobuchar	And I asked them about imminent threat, but I also ask them what their alternatives were and they gave very vague, vague answers.
131	Amy Klobuchar	I asked them where is the surge of diplomacy that we would be seeing if I was President?
132	Amy Klobuchar	And I asked them where they were going to leave the Iraqi people?
133	Amy Klobuchar	Time and time again, you see that this President puts his own interest, his private interests in front of our countries.
134	Amy Klobuchar	I would put our country’s interests first as Commander in Chief.
135	Wolf Blitzer	So Senator Warren, leave combat troops, at least some combat troops in the Middle East or bring them home?
136	E. Warren	No, I think we need to get our combat troops out.
137	E. Warren	You know, we have to stop this mindset that we can do everything with combat troops.
138	E. Warren	Our military is the finest military on earth and they will take any sacrifice we ask them to take, but we should stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily.
139	E. Warren	Our keeping combat troops there is not helping.
140	E. Warren	We need to work with our allies.
141	E. Warren	We need to use our economic tools.
142	E. Warren	We need to use our diplomatic tools.
143	E. Warren	Now look, I understand there are people on this stage when it comes to Afghanistan, for example, who talk about five more years, 10 more years.
144	E. Warren	Shoot Lindsay Graham talks about leaving troops there for a hundred more years.
145	E. Warren	No one has a solution and an end point.
146	E. Warren	We need to get our combat troops out.
147	E. Warren	They are not helping create more safety for the United States or the region.
148	Wolf Blitzer	Vice President Biden is Senator Warren right?
149	Joe Biden	Well, I’ll tell you what.
150	Joe Biden	There’s a difference between combat troops and leaving special forces in a position.
151	Joe Biden	I was part of the coalition that put together 68 countries to deal with stateless terror, as well as failed States, not us alone, 68 other countries.
152	Joe Biden	That’s how we were able to defeat and end the caliphate for ISIS.
153	Joe Biden	They’ll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organize the effort to take them down.
154	Wolf Blitzer	Mayor Buttigieg, you served in Afghanistan, who’s right?
155	Pete Buttigieg	If we can continue to remain engaged without having an endless commitment of ground troops.
156	Pete Buttigieg	But what’s going on right now is the President’s actually sending more.
157	Pete Buttigieg	The very President who said he was going to end endless war, who pretended to have been against the war in Iraq all along.
158	Pete Buttigieg	But we know that’s not true.
159	Pete Buttigieg	Now has more troops going into the Middle East.
160	Pete Buttigieg	And whenever I see that happen, I think about the day we shipped out and the time that was set aside for saying goodbye to family members.
161	Pete Buttigieg	I remember walking with a friend of mine, another Lieutenant I trained with as we walked away and his one and a half year old boy was toddling after him not understanding why his father wasn’t turning back to scoop him up.
162	Pete Buttigieg	And it took all the strength he had, not to turn around and look at his boy one more time.
163	Pete Buttigieg	That is happening by the thousands right now, as we see so many more troops sent into harm’s way.
164	Pete Buttigieg	And my perspective is to ensure that that will never happen when there is an alternative as Commander in Chief.
165	Wolf Blitzer	Senator Sanders.
166	Bernie Sanders	Wolf, in America today, our infrastructure is crumbling.
167	Bernie Sanders	Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck.
168	Bernie Sanders	87 million people have no healthcare or are under insured.
169	Bernie Sanders	You got 500,000 people sleeping out on the streets tonight.
170	Bernie Sanders	The American people are sick and tired of endless wars, which have cost us trillions of dollars.
171	Bernie Sanders	Our job is to rebuild the United Nations, rebuild the State department, make sure that we have the capability of bringing the world together to resolve international conflict diplomatically and stop the endless wars that we have experienced.
172	Wolf Blitzer	We’re going to get to everyone, but Vice President Biden.
173	Wolf Blitzer	You criticized President Trump’s decision to kill the Iranian General Soleimani, without first going to Congress.
174	Wolf Blitzer	Are there any circumstances other than a direct attack on the United States where you would take military action without congressional approval?
175	Joe Biden	I ran the first time as a 29 year old kid against the war in Vietnam, on the grounds that only way they can take a nation to war, is with the informed consent of the American people.
176	Joe Biden	The informed consent of the American people.
177	Joe Biden	And with regard to this idea that we can walk away and not have any troops anywhere, excluding special forces, there’s no way you negotiate or been able to negotiate with terrorists.
178	Joe Biden	You have to be able to form coalitions, to be able to defeat them or contain them.
179	Joe Biden	If you don’t, we end up being the world’s policeman again.
180	Joe Biden	They’re going to come to us, they’ve come to us before, they’ll come to us again.
181	Joe Biden	So that’s a fundamental difference than negotiating with other countries, it’s fundamentally a requirement that we use our special forces in small numbers to coordinate with other countries to bring together coalitions.
182	Wolf Blitzer	Mr Vice President, just to be clear, the Obama-Biden administration did not ask Congress for permission multiple times when it took military action.
183	Wolf Blitzer	So wouldn’t the Biden doctrine be different?
184	Joe Biden	No, there was the authorization for the use of military force that was passed by the United States Congress House and Senate and signed by the President.
185	Joe Biden	That was the authority, does not give authority to go into Iran, it gave authority to deal with these other issues.
186	Wolf Blitzer	Mayor Buttigieg.
187	Pete Buttigieg	That authorization needs to be replaced.
188	Joe Biden	Exactly.
189	Joe Biden	We tried that.
190	Pete Buttigieg	When we lost troops in [inaudible 00:19:21], there were members of Congress who admitted they didn’t even know we had troops there.
191	Pete Buttigieg	And it was all pursuant to an authorization that was passed to deal with Al Qaeda and 9-11.
192	Pete Buttigieg	And often Congress has been all too happy to leave aside its role.
193	Pete Buttigieg	Now thanks to Democrats in Congress, that’s changing.
194	Pete Buttigieg	But the reality is year after year, Congress didn’t want to touch this either because it was so politically difficult.
195	Pete Buttigieg	Fundamental truth is, if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harm’s way, often on deployment after deployment, then we’ve got to make sure that Congress has the courage to take tough up or down votes on whether they ought to be there.
196	Pete Buttigieg	And when I am President, anytime, which I hope will never happen, but anytime I’m compelled to use force, I seek that authorization.
197	Pete Buttigieg	We will have a three year sunset, so that the American people are included not only in the decision about whether to send troops but whether to continue.
198	Wolf Blitzer	Thank you.
199	Wolf Blitzer	We’re going to get to everyone, but Senator Warren, what about you?
200	Wolf Blitzer	Are there any circumstances other than a direct attack on the United States where you would take military action without congressional approval?
201	E. Warren	Well imminent threat, but we need an authorization for the use of military force before we take this nation into combat.
202	E. Warren	That is what the constitution provides and that’s what as Commander in Chief, I will do.
203	E. Warren	But I just want to be clear, everyone on this stage talks about nobody wants endless war, but the question is when and how do you plan to get out of it?
204	E. Warren	On Senate Armed Services Committee, we have one general after another in Afghanistan who comes in and says, “You know, we’ve just turned the corner and now it’s all going to be different.”
205	E. Warren	And then what happens?
206	E. Warren	It’s all the same for another year.
207	E. Warren	Someone new comes in and we’ve just turned the corner.
208	E. Warren	We’ve turned the corners so many times we’re going in circles in these regions.
209	E. Warren	This has got to stop.
210	E. Warren	It’s not enough to say, “Someday we’re going to get out.” No one on the ground.
211	E. Warren	None of our military can describe what the conditions are for getting out.
212	E. Warren	It’s time to get our combat troops home.
213	Wolf Blitzer	Mr. Steyer, would a President’s Steyer use military force as a deterrent?
214	Wolf Blitzer	And if not, under what circumstances would you take military action?
215	Tom Steyer	I would take military action to protect the lives and safety of American citizens.
216	Tom Steyer	But what we can see in the Middle East and what this conversation shows, is that there is no real strategy that we’re trying to accomplish in what we’re doing in the Middle East.
217	Tom Steyer	Obviously Mr. Trump has no strategy.
218	Tom Steyer	He is going from crisis to crisis from escalation to escalation.
219	Tom Steyer	But if you look further over the last 20 years including in the war in Afghanistan, we know from the Washington Post that in fact there was no strategy, there was just a series of tactical decisions that made no sense.
220	Tom Steyer	So we really have to ask ourselves in the Middle East, what are we trying to accomplish?
221	Tom Steyer	I agree with Vice President Biden, to do it we should definitely be doing it in coalition with other countries.
222	Tom Steyer	And I want to point out that as we do that we’re confronted by this issue which everyone is talking about.
223	Tom Steyer	But at the same time there’s a gigantic climate issue in Australia, which also requires the same kind of value driven coalition building, that we actually should be using in the Middle East.
224	Tom Steyer	We need to ask ourselves, how are we going to provide a world that is safer for Americans, where we can prosper more?
225	Tom Steyer	And every single thing we do should follow into that strategy and it’s just not happening in Washington DC.
226	Abby Phillip	Mayor Buttigieg, another critical issue you’d face as President is the threat of nuclear weapons.
227	Abby Phillip	Last week, President Trump said, “As long as I am President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.” Would a President Buttigieg make that same promise?
228	Pete Buttigieg	Ensuring that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons, will of course be a priority because it’s such an important part of keeping America safe.
229	Pete Buttigieg	But unfortunately, President Trump has made it much harder for the next President to achieve that goal.
230	Pete Buttigieg	By gutting the Iran nuclear deal, one that by the way, the Trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran.
231	Pete Buttigieg	By gutting that they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we’re now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war.
232	Pete Buttigieg	Now- [crosstalk 00:23:46] Yes?
233	Abby Phillip	Continue.
234	Pete Buttigieg	In order to get that done, we’ve got to work with our partners.
235	Pete Buttigieg	The Iran nuclear deal, the technical term for it was the JCPOA, that first letter J stood for joint.
236	Pete Buttigieg	We can’t do this alone.
237	Pete Buttigieg	Even less so now after everything that has happened, which is why it will be so critically important to engage leaders, including a lot of new leaders emerging around the world and ensure that we have the alliances we need to meet what I believe is not just an American goal, but a widely shared goal around the world, to ensure that Iran does not become a nuclear armed country.
238	Abby Phillip	Mayor Buttigieg to be clear, would you allow Iran to become a nuclear power?
239	Abby Phillip	Yes or no?
240	Pete Buttigieg	No.
241	Pete Buttigieg	Our security depends on ensuring that Iran does not become nuclear.
242	Pete Buttigieg	And by the way, we’ve got a lot other challenges with nuclear proliferation around the world.
243	Pete Buttigieg	Despite this President’s coziness with Vladimir Putin, we actually seem to be further away from being able to work with Russia on things like the renewal of START.
244	Pete Buttigieg	We’ve got to move toward less, not more nuclear danger, whether it is from States, from stateless potential terrorist actors or anywhere else around the world.
245	Abby Phillip	Thank you Mayor Buttigieg.
246	Abby Phillip	Senator Klobuchar, if you become President, it’s very possible there won’t be an Iran nuclear deal for the United States to rejoin.
247	Abby Phillip	Given that, how would you prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon?
248	Amy Klobuchar	I would start negotiations again and I won’t take that as a given, given that our European partners are still trying to hold the agreement together.
249	Amy Klobuchar	My issue is that because of the actions of Donald Trump, we are in a situation where they are now starting, Iran is starting to enrich uranium again, in violation of the original agreement.
250	Amy Klobuchar	So what I would do is negotiate, I would bring people together just as President Obama did years ago, and I think that we can get this done.
251	Amy Klobuchar	But you have to have a President that sees this as a number one goal.
252	Amy Klobuchar	And an answer to the original question you asked the mayor, I would not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.
253	Amy Klobuchar	And then you have to get an agreement in place.
254	Amy Klobuchar	I think there are changes you can make to the agreement, better sunsets and changes to the inspections, but overall that is what we should do.
255	Amy Klobuchar	And I am the one person on this debate stage, on the first night of the very first debate, when we were asked what we saw as the biggest threat to our world, I said China on the economy, but I said Iran because of Donald Trump.
256	Amy Klobuchar	Because I feared that exactly what happened would happen, enrichment of uranium, escalation of tensions, leaving frayed relations with our allies.
257	Amy Klobuchar	We can bring them back, understanding this is a terrorist regime that we cannot allow to have a nuclear weapon.
258	Abby Phillip	Vice President Biden, I want to ask you about North Korea.
259	Abby Phillip	President Trump has met with Kim Jong-un three times.
260	Abby Phillip	President Obama once said he would meet with North Korea without any preconditions.
261	Abby Phillip	Would you meet with North Korea without any preconditions?
262	Joe Biden	No, not now.
263	Joe Biden	I wouldn’t meet with him without any preconditions.
264	Joe Biden	Look, we gave him everything he’s looking for.
265	Joe Biden	Legitimacy, the President showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against them.
266	Joe Biden	I would be putting what I did as Vice President.
267	Joe Biden	I’ve met with Xi Jinping more than anyone else.
268	Joe Biden	I would be putting pressure on China to put pressure on Korea, to cease and desist from their nuclear power, make their efforts to deal with nuclear weapons.
269	Joe Biden	I would move forward as we did before and you reported it extensively Wolf, about moving forward the whole notion of defense against nuclear weapons.
270	Joe Biden	And when China said to me, when Xi Jinping said to me, “That’s a threat to us.” I said, “We’re going to move and protect our interests unless you get involved and protect it.” I would re-ignite the relationship between Japan and South Korea and I would put enormous pressure on China because it’s also in their interest for them to put pressure on North Korea to cease and desist.
271	Joe Biden	But I would not meet with absent preconditions.
272	Joe Biden	I would not meet with the “Supreme leader” who said, “Joe Biden is a rabid dog.
273	Joe Biden	He should be beaten to death with a stick.” I count that.
274	Bernie Sanders	Other than that, you like him.
275	Joe Biden	Other than that I like him and he got a love letter from Trump right after that.
276	Abby Phillip	Mr. Steyer, would you meet with North Korea without any preconditions?
277	Tom Steyer	No.
278	Tom Steyer	It’s very clear that if we’re going to do something with North Korea, we’re going to have to do it in concert with our allies.
279	Tom Steyer	That meeting with him without preconditions is not going anywhere, that the staff can meet to try and see how far we can get.
280	Tom Steyer	But this is a classic situation where the United States idea of going it alone makes no sense.
281	Tom Steyer	And when you are talking about Iran, let’s face it, Iran is under great pressure economically.
282	Tom Steyer	So every single discussion we’ve had about Iran has had to do with military power and America versus Iran.
283	Tom Steyer	Whereas in fact what worked with President Obama was an Alliance of our allies and us, putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic.
284	Tom Steyer	That to me is called strategy, having a goal to make America safer by looking more broadly than just us as the policemen of the world-
285	Abby Phillip	Thank you Mr. Steyer.
286	Tom Steyer	… Spending money.
287	B. Pfannenstiel	Let’s stay with the theme of America’s role in the world and talk about trade.
288	B. Pfannenstiel	Tomorrow, President Trump is expected to sign phase one of a trade agreement with China and the Senate will likely soon approve a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, Iowa’s largest trading partners.
289	B. Pfannenstiel	Senator Sanders, you have said that new deal, the USMCA, ” Makes some modest improvements,” yet you’re going to vote against it.
290	B. Pfannenstiel	Aren’t modest improvements better than no improvements for the farmers and manufacturers who have been devastated here in Iowa?
291	Bernie Sanders	The answer is we could do much better than a Trump led trade deal.
292	Bernie Sanders	This deal, and I think the proponents of it acknowledge, will result in the continuation of the loss of hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs, as a result of outsourcing.
293	Bernie Sanders	The heart and soul of our disaster trade agreements and I’m the guy who voted against NAFTA and against permanent normal trade relations with China, is that we have forced American workers to compete against people in Mexico, in China, elsewhere, who earn starvation wages, a dollar or $2 an hour.
294	Bernie Sanders	Second of all, every major environmental organization has said no to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase climate change in it.
295	Bernie Sanders	And given the fact that climate change is right now the greatest threat facing this planet, I will not vote for a trade agreement that does not incorporate very, very strong principles to significantly lower fossil fuel emissions in the world.
296	B. Pfannenstiel	But Senator Sanders, to be clear, the AFL-CIO supports this deal.
297	B. Pfannenstiel	Are you unwilling to compromise?
298	Bernie Sanders	The AFL-CIO does, the machinists union does not.
299	Bernie Sanders	And every environmental organization in this country, including the sunrise organization who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it.
300	Bernie Sanders	So I happen to believe, and I hope we will talk about climate change in a moment.
301	Bernie Sanders	If we do not get our act together in terms of climate change, the planet that we’re going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren will be increasingly unlivable and uninhabitable.
302	B. Pfannenstiel	We’re going to get to climate change but I’d like to stay on trade.
303	B. Pfannenstiel	Senator Warren.
304	Bernie Sanders	Well they are the same in this issue.
305	B. Pfannenstiel	Senator Warren, you support the USMCA, why is Senator Sanders wrong?
306	E. Warren	I do.
307	E. Warren	I wasn’t here, I haven’t been in Congress long enough to have voted against NAFTA, but I led the fight against the trade deal with Asia and the trade deal with Europe because I didn’t think it was in the interest of the American people, the American workers or environmental interests.
308	E. Warren	But we have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting and they are hurting because of Donald Trump’s initiated trade wars.
309	E. Warren	We have workers who are hurting because the agreements that have already been cut, really don’t have enforcement on workers rights.
310	E. Warren	This new trade deal is a modest improvement, Senator Sanders himself has said so.
311	E. Warren	It will give some relief to our farmers, it will give some relief to our workers.
312	E. Warren	I believe we accept that relief, we try to help the people who need help and we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal.
313	E. Warren	We need a coherent trade policy.
314	E. Warren	We need a policy that actually helps our workers, our farmers.
315	E. Warren	We need them at the table, not just a trade policy written for big international companies.
316	E. Warren	I’m ready to have that fight but let’s help the people who need help right now.
317	B. Pfannenstiel	Thank you.
318	B. Pfannenstiel	Senator Sanders, can you please respond to Senator Warren?
319	Bernie Sanders	Well, I think that it is not so easy to put together new trade legislation.
320	Bernie Sanders	If this is passed, I think it will set us back a number of years.
321	Bernie Sanders	Senator Warren is right, in saying we need to bring the stakeholders to the table, that is the family farmers here in Iowa and in Vermont and around the country.
322	Bernie Sanders	That is the environmental community, that…
323	Bernie Sanders	In Vermont and around the country, that is the environmental community.
324	Bernie Sanders	That is the workers.
325	Bernie Sanders	Bottom line here is I am sick and tired of trade agreements negotiated by the CEOs of large corporations.
326	Moderator 1	Senator Klobuchar, I’d like to bring you in here.
327	Amy Klobuchar	Brianne, I want to hit reality here.
328	Amy Klobuchar	I serve on the agriculture committee, and I will never forget going to Crawfordsville here in Iowa, and thank you for bringing up Iowa, Brianne, since that is where we are.
329	Amy Klobuchar	I went to this plant, and there was one worker left in that plant.
330	Amy Klobuchar	That plant had been shut down because of Donald Trump’s trade policies and because of what he had done to those workers, with giving secret waivers to oil companies and ruining the renewable fuel standard.
331	Amy Klobuchar	That worker brought out a coat rack of uniforms, and he said, “These are my friends.
332	Amy Klobuchar	They don’t work here anymore.” Their names were embroidered on those uniforms, Derek, Mark, Salvador, and that guy started to cry.
333	Amy Klobuchar	These are real people hurt by Donald Trump’s trade war.
334	Amy Klobuchar	So what we should do, and I support the USMCA.
335	Amy Klobuchar	I am glad that these improvements were made that are supported by people like Richard Trumka and Sherrod Brown, on labor and environment, on pharma, the sweetheart deal, because I think we need a big trading block with North America to take on China.
336	Amy Klobuchar	The way you are stronger than China is with your allies.
337	Moderator 1	Senator Klobuchar, your time is up.
338	Moderator 1	Mayor Buttigieg, do you support the USMCA?
339	Moderator 1	Yes or no?
340	Pete Buttigieg	Yes, it has been improved.
341	Pete Buttigieg	It is not perfect, but when you sit down with the people who are most impacted, they share just how much harm has been done to them by things like the trade war and just how much we can benefit, American consumers and workers and farmers, by making sure we have the right kind of labor and enforceability, as Democrats ensured we got in this USMCA.
342	Pete Buttigieg	But let’s acknowledge why there is such fear and frustration.
343	Pete Buttigieg	In my part of the country, in the industrial Midwest, I remember when they came around in the ’90s, selling trade deals, telling us, “Don’t worry about your slice of the pie.
344	Pete Buttigieg	The pie will get so much bigger that everyone will be better off,” and that promise was broken.
345	Pete Buttigieg	The part about the pie getting bigger happened.
346	Pete Buttigieg	It’s just that the part about it getting to most people where I live did not.
347	Pete Buttigieg	That is why there was such frustration.
348	Pete Buttigieg	The sense that these decisions in board rooms and in committee rooms in Washington are being made not based on what’s best for us, but based on their own game.
349	Moderator 1	Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.
350	Moderator 1	Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders has said Donald Trump will, quote, eat your lunch for voting yes on what he calls terrible trade agreements.
351	Moderator 1	When it comes to trade, why are you the best candidate to take on President Trump?
352	Joe Biden	There’ll be no trade agreements signed in my administration without environmentalist and labor at the table, and there will be no trade agreement until we invest more in American workers.
353	Joe Biden	We should be putting our money and our effort and our time in preparing America workers to compete in the 21st century on the high- tech side, dealing with artificial intelligence.
354	Joe Biden	We should be focusing on equipping American workers to do that.
355	Joe Biden	By the way, the idea … I don’t know that there’s any trade agreement that the senator would ever think made any sense, but the problem is that 95% of the customers are out there.
356	Joe Biden	So we’ve got to figure out how we begin to write the rules of the road, not China.
357	Moderator 1	Senator Sanders?
358	Bernie Sanders	Joe and I have a fundamental disagreement, in case you haven’t noticed, and that is NAFTA, PNTR with China, other trade agreements were written for one reason alone, and that is to increase the profits of large multinational corporations.
359	Bernie Sanders	The end result of those two, just PNTR with China, Joe, and NAFTA cost us some 4 million jobs as part of the race to the bottom.
360	Bernie Sanders	I am sick and tired and will not tolerate, and we will use the power of the federal contracting system.
361	Bernie Sanders	If a corporation in America wants to shut down in Iowa or Vermont or any place else and then they think they’re going to get online for a generous federal contract, they’ve got another thing going.
362	Bernie Sanders	We need some corporate responsibility here, and we need to protect good-paying jobs in America, not see them go to China, Mexico, Vietnam.
363	Moderator 1	Mr. Vice President, what’s your response?
364	Joe Biden	We need corporate responsibility, and I agree with that completely.
365	Joe Biden	But we also need to have enforcement mechanisms in the agreements we made, enforceable agreements.
366	Joe Biden	That’s one of the things that has been improved with the trade agreement with Mexico, and that’s what we should be doing in any agreement we have.
367	Joe Biden	But let’s get back to the basics here.
368	Joe Biden	If we don’t set the rules of the road by going out to our partners, instead of poking our finger in the eye of all our friends and allies.
369	Joe Biden	We make up 25% of the world’s economy.
370	Joe Biden	We’ve got to bring the other 25% of our allies along with us to set the rules of the road so China cannot continue to abuse their power by stealing an actual are stealing our intellectual property and doing all the other things using their corporate state system to our significant disadvantage.
371	Moderator 1	Senator Warren?
372	E. Warren	Our problem is not just that we need corporate responsibility.
373	E. Warren	It’s been the structure of how these trade deals have been negotiated.
374	E. Warren	The United States has had a strategy for decades, and that strategy has been to have government trade negotiators, a small number, and then surround them with giant multinational corporation lobbyists and corporate executives who whisper in the ears of our negotiators and then get deals cut that are great for the giant multinational corporations, not good for America, not good for American workers, not good for the environment.
375	E. Warren	We need a different approach to trade, and it starts by calling out the corruption of these giant corporations that have cut our trade deals.
376	E. Warren	Everybody wants to get to the American market, and we need to put some standards in place.
377	E. Warren	You want to be able to sell your goods here, then you’ve got to meet some environmental standards.
378	E. Warren	You’ve got to meet labor standards.
379	Moderator 1	Thank you, Senator Warren.
380	E. Warren	We need a coherent approach.
381	Moderator 1	I’d like to bring in Mr. Steyer here.
382	Moderator 1	Mr Steyer, even though farmers and manufacturers here in Iowa and around the country could see some relief from the China deal, they’ve been crushed by the current administration’s trade war.
383	Moderator 1	What will you do as President to help them get back on their feet?
384	Tom Steyer	Look.
385	Tom Steyer	On the first day, I would undo Mr. Trump’s tariffs.
386	Tom Steyer	On the first day, I would get rid of his waivers that Senator Klobuchar was referring to, to oil refiners not having to use corn-based ethanol.
387	Tom Steyer	In fact, these trade deals have been exactly what Senator Sanders and Warren have been saying, which is that they’ve been designed to grow the American GDP for the corporations of America, not for the working people of America, and not to protect the climate.
388	Tom Steyer	So let me say this.
389	Tom Steyer	I’m the only person on this stage who says climate is my number one priority.
390	Tom Steyer	I would not sign this deal, because if climate is your number one priority, you can’t sign a deal, even if it’s marginally better for working people, until climate is also taken into consideration.
391	Tom Steyer	Look.
392	Tom Steyer	I’ve got four kids between the ages of 26 and 31.
393	Tom Steyer	I cannot allow this country to go down the path of climate destruction.
394	Tom Steyer	Everybody in their generation knows it.
395	Tom Steyer	Frankly, Mayor Buttigieg, you’re their generation.
396	Tom Steyer	I’d think you would be standing up more.
397	Tom Steyer	Look.
398	Tom Steyer	That’s why I’m standing up for it.
399	Tom Steyer	We cannot put climate on the backseat all the time and say, “We’re going to sign this one more deal.
400	Tom Steyer	We’re going to do one more thing without putting climate first.” That’s why it’s my number one priority.
401	Tom Steyer	We can do it in a way that makes us richer, but we have to do it.
402	Moderator 1	Mayor Buttigieg, your response?
403	Pete Buttigieg	Well, that’s right.
404	Pete Buttigieg	This issue’s personal for me.
405	Pete Buttigieg	That’s why we’re going to tackle climate from day one.
406	Pete Buttigieg	It’s why we’ve got to make sure that we have better answers than we do today.
407	Pete Buttigieg	Now, what I’ve noticed is pretty much all of us propose that we move on from fossil fuels by the middle of the century, starting with actions that we take right now.
408	Pete Buttigieg	The question is how are we going to make sure any of this actually gets done?
409	Pete Buttigieg	Because people have been saying the right things in these debates for literally decades.
410	Pete Buttigieg	The other day in Winterset, there was a kid at one of my events.
411	Pete Buttigieg	Raised his hand, and he pointed out that he expects to be here in his nineties, in the year 2100.
412	Pete Buttigieg	He will sit in judgment over what we do, not just what we on this stage do, anyone old enough to vote right now, whether we actually put together the national project it will require to meet our climate goals, to act aggressively, not just rejoining the Paris Climate Accord.
413	Pete Buttigieg	That’s table stakes, but to actually move on from the fossil-dependent economy we live in today.
414	Moderator 2	Let’s now turn to an issue that’s come up in the last 48 hours, Senator Sanders.
415	Moderator 2	Seen and reported yesterday that … Senator Sanders, Senator Warren confirmed in a statement that in 2018, you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election.
416	Moderator 2	Why did you say that?
417	Bernie Sanders	Well, as a matter of fact, I didn’t say it, and I don’t want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want.
418	Bernie Sanders	Anybody that knows me knows that it’s in comprehensible that I would think that a woman could not be President of the United States.
419	Bernie Sanders	Go to YouTube today.
420	Bernie Sanders	There’s a video of me 30 years ago, talking about how a woman could become President of the United States.
421	Bernie Sanders	In 2015, I deferred, in fact, to Senate Warren.
422	Bernie Sanders	There was a movement to draft Senator Warren to run for President, and you know what?
423	Bernie Sanders	I stayed back.
424	Bernie Sanders	Senator Warren decided not to run, and I did run afterwards.
425	Bernie Sanders	Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by three million votes.
426	Bernie Sanders	How could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could become President of the United States?
427	Bernie Sanders	Let me be very clear.
428	Bernie Sanders	If any of the women on this stage or any of the men on this stage win the nomination … I hope that’s not the case.
429	Bernie Sanders	I hope it’s me.
430	Bernie Sanders	But if they do, I will do everything in my power to make sure that they are elected in order to defeat the most dangerous President in the history of our country.
431	Moderator 2	So Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, I do want to be clear here.
432	Moderator 2	You’re saying that you never told Senator Warren that a woman could not win the election?
433	Bernie Sanders	That is correct.
434	Moderator 2	Senator Warren, what did you think when Senator Sanders told you a woman could not win the election?
435	E. Warren	I disagreed.
436	E. Warren	Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie.
437	E. Warren	But look.
438	E. Warren	This question about whether or not a woman can be President has been raised, and it’s time for us to attack it head-on.
439	E. Warren	I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people’s winning record.
440	E. Warren	So can a woman beat Donald Trump?
441	E. Warren	Look at the men on this stage.
442	E. Warren	Collectively, they have lost ten elections.
443	E. Warren	The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they’ve been in are the women.
444	E. Warren	The only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican anytime in the past 30 years is me, and here’s what I know.
445	E. Warren	The real danger that we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can’t pull our party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of the Democratic constituency.
446	E. Warren	We need a candidate who will excite all parts of the Democratic Party, bring everyone in, and give everyone a Democrat to believe in.
447	E. Warren	That’s my plan, and that is why I’m going to win.
448	Moderator 2	Senator Klobuchar, what do you say …
449	Amy Klobuchar	Thank you, Elizabeth.
450	Moderator 2	Senator Klobuchar, what do you say …
451	Amy Klobuchar	I would like to …
452	Moderator 2	Senator Klobuchar, let me finish my question.
453	Amy Klobuchar	Oh, okay.
454	Moderator 2	What do you say to people who …
455	Amy Klobuchar	I thought it was such an open end.
456	Amy Klobuchar	I wasn’t at the meeting, so I can’t comment, but I was going to say …
457	Moderator 2	What do you say to people who say that a woman can’t win this election?
458	Amy Klobuchar	I hear that.
459	Amy Klobuchar	People have said it.
460	Amy Klobuchar	That’s why I’ve addressed it from this stage.
461	Amy Klobuchar	I point out that you don’t have to be the tallest person in the room.
462	Amy Klobuchar	James Madison was five foot four.
463	Amy Klobuchar	You don’t have to be the skinniest person in the room.
464	Amy Klobuchar	You don’t have to be the loudest person.
465	Amy Klobuchar	You have to be competent.
466	Amy Klobuchar	When you look at the facts, Michigan has a woman governor right now, and she beat a Republican, Gretchen Whitmer.
467	Amy Klobuchar	Kansas has a woman governor right now, and she beat Kris Kobach.
468	Amy Klobuchar	Her name is … I’m very proud to know her, and her name is Governor Kelly.
469	Amy Klobuchar	Thank you.
470	Amy Klobuchar	Third, I would add to this you have to be competent to win, and you have to know what you’re doing.
471	Amy Klobuchar	When you look at what I have done, I have won every race, every place, every time.
472	Amy Klobuchar	I have one in the reddest of districts.
473	Amy Klobuchar	I have won in the suburban areas, in the rural areas.
474	Amy Klobuchar	I have brought people with me.
475	Amy Klobuchar	That is why I have the most endorsements of current Iowa legislators and former Iowa legislators in this race …
476	Moderator 2	Thank you.
477	Amy Klobuchar	… because I know I bring people with me.
478	Moderator 2	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
479	Amy Klobuchar	Finally, every single person that I have beaten, my Republican opponents, have gotten out of politics for good.
480	Amy Klobuchar	I think that sounds pretty good.
481	Amy Klobuchar	I think that sounds pretty good with the guy we have in the White House right now.
482	Moderator 2	Senator Sanders, you can respond.
483	Bernie Sanders	Well, just to set the record straight, I defeated an incumbent Republican running for Congress.
484	E. Warren	When?
485	Bernie Sanders	1990.
486	Bernie Sanders	That’s how I won.
487	Bernie Sanders	Beat a Republican Congressman.
488	Bernie Sanders	Number two, of course …
489	E. Warren	30 years ago.
490	Bernie Sanders	… I don’t think there’s any debate on …
491	E. Warren	Wasn’t that 30 years ago?
492	Bernie Sanders	I beat an incumbent Republican Congressman.
493	E. Warren	I said I was the only one who has beaten an incumbent Republican in 30 years.
494	Bernie Sanders	Well, 30 years ago is 1990, as a matter of fact.
495	Bernie Sanders	But I don’t know that that’s the major issue of the day.
496	Bernie Sanders	I think what the major issue of the day is … Does anybody in their right mind thing that a woman cannot be elected President?
497	Bernie Sanders	That’s enough.
498	Bernie Sanders	Nobody believes that.
499	Bernie Sanders	Hillary Clinton got 3 million votes, more votes than Trump.
500	Bernie Sanders	So who believes that a woman can’t win?
501	Bernie Sanders	Of course a woman can win.
502	Bernie Sanders	But the real question is how do we beat Trump?
503	Bernie Sanders	The only way we beat Trump is by a campaign of energy and excitement and a campaign that has, by far, the largest voter turnout in the history of this country.
504	Bernie Sanders	I believe that our campaign has the strongest grassroots movement.
505	Moderator 2	Thank you.
506	Bernie Sanders	We are endorsed by many grassroots organizations.
507	Moderator 2	Senator Warren?
508	Moderator 2	Senator Warren, I want to give you the final word.
509	E. Warren	So I do think it’s the right question, how do we beat Trump?
510	E. Warren	Here’s the thing.
511	E. Warren	Since Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have outperformed men candidates in competitive races.
512	E. Warren	In 2018, we took back the House.
513	E. Warren	We took back state houses because of women candidates and women voters.
514	E. Warren	Look.
515	E. Warren	Don’t deny that the question is there.
516	E. Warren	Back in the 1960s, people asked, “Could a Catholic win?” Back in 2008, people asked if an African American could win.
517	E. Warren	Both times, the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes, got behind their candidate, and we changed America.
518	E. Warren	That’s who we are.
519	Moderator 2	Vice President Biden?
520	Moderator 2	Vice president Biden, go ahead.
521	Joe Biden	I agree women can win, and I’ve went in and campaigned for 27 of them, this last in 2018 the best group I’ve ever campaigned for in terms of competence.
522	Joe Biden	But the real issue is who can bring the whole party together and represent all elements of the party, African Americans, brown, black, women, men, gay, straight?
523	Joe Biden	The fact of the matter is that I would argue that, in terms of endorsements around the country, endorsements wherever we go, I am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race.
524	Moderator 2	All right, we’re going to take a short break now.
525	Moderator 2	The CNN Democratic Presidential Debate, live from Drake University, will be right back.
526	Moderator 2	Let’s turn to healthcare, the top issue for Iowa Democrats.
527	Moderator 2	Donald Trump is trying to repeal Obamacare, including the protections for preexisting conditions.
528	Moderator 2	We all know that each of you vigorously opposes that.
529	Moderator 2	Still, there are some questions about what each of you would do.
530	Moderator 2	Senator Sanders, you’ve consistently refused to say exactly how much your Medicare for All plan is going to cost.
531	Moderator 2	Don’t voters deserve to see the price tag before you send them a bill that could cost tens of trillions of dollars?
532	Bernie Sanders	Well, what I will tell you is Medicare for All, which will guarantee comprehensive healthcare to every man, woman, and child, will cost substantially less than the status quo.
533	Bernie Sanders	Medicare for All will end the absurdity of the United States paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and healthcare in general.
534	Bernie Sanders	While we have 87 million uninsured and underinsured and while 30,000 people die each year, on the Medicare for All, one of the provisions we have to pay for it is a 4% tax on income, exempting the first $29,000.
535	Bernie Sanders	So the average family in America that today makes $60,000 would pay $1,200 a year, compared to that family paying $12,000 a year.
536	Bernie Sanders	We save money, comprehensive healthcare, because we take on the greed and the profiteering and the administrative nightmare that currently exist in our dysfunctional system.
537	Moderator 2	Vice President Biden, does Senator Sanders owe voters a price tag on his healthcare plan?
538	Joe Biden	I think we need to be candid with voters.
539	Joe Biden	I think we have to tell them what we’re going to do and what it’s going to cost, and a 4% tax on income over $24,000 doesn’t even come close to paying for between 30 and some estimates as high as $40 trillion over ten years.
540	Joe Biden	That’s doubling the entire federal budget per year.
541	Joe Biden	There’s a way to do that.
542	Joe Biden	The way to do that is to take Obamacare, re-instate, rebuild it, provide a public option, allow Medicare for those folks who want it, and, in fact, make sure that we, in the process, reduce the costs of drug prices, reduce the cost of being able to buy into the … subsidize it further, and make it available to everyone.
543	Joe Biden	Here’s the deal.
544	Joe Biden	That costs a lot of money that cost $740 billion over ten years.
545	Joe Biden	I lay out how I pay for that.
546	Moderator 2	Senator Sanders?
547	Bernie Sanders	Well, first of all, what Joe forgets to say is when you leave the current system as it is, what you are talking about, all workers paying, on average, 20% of their incomes for healthcare, that is insane.
548	Bernie Sanders	You’ve got 500,000 people going bankrupt because they cannot pay their medical bills.
549	Bernie Sanders	We’re spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country.
550	Bernie Sanders	Look.
551	Bernie Sanders	We’ve talked about healthcare for all in this country for over 100 years.
552	Bernie Sanders	Now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the healthcare industry, of the drug companies, and finally provide healthcare to all through a Medicare for All single payer program.
553	Bernie Sanders	It won’t be easy, but that is what we have to do.
554	Moderator 2	Vice President Biden?
555	Joe Biden	You can do it without Medicare for All.
556	Joe Biden	You can get the same place.
557	Moderator 2	Senator Klobuchar, your response?
558	Amy Klobuchar	Yeah.
559	Amy Klobuchar	Senator Sanders and I have worked together on pharmaceuticals for a long, long time, and we agree on this.
560	Amy Klobuchar	But what I don’t agree with is his position on healthcare.
561	Amy Klobuchar	This debate isn’t real.
562	Amy Klobuchar	I was in Vegas the other day, and someone said, “Don’t put your chips on a number on the wheel that isn’t even on the wheel.” That’s the problem.
563	Amy Klobuchar	Over two thirds of the Democrats in the US Senate are not on the bill that you and Senator Warren are on.
564	Amy Klobuchar	You have numerous governors that are Democratic that don’t support this.
565	Amy Klobuchar	You have numerous House members that put Nancy Pelosi in a speaker.
566	Amy Klobuchar	The answer is a nonprofit public option.
567	Amy Klobuchar	The answer is the real debate we should be having is how do we make it easier for people to get coverage for addiction and mental health.
568	Amy Klobuchar	I have a plan for that, and then, finally, what should we do about long-term care, the elephant that doesn’t even fit in this room?
569	Amy Klobuchar	We need to make it easier for people to get long-term care insurance.
570	Amy Klobuchar	We need to make it easier for them to pay for their premiums.
571	Amy Klobuchar	My own dad, I know when his long-term care insurance ends, and then we have some savings for him.
572	Amy Klobuchar	He’s in assisted living.
573	Amy Klobuchar	He got married three times, whole nother story.
574	Amy Klobuchar	So there isn’t much there.
575	Amy Klobuchar	But then we go to Medicaid, and I’ve already talked to Catholic elder care.
576	Amy Klobuchar	They’re willing to take him in.
577	Amy Klobuchar	Our story is better than so many other families.
578	Amy Klobuchar	We have to make it easier for long-term care.
579	Moderator 2	Thank you.
580	Moderator 2	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
581	Amy Klobuchar	It’s not just for senators.
582	Amy Klobuchar	It’s also for the sandwich generation …
583	Moderator 2	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
584	Amy Klobuchar	… people trying to help their parents.
585	Moderator 2	Senator Warren?
586	E. Warren	So we need to start with what’s happening in America.
587	E. Warren	People are suffering.
588	E. Warren	I’ll just pick one.
589	E. Warren	36 million people last year went to the doctor, got a prescription.
590	E. Warren	This is what they needed to get well, and they couldn’t afford to have the prescription filled.
591	E. Warren	They looked at it and said, “It’s either groceries or this prescription.”
592	E. Warren	My approach to this is we’ve got to get as much help to as many people as quickly as possible.
593	E. Warren	I have worked out a plan where we can do that without raising taxes on middle class families by one thin dime.
594	E. Warren	What I can do are the things that I can do as President on the first day.
595	E. Warren	We can cut the cost of prescription drugs.
596	E. Warren	I’ll use the power that’s already given to the President to reduce the cost of insulin and EpiPens and HIV/AIDS drugs.
597	E. Warren	Let’s get some relief to those families, and I will defend the Affordable Care Act.
598	E. Warren	I’ve got a plan to expand healthcare.
599	E. Warren	But let’s keep in mind, when we come to a general election, we Democrats may argue among each other about the best way to do healthcare, but we’re going to be up against a Republican incumbent who has cut healthcare for millions of people and is still trying to do that.
600	E. Warren	I’ll take our side of the argument any day.
601	E. Warren	We’re going to beat him on this.
602	Moderator 2	Thank you.
603	Moderator 2	Thank you, Senator Warren.
604	Moderator 2	Vice President Biden?
605	Joe Biden	The [inaudible 01:00:41] my layout does, in fact, limit drug costs.
606	Joe Biden	It allows all the drug companies to … Excuse me, it allows Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price.
607	Joe Biden	It’s sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation.
608	Joe Biden	By the way, there’s mental health parity that I call for in the Obamacare expanded with the Biden option.
609	Moderator 2	Mr. Steyer?
610	Tom Steyer	Look.
611	Tom Steyer	We’ve had this conversation on this stage so many times.
612	Tom Steyer	Everybody on this stage believes that affordable healthcare is a right for every single American.
613	Tom Steyer	Everybody on this stage knows that Americans are paying twice as much for healthcare as any other advanced country in the world.
614	Tom Steyer	It makes no sense, and the government has to step in.
615	Tom Steyer	I do happen to agree with vice President Biden that we should move and develop the Affordable Care Act with a public option, but the real question is this.
616	Tom Steyer	This is not a new problem.
617	Tom Steyer	Why do we keep having this conversation?
618	Tom Steyer	We have a broken government.
619	Tom Steyer	It has been bought by corporations that include the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the private hospitals.
620	Tom Steyer	That’s what I’m talking about.
621	Tom Steyer	How do we get back government of, by, and for the people?
622	Tom Steyer	How do we actually break the corporate stranglehold on our government so that we can get any of these things passed?
623	Moderator 2	Thank you.
624	Moderator 2	Thank you, Mr. Steyer.
625	Moderator 2	Thank you, Mr. Steyer.
626	Moderator 2	Senator Sanders, your campaign proposals would double federal spending over the next decade, an unprecedented level of spending not seen since World War II.
627	Moderator 2	How would you keep your plans from bankrupting the country?
628	Bernie Sanders	No, our plan wouldn’t bankrupt the country.
629	Bernie Sanders	In fact, it would much improve the wellbeing of working class families and the middle class.
630	Bernie Sanders	Let us be clear what Medicare for all does.
631	Bernie Sanders	It ends all premiums.
632	Bernie Sanders	It ends all copayments.
633	Bernie Sanders	It ends the absurdity of deductibles.
634	Bernie Sanders	It ends out-of-pocket expenses.
635	Bernie Sanders	It takes on the pharmaceutical industry, which, in some cases, charges us ten times more for the same prescription drugs sold abroad as sold here.
636	Bernie Sanders	What we will do through a Medicare for All single payer program is substantially lower the cost of healthcare for employers and workers, because we end the hundred billion dollars a year that the healthcare industry makes and the $500 billion a year we spend an the administrative nightmare of dealing with thousands of separate insurance plans.
637	Bernie Sanders	Healthcare is a human right.
638	Bernie Sanders	Every other major country on Earth is guaranteeing healthcare for all.
639	Bernie Sanders	The time is long overdue for us to do the same.
640	Moderator 2	Senator Klobuchar?
641	Amy Klobuchar	Again, I think it is much better to build on the Affordable Care Act, and if you want to be practical and progressive at the same time and have a plan and not a pipe dream, you have to show how you’re going to pay for it.
642	Amy Klobuchar	I would also note, practically, that the Affordable Care Act right now is ten points more popular than the President of the United States.
643	Amy Klobuchar	So I think the answer is to build on it, and yes, I think you should show how you’re going to pay for things, Bernie.
644	Amy Klobuchar	I do.
645	Amy Klobuchar	This President is [inaudible 01:03:57] people out.
646	Amy Klobuchar	They’re like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos.
647	Amy Klobuchar	The way he is adding to our debt, I am the one person up here who has on her website, in her plan, a plan to actually start taking on the deficit by taking part of that money from that corporate tax cut that they put in there and putting it in a fund to pay back the deficit.
648	Moderator 2	Thank you.
649	Moderator 2	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
650	Amy Klobuchar	I have shown how I’m going to pay for every single plan, capital gains that’s going to the personal level …
651	Moderator 2	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
652	Amy Klobuchar	… getting rid of the oil giveaways …
653	Moderator 2	Let’s move on.
654	Amy Klobuchar	… doing something about the hedge fund loophole.
655	Amy Klobuchar	You can go through, and you can get the money to pay for things.
656	Moderator 2	Senator Klobuchar, your time is up.
657	Moderator 2	Let’s move on to the next question.
658	Moderator 2	Mayor Buttigieg, you’re selling your plan as Medicare for all who want it.
659	Moderator 2	Yet your plan would automatically enroll uninsured Americans into a public option, even if they don’t want it, and force them to pay for it.
660	Moderator 2	How is that truth in advertising?
661	Pete Buttigieg	Well, it’s making sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured American.
662	Pete Buttigieg	Look.
663	Pete Buttigieg	The individual mandate was an important part of the ACA, because the system doesn’t work if there are free riders.
664	Pete Buttigieg	What I’m offering is a choice.
665	Pete Buttigieg	You don’t have to be in my plan if there’s another plan that you would rather keep, and there’s no need to kick Americans off the plans that they want in order to deliver healthcare for all.
666	Pete Buttigieg	My plan is paid for.
667	Pete Buttigieg	Look.
668	Pete Buttigieg	Our party should no longer hesitate to talk about the issue of the debt and the deficit.
669	Pete Buttigieg	We’ve got a dramatically better track record on it than Republicans do.
670	Pete Buttigieg	In my lifetime, it’s almost invariably Republican Presidents who have added to the deficit.
671	Pete Buttigieg	$1 trillion under this President.
672	Pete Buttigieg	It’s why everything I’ve put forward, from Medicare for all who want it to the historic investments we’re going to make an infrastructure to dealing with climate change is fully paid for.
673	Pete Buttigieg	What comes to healthcare, you can do it in two moves.
674	Pete Buttigieg	Of course, my plan costs $1.5 trillion over a decade.
675	Pete Buttigieg	No small sum, but not the 20, 30, 40 that we’re hearing about from the others.
676	Pete Buttigieg	All I’ve got to do is two things.
677	Pete Buttigieg	Both of them are common sense.
678	Pete Buttigieg	Allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, and roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations.
679	Pete Buttigieg	Roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations and the wealthy that didn’t even need it.
680	Abby P	Senator Warren.
681	E. Warren	So I started this by talking about 36 million Americans including Americans with insurance who just can’t even afford to have a prescription filled.
682	E. Warren	We all talk about plans, healthcare plans that we have, and these plans are paid for.
683	E. Warren	The problem is that plans like the mayor’s and like the vice president’s is that they are an improvement.
684	E. Warren	They are an improvement over where we are right now.
685	E. Warren	Not going to be enough to cover prescriptions for 36 million people who can’t afford to get them filled.
686	E. Warren	What we need to do is make the commitment that we know where the money comes from.
687	E. Warren	We can ask those at the very top, the top 1% to pay a little more.
688	E. Warren	Those giant corporations like Chevron and Amazon who paid nothing in taxes.
689	E. Warren	We can have them pay, and we can go after the corporate tax cheats.
690	E. Warren	And when we do that, we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people.
691	E. Warren	Tax cheats.
692	E. Warren	And when we do that, we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people.
693	E. Warren	Yes, we build on the Affordable Care Act, but where we end up is we offer healthcare to all of our people, and we can offer it at no cost or low cost to all of them.
694	Abby P	Mayor Buttigieg.
695	Pete Buttigieg	It’s just not true that the plan I’m proposing is small.
696	Pete Buttigieg	We’ve got to move past a Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the treasury, that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate.
697	Pete Buttigieg	This would be a game changer.
698	Pete Buttigieg	This would be the biggest thing we’ve done to American healthcare in a half century.
699	Pete Buttigieg	Let’s measure the effects of our plans based on what they would do in our everyday lives and yes, we’re taking on costs on prescription drugs, we’ll have an out-of-pocket cap.
700	Pete Buttigieg	Even if you don’t get the subsidies that would make it free, a $250 monthly cap and here’s why it’s got to be monthly.
701	Pete Buttigieg	You ever been in that situation or known somebody who finds that they’ve got to defer a procedure or delay filling a prescription to try to have it happen in the right month because of when your out-of-pocket cap hits?
702	Pete Buttigieg	It makes no sense medically because most of us don’t experience the economy on an annual basis.
703	Pete Buttigieg	Our bills don’t come in every year.
704	Pete Buttigieg	They come in every month.
705	Pete Buttigieg	Same with our paychecks, biweekly or monthly.
706	Pete Buttigieg	That’s why we set this up in a way to solve the problem without running up 20, 30 $40 trillion bills.
707	Abby P	Senator Warren, your response.
708	E. Warren	Look, the numbers that the mayor’s offering just don’t add up.
709	E. Warren	The average family in America last year paid $12,000 in some combination of deductibles and copays, and uncovered expenses and fees.
710	E. Warren	You can’t cover that with the kind of money that the mayor is talking about.
711	E. Warren	The way we have to approach this is we’ve got to build this and we’ve got to build the alliances to make this happen.
712	E. Warren	I can bring down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin and take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the system immediately in costs.
713	E. Warren	We can get help to families, but we have to be willing to work together.
714	E. Warren	We can let people experience what healthcare is like when it’s you and your doctor, your mental health professional, your nurse practitioner with no insurance companies standing in the middle.
715	E. Warren	[crosstalk 01:09:12] When people try it and use it, then.
716	Abby P	Thank you, Senator Warren.
717	Abby P	Senator Klobuchar?
718	Amy Klobuchar	Senator Warren, you acknowledged that Medicare for all, that you couldn’t get there right away.
719	Amy Klobuchar	You got on the bill that said on page eight, which is why I didn’t get on it, that you would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance.
720	Amy Klobuchar	Then a few months ago, you said, “No, you’re going to wait a while to get there.” And I think that was some acknowledgement that maybe what we’re talking about is true.
721	Amy Klobuchar	And I don’t buy that it’s not enough.
722	Amy Klobuchar	It is a big, big step to say to people making $100,000 a year that, “Your premiums will be cut in half.” Which is what the nonprofit public option will do.
723	Amy Klobuchar	And if you talk, mayor Buttigieg, about Medicare and having negotiation, I actually have led that bill for years.
724	Amy Klobuchar	I have 34 co-sponsors.
725	Amy Klobuchar	As president, I can get it done.
726	Amy Klobuchar	That would allow Medicare to finally negotiate and lift the ban that big pharma got into law that says they can’t negotiate for better prices for our seniors.
727	Amy Klobuchar	I will it done.
728	Abby P	Senator Sanders, coming to you now.
729	Abby P	CNN reached out to Iowa Democratic voters for their most pressing questions.
730	Abby P	Edward from here in Des Moines writes, “Des Moines is an insurance town.
731	Abby P	What happens to all the health insurance industry here if there is Medicare for all?
732	Abby P	What happens to all the jobs and the livelihoods of the people that live in insurance towns like Des Moines?”
733	Bernie Sanders	We build into our Medicare for all program a transition fund of many, many billions of dollars that will provide for up to five years income and healthcare and job training for those people.
734	Bernie Sanders	But here is the issue, Tom Steyer made the point a moment ago.
735	Bernie Sanders	We are now spending twice as much per person on healthcare as do the people of any other country.
736	Bernie Sanders	That is insane.
737	Bernie Sanders	In some cases, 10 times more for prescription drugs.
738	Bernie Sanders	Why is that?
739	Bernie Sanders	Why is that?
740	Bernie Sanders	And the answer is the greed and corruption of the drug companies and the insurance companies.
741	Bernie Sanders	And if we want to do what every other major country on Earth does and guarantee people healthcare as a human right, not a privilege, you know what we have to do?
742	Bernie Sanders	We are finally going to have to stand up to the healthcare industry-
743	Tom Steyer	Can I respond to this?
744	Bernie Sanders	And end hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and profiteering.
745	Abby P	Mr. Steyer.
746	Tom Steyer	I just want to emphasize what Senator Sanders said.
747	Tom Steyer	This is not a complicated problem.
748	Tom Steyer	Between what Senator Warren and Senator Sanders said, it’s clear.
749	Tom Steyer	There are two problems.
750	Tom Steyer	We’re spending way too much because corporations own the system, and we’re not negotiating against those corporations and we’ve given tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations for decades.
751	Tom Steyer	That’s all this is.
752	Tom Steyer	We have corporations who are having their way with the American people and people are suffering.
753	Tom Steyer	Senator Warren is right.
754	Tom Steyer	This is cruelty for money.
755	Tom Steyer	In order to break this, we’re going to have to break the corporate stranglehold and solve both the tax and the negotiating problem.
756	Tom Steyer	That’s why I’m for term limits.
757	Tom Steyer	We need to redo Washington DC [crosstalk 01:12:27] and actually take back the government from the corporations who bought it.
758	Abby P	Thank you, Mr. Steyer.
759	Abby P	Vice President Biden?
760	Joe Biden	I would argue that the biggest breakthrough in recent time was us being able to do in our administration what five Democratic presidents couldn’t get done, and that is pass Obamacare.
761	Joe Biden	It was a big deal.
762	Joe Biden	Secondly, I would argue that the way you control drug prices is you limit what they can charge for those prices, you don’t have to pay the price.
763	Joe Biden	Limit what they can charge.
764	Joe Biden	If in fact they charge more than we set the price for, in fact, people can import from abroad assuming that it is safe.
765	Joe Biden	We in fact… It’s only yellow.
766	Joe Biden	Okay?
767	Joe Biden	And we can in fact do all of this and still provide people the option to stay the roughly 150 to 160 million Americans who like the negotiated plan they have with their employers, if they don’t like it or the employer gets rid of it, they can buy into a Medicare plan in the Biden plan.
768	Wolf Blitzer	Let’s talk a little bit more about prescription drugs right now.
769	Wolf Blitzer	Prescription drug prices in 2018, Americans spent $335 billion on prescription drugs alone.
770	Wolf Blitzer	That’s about $60 billion more than they paid a decade ago.
771	Wolf Blitzer	Senator Warren, you’ve called for the creation of a government-run drug manufacturer that would step in if there is a drug shortage or a price spike.
772	Wolf Blitzer	Why does it make sense for the government to manufacture drugs, especially when public trust in government is near historic lows?
773	E. Warren	So, let’s do this both ways.
774	E. Warren	What I also have said is I’m just going to use the power that is available, and I will do what a president can do all by herself on the very first day, and that is lower the prices of certain prescription drugs.
775	E. Warren	I will lower the price of insulin.
776	E. Warren	We already have the legal authority with the president to do that.
777	E. Warren	President just hasn’t picked up and used it.
778	E. Warren	I will lower the price of EpiPens, of HIV/AIDS drugs.
779	E. Warren	That’s going to bring a lot of relief to a lot of families immediately, but you know there are a whole lot of drugs, about 90% of drugs that are not under patent.
780	E. Warren	They’re generic drugs, but the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up.
781	E. Warren	So my view is let’s give them a little competition.
782	E. Warren	The government lets contracts for all kinds of things.
783	E. Warren	They let contracts to build buildings, they let contracts to build military weapons.
784	E. Warren	Let’s let the contracts out, put the contracts out so that we can put more generic drugs out there and drive down those prices.
785	E. Warren	This is a way to make markets work, not to try to move away from the market.
786	E. Warren	You don’t have to even use price controls.
787	E. Warren	The whole idea behind it is get some competition out there so the price of these drugs that are no longer under patent drops where it should be.
788	Wolf Blitzer	Senator Klobuchar, do you believe the government should be manufacturing drugs?
789	Amy Klobuchar	I am open to looking at it, but I would try these things first.
790	Amy Klobuchar	Number one, I mentioned the Medicare negotiation.
791	Amy Klobuchar	Number two, I have a plan, 137 things I’ve found that a president can do herself in the first 100 days without Congress that are legal, and one of those things is that you can start bringing in less expensive drugs from other countries.
792	Amy Klobuchar	Bernie and I had an amendment on this.
793	Amy Klobuchar	We got 14 Republican votes on it.
794	Amy Klobuchar	It was at midnight.
795	Amy Klobuchar	They might’ve not known what they were voting for, but we got that.
796	Amy Klobuchar	I now have an actual bill with Senator Grassley that does that, and I have a bill to get at what Elizabeth was talking about, which is to stop generics from taking money from big pharmaceuticals to keep their products off the market.
797	Amy Klobuchar	The issue here is that there are two pharma lobbyists for every member of Congress.
798	Brianne P	Thank you, Senator.
799	Amy Klobuchar	They think they own Washington.
800	Amy Klobuchar	They don’t own me.
801	Amy Klobuchar	And as president, I will get this done.
802	Brianne P	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
803	Brianne P	We’re going to turn now to childcare, a huge expense for many new families and a problem that’s especially acute in rural Iowa.
804	Brianne P	We have another question from an Iowa Democratic voter.
805	Brianne P	Mayor, Buttigieg, this is for you.
806	Brianne P	Tiffany from Clive writes, “As a young mom, I had to quit a job I love because childcare costs were taking up two thirds of my income.
807	Brianne P	Many families don’t have the option of quitting a job because that little bit of income is needed.
808	Brianne P	That leads to families using whatever care they can find, and sometimes the results are deadly as we’ve seen in Iowa over the last few years.
809	Brianne P	How will you prioritize accessing quality affordable childcare in your first 100 days in office?”
810	Pete Buttigieg	It makes no sense for childcare to cost two thirds of somebody’s income.
811	Pete Buttigieg	We’ve got to drive it to 7% or below, and zero for those families who are living in poverty.
812	Pete Buttigieg	But this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum.
813	Pete Buttigieg	I meet professionals who sometimes say that they’re working in order to be able to afford childcare in order to be able to be working.
814	Pete Buttigieg	It makes no sense and it must change and we shouldn’t be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality.
815	Pete Buttigieg	Subsidizing childcare and making sure that we are building up a workforce of people who are paid at a decent level to offer early childhood education as well as childcare at large.
816	Pete Buttigieg	We can do that and until we do this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap because when somebody’s like the the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason, she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in, and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career.
817	Brianne P	Senator Warren, your education plan includes tuition-free public college for all, but you impose an income limit for free childcare.
818	Brianne P	Why do your plans cover everyone for public college, but not childcare and early learning?
819	E. Warren	No, actually my plan is universal childcare for everyone.
820	E. Warren	It just has some people adding a small payment, but understand this about the plan.
821	E. Warren	I’ve been there.
822	E. Warren	You know, I remember when I was a young mom, I had two little kids and I had my first real university teaching job.
823	E. Warren	It was hard work.
824	E. Warren	I was excited, but it was childcare that nearly brought me down.
825	E. Warren	We went through one childcare after another and it just didn’t work.
826	E. Warren	If I hadn’t been saved by my Aunt Bee, I was ready to quit my job.
827	E. Warren	And I think about how many women of my generation just got knocked off the track and never got back on.
828	E. Warren	How many of my daughter’s generation get knocked off the track and don’t get back on.
829	E. Warren	How many mamas and daddies today are getting knocked off the track and never get back on.
830	E. Warren	I have a two-cent wealth tax so that we can cover childcare for all of our children and provide universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in America, and stop exploiting the people who do this valuable work, largely black and brown women.
831	E. Warren	We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America.
832	E. Warren	That’s an investment in our babies.
833	E. Warren	That’s an investment in their mamas and their daddies and it’s an investment in our teachers and in our economy.
834	Brianne P	Senator Sanders, will your universal-
835	E. Warren	It’s what we need to do.
836	Brianne P	Child care program be free for everyone regardless of income?
837	Bernie Sanders	Yeah.
838	Bernie Sanders	Let me just pick up on this childcare thing.
839	Bernie Sanders	Every psychologist in the world knows zero through four are the most important years of human life, intellectually and emotionally, and yet our current childcare system is an embarrassment.
840	Bernie Sanders	It is unaffordable.
841	Bernie Sanders	Childcare workers are making wages lower than McDonald’s workers.
842	Bernie Sanders	We need to fundamentally change priorities in America.
843	Bernie Sanders	We should not be one of the few countries that does not have universal, high quality, affordable childcare.
844	Bernie Sanders	We should not be one of the only major countries not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right.
845	Bernie Sanders	We should not be spending more than the 10 next countries on the military, hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for the fossil fuel industry.
846	Bernie Sanders	Tax breaks for billionaires, and then to tell the moms and dads in this country, “We cannot have [crosstalk 01:20:36] high-quality, affordable childcare.” That is wrong.
847	Brianne P	Vice President Biden, infant care is more expensive than in-state public college tuition in more than half the country.
848	Brianne P	Do you support free universal infant care?
849	Joe Biden	There should be free, universal infant care, but here’s the deal.
850	Joe Biden	I was a single parent too when my wife and daughter were killed.
851	Joe Biden	My two boys I had to raise.
852	Joe Biden	I was a young Senator.
853	Joe Biden	I just hadn’t been sworn in yet, and I was making $42,000 a year.
854	Joe Biden	I commuted every single solitary day to Wilmington, Delaware over 500 miles a day.
855	Joe Biden	Excuse me, 250 miles a day because I could not afford, but for my family, childcare.
856	Joe Biden	It was beyond my reach to be able to do it and that’s why there’s several things we do.
857	Joe Biden	When I tripled the amount of money for title one schools, every child three, four and five-years-old will in fact have full schooling.
858	Joe Biden	They’ll go to school and after school programs, which will release some of the burden.
859	Joe Biden	Secondly, I think we should have an $8,000 tax credit, which would put 7 million women back to work.
860	Joe Biden	They could afford to go to work and still care for their children as an $8,000 tax credit.
861	Joe Biden	I also believe that we should, in fact, for people who in fact are not able to afford any of the infant care to be able to get that care.
862	Joe Biden	But Bernie’s right.
863	Joe Biden	We have to raise the salaries of the people who are doing the care, and I provide for that as well.
864	Joe Biden	My time is up.
865	Joe Biden	I know, but I’m not going to go over like everybody.
866	Brianne P	Mayor Buttigieg, higher education is another huge expense for families.
867	Brianne P	You oppose free public college for all because you don’t want to make it “free for the kids of millionaires”.
868	Brianne P	But lots of public services are available to the kids of rich people like libraries and public schools.
869	Brianne P	Why do you draw the line at public colleges and universities?
870	Pete Buttigieg	Well, it’s simple.
871	Pete Buttigieg	We expect and hope for everyone to get through 12th grade.
872	Pete Buttigieg	It’s not the same for college.
873	Pete Buttigieg	Now again, I don’t want cost ever to be a barrier to somebody seeking to attend college, and under my plan it won’t be.
874	Pete Buttigieg	Matter of fact, for the first 80% of Americans by income, it is free at public colleges, but if you’re in that top income bracket, don’t get me wrong, I still wish you well.
875	Pete Buttigieg	I hope you succeed when you go to college.
876	Pete Buttigieg	I just need you to go ahead and pay that tuition because we could be using those dollars for something else.
877	Pete Buttigieg	There is a very real choice about what we do with every single taxpayer dollar that we raise.
878	Pete Buttigieg	And we need to be using that to support everybody, whether you go to college or not, making sure that Americans can thrive, investing in infrastructure and something that hasn’t come up very much tonight, but deserves a lot of attention.
879	Pete Buttigieg	Poverty, you know, the Poor People’s Campaign is marching on Iowa right now, calling on us to talk about this issue more.
880	Pete Buttigieg	They are driven by their faith.
881	Pete Buttigieg	I think, because even though in politics we’re supposed to talk middle-class, they know there’s no scripture that says, “As you’ve done under the middle-class, so you’ve done unto me.”
882	Pete Buttigieg	We got to be making sure that we target our tax dollars, where they will make the biggest difference.
883	Pete Buttigieg	And I don’t think subsidizing the children of millionaires and billionaires to pay absolutely zero in tuition of public colleges is the best use of those scarce [crosstalk 01:23:52] taxpayer dollars.
884	Brianne P	Senator Warren.
885	E. Warren	So look, the way I think we need to do this is we need a wealth tax in America.
886	E. Warren	We need to ask people with fortunes above $50 million to pay more, and that means that the lowliest millionaire that I would tax under this wealth tax would be paying about $19 million in the first year in taxes.
887	E. Warren	If he wants to send his kid to public university, then I’m okay with that because what we really need to talk about is the bigger economic picture here.
888	E. Warren	We need to be willing to put a wealth tax in place to ask those giant corporations that are not paying to pay because that’s how we build an economy and for those who want to talk about it, bring down the national debt.
889	E. Warren	You do universal child care, and you got a lot of mamas who can go to work.
890	E. Warren	A lot of mamas who can finish their education.
891	E. Warren	We make that investment in universal college.
892	E. Warren	We’ve got [crosstalk 01:24:44] people who would finish an education.
893	Brianne P	Thank you, Senator.
894	Brianne P	Senator Klobuchar.
895	Abby P	Yeah.
896	Abby P	You know, I [crosstalk 01:24:47] appreciate your thoughts, Elizabeth, but I want to step back.
897	Abby P	I actually think that some of our colleagues who want free college for all aren’t actually thinking big enough.
898	Abby P	I think what we have to look at is how we connect our education system with our economy.
899	Abby P	Where are our job openings, and what do we need?
900	Abby P	We are going to have over a million openings for home healthcare workers that we don’t know how to fill in the next 10 years.
901	Abby P	We are going to have open 100,000 jobs for nursing assistants.
902	Abby P	We, as my union friends know, we’re going to have over 70,000 openings for electricians.
903	Abby P	We’re not going to have a shortage of MBAs.
904	Abby P	We’re going to have a shortage of plumbers.
905	Abby P	So, when we look at that, then we step back.
906	Abby P	Where should our money go?
907	Abby P	It should go into K-12 it should go into free one and two-year degrees like my dad got like my sister got.
908	Abby P	[crosstalk 01:25:37] And then we double the Pell grants because we’re going to need four-year degrees so the money goes where it should go instead of two rich kids going to college.
909	Brianne P	Mr. Steyer, as a billionaire, should your children have been entitled to free public college?
910	Tom Steyer	No.
911	Tom Steyer	And let me say this, I was one of the people who talked about a wealth tax, almost a year-and-a-half ago.
912	Tom Steyer	I believe that the income inequality in this country is unbearable, unjust and unsupportable, and the redistribution of wealth to the richest Americans from everyone else has to end.
913	Tom Steyer	And I proposed a wealth tax almost a year-and-a-half ago to start to address it and to raise some of the money that we need.
914	Tom Steyer	But I want to go beyond this and go back to this question about education because we’re talking a lot about college.
915	Tom Steyer	But in fact, if you talk about the Poor People’s Campaign, you have to realize that for the youngest kids, they are getting an education that’s relative to the taxes in their neighborhoods.
916	Tom Steyer	We need to redistribute money so every kid has a chance.
917	Tom Steyer	So we’re not legislating inequality for the next generation.
918	Tom Steyer	And so, we actually invest in every single kid, specifically poor kids, specifically black kids, specifically brown kids.
919	Tom Steyer	We need to start using the money dramatically more for that.
920	Wolf Blitzer	We’ll be back with more from CNN’s Democratic Presidential Debate live from Des Moines, Iowa.
921	Wolf Blitzer	… Senate, launching the third trial of a US president.
922	Wolf Blitzer	The Republican-led Senate has signaled that it is likely to acquit him, Vice President Biden, if you’re the nominee, is it going to be harder to run against President Trump if he’s been acquitted and able to claim vindication, especially after what he said about your family?
923	Joe Biden	It’s irrelevant.
924	Joe Biden	There’s no choice but for Nancy Pelosi and the House to move.
925	Joe Biden	He has in fact committed impeachable offenses.
926	Joe Biden	Whether the Senate makes that judgment or not is for them to decide, and by the way, I’m told that I say we have to unite the country.
927	Joe Biden	It’s going to be harder after this trial.
928	Joe Biden	It may be, but look, you know, I understand how these guys are, this Republican party.
929	Joe Biden	They’ve gone after, Savage, my surviving son.
930	Joe Biden	Gone after me, told lies that your networks and others won’t even carry on television because they’re flat out lies, and I did my job.
931	Joe Biden	The question is whether or not he did his job.
932	Joe Biden	And he hasn’t done his job, and so it doesn’t really matter whether or not he’s going after me, I’ve got to be in a position that I think of the American people.
933	Joe Biden	I can’t hold a grudge.
934	Joe Biden	I have to be able to not only fight, but also heal, and as president of the United States, that’s what I will attempt to do, not withstanding that we’re going to be more division after he’s defeated by me this next time.
935	Wolf Blitzer	Senator Klobuchar, going to be a juror in the trial in the Senate that’s about to start.
936	Wolf Blitzer	Do you worry President Trump will be emboldened by acquittal?
937	Amy Klobuchar	No.
938	Amy Klobuchar	We have a constitutional duty to perform here.
939	Amy Klobuchar	And when I look at what the issue is, it’s whether or not we’re going to be able to have witnesses.
940	Amy Klobuchar	We’ve asked for only four people as witnesses, and if our Republican colleagues won’t allow those witnesses, they may as well give the president a crown and a scepter.
941	Amy Klobuchar	They may as well make him king.
942	Amy Klobuchar	And last time I checked, our country was founded on this idea that we didn’t want to be ruled by a king.
943	Amy Klobuchar	And I think the best way to think about this trial and what we’re facing in this election is a story of a man from Primghar, Iowa.
944	Amy Klobuchar	His name was Joseph Welch.
945	Amy Klobuchar	He came from humble beginnings, a son of immigrants.
946	Amy Klobuchar	He became the army counsel, and he was the one that went to the Joseph McCarthy hearings.
947	Amy Klobuchar	And when McCarthy was blacklisting people and going after people because of their political beliefs or supposed political beliefs, there was only one man.
948	Amy Klobuchar	Everyone that was afraid, they’re afraid of being blacklisted.
949	Amy Klobuchar	Joseph Welch, he stood up and looked at McCarthy and said, “Have you no sense of decency, sir?
950	Amy Klobuchar	Have you no sense of decency?”
951	Amy Klobuchar	This is a decency check on our government.
952	Amy Klobuchar	This is a patriotism check.
953	Amy Klobuchar	Not only is this trial that-
954	Wolf Blitzer	Thank you.
955	Amy Klobuchar	But also this election, and no matter if you agree with everyone here on the stage, I say this to [crosstalk 01:34:52] Americans, you know this is a decency check on this president.
956	Wolf Blitzer	Mr. Steyer, you’ve spent millions and millions of dollars telling the American people that President Trump deserves to be impeached.
957	Wolf Blitzer	Will it have been worth it if he’s been impeached but not removed from office?
958	Tom Steyer	Well Wolf, actually what I’ve done is to organize a petition drive of eight-and-a-half million Americans to sign and say this president deserves to be impeached and removed from office.
959	Tom Steyer	And those eight-and-a-half million people have called their Congress people, have emailed their Congress people and have actually dragged Washington DC to see that in fact, this is a question of right and wrong and not of political expediency.
960	Tom Steyer	So, if you ask me whether standing up for what’s right in America, standing up for the American people and our safety, standing up for the constitution, whether doing that and trying to bring the truth in front of the American people in televised hearings so we can decide what the truth is for ourselves, if you think that that isn’t worth it, then you don’t share the idea that I do about what America’s about.
961	Tom Steyer	Standing up for what’s right is always worth it, Wolf, and I will never back down from that.
962	Wolf Blitzer	Senator Warren, a Senate trial is expected to keep you in Washington in the weeks leading up to the Iowa caucuses here.
963	Wolf Blitzer	How big of a problem is that for you as you’re making your closing pitch to voters here?
964	E. Warren	Look, some things are more important than politics.
965	E. Warren	I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America.
966	E. Warren	It says that no one is above the law that includes the president of the United States.
967	E. Warren	If we have an impeachment trial, I will be there because it is my responsibility.
968	E. Warren	But understand this, what that impeachment trial is going to show once again to the American people, and something we should all be talking about, is the corruption of this administration.
969	E. Warren	That’s what lies at the heart of it.
970	E. Warren	It is about Donald Trump putting Donald Trump first, not the American people, not the interests of the United States of America, not even in helping Ukraine defend against Russia.
971	E. Warren	It is about him helping himself.
972	E. Warren	That is what we need to do to win this election.
973	E. Warren	We need to draw that distinction and show that as Democrats, we’re not going to be the people who are just out for the big corporations, people who want to help themselves, that we are going to be the party that is willing to fight on the side of the people.
974	E. Warren	That’s why we’re here.
975	Brianne P	Let’s turn now to the climate crisis.
976	Brianne P	Here in Iowa, parts of the state remain underwater after record-breaking flooding began last spring, racking up an estimated $2 billion in damages.
977	Brianne P	Today, many Iowans are still displaced from their homes.
978	Brianne P	Mayor Buttigieg, you’ve talked about helping people move from areas at high risk of flooding, but what do you do about farms and factories that simply can’t be moved?
979	Pete Buttigieg	That’s why we have to fight climate change with such urgency.
980	Pete Buttigieg	Climate change has come to America from coast to coast.
981	Pete Buttigieg	We’re seeing it in Iowa.
982	Pete Buttigieg	We’ve seen it in historic floods in my community.
983	Pete Buttigieg	I had to activate our emergency operation center for a once in a [inaudible 01:38:04] flood.
984	Pete Buttigieg	Then two years later, had to do the same thing.
985	Pete Buttigieg	In Australia there are literally tornadoes made of fire taking place.
986	Pete Buttigieg	This is no longer theoretical.
987	Pete Buttigieg	This is no longer off in the future.
988	Pete Buttigieg	We have got to act, yes to adapt, to make sure our communities are more resilient, to make sure our economy is ready for the consequences that are going to happen one way or the other.
989	Pete Buttigieg	But we also have to ensure that we don’t allow this to get any worse.
990	Pete Buttigieg	And if we get it right, farmers will be a huge part of the solution.
991	Pete Buttigieg	We need to reach out to the very people who have sometimes been made to feel that accepting climate science would be a defeat for them.
992	Pete Buttigieg	Whether we’re talking about farmers, or industrial workers in my community, and make clear that we need to enlist them-
993	Brianne P	But Mayor Buttigieg-
994	Pete Buttigieg	In the national project to do something about this.
995	Brianne P	So, clarify.
996	Brianne P	What do you do about farms and factories that cannot be relocated?
997	Pete Buttigieg	We are going to have to use federal funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose li-
998	Pete Buttigieg	….
999	Pete Buttigieg	Funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose lives will inevitably be impacted further by the increased severity and the increased frequency.
1000	Pete Buttigieg	And by the way, that is happening to farms, that is happening to factories and that disproportionally happens to black and brown Americans, which is why equity and environmental justice have to be at the core of our climate plan going forward.
1001	Brianne P.	Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.
1002	Brianne P.	Mr Steyer, what’s your response?
1003	Tom Steyer	Look, what you’re talking about is what’s called managed retreat.
1004	Tom Steyer	It’s basically saying, we’re going to have to move things because this crisis is out of control and it’s unbelievably expensive.
1005	Tom Steyer	And of course, we’re going to come to the rescue of Americans who are in trouble.
1006	Tom Steyer	But this is why climate is my number one priority.
1007	Tom Steyer	And I’m still shocked that I’m the only person on this stage who will say this.
1008	Tom Steyer	I would declare a state of emergency on day one on climate.
1009	Tom Steyer	I would do it from the standpoint of environmental justice and make sure we go to the black and brown communities where you can’t breathe the air or drink the water that comes out of the tap safely.
1010	Tom Steyer	But I also know this, we’re going to create millions of good paying union jobs across this country.
1011	Tom Steyer	It’s going to be the biggest job program in American history.
1012	Tom Steyer	So I know we have to do it, I know we can do it and I know that we can to do it in a way that makes us healthier, that makes us better paid and is more just.
1013	Tom Steyer	But the truth of the matter is, we’re going to have to do it and we’re going to have to make the whole world come along with us and it’s going to have to be priority one.
1014	Brianne P.	Mr. Steyer, to clarify, you say you’re the climate change candidate, but you made your $1.6 billion in part by investing in coal, oil, and gas.
1015	Brianne P.	So are you the right messenger on this topic?
1016	Tom Steyer	I absolutely am.
1017	Tom Steyer	Look, we invested in every part of the economy and over 10 years ago I realized that there was something going on that had to do with fossil fuels, that we had to change.
1018	Tom Steyer	So I divested from fossil fuels.
1019	Tom Steyer	I took the giving pledge to give most of my money away while I’m alive.
1020	Tom Steyer	And for 12 years, I’ve been fighting the climate crisis.
1021	Tom Steyer	I’ve beat oil companies in terms of clean air laws.
1022	Tom Steyer	I’ve stopped fossil fuel plants in Oxnard, California.
1023	Tom Steyer	I fought the Keystone Pipeline.
1024	Tom Steyer	I have a history of over a decade of leading the climate fight successfully-
1025	Brianne P.	Thank you Mr. Steyer.
1026	Tom Steyer	So actually, yes, I am the person here who has the chops and the history that says I’ll make it priority one because I’ve been doing it for a long time.
1027	Brianne P.	Thank you.
1028	Brianne P.	Mr Steyer.
1029	Brianne P.	Senator Warren, President Trump is rolling back major environmental rules to allow pipelines and other major infrastructure projects to be built without strict environmental review.
1030	Brianne P.	Will you restore those protections and in a way that the next president can’t overturn?
1031	E. Warren	Yes.
1032	E. Warren	Climate change threatens every living thing on this planet and the urgency of the moment cannot be overstated.
1033	E. Warren	I will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day.
1034	E. Warren	I will roll back the environmental changes that Donald Trump is putting in place.
1035	E. Warren	I will stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands and offshore drilling.
1036	E. Warren	That’ll help us get in the right directions.
1037	E. Warren	I’ll bring in the farmers.
1038	E. Warren	Farmers can be part of the climate solution.
1039	E. Warren	We should see this though for the problem it is.
1040	E. Warren	Mr. Steyer talks about it being problem number one.
1041	E. Warren	Understand this, we have known about this climate crisis for decades.
1042	E. Warren	Back in the 1990s, we were calling it global warming, but we knew what it was.
1043	E. Warren	Democrats and Republicans back then were working together because no one wanted a problem.
1044	E. Warren	But you know what happened?
1045	E. Warren	The industry came in and said, we can make big money if we keep them divided and make no change.
1046	E. Warren	Priority number one has to be taking back our government from the corruption.
1047	E. Warren	That is the only way we will make progress on climate, on gun safety, on healthcare, on all of the issues-
1048	Brianne P.	Thank Senator Warren.
1049	E. Warren	That matter to us.
1050	Brianne P.	Senator Klobuchar, some of your competitors on this stage have called for an all out ban on fracking, you haven’t, why not?
1051	Amy Klobuchar	Well, first of all, I would note that I have a 100% rating from the League of Conservation Voters and that is because I have stood tall on every issue that we have talked about up here, when it comes to this administration, this Trump administration, trying to reverse environmental protections.
1052	Amy Klobuchar	I think it is going to lead to so many problems and one thing that hasn’t been raised by the way is the rules on methane, which is actually one of the most environmentally dangerous hazards that they have recently embarked on.
1053	Amy Klobuchar	And I would bring those rules back as well as a number of other ones.
1054	Amy Klobuchar	When it comes to the issue of fracking, I actually see natural gas as a transition fuel.
1055	Amy Klobuchar	It’s a transition fuel to where we get to carbon neutral.
1056	Amy Klobuchar	Nearly every one of us has a plan that is very similar and that is to get to carbon neutral by 2045 to 2050.
1057	Amy Klobuchar	To get to by 2030 do a 45% reduction.
1058	Amy Klobuchar	And I want to add one thing that no one’s really answered.
1059	Amy Klobuchar	When we do this, we have to make sure that we make people whole and when we put a tax on carbon, which we will do, either through CAP and trade or through a renewable electricity standard or through a fee on carbon.
1060	Brianne P.	Thank you Senator Klobuchar-
1061	Amy Klobuchar	Then we have to make sure the money goes back to the people that will be hurt by it.
1062	Amy Klobuchar	[crosstalk 01:44:17] To help with their energy bills and to bring jobs to areas that will lose jobs.
1063	Brianne P.	Senator Sanders.
1064	Bernie Sanders	Thank you.
1065	Bernie Sanders	Let’s be clear, if we as a nation do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, not by 2050, not by 2040, but unless we lead the world right now, not easy stuff, the planet we are leaving our kids will be uninhabitable and unhealthy.
1066	Bernie Sanders	We are seeing Australia burning.
1067	Bernie Sanders	We saw California burning.
1068	Bernie Sanders	The drought here in Iowa is going to make it harder for farmers to produce the food that we need.
1069	Bernie Sanders	This is of course a national crisis.
1070	Bernie Sanders	I’ve introduced legislation to indicate it’s an actual crisis.
1071	Bernie Sanders	We have got to take on the fossil fuel industry and all of their lies and tell them that their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.
1072	Bernie Sanders	That’s what the Green New Deal does.
1073	Bernie Sanders	That’s what my legislation does and that is what we have to do.
1074	Brianne P.	Vice President Biden, your response.
1075	Joe Biden	My response is back in 1986, I introduced the first climate change bill and check Politifacts, they said it was a game changer.
1076	Joe Biden	I’ve been fighting this for a long time.
1077	Joe Biden	I headed up the Recovery Act, which put more money into moving away from fossil fuels to solar and wind energy than ever has occurred in the history of America.
1078	Joe Biden	Look, what we have to do is we have to act right away and the way we act right away is immediately.
1079	Joe Biden	If I’m elected president, I’ll reinstate all the mileage standards that existed in our administration, which were taken down, that’s 12 billion gallons of gasoline, barrels of gasoline to be saved immediately.
1080	Joe Biden	And with regard to those folks who in fact are going to be victimized by what’s already happened.
1081	Joe Biden	We should be investing in infrastructure that raises roads, makes sure that we’re in a position where we have … every new highway build is a green highway.
1082	Joe Biden	[inaudible 01:46:18] 550,000 charging stations.
1083	Joe Biden	We can create, and this is where I agree with Tom, we can create millions of good paying jobs.
1084	Joe Biden	We’re the only country in the world that’s ever take great crisis and turn it into a great opportunity.
1085	Joe Biden	And one of the ways to do it is with farmers here in Iowa, by making them the first group in the world to get to net-zero emissions by paying them for planting and absorbing carbon in their fields right away.
1086	Joe Biden	There’s more to say, but I know-
1087	Abby Phillips	A key part of your mission in this primary is going to be to prove to democratic voters that you’re strong enough to take on Donald Trump.
1088	Abby Phillips	Each of you face unique challenges in doing that.
1089	Abby Phillips	Mayor Buttigieg, you say you’ve had trouble earning the support of black voters because you’re unknown but you’ve been campaigning for a year now and polling shows you with next to no black support.
1090	Abby Phillips	Support that you’ll need in order to beat Donald Trump.
1091	Abby Phillips	Is it possible that black voters have gotten to know you and have simply decided to choose another candidate?
1092	Pete Buttigieg	The black voters who know me best are supporting me.
1093	Pete Buttigieg	That’s why I have the most support in South Bend.
1094	Pete Buttigieg	It’s why among elected black officials in my community, who have gotten into this race, by far most of them are supporting me.
1095	Pete Buttigieg	And now nationally, I am proud that my campaign has co-chaired by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and to have support right here in Iowa from some of the most recognizable black elected leaders.
1096	Pete Buttigieg	From Mayor Hart of Waterloo to former Representative Berry in Black Hawk County.
1097	Pete Buttigieg	Now, the biggest mistake we could make is to take black votes for granted and I never will.
1098	Pete Buttigieg	The reason I have the support I do is not because any voter thinks that I’m perfect.
1099	Pete Buttigieg	It’s because of the work that we have done facing some of the toughest issues that communities can.
1100	Pete Buttigieg	Not from the luxury of a of a debate or a television panel or a committee room, but on the ground.
1101	Pete Buttigieg	Issues from poverty to justice in policing.
1102	Pete Buttigieg	And I’m proud to say we’ve been nationally recognized for our work as a race informed city on delivering greater economic justice.
1103	Pete Buttigieg	That we have reduced use of force by leading the region in transparency around the use of force in policing.
1104	Pete Buttigieg	Of course, there is a much longer way to go, in my community and around the country.
1105	Pete Buttigieg	But I will be a president whose personal commitment is to continue doing this work.
1106	Abby Phillips	Senator Sanders, you call yourself a democratic socialist, but more than two thirds of voters say they are not enthusiastic about voting for a socialist.
1107	Abby Phillips	Doesn’t that put your chances of beating Donald Trump at risk?
1108	Bernie Sanders	Nope, not at all.
1109	Bernie Sanders	And that is because the campaign that we are going to run will expose the fraudulency of who Donald Trump is.
1110	Bernie Sanders	Donald Trump is corrupt.
1111	Bernie Sanders	He is a pathological liar and he is a fraud.
1112	Bernie Sanders	Now when Trump talks about socialism, what he talks about is giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry.
1113	Bernie Sanders	Donald Trump as a businessman, received $800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury housing.
1114	Bernie Sanders	My democratic socialism says healthcare is a human right.
1115	Bernie Sanders	We’re going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.
1116	Bernie Sanders	We’re going to make public colleges and universities tuition free.
1117	Bernie Sanders	We’re going to have a Green New Deal and create up to $20 million, saving the planet for our children and our grandchildren.
1118	Bernie Sanders	We are going to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance company.
1119	Bernie Sanders	That is what democratic socialism is about and that will win this election.
1120	Abby Phillips	Mr. Steyer, you’ve spent more than $100 million of your own dollars on television ads.
1121	Abby Phillips	How do you convince voters that you’re more than just your money?
1122	Tom Steyer	Look, we know how Donald Trump is going to run for president.
1123	Tom Steyer	He’s going to run on the economy.
1124	Tom Steyer	He’s already told Americans last month in Florida, you don’t like me and I don’t like you, but you’re all going to vote for me because the Democrats are going to destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control.
1125	Tom Steyer	So let’s be clear, I started a business by myself in one room.
1126	Tom Steyer	I didn’t inherit a penny from my parents.
1127	Tom Steyer	I spent 30 years building that business into a multi-billion dollar international business.
1128	Tom Steyer	Then I walked away from it and took the giving pledge and started organizing coalitions of ordinary Americans to take on unchecked corporate power.
1129	Tom Steyer	But whoever is going to beat Mr. Trump is going to have to beat him on the economy and I have the experience and the expertise to show that he’s a [inaudible 01:50:58] and a fraud.
1130	Tom Steyer	Look, Mayor Pete has three years as an analyst at McKinsey.
1131	Tom Steyer	I have 30 years of international business experience, I can beat Trump on the economy.
1132	Tom Steyer	We’re going to have to beat him on the economy and I look forward to taking him down in the fall on the debate stage.
1133	Abby Phillips	Mayor Buttigieg.
1134	Pete Buttigieg	You demoted me, I was actually an associate but that’s okay.
1135	Pete Buttigieg	It was not the biggest part of my career, but I am ready to take on this president on the economy because I am from the exact kind of industrial Midwestern community that he pretends to speak to and has proven to turn his back on and guided that community through a historic transformation.
1136	Pete Buttigieg	When at the beginning of the decade I took office, we were described as a dying city.
1137	Pete Buttigieg	I’m ready to take on Donald Trump because when he gets to the tough talk and the chest thumping, he’ll have to stand next to an American war veteran and explain how he pretended bone spurs made him ineligible to serve.
1138	Pete Buttigieg	And if and if he keeps trying to use religion … If a guy like Donald Trump keeps trying to use religion to somehow recruit Christianity into the G.O.P., I will be standing there not afraid to talk about a different way to answer the call of faith and insist that God does not belong to a political party.
1139	Pete Buttigieg	I am ready to take on this president on every front.
1140	Abby Phillips	Thank you.
1141	Abby Phillips	Senator Klobuchar, you’re pitching yourself as a practical candidate who can get things done.
1142	Abby Phillips	And even tonight you’ve dismissed some of the ideas that are offered in this primary as pipe dreams.
1143	Abby Phillips	How are you going to inspire democratic voters with a message of pragmatism?
1144	Amy Klobuchar	Our voters, actually all Americans have seen now a number of years of a guy that has, I think, told over 15,000 lies.
1145	Amy Klobuchar	He is someone that literally has a rap sheet of divisive rhetoric.
1146	Amy Klobuchar	And I think what Americans want is something different.
1147	Amy Klobuchar	I am going to be able to stand across from him on that debate stage and say to my friends in Iowa, the Midwest is not flyover country for me, I live here.
1148	Amy Klobuchar	I’m going to be able to look at him and say, you’ve treated these workers and farmers like poker chips.
1149	Amy Klobuchar	For me, these are my friends and these are my neighbors.
1150	Amy Klobuchar	I’m going to be able to look at him and say, you know what?
1151	Amy Klobuchar	You got $413 million over the course of your career, that’s how you built your fortune.
1152	Amy Klobuchar	And what I’m going to say is this, my grandpa worked 1500 feet underground in the iron ore mines, saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to a two year community college.
1153	Amy Klobuchar	That’s my family trust.
1154	Amy Klobuchar	And when you have been given an opportunity like that, you go into the world, not with the sense of entitlement, Donald Trump, but with a sense of obligation.
1155	Abby Phillips	Thank you.
1156	Abby Phillips	Senator Warren, what do you say to voters who like your policies but they’re worried they will scare away swing voters you need to win this race in November?
1157	E. Warren	So I was born and raised in Oklahoma.
1158	E. Warren	I have three older brothers who are all retired, who are all back there still.
1159	E. Warren	And two of my three brothers are Republicans.
1160	E. Warren	And sure, there are a lot of things we disagree on and we can take to our corners and do the Democratic, Republican talking points.
1161	E. Warren	But the truth is there’s a whole lot we agree on.
1162	E. Warren	You know, my brothers just furious over Chevron and Eli Lilly and Amazon, that are giant corporations make billions of dollars in taxes … make billions of dollars in profits and pay nothing in taxes.
1163	E. Warren	My brother said, “I don’t get this.
1164	E. Warren	I have to pay my taxes.
1165	E. Warren	Somebody has to keep the roads paved and the schools open and pay for our defense.”
1166	E. Warren	They understand that we have an America right now that’s working great for those at the top.
1167	E. Warren	It’s just not working for anyone else.
1168	E. Warren	We have a chance to unite, unite as Democrats, but also with independents and Republicans, who are sick of living in a country that’s working great for the politicians that are taking the money.
1169	E. Warren	It’s working great for the lobbyists.
1170	E. Warren	It’s working great for the corporate executives.
1171	E. Warren	It’s just not working for everyone else.
1172	E. Warren	I’m building the grassroots movement, leading the fight.
1173	E. Warren	We’re going to make this America work for everyone else.
1174	E. Warren	That is how we’re going to beat Donald Trump.
1175	Abby Phillips	Vice President Biden, the eventual nominee will face President Trump, who has no problem mocking people using insulting nicknames, slinging mud, and telling lies.
1176	Abby Phillips	The debate against him will make tonight’s debate look like child’s play.
1177	Abby Phillips	Are you prepared for that?
1178	Joe Biden	I am prepared for that.
1179	Joe Biden	Look, I’ve been the object of his affection now more than anybody else on this stage.
1180	Joe Biden	I’ve taken all the hits he can deliver and I’m getting better in the polls, my going up.
1181	Joe Biden	And by the way, I have overwhelming support from the African American community, overwhelming more than everybody else in this operation, number one.
1182	Joe Biden	Number two, working class people, where I come from in Pennsylvania and the places I come from in Delaware, I have great support.
1183	Joe Biden	I have support across the board and I’m not worried about taking on Donald Trump at all.
1184	Joe Biden	And with regard to the economy, I can hardly wait to have that debate with him.
1185	Joe Biden	Where I come from, the neighborhoods I come from, they’re in real trouble, working class people and middle class people.
1186	Joe Biden	When the middle class does well, working class has a way up and the wealthy do well.
1187	Joe Biden	But what’s happening now?
1188	Joe Biden	They’re being clobbered, they’re being killed.
1189	Joe Biden	They now have a situation where if they … the vast majority believe their children will never reach the stage that they’ve reached an economic security.
1190	Joe Biden	I love that debate because the American public is getting clobbered.
1191	Joe Biden	The wealthy are the only ones doing well, period.
1192	Joe Biden	I’m looking forward to the economic debate.
1193	Wolf Blitzer	We’ll be right back with more from CNN’s Democratic presidential debate, live from Des Moines, Iowa.
1194	Wolf Blitzer	Stay right here.
1195	Wolf Blitzer	….
1196	Wolf Blitzer	Iowa.
1197	Wolf Blitzer	Time now for closing statements, you each have one minute.
1198	Wolf Blitzer	Senator Klobuchar, let’s begin with you.
1199	Amy Klobuchar	Donald Trump thinks this is all about him.
1200	Amy Klobuchar	I think it’s about you.
1201	Amy Klobuchar	It’s not about his resorts or his tweets or even his ego.
1202	Amy Klobuchar	It is about your healthcare.
1203	Amy Klobuchar	It is about your schools.
1204	Amy Klobuchar	It is about your lives and your future.
1205	Amy Klobuchar	So if you want to do something about racial justice and immigration reform and climate change and gun safety, we need a candidate who is actually going to bring people with her.
1206	Amy Klobuchar	I have won every race, every place, every time.
1207	Amy Klobuchar	I have gotten the highest voter turnout in the country when I’ve led the ticket.
1208	Amy Klobuchar	I have passed more bills as the lead Democrat than anyone who’s in Congress that’s running for president.
1209	Amy Klobuchar	I believe that we need a president that’s going to look out for you.
1210	Amy Klobuchar	It is easy to hurl insults.
1211	Amy Klobuchar	It is easy to draw lines in the sand and sketch out grand ideological sketches that will never see the light of day.
1212	Amy Klobuchar	What is hard is bringing people together and finding common ground instead of scorched earth.
1213	Amy Klobuchar	What is hard is the work of governing.
1214	Amy Klobuchar	So if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me.
1215	Amy Klobuchar	Join me at amyklobuchar.com.
1216	Wolf Blitzer	Mr. Steyer.
1217	Tom Steyer	I know that Iowans are going to caucus within three weeks and I want to tell you how I feel about the American people.
1218	Tom Steyer	Look, I played team sports my entire life.
1219	Tom Steyer	The bond between teammates is deep and emotional and full of love and as far as I’m concerned, the American people are my teammates.
1220	Tom Steyer	And if there’s one thing I will not permit, it is someone to run down the field and kick my teammate in the face.
1221	Tom Steyer	And that is exactly what I’ve seen over the last seven years traveling around this country, seeing these Republicans led by Mr. Trump, basically kicking the American people in the face.
1222	Tom Steyer	I am prepared to take on Mr. Trump on the debate stage and take him down on the economy.
1223	Tom Steyer	But I am asking for your support because I know that if I’m going to be a good teammate to you and give you absolutely everything without any compromise, I need the support of you on caucus night so I can turn around and together we can take back this country and together we can save the world.
1224	Wolf Blitzer	Mayor Buttigieg.
1225	Pete Buttigieg	This is our moment.
1226	Pete Buttigieg	This is our one shot to defeat Donald Trump and to do it by such a big margin that we send Trumpism into the dustbin of history too.
1227	Pete Buttigieg	Well, we cannot take the risk with so much on the line of trying to confront this president with the same Washington mindset and political warfare that led us to this point.
1228	Pete Buttigieg	If you are watching this at home and you were exhausted by the spectacle of division and dysfunction, I’m asking you to join me to help turn the page on our politics.
1229	Pete Buttigieg	You’re seeing the President boast about the Dow Jones wondering whether any of that will ever get to your kitchen table.
1230	Pete Buttigieg	Join me if you’re a voter of color feeling taken for granted by politics as usual.
1231	Pete Buttigieg	Join me if you’re used to voting for the other party, but right now cannot look your kids in the eye and explain this president to them, join me.
1232	Pete Buttigieg	We have a chance to change all of this if we can summon the courage to break from the past.
1233	Pete Buttigieg	That is why I am running for president.
1234	Pete Buttigieg	It is why I’m asking you to caucus for me on February 3rd and I hope that you will go to peteforamerica.com and join me in this effort.
1235	Wolf Blitzer	Senator Warren.
1236	E. Warren	So, much is broken in this country.
1237	E. Warren	I sat here in the break and just made notes about many of the things we didn’t get to talk about tonight.
1238	E. Warren	How the disability community is struggling for true equality, how gun violence and active shooter drills worry every mother in this country.
1239	E. Warren	How children are living in poverty and seeing their life chances shrink.
1240	E. Warren	How trans women, particularly trans women of color are at risk.
1241	E. Warren	Black infant mortality, climate change that particularly hits black and brown communities.
1242	E. Warren	People who are being crushed by student loan debt, farmers who are barely holding on, people struggling with mental illness.
1243	E. Warren	And yet I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope and it’s filled with hope because I see this as our moment in history, our moment when no one is left on the sidelines.
1244	E. Warren	Our moment when we understand that it comes to us to decide the future of this country.
1245	E. Warren	Our moment when we build the movement to make real change, hope and courage.
1246	E. Warren	That is how I will make you proud every day as your nominee and as the first woman president of the United States of America.
1247	Wolf Blitzer	Senator Sanders.
1248	Bernie Sanders	It’s been a good debate, but we haven’t asked the major question.
1249	Bernie Sanders	The major question is how does it happen in the richest country in the history of the world that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck, trying to get by, $9, $10 bucks an hour?
1250	Bernie Sanders	How does it happen that when the top one percent owns more wealth than the bottom 92%, half a million people are sleeping out on the streets tonight?
1251	Bernie Sanders	How does it happen in this great country we are the only major nation not to guarantee healthcare to all.
1252	Bernie Sanders	How does that happen that we have a child care system which is dysfunctional, a criminal justice system which is broken and racist, an immigration system that needs reform.
1253	Bernie Sanders	This is the moment when we have got to think big, not small.
1254	Bernie Sanders	This is the moment where we have got to have the courage to take on the one percent, take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create an economy and create a government that works for all of us, not just the one percent.
1255	Bernie Sanders	Thank you.
1256	Wolf Blitzer	Vice President Biden.
1257	Joe Biden	Character is on the ballot this time around.
1258	Joe Biden	The American character is on the ballot.
1259	Joe Biden	Not what Donald Trump is spewing out, the hate, the xenophobia, the racism.
1260	Joe Biden	That’s not who we are as a nation.
1261	Joe Biden	Everyone in this country is entitled to be treated with respect and dignity.
1262	Joe Biden	Every single solitary person has to have in a position that may in fact we treat them with decency.
1263	Joe Biden	It’s about fundamental, basic decency.
1264	Joe Biden	We in the United States of America can put up with … we can overcome four years of Donald Trump, but eight years of Donald Trump will be an absolute disaster and fundamentally change this nation.
1265	Joe Biden	We have to restore America’s soul.
1266	Joe Biden	As I’ve said from the moment I announced, it is in jeopardy under this President of the United States.
1267	Joe Biden	We lead the world when we lead by example, not by our power.
1268	Joe Biden	We in fact have to regain the respect of the world in order to be able to change things.
1269	Joe Biden	Ladies and gentlemen, we are in a position right now we have to remember who we are.
1270	Joe Biden	This is the United States of America.
1271	Joe Biden	There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity to do if we do it together, let’s go do it.
1272	Wolf Blitzer	Candidates, thank you very, very much.
1273	Wolf Blitzer	That concludes the first Democratic presidential debate of 2020.
1274	Wolf Blitzer	The Iowa caucuses are only 20 days away.
1275	Wolf Blitzer	Tune into CNN for continuing coverage of this presidential election.
1276	Wolf Blitzer	Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo pickup our coverage right now.
