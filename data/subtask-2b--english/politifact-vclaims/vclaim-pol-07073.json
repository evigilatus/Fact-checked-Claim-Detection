Don Young, R-Alaska, provoked a firestorm with a series of comments about suicide. It\u2019s a significant issue in his home state: In recent years, Alaska has experienced suicide at roughly twice the national rate.\nThe controversy began when Young spoke to more than 100 students and staff at Wasilla High School on Oct. 21, 2014, just days after a student at the school had committed suicide.\nYoung, according to news reports, told an audience that suicide shows a lack of support from friends and family -- a claim that inspired an immediate negative response from some in the audience.\n\"A friend of the victim shouted to Young that a disease, depression, was at the root of suicide,\" the Alaska Dispatch News reported. \"Young bristled at the interruption and responded to the student with profanity.\"\nLater that day, Young\u2019s office released a statement saying the congressman should \"have taken a much more sensitive approach.\" But Young doubled down in an event the next day, appearing before 100 people at a senior center.\nAccording a recording excerpted in the Dispatch News, Young told the group, \"When people had to work and had to provide and had to keep warm by putting participation in cutting wood and catching the fish and killing the animals, we didn\u2019t have the suicide problem.\" Suicide, he added, comes from federal government largesse \"saying you are not worth anything but you are going to get something for nothing.\"\nWe wondered: Is there proof that suicide in Alaska has been linked to receiving government payments?\nBefore digging any deeper, we should note that Young\u2019s office has since apologized for his comment.\nIn a statement to PolitiFact on Oct. 23, Young\u2019s office said he \"discussed what he believes are leading causes of youth suicide in our state, including the impact of drugs and alcohol, depression, a feeling of worthlessness, and a lack of support systems. Congressman Young did not mean to upset anyone with his well-intentioned message, and in light of the tragic events affecting the Wasilla High School community, he should have taken a much more sensitive approach. \u2026 Issues like suicide and domestic violence cannot be discussed in isolation or generalities. Each and every case is different, and should be addressed in that manner.\"\nThen, a day later, in a speech to the Alaska Federation of Natives Convention, Young \"shared his sincere and honest apology\" and said the suicide of a nephew \"may have caused me to mangle some of my statements.\"\nStill, since suicide is a significant problem in Alaska, we thought the substance of his original comment was worth a closer look.\nExplaining suicide in Alaska\nAccording to the state Department of Health and Social Services, the age-adjusted rate for suicide in Alaska between 2003 and 2010 was almost twice the national average. In 2010, suicide ranked as the sixth-leading cause of death in Alaska and the leading cause of death among persons aged 15\u201324 years.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Fournier\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main reason for Alaska\u2019s high rate is the unusually high frequency of suicide among Alaska Natives -- that is, indigenous Alaskans. The suicide rate for rural Alaska Natives is three to four times higher than it is for Anglos, said Matthew D. Berman, an economist at the University of Alaska-Anchorage who has studied the issue.\nIn a paper published earlier this year, Berman reported suicide data for Alaska Natives going back to 1950 (see chart below). The rate was basically flat from 1950 to the mid\u00a01960s, then rose rapidly from the mid\u00a01960s to the mid\u00a01970s before falling again. The rate peaked in the late 1980s and has fallen slowly but consistently since then.\n\nOne problem with the connection Young pointed to is that the creation of the state\u2019s biggest source of \"largesse\" -- the annual dividends paid to all Alaska residents from the proceeds of natural-resource extraction -- doesn\u2019t track with the ups and downs of Alaska Native suicide rates.\nThe Alaska Permanent Fund, as the resource-extraction fund is known, began paying dividends to residents in 1982, usually between several hundred dollars and $2,000 in a given year. Yet the growth in Alaska Native suicide predated those dividends, and the suicide trend since creation of the fund has generally been downward.\n\"This is a classic case of offering a simple answer to a really complicated problem,\" Berman said. \"When I have visited rural Alaska, I see people hauling firewood, fishing, and hunting for food. The rural cash economy depends heavily on government, but state spending plays a bigger role than federal these days, and most of the income comes from employment.\"\nMoreover, researchers have found evidence that factors other than money tend to influence the rate of suicide in Alaska Native communities.\nSuicide tends to be lower among Alaska Natives who live in traditional ways, and among those who live in the larger, Anglo-dominant culture. Those who are are most susceptible to suicide are those who are firmly rooted in neither society, and perhaps transitioning between them.\nJames Allen, a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota, has found that older Alaska Natives, who tend to have a stronger connection to cultural traditions, are at lower risk of suicide. This tracks with data from other polar indigenous populations, such as the Sami people of Norway. Sami people who participate in the traditional pursuit of reindeer herding tend to have lower rates of suicide, according to Siv Kvernmo, a researcher at the University of Tromso.\nAs for the second group with lower suicide rates -- Alaska Natives who have relocated from rural villages to urban centers -- Berman reports that suicide rates in small, rural communities are more than twice as high as those among urban Native residents. Indeed, he writes, that the post-1980s decline in suicide rates may stem from more Alaska Natives moving to urban areas. (Today, about 10 percent of the state\u2019s population lives in small, rural, predominantly Alaska Native communities.)\nIn other words, Berman writes, the data suggests that \"opportunities in the modern economy (higher median incomes) and a strong traditional presence (linguistically isolated households) offer some protection against young male suicide.\"\n\"Research suggests that it was local communities' loss of control over their communities and land that is more relevant to the rise in suicide, not welfare,\" Berman told PolitiFact.\nIn other words, Alaska Native suicide is a much more complex subject than Young was letting on.\nOur ruling\nYoung said that suicide comes from federal government largesse \"saying you are not worth anything but you are going to get something for nothing.\" Data suggests high suicide rates among Alaska Natives stem more from cultural changes, including the transition from rural, traditional practices to urban life.
