Tops on their list is Kaine\u2019s position on offshore drilling.\n\"Kaine recently told activists he supports banning offshore drilling off the Atlantic Coast despite being a strong advocate for offshore drilling for years,\" the GOP says.\nWe decided to pull out the Flip-O-Meter to see if Kaine\u2019s position has shifted on that issue.\nThe prospect of drilling for oil and natural gas off Virginia\u2019s coast and other Atlantic states has been hotly debated for years.\nAt the start of this decade, energy leases to explore off Virginia\u2019s coast were scheduled to begin. But a moratorium on those activities has been in place since the 2010 explosion on BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico.\nIn 2013, Kaine\u2019s first year in the U.S. Senate, he co-sponsored a measure with fellow Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner that called for opening the waters off the coast of Virginia to oil and gas drilling.\nThe legislation called for state coffers to get a 50 percent cut of the energy royalties from drilling off Virginia\u2019s coast. It also said that drilling wouldn\u2019t be done in any area where it would threaten military operations or national security.\n\"Virginia is well-positioned to be a national leader in offshore energy exploration. A comprehensive energy strategy \u2013 including oil, gas, wind, solar, tidal and other areas \u2013 can transition us to a clean energy future while bridging that transition with secure U.S. fuels we don\u2019t have to import,\" Kaine said in a joint 2013 statement with Warner. \u00a0\u00a0\n\"Virginia\u2019s diverse energy portfolio is a model for the nation. This legislation will bolster our energy security, create jobs, and direct revenues to Virginia that will support important priorities across the state.\"\nA couple months later, in June 2013, Kaine penned an op-ed in The Washington Post in which he said \"I support development of offshore energy (gas, oil, wind and tidal) in the Atlantic.\"\nIn April 2015, Kaine was among eight senators who signed a letter to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee asking for legislation that would provide Atlantic Coast states a share of revenues from offshore oil and gas exploration if that area was opened to new energy leases.\n\"Bipartisan support for oil and gas development on the Atlantic OCS (Outer Continental Shelf) can be found at the federal, state and local levels,\" Kaine and the other senators from Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia wrote. \"Our states want the opportunity to create new jobs, generate new revenue.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration had been examining whether to allow oil and natural gas drilling off Virginia and those three other Atlantic Coast states, and it included them in initial plans to open areas off the coast for oil and gas leases from 2017 to 2022.\nBut the U.S. Department of the Interior, on March 15, said it had decided not to open the waters off Virginia and the other Atlantic Coast states for oil and gas exploration. It released an updated five-year offshore energy plan that proposes leasing operations in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska.\nThe Interior Department said it was particularly moved by opposition from coastal communities as well as objections from the Department of Defense that the drilling could affect military operations along the coast in places including Hampton Roads.\nThe same day of the Interior Department\u2019s announcement, Kaine said he long had called for the federal government to reconsider its moratorium on drilling off the Atlantic Coast. But in that prepared March 15 statement, Kaine signaled his position was softening:\n\"I am particularly struck by the material objections of the Department of Defense to the incompatibility of drilling with naval operations off Virginia\u2019s coast, cited by the BOEM (Bureau of Oceanic Energy Management) as one of the three principal reasons for their decision.\nI have participated in this debate for over a decade as a governor and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The DOD has been relatively quiet during this public debate and has never shared their objections with me before. I look forward to additional discussions with DOD to understand its position.\"\nFast forward to August 2016. Kaine was asked after an Aug. 13 rally in Manchester, N.H., if he supported a ban on offshore drilling.\n\"Well, I actually am now in that position, because the Obama administration has decided not to do offshore drilling because the Defense Department objects, and I share those objections,\" Kaine said in a video of his response that was tweeted out by 350 Action, an environmental advocacy group.\nThe Richmond Times-Dispatch noted in an Aug. 15 story that Kaine\u2019s opposition put him in line with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who expressed support for the Department of the Interior\u2019s position.\nWe asked Amy Dudley, Kaine\u2019s national spokeswoman, for elaboration for the reasons of Kaine\u2019s shifting stance on offshore drilling.\n\"As a member of the Armed Services Committee, Sen. Kaine met with DoD (Department of Defense) officials to further discuss the impact that oil drilling would have on our military operations in Hampton Roads, and concluded we should not be undertaking speculative drilling activities that could potentially impact installations in the region,\" Dudley wrote in a prepared statement. \"Sen. Kaine recognizes the Navy is a key economic pillar of the Hampton Roads economy and must be protected.\"\nWith the Flip-O-Meter, we don\u2019t take a stance on whether a policy shift is a good or bad thing. We\u2019re examining whether a change of position has occurred.\nHere, there\u2019s little doubt that Kaine, who pushed for opening waters off the Virginia coast to drilling in 2013, opposes it now. His spokeswoman says he has come to that conclusion on the basis of additional information from Pentagon officials.\nSo we rate this a Full Flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04404"}
