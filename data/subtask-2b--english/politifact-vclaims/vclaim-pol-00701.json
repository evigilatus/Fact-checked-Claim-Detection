So you\u2019ve got 74% of the folks in Texas crammed into 4% of the land. Having reasonable restrictions on what you can do with your property is something that cities have done for thousands of years.\"\nIs Sandlin correct? Do the vast majority of Texans live in cities, which make up a small percentage of the state\u2019s total area?\nSandlin did the math\nSandlin said his organization\u00a0calculated this claim using population data they maintain and U.S. Census Bureau numbers on population and land area.\nThey calculated the percentage of people living in Texas cities by using their data to find people living in cities and the overall estimate of the state\u2019s population.\nTo find the area, they used census numbers to find the area of the state and the area within cities \u2014 while keeping an eye out for erroneous data.\n\"We\u2019ve found over the years that the census is not always completely sensitive to what it means to be an incorporated Texas city, and they sometimes include non-city metropolitan regions or districts,\" Sandlin said in an email.\nThe cities in his calculation include all incorporated areas in Texas, from Houston, with more than 2.3 million people, to Toco in North Texas, with an estimated 75 residents.\nSandlin said he has not completed a new calculation since 2015, but it\u2019s unlikely things have changed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s been a handful of new very small cities formed and maybe some annexation and dis-annexation, but I doubt it has changed the percentage in any appreciable way,\" he said.\nWhat do the numbers say?\nLila Valencia, the senior demographer at the Texas Demographic Center, said Sandlin\u2019s calculations are exactly right.\nPopulation estimates from the census for 2017 show that the state\u2019s population was about 28.3 million. Of those, about 20.8 million people lived in incorporated areas \u2014 or 73.63% of Texans.\nValencia also pulled numbers from the census related to geography of the state and incorporated places. Texas has a land area of more than 676.6 billion square meters. As of 2017, more than 28.7 billion square meters (or 4.25%) are in incorporated areas.\nNationwide, a similar trend exists.\nA report produced by the Census Bureau in 2015 showed that a majority of the country\u2019s population lives in incorporated places \u2014 62.7 percent as of 2013. Incorporated lands made up just 3.5 percent of the country\u2019s land area at that time.\nOur ruling\nSandlin said, 74% of people in Texas are \"crammed into 4% of the land.\"\nThe latest census data supports Sandlin\u2019s claim. About 20 million Texans, or 74% of the state\u2019s population, live in incorporated areas, which make up about 4% of the state\u2019s land.\nWe rate this claim True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\n Share the Facts 2019-04-26 18:42:20 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  Says 74% of people in Texas are \"crammed into 4% of the land.\"     Bennett Sandlin Executive Director of the Texas Municipal League    a news conference Monday, April 22, 2019 2019-04-22    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00701"}
