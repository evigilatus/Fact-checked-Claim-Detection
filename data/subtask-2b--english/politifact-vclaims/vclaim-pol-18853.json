Tony Evers to address such issues in less than 30 seconds.\u00a0\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have pointedly blamed Evers, saying the deaths of the two people that\u00a0Kyle Rittenhouse is accused of shooting could have been avoided if the state had been more aggressive earlier about deploying National Guard troops.\nTrump appeared in Kenosha on Sept. 1, 2020 to meet with local law enforcement officers and business owners, despite a plea from Evers and other Democratic state leaders to stay away during a painful time for the city.\u00a0\nU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, welcomed the visit and in an Aug. 31, 2020 statement blasted Evers and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, saying that instead of working with Trump they \"made statements, leapt to conclusions, and have participated in rallies that have done more to incite than calm the situation.\"\u00a0\nDid Evers and Barnes participate in rallies that have \"done more to incite than calm the situation in Kenosha,\" as Johnson claims?\u00a0\nBarnes attended one rally at request of Jacob Blake\u2019s family\u00a0\nJohnson\u2019s office did not respond to a request for the evidence that he used to make the claim, but his statement echoes an Aug. 25, 2020 claim from state Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, that Evers and Barnes did not \"call for peace\" or \"encourage calm\" after Blake was shot.\u00a0\nWe rated that claim Mostly False. Evers released a video statement the day prior asking protesters to remain peaceful.\u00a0\nWhat about the rallies?\nBesides a joint news conference on Aug. 27, 2020 in Kenosha, Evers and Barnes have not appeared together publicly to discuss the situation.\u00a0\u00a0\nEvers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback said the pair have gone to one rally between the two of them, an Aug. 29, 2020 event that Blake\u2019s family asked Barnes to attend.\u00a0\nBarnes met with Blake\u2019s family, spoke at the event and marched alongside thousands who showed, Cudaback said.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReports from the rally confirm it was a peaceful one, but the Republican Party of Wisconsin and the Kenosha News seized on a comment near the end of the event in which an unidentified\u00a0 man took the microphone, decried police shootings of Black people and said, \"If you kill one of us, it\u2019s time for us to kill one of yours.\"\u00a0\nThe remarks were met with a muted response from the crowd.\nTo be sure, the comment strayed from the message of the event. In the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s reporting, Blake\u2019s father, Jacob Blake Sr., is quoted asking people to be calm and civil, saying, \"If we tear it up, we have nothing.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nBarnes, meanwhile, spoke on the importance of voting and continued activism, commended Blake\u2019s family for their resilience despite \"centuries of injustice\" that Black people have endured and urged the crowd to demand accountability from police departments.\u00a0\nIn any case, Johnson\u2019s claim was that the rally did more \"to incite than calm the situation.\"\nBut examining the timeline of the last week in the city, the violence and property destruction in Kenosha took place in the days before the Saturday rally \u2014 not after.\u00a0\nProtests and cases of arson and looting began the night Blake was shot and reached a chaotic point two nights later, on the night Rittenhouse is charged with killing two and injuring one.\u00a0\nThe rally Barnes attended was days later.\nIndeed, Johnson himself noted during Trump\u2019s visit that the situation in Kenosha became much calmer after the night where the protesters were shot. He credits the president. But in praising Trump for bringing calm, he undermines his claim here that an event days later attended by Barnes somehow incited violence again.\nIn short, it can\u2019t be both.\nOur rating\u00a0\nJohnson claimed that Evers and Barnes \"have participated in rallies that have done more to incite than calm the situation\" in Kenosha.\nBarnes was present at a rally where a threat was made, but the event was overall a peaceful one, and reports of violence tied to Blake\u2019s shooting came before the rally, not after.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd Johnson himself, while praising Trump\u2019s actions, has acknowledged things had been quiet for days before the Barnes speech -- and have remained so in the days since.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18853"}
