This is the blazing pants.", "text": "The California Republican Party made a blatantly misleading and inaccurate allegation this week that President Donald Trump was \"extracted from California's vote\" during a fundraiser on his website. He's asking supporters to donate to bring Trump back to the vote. The letter goes on to claim that \"Governor Newsome signed SB27, which prevented President Trump from appearing in next year's ballot. It is clear that the law is unconstitutional and deprives millions of voters in California. We need your support for the SB27 heart.\" We've begun to verify the truth. Our search (Joff) Gavin Newsome signed Senate Bill No. 27 into law last week. But this does not prevent Trump or anyone else from appearing in California's vote, nor does it mean that he \"kicked off.\" Instead, candidates for President and Governor would be required to release five years of tax returns to the United States primary election. This requirement does not include general elections. Here is the provision of the law: \"This law shall enact the Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act, which requires the candidate for the office of President, in order to place the candidate's name on the initial electoral ballot, to submit the candidate's income tax returns for the last five years subject to taxation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as specified.\" Trump refused to release his earnings, saying that his presidential campaign was subject to audit. Trump, the Republican National Committee and the California Republican Party filed all lawsuits against SB 27, arguing that it was unconstitutional and \"a naked political attack\" on Trump. The law authorized a party-based vote in the legislature controlled by democracy. Some legal analysts have questioned this, as has been done by the previous government. When he objected to a similar law two years ago, Jerry Brown said that it would create a slippery slope of trying to force candidates to release additional information to run for president. The courts will eventually take a decision on their constitutionality. However, as in the case of Trump, it does not prevent Trump from appearing in the ballot. On January 28, 2021 in Facebook blog, bloggers tried to \"close\" the California government's summoning campaign. \u2219 (Gavin Newsom) On February 2, 2012, Chris Nichols asked about the accuracy of the allegation. A spokesman for the Republican Party in California referred to a newsletter on the party's website on lawsuits. He criticizes the release of the law and claims Democrats use it \"to keep the Republicans home\" during the upcoming elections. However, it does not provide any information showing that Trump was expelled from or prevented from participating in the ballot. California is still several months after its primary-school ballot was finalized in March 2020. After asking about the allegation, the main address on the party &apos; s website was slightly changed from President Trump to President Trump. Another line changed from asking donors to donate to put Trump back to the vote to put him back to the vote. The California Republican Party recently claimed President Trump was \"withdrawn against California's vote\" as a result of Senate Bill 27. The recently signed law provides that candidates for the posts of President and Governor shall be released for five years of tax returns to run for the post of President and Governor of the State. It does not apply to candidates in general elections. The Republicans challenge the law in court, and say it is unconstitutional. The court can very well override the law. However, as it is written, Trump does not expel him from voting or prevent him from being on it. That ballot is still several months after its completion. It may be difficult for Tramp to release his tax returns, which he refused to make, but it still provides him and all future presidential candidates and the Governor to appear in the main ballot. The letter on the State party &apos; s website is blatantly false, ignoring any mention of what is already in the law and how candidates can comply with it. Furthermore, the false letter is used to collect donations. For these reasons, we value it pants on fire. Pants on fire - The statement is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous allegation.
