Besides, as Austin American-Statesman humor writer John Kelso observed in a Dec. 8, 2012, column, nearly 25 million Texans hadn\u2019t signed it.\n\nKilgore has run for numerous offices in Texas since 2004 as a pro-secession candidate. His basis for this statement, he told us by phone, was a comparison of nations\u2019 gross domestic product to that of Texas.\n\nGDP is the most-used measure of national economic output, defined as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country.\n\nKilgore said he drew his numbers from NationMaster, a Sydney, Australia-based website that compares nations and U.S. states on matters from health and crime to economy, using data from many sources to generate lists and graphs.\n\nNationMaster\u2019s Australia page gives the country\u2019s GDP as $606 billion, citing \"Economic Importance, 1998\" as its source. The site\u2019s Texas page gives the gross state product as $881 billion, citing U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics information from March 2006.\n\nSo although the numbers are both presented as current data on the website, and they show Texas\u2019 GDP to be 45 percent larger than Australia\u2019s, they appear to represent the Texas economy in 2006 and the Australian economy in 1998.\n\n\"Are you serious? My goodness,\" Kilgore said, when we asked if he\u2019d known the site was using data that old. \"I guess we need some more updated numbers.\" He had not looked at the sources, he said, and didn\u2019t do further research.\n\nThe Texas state comptroller\u2019s office annually calculates where Texas would rank globally if it were a nation. Spokesman RJ DeSilva told us by email that the comptroller uses the GDP calculated for Texas by the federal Bureau of Economic Statistics and sent us the 2011 figure: $1.3 trillion.\n\nBy phone, bureau spokesman Thomas Dail suggested we compare the Texas figure to national GDP calculated with current prices in U.S. dollars. That would be \"conceptually consistent,\" he said.\n\nDail guided us through the steps of generating the Texas statistics on his agency\u2019s website. Separately, we found a fact sheet from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with the country's annual GDPs using current prices and U.S. dollars.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP in $US billion\n\n\n\n2007\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas\n\n\n\n1,147.404\n\n\n\n1,209.267\n\n\n\n1,129.537\n\n\n\n1,222.904\n\n\n\n1,308.132\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\n\n944.8\n\n\n\n 1,033.5\n\n\n\n976.0\n\n\n\n1,242.1\n\n\n\n1,487.4\n\n\n\n\n\nWho\u2019s bigger?\n\n\n\nTexas\n\n21% bigger\n\n\n\nTexas\n\n17% bigger\n\n\n\nTexas\n\n16% bigger\n\n\n\nAustralia\n\n2% bigger\n\n\n\nAustralia 12% bigger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bureau\u2019s data and the Australian government\u2019s numbers show that Texas\u2019 GDP was larger than Australia\u2019s in 2007 through 2009, but not in 2010 or 2011.
