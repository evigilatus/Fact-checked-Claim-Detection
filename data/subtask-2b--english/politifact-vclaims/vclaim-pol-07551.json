A day earlier, she called MSNBC\u2019s coverage \"disgustingly biased\" toward Israel.\nPunditFact wanted to see if Jebreal had a point, using the evidence she laid out in her interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes. (Watch the video for more from their chat.)\nJebreal told Hayes that on CNN \"between June 30 and July 10, you had 17 Israeli public officials vs. one\" Palestinian public official.\nWhile the statistic doesn\u2019t necessarily prove bias, it does suggest lopsided coverage of the Israel-Gaza crisis. Is Jebreal right?\nThe source of her count\nBiased coverage of the Israel-Gaza crisis has been a constant cable news subplot.\nABC News\u2019 Diane Sawyer acknowledged she mislabeled a Palestinian family assessing damage after an Israeli bomb strike as an Israeli family. NBC News raised questions for pulling reporter Ayman Mohyeldin off the story for a script he wrote about four Gaza children killed by a bomb on a beach because it was allegedly seen as too sympathetic to Palestinians.\nJebreal emerged as a Middle Eastern voice in Western media after sharing her experiences about growing up in the West Bank and reporting in Egypt during the Arab Spring.\nWhile Jebreal did not respond to our attempts to reach her, we were able to find the source of her claim about CNN.\nTwo years ago, Yousef Munayyer, executive director of The Jerusalem Fund and The Palestine Center, reviewed transcripts of CNN\u2019s coverage of Gaza fighting from Nov. 14, 2012, when Hamas military commander Ahmed Jabari was killed in an Israeli airstrike, until Nov. 21, 2012, the day a cease-fire was announced.\nDuring that week, he found officials from Israel appeared on the network 45 times, compared to five appearances by Hamas officials and 20 combined appearances of spokespersons for the Palestine Liberation Organization, Palestinian Legislative Council and Hamas.\nMunayyer revived the media watching to document the current crisis, and on July 10, Munayyer tweeted new observations of CNN. Munayyer again relied on available transcripts of CNN programming.\n\u00a0\n\nIn @CNN coverage of Israel/Palestine since 6/29 they have had 35 guests on the topic this is how they break down (1/2)\n\u2014 Yousef Munayyer (@YousefMunayyer) July 11, 2014\n\n17 Israeli officials 4 Israel lay persons 1 Palestinian official 4 Palestinian lay persons 8 Unaffiliated 6 Michael Oren appearances (2/2)\n\u2014 Yousef Munayyer (@YousefMunayyer) July 11, 2014\n\u00a0\nIn an interview with PunditFact, Munayyer said the exercise shows CNN alarmingly favored Israeli perspectives. Munayyer said a more thorough analysis will be done whenever the conflict ends.\nMunayyer started analyzing coverage to coincide with the discovery of the bodies of three missing Israeli teens in the West Bank on June 30. (The boys had been missing since June 12, the tipping point of the conflict. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced June 15 that Hamas was responsible \"for a fact.\") On July 2, a retaliatory killing of a Palestinian teen escalated the fighting. Four days later, the beating of an American-Palestinian teen by Israeli police made the U.S. airwaves. On July 8, the Israelis launched an official offensive operation known as \"Protective Edge.\" When Munayyer tweeted on July 10, the death toll in Gaza had reached at least 78.\nWho did Munayyer count? For starters, he was looking at appearances, not individual guests.\nHe counted Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, as six Israeli officials because he gave six interviews. Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s office, was also counted six times. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner was counted twice and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was counted once. President Shimon Peres was counted twice, bringing Munayyer\u2019s tally to 17 appearances from Israeli officials. (However, Munayyer told us he counted two more appearances from Peres on July 10, the same day as his tweet, upping the total for that period to 19. He says he thinks he sent the tweet without \"closing out\" the July 10 appearances.)\nFormer Israeli ambassador Michael Oren got his own category in Munayyer\u2019s tally because he is now CNN\u2019s Middle East analyst.\nConversely, Munayyer counted just one Palestinian official, -- Palestinian Ambassador Maen Areikat, though there were other Palestinian \"lay persons\" invited as CNN guests, including lawyers for the Tampa teen beaten up by Israeli police,\u00a0and Muyanner himself.\nMunayyer told us he focused on CNN because it\u2019s more mainstream than MSNBC and Fox News and typically throws more resources on the ground to cover international crises. His team reviewed transcripts for every hour of news coverage to see who was invited to weigh in. He excluded interviews within correspondent\u2019s reports, looking instead for pundits and analysts asked to provide their take of the situation by phone or in-studio.\n\"The question we\u2019re trying to ask is, who is CNN trying to give a platform on this issue, and is it done in a balanced way?\" Munayyer said. \"My hunch is there\u2019s going to be slight improvement over 2012, but there\u2019s still a lot of work to do to get towards parity.\"\nIn the interview with Jebreal, Hayes argued one reason for the uneven coverage is the difficulty of booking a spokesperson for the militant group firing rockets into Israel, Hamas. Still, Munayyer told us, \"that doesn't mean there aren't Palestinian voices who can speak to the situation on the ground from an informed Palestinian perspective that would provide a greater sense of balance to all of the Israeli perspectives that are there.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, CNN said, \"Our team of correspondents, anchors and contributors have been reporting live from the Mideast fairly across all our platforms.\u00a0Our reporting represents all sides (Israeli, Palestinian and Hamas) daily.\u00a0We're comfortable with the Palestinian voices we have included from Gaza, Qatar, Washington, D.C., and New York when supplemented with our countless live reports from Gaza with three correspondents\u00a0on the ground.\"\nOur own tally\nWe set out to match up Munayyer\u2019s preliminary analysis with our own, using a computer program we subscribe to called Critical Mention. The program allows us to search video going back 30 days for all major news networks, and it allows us to search using the closed captioning transcript.\nWe scanned the network\u2019s discussion of Israel, Gaza and Palestine from June 29 to July 10, the same window as Munayyer.\nOur findings suggest Munayyer undercounted the number of Palestinian officials CNN had on air.\nThe following breakdown somewhat mirrors the categories Munayyer outlined, which do not include voices from correspondents\u2019 news packages. There is no perfect way to do this, however, as it\u2019s awkward to classify appearances by people with neutral titles and biased commentary and vice versa.\nWith that note, here\u2019s what we found (and here\u2019s a link to our chart of who appeared when):\n\n\n20 appearances by Israeli public officials (four of these were replays);\n\n\n2 appearances by Israeli laymen;\n\n\n5 appearances by Palestinian officials;\n\n\n11 appearances by Palestinian laymen, including Munayyer himself;\n\n\n6 appearances by Michael Oren.\n\n\nWhile Munayyer found one appearance by a Palestinian official, we found five. Four were by Palestinian Ambassador Maen Areikat, and one was a prerecorded interview with PLO committee member Hanan Ashrawi.\nOther \"pro-Palestinian\" voices included four appearances by Palestinian-American relatives and lawyers commenting on the case of Tariq Abu Khdeir, the Tampa teen beaten by Israeli security.\nFormer PLO legal adviser and spokesperson Diana Buttu accounts for five \"layman\" appearances, though one appearance was cut before it began when CNN lost the phone connection. Another former PLO adviser and current Brookings Institution fellow, Khaled Elgindy, appeared once on CNN.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting efforts to incorporate more Palestinian voices that fall outside of the timeline Munayyer and Jebreal talked about, closer to daily news. CNN host Jake Tapper, for example, interviewed Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad by phone on July 18.\nSeem complicated? It is.\nWhat drives the disparity\nMarda Dunsky, a former journalist who teaches at Northwestern University\u2019s Medill School and author of Pens and Swords: How the American Mainstream Media Report the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, said the imbalance of Israeli and Palestinian news sources in most mainstream coverage is well documented, but it does not necessarily imply a deliberate attempt to mislead.\nIt\u2019s an accessibility issue. The shortage of Palestinian voices is more often a symptom of two very different warring societies, she said.\n\"The Israeli government has people in many different branches who are trained specifically to speak to the media,\" she said. \"The Palestinian government is not as well developed, and as a result it lacks the same depth of field when it comes to official sources.\"\nButtu, the former PLO spokeswoman and legal adviser, told us in an interview that her CNN appearances are a \"drop in the bucket\" compared to Michael Oren, the network\u2019s on-hand Middle East analyst and former Israeli ambassador to the United States.\n\"No matter what any Palestinian commentator says on the show, at the end of the day they always have Michael Oren,\" she said. \"That\u2019s quite problematic. Can you imagine if a former Palestinian ambassador of the United States served as a commentator on Fox, don\u2019t you think they would be up in arms in that? It\u2019s accepted as commonplace at CNN.\"\nButtu\u2019s bigger issue is with the style of questions directed at Palestinian guests, and that she is often asked about the official Palestinian position even though she has not been an official for years.\nAnother thing to remember: Both sides point to bias in reporting. Countering Munayyer\u2019s media-monitoring group are U.S.- and Israel-based organizations such as the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) and HonestReporting.\nOur ruling\nJebreal said, on CNN \"this time around, you have, between June 30 and July 10, you had 17 Israeli public officials vs. one\" Palestinian public official.\nShe is referencing a preliminary tally of Israeli and Palestinian officials\u2019 voices during that time by a pro-Palestinian media watcher. Our tally confirms there was a disparity, but it was not quite as lopsided as Jebreal said. We found 20 appearances by Israeli public officials on CNN compared to 5 appearances by Palestinian officials.\nAlso, the tally is measuring appearances, not the number\u00a0of officials from each side who appeared. And it's\u00a0worth noting that any look at the media coverage is incomplete because the story is continuing to unfold.\nBecause of those caveats, we rate Jebreal\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07551"}
