Chuck Fleischmann, who represents Tennessee\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, offered his own critique of the president\u2019s remarks a few days after Obama set off the firestorm.\n\n\"Obama: Small Businesses Succeed Because of Government,\" screamed the headline from a blog entry that Fleischmann posted on his campaign website on July 17, 2012.\n\n\"Having no experience in running a business, President Obama just doesn\u2019t get it,\" Fleischmann wrote. \"In fact, he fights against it. Just recently, he said: \u2018If you\u2019ve got a business \u2013 you didn\u2019t build that. Somebody else made that happen.\u2019 \"\n\n\"If you are like me,\" Fleischmann continued, \"you were speechless at the President\u2019s latest arrogant attack on the foundation of the American economy. The President insists on pushing his view of successful businesses in America \u2013 that we owe the government for our success.\"\n\nAsked to explain Fleischmann\u2019s comments, his campaign spokesman, Jordan Powell, said the blog item was built around Obama\u2019s remarks in Roanoke.\n\n\"The president seems to think that the government is the engine of success, and Chuck thinks it\u2019s not so \u2013 it\u2019s the private sector and hard-working small business owners,\" Powell said.\n\nObama\u2019s Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, has made pretty much the same claim about the president at public events and in several ads. The Republican National Committee and the National Federation of Independent Businesses are among the groups that have released their own videos and statements claiming Obama is out of touch.\n\nThe criticism has become so big a threat that Obama\u2019s re-election campaign felt the need to address the issue in a web video titled \"Tampered\" that quoted media accounts saying the quote had been taken out of context.\n\nWe won\u2019t delve into the broader question of what President Obama thinks about businesses. Here, we will simply examine Fleischmann\u2019s claim that, in his campaign speech, Obama was saying \"small businesses succeed because of government.\"\n\nOur colleagues at PolitiFact national have examined similar claims made by Romney and others and given them False rulings. Many of their points are repeated here.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by looking at the full context of Obama\u2019s speech. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\n\"There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me -- because they want to give something back. They know they didn\u2019t -- look, if you\u2019ve been successful, you didn\u2019t get there on your own. You didn\u2019t get there on your own. I\u2019m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.\n\n\"If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you\u2019ve got a business -- you didn\u2019t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn\u2019t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.\n\n\"The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don\u2019t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.\n\n\"So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That\u2019s how we funded the G.I. Bill. That\u2019s how we created the middle class. That\u2019s how we built the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam. That\u2019s how we invented the Internet. That\u2019s how we sent a man to the moon. We rise or fall together as one nation and as one people, and that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m running for President -- because I still believe in that idea. You\u2019re not on your own, we\u2019re in this together.\"\n\nWhen placed in context, it is obvious Obama was making the point that success comes from the combination of \"individual initiative\" and the fact that \"we do things together.\"\n\nFleischmann and others who have criticized Obama\u2019s remarks omitted the lead-up to his statement -- that \"if you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges.\"\n\nThese words indicate Obama was referring to infrastructure and educational opportunities that were paid for by taxpayers through the government -- things that the President argues establishes a necessary foundation for making private businesses successful.\n\nWe think his meaning is clear -- that both business people and government play a role in the American enterprise system, not purely one or the other.\n\nOur ruling\n\n Rep. Fleischmann cherry-picks a quote from President Obama\u2019s remarks to make it appear Obama was being dismissive of businesses and was saying in essence that\n\"small businesses succeed because of government.\" \u00a0But the preceding sentences in Obama\u2019s remarks make clear that he was talking about the importance of government-provided infrastructure and education to the success of private businesses.\n\nFleischmann also ignores Obama's clear summary of his message, that \"the point is ... that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.\"\n\nBy leaving out the \"individual initiative\" reference, Fleischmann has given a false impression. We rate his statement False.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarsha Blackburn\n\n\nstated on December 16, 2011 in appearance on Fox Business Channel\u2019s \u201cVarney & Co.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew energy standards will take away \"our freedom of choice and selection in the light bulbs we have in our homes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bartholomew Sullivan \u2022 January 13, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10639"}
