Bribos, from Wisconsin, claimed that Clinton had taken \"money from the kings of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Oman and Yemen.\" Our evaluation was half correct. Its wording could have given the impression that Clinton herself, instead of the Clinton Family Foundation, had received money. (Yemen does not own property or contribute to the institution.) On July 21, 2016, Bribos attacked Clinton again, this time during his address to the Republican National Congress in Cleveland. \"In foreign policy, Clinton's presidency means forgetting our friends and empowering our enemies,\" accused Bribos. \"Look only at Iran's catastrophic nuclear agreement, which has characterized the pockets of the world's first nation to sponsor terrorism with your money, while abandoning our greatest ally in the Middle East, the nation of Israel.\" A few days ago in Cleveland, Bribos made one statement about the Bush family that appeared at GOP conferences, one on \"facts\" and \"best children's scenario.\" Both were mischaracterized by Polyte Fact National. This claim doesn't sound good either. The Republican Party has not responded to our requests for information to support the Bribos statement. But Iran's characterization as \"first care for terrorism\" is not just a speech. Iran has been on the official list of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the States sponsoring terrorism since 1984. In its last annual country report on terrorism, issued in June 2016, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that \"Iran remains the first State to sponsor terrorism\" in 2015. However, Bribos &apos; s description of the nuclear agreement with Iran, reached in July 2015 with the United States and several other States, is deeply flawed. The nuclear deal was intended to make it difficult for Iran to build a nuclear bomb. At that time, it was believed that Iran might be two or three months away from acquiring a nuclear bomb. But if Iran adheres to the restrictions imposed by the deal, scientists say, it will take at least 12 months to build the weapon. On January 10, 2021, in a television interview, \"It takes a long time on election day to download those cards, which is why we have 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. to throw the ballot papers at Milwaukee.\" In exchange for limiting its nuclear programme, Iran receives tens of billions of dollars in assets (estimated at $150 billion, but the exact amount is unknown). But the vast majority of these assets are Iran's money, not US cash. These assets were frozen as a result of sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States and other countries. CNN indicated that the transaction included the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' agreement to pay $1.7 billion to Iran to settle a 35-year-old legal dispute over a trust fund that had been frozen since Iran's revolution. So, the nuclear deal can be said to have \"closed the pockets\" of Iran -- but almost all of that is Iran's own money. Another thing -- a big thing -- about the timing of the deal. Clinton said that her work as Secretary of State for sanctions against Iran had helped Iran to enter the negotiating table, a national claim mostly classified as valid. But Clinton was referring to her work in 2009 and 2010. She left the post of Secretary in February 2013. That means Clinton left for 2.5 years before the nuclear deal. In other words, the heavy lifting was carried out under the auspices of the current Secretary, John Kerry, despite Clinton &apos; s support. President Barack Obama had to sign the deal, so he belongs to him more than any foreign minister. Our assessment of Bribos says that Clinton's nuclear deal \"sticked the pockets of the world's first nation that sponsors terrorism with your money.\" The United States describes Iran as the first country to sponsor terrorism. But the deal was made two and a half years after Clinton left Obama's administration. The vast majority of the tens of billions of dollars that Iran receives are not United States funds, but its own assets, frozen by the United States and other countries that have imposed sanctions on Iran. For a statement that contains some elements of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, our assessment is often wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d04632ed-a487-42ae-8342-dab37119b6af", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04562"}
