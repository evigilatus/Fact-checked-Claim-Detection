On January 10, 2021 in Facebook, it says that Nancy Belusi sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he adhere to a proven democratic playbook.\" By Sierra Aurork on January 11, 2021, Valenti responded, and when he found out that teenage girls had expired membership after his mother couldn't afford it, \"he offered to pay $150 from his own pocket, asking the staff of the fitness center how much of the membership would buy for the boy,\" Tribeon reported. It covered up to four months, but after the company's office at the gym discovered the situation, they said that the $150 would go to membership for two years, instead, with the gym picking up the rest of the costs. The fake Facebook contains the full name and picture of Valenti, which appears to be the same picture as the Tribune. In the title of the article, it is clear that the original text has been erased and the part that says \"fired 53 times\" has been included, since the size and style of the text do not correspond visually to the rest of the sentence.
