Bloomberg may be laying the groundwork for a presidential nomination. Or he might not. He travels all over the country, making speeches confirming his record for 12 years as Mayor of New York City and what he has been doing since the end of his last term in 2013. In a speech to the National Action Network, Civil Rights, in Martin Luther King Day, Bloomberg spoke of his educational record as mayor. \"So we shut down schools that often failed minority communities for decades, and opened new schools in their place that outperform old schools,\" he said. \"We gave New York City teachers an increase of 43 per cent to attract and retain our best, and we are more than twice the education budget when I was in office. We have also received some important assistance from President Obama, who worked closely with his team and with us in the New York race to the highest level of application, and who has helped us to raise standards and improve good school choices, including charters, for families that have long lacked them. All this work has helped us increase graduation rates by 42% and significantly reduce the ethnic achievement gap.\" In view of his possible candidacy for the presidency, we asked about his allegations. Did graduation rates increase by 42 per cent, and did the ethnic achievement gap shrink \"in essence\"? The graduation rate of Bloomberg, which was sworn in in January 2002, was given deliberate control over the public school system in that year by the Legislature and the Governor of the State. This means that authority and accountability have been central to his office and have not spread across all sectors of education. The system is still in place today. As evidence of Bloomberg &apos; s allegations, his spokesman for the Mayor, Stu Louiser, presented statements from the State Ministry of Education, as reported by the city. For the class that started high school in September 2001 and graduated by June 2005, 46.5% graduated. By August 2013, 66 percent of students had graduated within four years. This represents an increase of 42 per cent. Experts studying education data did not object to Bloomberg &apos; s claim that graduation rates had increased during his tenure. For eight years, Ray Domanico led a separate effort to assess successes in controlling governors as part of the City of New York's independent budget office. As director of educational research, Domanico had access to school data. He was a public supporter of Bloomberg, but he said he was curious before he started working on the results of all the changes Bloomberg made. \"On graduation rate, I think this is unequivocally true,\" said Domanico, who is the Director of Education Policy at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. However, experts caution against some drawbacks when measuring graduation rates. Aaron Palace, Head of the Department of Educational Policy and Social Analysis at the College of Teachers at Columbia University, said that school years generally included more than one mayor. However, Pallas said that his analysis showed that Bloomberg's claim for graduation rates was not \"funny.\" The New York City School Research Alliance, New York University, calculates students differently from the city and state departments of education, and has reached a 36 per cent increase in graduation rates on time for all students with any type of diploma, as Chelsea Farley, Director of Communications, said. The results were described as \"generally consistent\" with Bloomberg's claim. Two methods were often used to study the ethnic achievement gap - graduation rates and test results - and the experts who analysed the data from both directions expressed doubts about Bloomberg's claim that his initiatives \"in essence\" narrowed the gap. In support of Bloomberg &apos; s claim, it presented data on the graduation rate for four years from June 2005 and August 2013, broken down by ethnic group. All white, Asian, black and Spanish students saw increases in graduation on time, although white and Asian students are still more likely to graduate from high school than their black and Spanish peers. In August 2013, 81.1 per cent of Asian students graduated on time, up from 66.3 per cent in June 2005. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January, 2021, in August 2013, 79.7 per cent of white students graduated on time, up from 64 per cent in June 2005. In August 2013, 61.2 per cent of black students graduated on time, compared with 40.1 per cent in June 2005. In August 2013, 59 per cent of Spanish students graduated on time, from 37.4 per cent in June 2005. The gap between white and black students was 18.5 per cent in August 2013, compared with 24 per cent in June 2005. The gap between white and Spanish students reached 20.7 percentage points in August 2013, compared with 26.6 percentage points in June 2005. This is a drop of about 6 percentage points per group. The Bloomberg Panel uses graduation rate data to support its claim. At the College of Teachers at Columbia University, Pallas describes the change in racial and ethnic gaps in graduation rates as \"a slight decline.\" \"It continues to be the case that a high school student in the white or Asian city of New York was more likely to graduate from high school than black or Hispanic students at the end of the Bloomberg era,\" Balas wrote in an e-mail. Farley, from the Research Alliance, said that his analysis showed that the gap in the graduation rates of black and Latin students compared to white students had narrowed from the category that entered ninth grade in 2001 to the group that entered in 2012 - almost the term of the Mayor of Bloomberg - by 11 percentage points. As for the state test scores, experts caution against relying on them to draw conclusions on the ethnic achievement gap over time. The State changed the difficulty of its testing programme several times between 2001 and 2013. Domanico said that the use of the National Evaluation of Education Progress Examinations, or the National Institute of Education, to reflect changes in the achievement gap, was also complicated by the choice of the starting point that should be used. The Independent Budget Office studied 71,000 students who were in third grade in 2008-2009 and eighth grade in 2013-14. Given their degrees in English arts and mathematics examinations, researchers found that the gap between white and Asian students and their black and Spanish peers had widened over that period. When Ballas analysed the data from the 2012 National Assessment of Educational Progress in Urban Areas, the racial/ethnic gap in achievement in Bloomberg did not budge. Our rule, Bloomberg, said that graduation rates under his administration had increased by 42 per cent, and that the ethnic gap in achievement had declined \"to a large extent.\" The data show that the graduation rate increased by 42 per cent. With regard to Bloomberg's claim that his administration \"essentially\" reduced the gap in racial achievement, he looks mainly at graduation rate data, which showed that the gap in ethnic achievement had narrowed. However, this part of his statement requires additional information. Experts in different measurements have found that the racial achievement gap has not shrunk significantly, but has not budged and even expanded in some analyses. We assess Bloomberg's claim mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01052"}
