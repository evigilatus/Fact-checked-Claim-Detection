Ryan Now,\" a link sent you to a page with more information. That page contained a statement that began with this:\nHouse Republicans are quickly moving to pass a tax bill with divisive conception language by disguising it as a college savings plan. This is another attempt to ban abortion and rob women of their reproductive rights. Leading the charge has been House Speaker Paul Ryan.\nNARAL made similar claims on social media. And the group said that, besides Ryan, the online ads targeted eight other House Republicans: Rod Blum of Iowa, Steve Knight and Darrell Issa of California, Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, Mike Coffman of Colorado, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Karen Handel of Georgia and Pat Meehan of Pennsylvania.\nLet\u2019s look at each of the three parts of the attack on Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican.\n1. \u2018Ryan is leading the effort\u2019\nThe House tax bill was introduced on Nov. 2, 2017, and was approved by the House on Nov. 16, 2017, the day after NARAL\u2019s ad on JSOnline.com. Ryan has long been touting a GOP tax reform proposal, describing it as the first major tax reform since 1986, and promising that its tax cuts and other tax changes would stimulate the economy.\nA spokeswoman in the speaker\u2019s office told us Ryan supports the provision that is targeted by NARAL, which would change so-called 529 college savings accounts. But she said she wasn\u2019t aware of any public statement Ryan has made on that provision, and we couldn\u2019t find any, which indicates Ryan hasn\u2019t taken the lead on pushing that particular provision.\nSo, this part of the claim is partially accurate.\n2. \u2018Conception language disguised as savings plan\u2019\nPeople use 529 accounts (529 refers to that section of the tax code) as investment vehicles to save money for college expenses. The savings are for -- as the Internal Revenue Service explains it -- \"a designated beneficiary, such as a child or grandchild.\" A key attraction is that earnings on investments are not subject to federal tax.\nThe House tax bill would allow 529 accounts to be opened explicitly for unborn children. That provision says:\nNothing shall prevent an unborn child from being treated as a designated beneficiary or an individual under this section. The term \"unborn child\" means a child in utero. The term \"child in utero\" means a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.\nThe provision is \"disguised\" in the sense that adding the unborn child language doesn\u2019t enable savers to do anything they can\u2019t already do for future children -- a point U.S. Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., raised during a hearing. Expectant parents and other savers can already open a 529 in anyone\u2019s name, including their own, and later change the beneficiary -- for instance, after a child is born.\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s clear the provision is divisive. NARAL is among a number of groups that opposes it; meanwhile, anti-abortion groups support the provision, with one, the Susan B. Anthony List, saying: \"It's a small increment in the momentum that we're building to ensure that one day every child is welcomed and protected under the law.\"\nSo, this part of the claim is mostly on target.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. \u2018Another attempt to ban abortion\u2019\nThe third part of the claim, however, goes too far. The 529 provision would not ban abortion; it strictly deals with college savings accounts, not any restrictions on abortion.\nIn fact, in announcing its ads, NARAL itself labeled the provision as merely a beginning step, saying:\nThe sole purpose of this provision is to codify the radical, anti-choice idea that life begins at conception into law and begin the process of banning abortion altogether \u2026.This is the first time \u2018personhood\u2019 language has made it into tax reform legislation, leaving the door open for future laws to use the same, ideological definition of when life begins \u2026\nThere is evidence that, as the New York Times reported, \"the provision accomplishes what anti-abortion activists have long sought: It enshrines into federal law the recognition of the unborn.\"\nThe anti-abortion group March for Life said in a statement: \"We are heartened to see this bill promote the personhood of an unborn child \u2026 and see this as a huge stride toward expanding the child tax credit to recognize life beginning at conception.\"\nSnopes fact checked whether the tax provision attempts to codify \"fetal personhood\" \u2014 the legal theory that a fetus has the same legal rights as a person -- and found the claim largely accurate.\nTwo experts, echoing others, told us that inserting an unborn child definition into federal law is part of a broader strategy to limit abortion rights in the future.\n\"It is part of the anti-abortion strategy to work on all fronts to establish fetal personhood/citizenship claims,\" said Yale Law School professor Mindy Roseman, whose specialties include reproduction rights. \u00a0\nThe \"unborn child\" or human \"from moment of conception\" language is also in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 strategic plan, said University of Wisconsin-Madison law and bioethics professor Alta Charo, whose specialties include reproductive health.\nSuch efforts are aimed, she said, \"at building an impression that everywhere in federal law the embryo and fetus is considered morally and perhaps legally equal to a live-born child. It is like building a wall. At the end, abortion stands out as a singular exception, a single missing brick in the wall, and seems harder and harder to justify either morally or constitutionally.\"\nRyan\u2019s response\nAsked to respond to NARAL\u2019s ad, Ryan\u2019s office referred us to a statement about the provision issued by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. The statement says in part:\nToday, our tax code doesn\u2019t recognize children with eyes, ears, noses, arms, legs, fingers, and heartbeats as children just because they haven\u2019t yet left the womb \u2026.So our tax plan adds clear language that allows parents to start a college savings account before their son or daughter is born by explicitly and unambiguously declaring these sons and daughters \"unborn children.\"\nOur ruling\nNARAL says Ryan is leading the effort to \"pass a tax bill with divisive conception language by disguising it as a college savings plan\" in \"another attempt to ban abortion and rob women of their reproductive rights.\"\nRyan is leading the effort to pass the tax bill. But while he supports the college savings plan provision, he hasn\u2019t spoken out publicly to push that provision.\nConception language in the provision is divisive among anti-abortion and abortion-rights groups. And it is \u2018disguised\u2019 in the sense that it inserts the concept of unborn children into federal law without making any material change to what are known as 529 college savings plans.\nThe provision would not, however, ban or even restrict abortion rights -- although advocates fear that inserting unborn children language into federal law could be used to erode abortion rights in the future.\nNARAL\u2019s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15656"}
