I don't know what to say. Ren\u00e9-Charles was the most kind-hearted, loving son I have ever seen.\"\nHowever, Dion never said this. Instead, Heather Gulish Melton said it in a statement made to radio station WCYB about her husband, Sonny. Sonny and Heather Melton attended the Route 91 Harvest Festival together. There, Sonny was shot and killed as they were running away from the shooter at the concert.\n\"At this point, I'm in complete disbelief and despair. I don't know what to say. Sonny was the most kind-hearted, loving man I have ever met. He saved my life and lost his,\" said Heather Gulish Melton.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoustonChronicle-tv.com changed the quote by switching the names from \"Sonny\" to \"Ren\u00e9,\" altering the last part of the quote from \"loving man I have ever met,\" to \"loving son I have ever seen,\" and eliminating all together \"he saved my life and lost his.\"\nOften, fake news sites use site names that are close to the name of an existing news publication to trick people into thinking it is legitimate. For example, HoustonChronicle-tv.com is similar in name to the Houston Chronicle, which is the actual local newspaper for Houston, Texas.\nDion had a concert in Las Vegas on Oct. 3 where she paid tribute to the victims, their families, first responders and anyone affected by the tragedy.\n\"I never start the show like this but tonight is very different,\" she said, according to People. \"On Sunday we lost too many beautiful, innocent souls, and so many are still suffering,. But tonight we\u2019re going to let these families know that we are supporting them and that we will help them through their tragic loss.\" \nShe made no mention of her son, because he was not a victim of this mass shooting.\nHoustonChronicle-tv.com has posted other fake news articles that we have rated before.
