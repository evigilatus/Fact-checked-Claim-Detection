Chris Christie to the bottom end of the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nThe Republican governor last week repeated a claim about how there are fewer \"state government\" employees now than when former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman resigned in January 2001.\n\nBetter yet, the state accomplished that reduction \"without any layoffs,\" Christie said.\n\n\"New Jersey today has fewer employees in state government than it had when Christie Whitman left office in January of 2001, and I think that\u2019s good,\" Christie said in a July 9 appearance at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. \"And we did it without any layoffs. We did it through attrition.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey issued a True ruling in December on Christie\u2019s claim about how state government has fewer employees than when Whitman resigned.\n\nBut when we looked at recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that the governor\u2019s statement is no longer accurate. Christie\u2019s claim about there being no layoffs is wrong too, because his representatives previously cited hundreds of layoffs during his tenure.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s explain what\u2019s changed since our True ruling.\n\nAt the time of that ruling, the latest numbers were preliminary estimates for November 2011, showing 137,800 \"state government\" workers. That figure represented 600 fewer employees than the 138,400 state workers in January 2001.\n\nBut the November figures have since been revised to show 144,300 workers in that month, exceeding the estimate from January 2001. Every month since November also has shown a greater number of employees than when Whitman resigned.\n\nWhen Christie repeated the claim last week, the latest figures were preliminary estimates for May 2012, when there were 146,100 state government employees. That represents a 7,700 increase, or nearly 5.6 percent, over Whitman\u2019s final month.\n\nThose statistics are seasonally adjusted and include workers in state departments; the legislative and judicial branches; state colleges and universities; state hospitals and state authorities and commissions, such as NJ Transit.\n\nBrian Murray, a spokesman with the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, acknowledged how \"the Bureau of Labor Statistics has since revised the data and shifted the estimated count of state employees higher.\"\n\nBut Murray also pointed to a reduction in employees since the Whitman era in the subcategory of \"other state government,\" which includes the executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as state boards and authorities.\n\n\"It could be argued that the Governor has more day-to-day control over the workforces in the items included in \u2018other state government\u2019 rather than Educational Services and hospitals,\" Murray said in an e-mail.\n\nHowever, in both claims, Christie has just referred to \"state government\" in general.\n\nAlso, when we referred to that overall category for our first fact-check, a Christie spokesman confirmed that was the source of the governor\u2019s information. So, for this fact-check, we\u2019re focusing on the same category.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that since Christie took office in January 2010, the number of \"state government\" employees has dropped by 5,600, or nearly 3.7 percent.\n\nBut has the Christie administration reduced the state workforce \"without any layoffs\"?\n\nThat\u2019s not what the governor\u2019s representatives told us in December when we were working on our first fact-check.\n\nBetween the start of Christie\u2019s tenure and November 2011, \"743 out of 4,738 full-time positions eliminated were through layoffs,\" the spokesmen said in an e-mail, referring to the executive, legislative and judicial branches.\n\nThose layoffs included 138 positions at the New Jersey Network, the state-owned TV network shut down at the end of June 2011.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAt the Brookings Institution, Christie claimed: \"New Jersey today has fewer employees in state government than it had when Christie Whitman left office in January of 2001, and I think that\u2019s good. And we did it without any layoffs. We did it through attrition.\"\n\nBut the latest labor statistics show there were 7,700 more \"state government\" workers in May than when Whitman resigned. Also, the governor\u2019s representatives have cited hundreds of layoffs during Christie\u2019s tenure.\n\nWe rate the statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10764"}
