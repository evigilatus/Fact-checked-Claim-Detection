Chesterfield, said on October 9th. \"But right after Professor Hashimi won her primary in June - a few weeks later - she accepted $25,000 from the government. Northam is now silent on his previous call to resign.\" \"This is not the kind of leadership we need in the Virginia Senate,\" said Stortivant, questioning Hasmy's spine is \"an independent voice and standing in power and vested interests.\" \"Goff.
