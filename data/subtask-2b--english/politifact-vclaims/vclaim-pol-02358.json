Tammy Baldwin, who is being challenged by two Republicans in her bid for re-election, made a claim about background checks that might sound extreme.\nAt a WisPolitics event on Feb. 22, 2018, eight days after the shooting, the Wisconsin Democrat said:\n\nWe know that we need change. And it\u2019s frustrating because there is a high level of consensus across America on the sort of common-sense safety measures that need to be brought up and passed. Among gun owners -- and I'm a gun owner myself -- 97 percent support expanded, universal background checks so we don\u2019t have the gun-show loophole, so that we don\u2019t have the internet purchases that don\u2019t go through a thorough background check.\nTo reiterate, Baldwin\u2019s claim is about support among gun owners, not just the general public, for requiring background checks for all gun sales, not just those done by federally licensed dealers.\nPrior fact checks\nFour months before the Florida school shooting, we rated True a claim by Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele that 90 percent of Americans \"support universal background checks\" for gun purchases.\nWe found a half dozen national polls that showed support at or near 90 percent. And an October 2017 poll taken by Gallup after Abele made his claim found support at 96 percent.\nBut that\u2019s the general public. What about gun owners?\nQuinnipiac poll\nTo back Baldwin\u2019s claim, her campaign cited a national telephone poll by Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., of 1,249 people who identified themselves as registered voters.\nThe poll, done with live interviews on landlines and cell phones, was taken over four consecutive days, starting Feb. 16, 2018 -- two days after the school shooting in Parkland.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question: \"Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?\"\nBefore we get to the results, there is one wrinkle here: Respondents weren\u2019t asked if they were gun owners themselves; rather, they were asked if they, or anyone in their home, owns a gun.\nThe result was 97 percent support among gun households (as well as 97 percent among all respondents in the poll).\nThe margin of error for the gun households (which made up 555 of the 1,249 total respondents) was plus or minus 5 percentage points.\nThree polling experts -- Marquette Law School Poll director Charles Franklin, Karlyn Bowman at the American Enterprise Institute and Janine Parry, director of the Arkansas Poll -- told us they were not aware of any other national polls done in recent months that published results about gun owner support of universal background checks.\nWe did find a poll of people who identified themselves as gun owners, by the Pew Research Center, which asked: \"Would you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to\nbackground checks?\" The result: 77 percent of gun owners strongly or somewhat favored.\nBut that poll was taken in March 2017, 11 months before the Parkland shooting.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to think that support reached 97 percent in the Quinnipiac poll simply because it was taken days after the Parkland shooting. But Quinnipiac\u2019s results have been consistent.\nFor example, support was 94 percent among gun households in Quinnipiac\u2019s December 2017 and November 2017 polls, the most recent ones done before the February 2018 poll.\nOur rating\nBaldwin says \"97 percent\" of gun owners support universal background checks.\n\nThe figure is correct for the latest national poll, completed days before her claim, that asked about requiring background checks for all gun purchases.\nThe only clarification is that the respondents weren\u2019t all necessarily gun owners, but rather lived in a household where they or someone else own a gun.\nWe rate Baldwin\u2019s statement Mostly True. div class='artembed'> Share the Facts 2018-03-02 15:20:29 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  Says 97 percent of gun owners support universal background checks.
