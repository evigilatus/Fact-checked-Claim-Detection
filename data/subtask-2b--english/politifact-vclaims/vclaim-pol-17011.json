Turns out, these numbers are in line with economic projections. Economic forecasts of any kind, however, are inherently flawed.\u00a0\n\nThe future will always differ somewhat from the past, and a small change in factors such as gross domestic product, inflation and interest rates can make predictions incredibly complex.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTracking the right reports\n\n\nIn his email, Choi\u00a0linked a\u00a0UM System news release\u00a0that cited economic projections for the next 25 years. This estimate was taken from a report by the University of Missouri Economic and Policy Analysis Research Center. But the projections in the release were about the economic impact of the NextGen Initiative as a whole, not the building.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, the numbers from Choi\u2019s claim were not included in the 34-page economic report we obtained in an email from MU News Bureau Director Christian Basi.\u00a0\nPDF link here\n\n\n\nSo, where did these numbers come from?\u00a0\nAfter more emails and a phone interview with MU economics professor Joe Haslag, who co-wrote the university report, we discovered the numbers came from the university\u2019s appropriations request to the state for the NextGen Health Institute.\u00a0\nThe request, shared by Basi, stated construction of the NextGen Health Institute would have a $468 million impact on the overall state economy and generate 3,287 jobs.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s pretty close to Choi\u2019s email that boasted of 3,400 jobs and $472 million in revenue. Basi said the gap in the numbers from the state request and Choi\u2019s email could be a result of the operating costs not being included in the calculations.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are these numbers calculated?\nThey were generated using a report Basi shared from the Commercial Real Estate Development Association, a research foundation also known as NAIOP. The group produces an annual report to estimate the economic contributions of commercial real estate to the U.S. economy.\u00a0\nPDF link here\n\nThe report compiles economic multipliers for each state. Multipliers, supplied by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, are numbers used to calculate the economic impact of each dollar spent.\u00a0\n\n\nIn other words, multipliers can tell you if you spend X on a commercial real estate project, this is the estimated number of jobs created and total economic impact.\n\n\nSo, for a construction project that costs an estimated $221 million and a Missouri employment multiplier of 14.8721, the total number of jobs created is 3,287.\n\n\nWith the same construction cost and a Missouri output multiplier of 2.1169, the total economic impact is $467,834,900.\n\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that predictions aren\u2019t a guaranteed reality. Lots of factors can change over the course of 25 years. So, when Choi said these jobs and economic impact will occur, he was overplaying his claim.\nPDF link here\nOur ruling\n\nChoi claimed the construction of the NextGen Health Institute alone \"will bring in 3,400 jobs and $472 million in revenue to Missouri.\"\u00a0\n\n\nAfter some digging, we found these numbers were the result of a third-party foundation\u2019s report and used in the university\u2019s capital appropriations request to the state. The request stated the institute would create an estimated 3,287 jobs and have a total economic impact of about $468 million.\u00a0\n\n\nBecause all figures regarding the economic impact of the NextGen Health Institute are estimates for the next 25 years and Choi\u2019s numbers were very close, we rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17011"}
