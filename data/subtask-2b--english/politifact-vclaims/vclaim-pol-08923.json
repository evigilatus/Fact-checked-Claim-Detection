The blog entry said the San Antonio City Council would soon consider a \"similar policy\" that \"makes it illegal to deny \u2018facilities\u2019 because of a person\u2019s \u2018gender identity.\u2019 These facilities are commonly understood to include bathrooms, locker rooms, and other changing facilities.\"\nTexas Values president Jonathan Saenz confirmed by phone that the group was referring to a proposed nondiscrimination ordinance that has been hotly debated in San Antonio with religious protests, an effort to recall the councilman who proposed it and 400 people showing up to speak at an Aug. 28, 2013, council meeting. The San Antonio Spurs basketball team and Austin Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett have lent their support to the ordinance; gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott and other politicians have weighed in opposing it.\nThe proposal has a broader scope than bathrooms. According to a July 25, 2013, San Antonio Express-News news blog entry, it would consolidate the city\u2019s \"hodgepodge\" of anti-discrimination policies and add protection for sexual orientation, gender identity and veteran status. PolitiFact Texas wrote about the proposal\u2019s employment protections in a July 26, 2013, fact-check. The council will hear more public comment Sept. 4 and is set to consider the ordinance Sept. 5.\nSaenz said his group was referring to Section 2-592 in an Aug. 7, 2013, draft of the ordinance, which said: \nA place of public accommodation, the draft said, is any business in San Antonio that\u2019s open to the general public and offers products, services or facilities in return for payment. Among the examples it gives: stores, theaters, bars, restaurants, hospitals, museums and golf courses.\nThe city issued a revised draft Aug. 28, 2013, that did not change the wording of Section 2-592 but added below it, \"Nothing herein shall be construed as directing any policy or practice regarding the use of restrooms, shower rooms, or similar facilities which have been designated for use by persons of the opposite sex.\"\nAccording to Councilman Diego Bernal, who spearheaded the proposal, neither version would have addressed who could enter which restroom. Rather, he told us by phone, both would protect people from being turned away entirely -- not allowed to use any restroom at all -- based on their gender identity.\nWe unsuccessfully sought comment from the City of San Antonio\u2019s communications office and city attorney\u2019s office on whether the ordinance would \"allow men into women\u2019s restrooms.\"\nSpokeswoman Diedrie Brewton of the city attorney\u2019s office, speaking to us by phone Aug. 30, pointed us to a fact sheet posted in the \"last week\" on the city\u2019s homepage, www.sanantonio.gov, which says the proposal does \"not change any bathroom, dressing room or locker room policies currently in place.\"\nBernal pointed us to an Aug. 15, 2013, opinion column by Express-News commentator Brian Chasnoff, who wrote that according to city attorney Michael Bernard, because of an appeals court ruling that applies to Bexar County, \"if the proposal passes, a business owner in San Antonio would still have the right to stop someone from going into a bathroom \u2014 regardless of that person's gender identity.\"\nSo the official view appears to be that places open to the public will still be able to prevent men from entering women\u2019s restrooms, or vice versa.\nSaenz disagreed, saying, \"What the councilman says and what the city attorney says doesn\u2019t say how it will be used.\" Courts will decide how the ordinance is carried out, he said.\nTransgender groups\u2019 swift opposition to the Aug. 28 revision bolsters that view, Saenz said, because their reaction made it clear they expected the ordinance would let them use the restrooms of their choice.\nSpokesman Michael Diviesti of GetEqualTX, an education and advocacy group that started a petition protesting the ordinance\u2019s revisions, told us by phone that by specifying bathroom policies would remain unchanged, the Aug. 28 version effectively stripped protection that the Aug. 7 draft offered to transgendered people.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive director Katrina Stewart of the Transgender Education Network of Texas, an advocacy and education group whose online fact sheet about the proposal was sent to us by Saenz, told us by phone that Texas Values\u2019 statement was false for a different reason: \"Because transgender women don\u2019t identify as men,\" she said. \"They identify as women.\" Separately, Diviesti said the same.\nOverall, Stewart said, the ordinance would not create significant change. \"The truth is, there are a large number of transgender people that have been working in San Antonio just fine, and using the restrooms,\" she said. \"For the vast majority of trans people, we just want to go in, go to the bathroom, wash our hands and leave.\"\nDiviesti said that there\u2019s no state law governing bathrooms\u2019 gender designation, so \"it\u2019s currently up to business owners\" to say who can use which restroom.\nRyan Kellus Turner, general counsel for the Texas Municipal Courts Education Center, also told us by phone there is no Texas law specifically saying whether men or women can enter bathrooms designated for the opposite gender, though other states and some cities have created ordinances addressing such access.\nHouston\u2019s municipal code makes it a misdemeanor to enter without permission a public restroom designated for the opposite gender \"in a manner calculated to cause a disturbance.\" City employees, under executive orders issued by Mayor Annise Parker in 2010, can \"use restroom facilities in city-owned buildings for the gender with which they identify,\" according to an April 2, 2010, Houston Chronicle news story.\nSaenz said that antidiscrimination policies in other places indicate how San Antonio\u2019s could be applied, citing a 2012 incident in which Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., protected the right of a transgender student who was biologically male to use women\u2019s facilities after a girl saw the student nude in a locker room.\nAllowing men into women\u2019s facilities via such policies has \"happened in other states; it will happen in San Antonio as well,\" he said.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union said April 24, 2013, on its website that while some jurisdictions across the U.S. have specified that denying transgender people access to the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity is discrimination, courts have also ruled the other way.\nA Dallas ordinance protects against discrimination based on sexual orientation at public accommodations\u2019 facilities citywide; similar ordinances in Austin, El Paso and Fort Worth include gender identity as well. Dallas County protects county employees from discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.\nOur ruling\nTexas Values\u2019 email said, \"San Antonio Ordinance to Allow Men into Women\u2019s Restrooms.\"\nWe found nothing in law that says San Antonio men can\u2019t go into women\u2019s restrooms now, or vice versa. The City of San Antonio and the councilman who proposed the measure said it won\u2019t change any bathroom policies that are now in place. The city attorney said in a newspaper commentary that an appeals court decision means a San Antonio business owner would still be able to prevent someone from entering a bathroom, regardless of that person\u2019s gender identity.\nWe rate the group\u2019s statement as False.\n\u00a0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08923"}
