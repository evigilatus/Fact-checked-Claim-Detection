Tammy Baldwin opposed to schools displaying the American flag and having students say the Pledge of Allegiance and sing the national anthem in school?\nThat\u2019s a heavy-hitting claim from state Sen. Leah Vukmir of suburban Milwaukee, one of two major Republican candidates competing to face Baldwin in November 2018.\nThe claim came in a June 1, 2018, tweet:\n\"It\u2019s clear Sen. Baldwin lacks pride in her country. She boldly opposed displaying the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance or singing the National Anthem in our classrooms.\"\nVukmir repeated the statement on her campaign website\u00a0and during a July 6, 2018, interview on The Jay Weber Show on WISN-AM: \"If you go back and look at some of the things she supported when she was in the Wisconsin Legislature, it\u2019s embarrassing \u2013 boldly opposing displaying the flag and reciting the Pledge or singing the national anthem in our classrooms\u2026\"\nIs Vukmir right about Baldwin\u2019s position on flag display, the pledge and national anthem in schools?\nIn the end, Vukmir\u2019s claim comes down to one vote from 22 years ago, ignoring other votes that Baldwin could pull out and cite as evidence of patriotism.\nLet\u2019s take a look.\nThe bill\nIncluded in Vukmir\u2019s tweet was a link to the Assembly Journal for March 1996, which included a vote on Assembly Bill 667. Baldwin was elected to the chamber in 1993.\nThe bill aimed to change some of the requirements around displaying the American flag, reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and singing the national anthem in schools. They were as follows:\n\n\nIn public and private schools, flags would have to be displayed in every classroom during school hours. At the time, schools had the option to display it on a flagstaff on school grounds or in the classroom.\n\n\nPublic and private schools would have to offer the Pledge of Allegiance or the national anthem for grades 1 to 12 at the beginning of each school day. At the time, schools were required to offer the pledge to grades 1 to 8 once a week.\n\n\nA statement was also included saying if students or their parents objected, students couldn\u2019t be forced to say the pledge or sing the anthem.\nSo, the measure would have expanded requirements related to the pledge, flag and anthem that were on the books. It would not have created them, as Vukmir\u2019s claim suggests.\nIn the end, Baldwin was one of two Assembly members to vote against the bill.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could not locate any news articles from the time that included comments on why she voted against the measure. The Wisconsin State Journal did not have any record of coverage in its archives either. And Baldwin campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt refused to comment on why Baldwin voted against the bill.\nIn any case, Assembly Bill 667 died in the Senate.\nBut language changing the grade levels where the pledge and national anthem had to be offered was later added to a budget bill, which passed in August 2001. By then Baldwin was in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nWhen asked for evidence to back up the claim, Mattias Gugel, communications director for Vukmir\u2019s campaign, pointed to the vote and basically repeated the words from the tweet.\nGugel also emailed a statement from Vukmir: \"This isn\u2019t a belief of my campaign \u2013 it\u2019s Baldwin\u2019s voting record.\"\nBaldwin\u2019s response\nThe claim we\u2019re examining is about a specific vote, and whether Vukmir characterized it correctly. However, it came in the context of a broad attack on Baldwin\u2019s patriotism.\nNeidhardt, Baldwin\u2019s campaign spokesman, said the attack was \"despicable\" and noted that Baldwin -- like other senators -- took an oath to uphold the Constitution when sworn into office.\n\"Wisconsinites know that Tammy Baldwin is a dedicated leader who stands up for our country and its values every day, whether it's defending the display of the American flag, protecting the Pledge of Allegiance, or championing Buy American laws,\" Neidhardt said.\nHe also cited three pieces of legislation Baldwin voted on related to the flag and pledge:\nIn 2005, Baldwin voted in favor of Resolution 245, which urged the U.S. Supreme Court to \"speedily find the use of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools to be consistent with the Constitution of the United States,\" citing two U.S. Court of Appeals rulings that were split on the issue.\nThat same year, Baldwin supported the Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005, which prevented condominium, cooperative, or residential real estate management associations from restricting members from displaying the American flag.\nIn 2002, Baldwin voted in favor of a bill to reaffirm the phrase \"one Nation under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance in 2002.\nOur rating\nVukmir said Baldwin \"opposed displaying the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance or singing the National Anthem in our classrooms.\"\nShe cited a Baldwin vote from more than 20 years ago. While the vote happened, the claim is \u00a0presented in a way that ignores Baldwin\u2019s other votes supportive of the flag and pledge.\nShe portrayed the bill Baldwin voted against as one that would get rid of displaying the flag and offering the anthem and pledge in schools, when it was about changing specific requirements around them.\nWe rate her claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-07-20 13:13:14 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Tammy Baldwin \"opposed displaying the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance or singing the National Anthem in our classrooms.\"    Leah Vukmir Republican Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate https://twitter.com/LeahVukmir/status/1002684873738473476   In a tweet Friday, June 1, 2018 2018-06-01    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01834"}
