Read more about our partnership with Facebook.\nNothing in the story said Huckabee was fired. Instead the story said he \"fired off\" at actor Robert De Niro for dropping multiple f-bombs on Trump at the June 10 Tony Awards.\n\"Only thing sadder than De Niro's vile rant is that high-toned elite snobs at the event gave him a standing O. Were U raised by wolves? Your hate and contempt works in H'wood, NY & DC, but in the land of \u2018God, Guns, Grits & Gravy\u2019 ppl pray for you to get over your bitterness,\" Huckabee tweeted June 11.\nHe followed up with a more comical rebuttal of De Niro in a second tweet:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just called Robert De Niro and told him that he's out of my \u2018circle of trust.\u2019 He cried like a 6 year old who didn't get cake at the birthday party and begged to get back in. http://No.Can.DO .\"\nHuckabee linked to a scene in the movie Meet the Parents in which De Niro, a retired CIA officer, tells his future son-in-law, played by Ben Stiller, he is now in the \"circle of trust.\"\nHuckabee ran for the GOP presidential nomination \u00a0in 2016 but later endorsed Trump. He is now the host of \"Huckabee\" on TBN and a Fox News contributor. His daughter Sarah Huckabee Sanders is Trump\u2019s press secretary.\nThe Red State Wave article about Huckabee was written by an unnamed \"MAGA student,\" a reference to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign slogan \"Make America Great Again.\" A disclaimer states that redstatewave.com is a \"passive service for storage and dissemination of the works that redstatewave.com members may choose to post and distribute.\"\nRed State Wave has used similar clickbait language before when it wrote in a misleading headline that Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham was \"fired,\" when she actually fired off at Democrats.\nA headline said \"Breaking: Mike Huckabee just fired!\" Huckabee wasn\u2019t fired -- he fired off at De Niro.
