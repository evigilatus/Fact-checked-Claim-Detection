Despite the well-publicized woes, however, state officials say they are making progress toward getting people enrolled in time to avoid federal penalties.\nAll of which makes Cover Oregon a prime target for critics who say the state\u2019s new health-insurance marketplace is too expensive, too intrusive and too restrictive.\nU.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., took a shot at Cover Oregon in his new \"Wastebook 2013\" -- a comic-book-style tome he puts out each year highlighting what he calls 100 examples of wasted taxpayer dollars.\nChapter Nine, \"Millions Spent Building, Promoting an Insurance Plan Few Want and a Website that Doesn\u2019t Work,\" said this: \"Oregon is spending $10 million advertising Obamacare with advertisements that don\u2019t even mention the program or how to enroll in it.\"\nHe singles out two television ads, both produced for Cover Oregon by NORTH, a Portland advertising agency. One spot, Coburn said, \"does not mention the word \u2018insurance,\u2019 \" while another, he added, \"does not mention the word \u2018insurance,\u2019 but features what appears to be Gumby riding on the Beatles\u2019 yellow submarine.\" The implication is that the state spent a ton of money on ads that may have been clever but not direct or effective.\nDid Cover Oregon spend $10 million for television ads that didn\u2019t mention the word \u2018insurance\u2019? PolitiFact Oregon checked.\nThe many assertions in \"Wastebook 2013\" are heavily footnoted, so we checked there first to see which sources Coburn relied on.\nThe first footnote for the Cover Oregon claim took us to a July 28, 2013, cbsnews.com story, which reported that Cover Oregon\u2019s new ad campaign cost $10 million. The second footnote linked directly to one of the Cover Oregon ads, \"Fly With Your Own Wings,\" a 31-second animated ad that opens and closes with the words \"Cover Oregon.\"\nThe television ad included a pleasantly peppy song but never used the word \"insurance.\" So on that score, at least, Coburn\u2019s claim appears to be on the mark. Still, wondering about context, we called Mark Ray, the NORTH principal and creative director who produced the ads.\nThe spots Coburn focuses on in his \"Wastebook,\" Ray said, were the very first ads produced to market Cover Oregon. They were intended to raise general awareness about the program rather than rain down nuts-and-bolts specifics, he said. Details on how and where to enroll were included in subsequent spots. This is a common strategy for rolling out brand-new programs.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He\u2019s cherry-picking something he doesn\u2019t understand,\" Ray said of Coburn.\nIn Ray\u2019s view, the campaign has been a smashing success. The 7 percent public awareness of Cover Oregon in May, he said, had soared to 78 percent in September, based on follow-up polling. \"Those are the best results I\u2019ve had in my career,\" he said.\nSo we have disagreement on omission of the word \"insurance\" in Cover Oregon\u2019s first advertisements. Coburn is correct that it\u2019s not there. But Ray adds important context in noting that the ads were early and part of a campaign designed to morph from general to specific. Newer ads, available on Cover Oregon\u2019s YouTube page, provide details of how and where to enroll, and nearly all use the word \"insurance.\"\nThat still leaves the $10 million figure cited in Coburn\u2019s \"Wastebook.\" Wanting to know exactly what the figure, in the senator\u2019s view, represented, we contacted John Hart, Coburn\u2019s communications manager. He spoke only of Cover Oregon\u2019s initial television ads. In an email, he wrote, \"If the state of Oregon or local communities like Portland want to fund these ads we would applaud their effort to make their state a haven for indie rockers or lumberjacks without insurance, as the ad melodically suggests.\" Neither he nor \"Wastebook 2013\" addressed any other elements of the marketing campaign.\nWe then called Michael Cox, Cover Oregon\u2019s communications director. He said the ads singled out in the \"Wastebook\" actually cost $3.5 million to produce and air. The $10 million figure, he said, came from a news report cited in the \"Wastebook\" footnotes that mistakenly conflated the total costs of the campaign\u2019s first phase -- which included Spanish-language spots, information fliers and fact sheets -- with the costs of the TV ads Coburn spotlighted. Even then, he said, the total costs of the first phase were $8.3 million, not $10 million.\nWe called Coburn\u2019s office again and asked Hart about the figures provided by Cox. \"We didn\u2019t claim they\u2019ve spent $10 million,\" Hart said. \"That was the amount budgeted. If they\u2019ve spent less, that\u2019s terrific.\"\nWe glanced back at \"Wastebook 2013,\" which leads its Cover Oregon claim by saying, \"Oregon is spending $10 million advertising Obamacare\u2026\"\nCover Oregon has not spent $10 million on the ads Coburn singles out in his \"Wastebook 2013.\" A budget passed along by Cox puts the figure at $3.5 million. A Coburn spokesman brushed aside the difference by saying his office never said that $10 million had been spent, only that it had been budgeted. The spokesman\u2019s own words, however, are contradicted by the senator\u2019s \"Wastebook 2013\" entry on Cover Oregon.\nOn Coburn\u2019s first claim, the Cover Oregon ads in question do not mention the word \"insurance.\" But the context in this case is vital. These were not the campaign\u2019s only ads, and later ads make details clear.\nWe also find that the senator completely missed the mark on the amount of money spent. We rate the claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08427"}
