Chris Christie by name, but the Democratic leader took a shot at his Republican governor Tuesday for cutting funding for women\u2019s health services.\n\nBefore the mayor made a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., Booker appeared at a Planned Parenthood rally and blasted the GOP for denying women access to health care.\n\n\"Now I want to be very clear. I come from a state where we\u2019ve seen what Republican leadership will do to things like Planned Parenthood,\" Booker told the crowd, according to a video posted on YouTube. \"We\u2019ve seen it. The first budget that came out of our Republican leadership slashed funding to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"It resulted in, it resulted in the reduction of hours, the elimination of days, elimination of access to women in my city and all over my state.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey found that Booker\u2019s claim is on target. Christie eliminated nearly $7.5 million for family planning services in his first budget for fiscal year 2011, and has rejected efforts by the Democrat-led legislature to restore that funding.\n\nAs we discovered in a previous fact-check, that reduction in funding led to the closure of six family planning clinics, including two facilities run by affiliates of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThose clinics included the following: Westampton and Brown Mills locations run by the Burlington County Health Department; Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey\u2019s Cherry Hill center; FamCare, Inc.\u2019s Millville facility; the Bayonne Women\u2019s Health and Family Planning Center; and Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey\u2019s Dover site.\n\nRepresentatives of those clinics previously told us that state funding cuts forced the closures.\n\nOn three occasions, Christie has rejected efforts by the legislature to restore those family planning dollars. The first time occurred when the governor vetoed a bill passed by the legislature in June 2010 to restore the funding.\n\nAt the time, Christie said New Jersey residents have access to \"comprehensive reproductive health care services\" at other sites and the state can\u2019t afford to \"provide duplicative funding for family planning centers.\"\n\nIn June 2011, the legislature included the $7.5 million in the fiscal year 2012 budget sent to the governor. Christie eliminated that funding as part of his line-item vetoes, and the legislature couldn\u2019t secure enough votes to override that veto.\n\nMost recently, the legislature passed a bill in June to restore the funding, but Christie vetoed it.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAt a Planned Parenthood rally, Booker went after Christie\u2019s record of cutting funding for family planning services.\n\n\"The first budget that came out of our Republican leadership slashed funding to Planned Parenthood,\" Booker said. \"It resulted in, it resulted in the reduction of hours, the elimination of days, elimination of access to women in my city and all over my state.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that Christie eliminated nearly $7.5 million for family planning services in the fiscal year 2011 budget, and has rejected efforts to restore that funding. That funding reduction led to the closure of six family planning clinics around the state.\n\nWe rate the statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10454"}
