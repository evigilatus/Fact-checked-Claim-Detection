Rick Scott\u2019s campaign has a simple message: Scott and his wife Ann have shown Florida their tax returns, so it\u2019s only fair that former Gov. Charlie Crist and wife Carole show theirs.\nIn the ad released June 25 called \"What\u2019s He Hiding,\" Scott\u2019s political group Let\u2019s Get To Work demands that Crist release not only his tax returns, but Carole\u2019s, too. The ad says the Scotts have released tax returns both in 2010 and for this year\u2019s election.\n\"But millionaire Charlie Crist refuses to release his spouse\u2019s tax returns,\" the ad says. \"Candidates for governor routinely disclose those returns. Alex Sink and Rick Scott both did it four years ago.\"\nCrist has said he won\u2019t be releasing his wife\u2019s tax returns, saying Scott was \"out of bounds\" for making the request and should apologize. PolitiFact Florida wondered, however, if spouses truly do \"routinely disclose\" their tax returns. Here\u2019s our disclosure: It depends on what you consider routine.\nA separate issue\nThe practice of gubernatorial candidates themselves disclosing tax returns goes back a long time, but for this check we\u2019ll head as far back as Reubin Askew, who became governor in 1971 and released several years\u2019 worth. Florida elected officials are required by law to file an annual statement showing their assets and liabilities. They are not required to release tax returns, but candidates for governor have traditionally done so.\nWe should note that this generally applies to the general election candidates, and not always primary candidates. For example, Bill McCollum did not release his returns in 2010 while running in the primary against Rick Scott.\nAs to whether spouses fess up their finances, well, that\u2019s an interesting history.\nMost candidates have filed jointly with their spouses. Jeb Bush and his wife Columba released several years\u2019 worth of joint returns during Bush\u2019s years in office, and Rick and Ann Scott filed jointly. It wasn\u2019t until 2002, when Democrat Bill McBride ran against Bush, that the issue of a spouse filing separately came up.\nMcBride\u2019s wife, Alex Sink, began to file separately from her husband specifically because her husband was running for governor, but in 2002 she released two years of tax returns under pressure from the Bush campaign. Sink had retired as president of Bank of America\u2019s Florida operations in 2000. McBride, a lawyer who worked at Tampa firm Holland & Knight for many years, returned the favor in 2010 and released his returns when his wife ran for governor against Rick Scott (McBride died in 2012).\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrist was a solo filer when he ran for governor in 2006, because he was single. He didn\u2019t marry Carole Crist until 2008. He has said they continue to file separately because he \"was a single guy for a long time. She's got her own business, and it's her business.\"\nCarole Crist is an owner of a family Halloween costume and novelty business, Franco-American Novelty Co., and has created a second company, Goddessey. Crist, a lawyer by trade like McBride, announced the release of three years of tax returns as the ad began airing. The next day, he released returns going back to 2001, with promises to release more, going back to 1991.\nCandidates releasing their spouses separate returns has become more of an issue in the last couple of decades as more women become entrepreneurs independently of their spouses. Susan McManus, a University of South Florida political science professor, says the expectation of disclosing separate returns really took off when Walter Mondale chose Geraldine Ferraro as his Democratic running mate during the 1984 presidential campaign.\nFerraro faced many questions from political opponents and the media about her husband John Zaccaro\u2019s real estate company. They ultimately released the returns, and Ferraro admitted she was an officer in the company, albeit without the authority to sign company checks.\nIn recent years the same expectation has come up in presidential campaigns; Sen. John McCain\u2019s millionaire wife Cindy eventually released two years of individual tax returns during the 2008 presidential campaign amid Democratic pressure. \u00a0\nBut those are examples from presidential politics. In Florida, the question is whether two instances -- by the same couple, in McBride and Sink -- over the last 12 years constitutes spouses\u2019 tax returns being released \"routinely,\" as Scott alleges. It\u2019s only recently that we\u2019ve seen candidates\u2019 spouses filing separate returns.\nHow you feel about it as a voter likely depends on how you feel about the race and the candidates, McManus said.\n\"The interesting thing in this case is that attitudes about this are changing,\" she said. \"In the future we\u2019re likely to see everyone routinely releasing everything.\"\nOur ruling\nScott said \"candidates for governor routinely disclose\" spouses\u2019 tax returns. It is routine when candidates file joint returns with their spouses. It\u2019s only recently that gubernatorial candidates and their spouses have started filing separate tax returns, though. When spouses file separately, there are two instances to look to, when first Alex Sink and then her husband Bill McBride disclosed individual returns for their spouse\u2019s respective gubernatorial runs in 2002 and 2010.\nSo the trend of spouses who file separately is a new one, but one way or the other, spouses' returns have been released over the years.
