The Obama administration was begging for a meeting. They were begging for meetings constantly.

We will not reward the DPRK for the absence of bad behavior. We will not compensate the DPRK merely for returning to dialogue. We have also made clear that U.S.-DPRK relations cannot fundamentally improve without sustained improvement in inter-Korean relations and human rights. Nor will we tolerate North Korea provoking its neighbors. These positions will not change.\"\nThis policy came on the heels of discussions with North Korean negotiators in 2011 aimed at restarting more robust talks that had been on hold since 2008. Initially, Pyongyang indicated it was open to the return of international inspectors, and a moratorium on nuclear tests, long-range missile launches, and all nuclear activity, including uranium enrichment.\nIn 2012, the process broke down when North Korea announced plans to launch a satellite, a move the Americans called a deal-breaker.\nUS-North Korean expert Frank Jannuzi, president of the Mansfield Foundation, said Obama was \"reticent to engage the top leader without having the pieces in place.\"\n\"Obama never, to the best of my knowledge, asked, much less begged, for a meeting with Kim Jong Un,\" he said. \"In fact, he took a stand-off approach, which came to be known as strategic patience.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
