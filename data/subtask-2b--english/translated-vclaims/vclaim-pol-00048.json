Trump told journalists that Erdo\u011fan would meet in Turkey the next day with Vice President Mike Pines and Foreign Minister Mike Pompio, while United States officials continued to press Turkey for a ceasefire: \"We have a lot of great people there; we will see. In the meantime, our soldiers are not in harm's way, because they shouldn't be like two countries fighting on land that has nothing to do with us. And Kurds are safer now. But the Kurds know how to fight. After Trump said, \"They are not angels,\" Trump added, \"Syrians protect Kurds.\" The White House and its campaign did not respond to our requests for information to support his claim. However, it is true that the Kurds formed a new alliance with Syria, which happened only because the withdrawal of the United States from the area that ordered Trump to open the door to Turkish attacks against Kurds. \"This statement is completely separate from reality because of the long-standing, deep and constant hostility between Turkey and Kurds and the full objective of the Turkish military offensive, namely, to clear the borders of Kurds and Kurdish forces by force,\" Bruce Hoffmann, a senior colleague of the Foreign Relations Council on counter-terrorism and national security, said Politi Facte. The Kurds here have targeted a timetable for the recent events: 5 October - Turkey threatens to enter: Erdo\u011fan announces that preparations for a military incursion into north-east Syria have been completed. 6 October - Trump announces withdrawal: After a call with Erdo\u011fan, Trump declares that the United States will withdraw from the \"immediate zone\" to which Turkish forces are expected to submit. The White House denies that Trump offered Turkey a \"green light\" to slaughter Kurdish forces supported by the United States. 7 October - The Kurds fear the massacre. The Kurdish leaders condemn Trump's decision \"to allow Turkish forces to invade north-east Syria,\" saying: \"The Turkish army has occupied the predominantly Kurdish city of Avrin, Syria, since early 2018. Their army and militia have committed grave atrocities and human rights violations there. We don't want to repeat the invasion and occupation of Avrin.\" 9 October - The Turkish incursion begins: Turkish forces begin a ground offensive under the cover of air strikes and artillery shelling. 10 October - 150 Kurds killed: Turkey declares that it killed 150 Kurdish fighters. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 11 January 2021, 12 October - approximately 200,000 displaced persons: according to the Kurdish-led administration in north-east Syria, 191,069 persons were displaced as a result of Turkish military operations. 13 October - The Kurds embrace Syria: Kurdish fighters declare a new alliance with the Government of Syria. 16 October - The Kurds also threatened: Erdo\u011fan calls on the Kurdish fighters fighting his forces in north-east Syria to lay down their weapons and withdraw from the border area \"tonight very night.\" Erdo\u011fan also requests international support for his country's fight against Kurdish fighters, whom he considers terrorists, and says that Turkey will not stop fighting until it has established a planned \"safe zone\" in Syria approximately 20 miles deep. It is no longer safe to say that the new Kurdish agreement with the Syrian Assad regime, supported by Russia, limits the areas under attack by Turkish forces, without the Kurdish expert at Missouri State University and Historic Professor Djin Reis Bakhalan. But the Syrian Government \"does not have a strong record of respecting Kurdish rights and a terrible military posture means that it will not have much influence in the negotiations to preserve the autonomy of north-east Syria,\" he said. \"In comparison with the situation before the withdrawal of the United States, Kurds are certainly not safer.\" Will Tudman, Associate Fellow of the Middle East Programme and the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, presented a similar view. \"It is certainly true that the Kurds were in great danger after the withdrawal of the United States and before an agreement was reached with the regime, which mediated the Russians. Now that Russia is acting as their security guarantor, their position is safer and they are better able to repel the attack led by Turkey, \"Todman said. \"But Kurds are certainly not safer under the control of the Assad regime and Russia than the time when the United States existed. There is considerable local opposition to the return of regime forces that led to unrest, and ISIS has already taken over the situation to carry out new attacks in the area.\" Another expert from Missouri State in Kurdish politics, the political scientist David Romano, was more assertive. The Kurds \"had never faced such an existential threat before\" Romano told Poletti Fuckett. \"Still at risk of ethnic cleansing and genocide by Turkey.\" The Governor Trump said: \"The Kurds are safer now.\" In the days since Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Syrian border with Turkey, Turkey attacked the region, killing dozens of Kurds and displaced thousands more. The Turkish President, who considers the Kurds to be terrorists, has pledged not to respond to calls for a ceasefire. We also appreciate Trump's false establishment.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00048"}
