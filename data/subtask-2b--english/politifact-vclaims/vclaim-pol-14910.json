We here at PolitiFact Georgia know that politicians are occasionally given to hyperbole.\nFrom time to time the political class seems driven to test the bounds of rhetorical gravity. And we feel inclined to test what they say.\nTake former Gov. Roy Barnes, a skilled orator and shrewd trial lawyer who to can turn on the aw-shucks routine with the best of them.\nEarlier this year, Barnes spoke in Summerville as part of the Chattooga County Chamber of Commerce\u2019s annual meeting. And man-oh-man did he ever come up with the money quote as noted in the Chattanooga Times Free Press, which reported it in a news story about his speech.\n\"If we have to scrape the gold off the gold dome, you make sure that education comes first,\" Mr. Barnes told the group, according to the news article. He made the same claim in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an opinion piece he penned in 2008. \u201cIf \u00a0we have to scrape the gold off the Capitol dome to do it, so be it. It's worth it, and we owe it to our children,\u2019 Barnes wrote.\nThe state\u2019s schools are in tough shape due to the grinding recession that has withered property values and diminished state and local coffers. The schools now need billions to avoid furloughs, layoffs and school closings.\nChris Carpenter, Barnes\u2019 campaign manager, said Barnes made the statement to show how important he considers education. The former governor has also mentioned closing the Governor\u2019s Mansion and the state Capitol \u2013 the same one he wants to relieve of its gold top \u2013 to raise money for state schools.\n\u201cHe just thinks public education is the No 1 priority,\u201d Carpenter said. \u00a0\u201cObviously there is some rhetorical flourish there.\u201d\nFlourish, smourish. We wanted to know how much the state could get if it the gold leaf was actually scraped off the venerable old dome and sold.\nNot a lot, as it turns out, despite the fact that gold has recently surged past $1,200 an ounce.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGold first graced the dome after a late 1950s Capitol renovation in which the old tin-covered dome as was done up in 43 ounces of the glittering stuff. It was milled to 1/5000th of an inch thick before being affixed to the roof. The gold originally traveled to Atlanta from Dahlonega, site of the nation\u2019s first gold rush, in a caravan of seven mule-drawn covered wagons, which took three days to reach Atlanta.\nThe gold was expected to last thirty or forty years but by the late 1970s it had deteriorated to the point that the dome to be re-gilded, a project completed in 1981.\nMike Kramer, owner and president of The Gilder\u2019s Studio, runs the Maryland-based company that re-gilded the dome again in 1998. Workers first scraped off what was left of the old gold.\n\u201cWe had people that parked at the Capitol complaining because we were getting gold scrapings on their cars,\u201d Kramer said in a telephone interview.\nKramer reckons his company used about 85 ounces of gold gilding material. He said the new dome should be good for another 20 or even 30 years \u2013 as long as politicians don\u2019t start scraping on it.\nAs for Barnes\u2019 idea about cashing in on the shiny Capitol covering, Kramer was, well, less than enthusiastic.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to dry scrape it off, and I\u2019d probably charge a hundred-grand for that,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cThen you have to contain it. Then you have to refine because it\u2019s attached to the zinc-chromate primer.\u201d\nKramer figured that only about 60 ounces of the original gold could be salvaged. A refiner would charge you 20 percent or so to extract it once it was scraped off, he said.\nSo at $1,200 an ounce, you get about $72,000 for 60 ounces. Subtract the refiner\u2019s fee and you\u2019re down to $57,600. By the time you pay Kramer his $100,000 for scraping the orb in the first place, you are actually in the hole by more than $40,000.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to make any money,\u201d Kramer said.\nIn fact you would lose money, and end up with a naked Capitol dome. And nobody wants that. We give the former governor a Pants On Fire for this one.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14910"}
