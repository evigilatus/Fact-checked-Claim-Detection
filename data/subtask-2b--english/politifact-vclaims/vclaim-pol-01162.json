(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe could find no instance of Michelle Obama saying those words, or any variation of that quote.\nThe rumor can be traced back to a 2015 commencement speech Obama gave at Tuskegee University, a private, historically black university in Alabama.\nFollowing the speech, JewsNews.com, a right-wing website that often pushes conspiracy theories, published an article with the headline: \"White Folks And America Are The Problem \u2013 Michelle Obama Addresses All Black University With Divisive Message.\" A few months later the site repurposed the same story, but this time with the headline: \"Michelle Obama says \u2018White Folks\u2019 are what\u2019s Wrong with America\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe articles contain misleading content, and the headline of the second is a distorted take on Obama\u2019s speech and not drawn from any statement she made.
