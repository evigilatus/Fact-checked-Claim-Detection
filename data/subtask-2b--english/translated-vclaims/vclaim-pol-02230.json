We need the wall. We started building the wall, as you know, we have $1.6 billion to build the wall and repair the existing wall that fell, and it was not appropriate in the first place, \"Tramb said he was standing alongside the Baltic leaders during a press conference on 3 April. Trump made similar remarks in Ohio on March 29: \"We started building our wall. I'm so proud of that. We're on. We have $1.6 billion. On March 28, I tweeted pictures of the construction work on the border and wrote: \"A wonderful briefing this afternoon at the beginning of Wall our southern border!\" A wonderful briefing this afternoon at the beginning of Wall our southern border! Tramp@realDonaldTromp (March 28, 2018), Tramp's words give the impression that construction is under way to build the border wall he promised, and that $1.6 billion is helping to pay for it. That's not the case. There are ongoing projects along parts of the border to improve or replace the fence, but none of these include any of the eight model border wall models requested by the Trump Administration. In fact, U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Politi Fucket this week that no prototype was selected. The White House did not respond to our request for comment in the record. 1.6 billion dollars for the fence, not the Trap border wall, has reluctantly signed a comprehensive spending bill worth $1.3 trillion on March 23 and threatened to reverse it partly because the promised boundary wall was not \"fully funded.\" The bill included $1.6 billion for some projects at the border, but none could be used in the direction of the border wall pledged during the presidential campaign. The draft law states that the funds allocated \"shall only be available for operationally effective designs published from the date of the Uniform Appropriations Act, 2017\" (5 May 2017), \"such as the steel designs currently published, which give priority to the safety of the agent.\" The specific uses are: $251 million for a secondary fence along approximately 14 miles of secondary fence along the south-western border in Sector San Diego; $445 million for a 25-mile primary infantry fence along the south-western border in Sector Rio Grande; $196 million for a basic infantry fence along the south-western border in Sector Rio Grande; $445 million for the replacement of the current basic infantry fence along the south-western border; and Tom Cotton reported verification of the facts on 1 February 2021 in an interview with Fox and friends of \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of examining their health or security backgrounds.\" \u2022 $196 million for the acquisition and deployment of border security technology \"This is the replacement and improvement of existing fences,\" said Sanhu Tri, a colleague at the Institute of Policy Studies, a left-wing intellectual complex. According to the Los Angeles Times, the images shared by Trump in his tweet on March 28 of \"the beginning of our southern border and\" were to replace an estimated 2.25 miles of the border wall in Calixico, Califf, which was built in the 1990s using old metal scrap metal. This barrier is being replaced by a 30-foot Pollard wall. The replacement plans began in 2009 and were funded in 2017, as reported by the newspaper. The L.A. Times quoted Jonathan Pacheco, spokesman for the border police sector at the station, as saying earlier in March: \"First and foremost, this is not the Trump Wall. This is not the infrastructure Trump is trying to bring. This new replacement of the wall has nothing to do with the models presented in the San Diego area. Customs and Border Protection published a newsletter on March 30 entitled \"Building on the Border Wall from the Interior.\" The report stated that the funding of $1.6 billion would cover the construction of approximately 100 miles of the new border wall. The term \"border wall\" is used to refer to dueling and other structures, not the prototypes used by Trump. It highlights, inter alia, the 20-mile replacement of the main vehicle barrier in Santa Teresa, N.M.; the replacement in San Diego of 14 miles of the old steel plate barrier with a concrete structure; the replacement of at least two miles of the border barrier in Calixico with a 30-foot Pollard wall; and the replacement of the Pollard wall in El Paso with four miles. \"We are building 35 new gates along 55 miles of the existing border wall,\" Deputy Commissioner Ronald Vitello said in release. Hannah R. Gorman, an assistant clinical professor at the University of New York, looked into the history of immigration law enforcement in the United States and its intersection with criminal prosecution. With regard to prototypes, it is uncertain whether one of them will be built at the border as designed. The Ministry of Internal Security \"does not expect\" to select one prototype as a design standard for the future construction of the border wall, as stated by Customs and Border Protection spokesman Carlos D\u00edaz. \"Then, eight different models each are expected to guide the design criteria of the future boundary wall with a certain capacity,\" told Diaz Politi Fact 2 April. Diaz said the agency tested, evaluated and evaluated the forms to determine which of them stopped the illegal crossing. The evaluators proposed new features to add a \"tool set\" from the boundary wall designs to the customs and border protection office designs, as Diaz said. Trump or Meter Poletti is tracking the promise of Trump to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. It is considered in \"works\" because the promise has been proposed or is being considered. Our governor Trump said, \"We've started building the wall.\" Projects are under way to replace existing border walls and to add some new barriers. But it is deceiving to claim that they reach the border wall that Trump promised a long time ago. A recent allocation of $1.6 billion allows for the replacement of existing fences, but not the construction of any kind of wall models. The Customs and Border Protection Office stated that the prototypes would be used \"to inform\" future design criteria. We appreciate Trump's claim that it is often false.
