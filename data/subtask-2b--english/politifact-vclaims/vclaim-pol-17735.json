But the United States is not alone in experiencing an increase in COVID-19 cases.\nWhat is a second wave?\nAs we\u2019ve reported, the United States is arguably still in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. In comments published June 16, Vice President Mike Pence argued there isn\u2019t a second wave, while Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top federal infectious-disease expert, insisted: \"We\u2019re still in a first wave.\"\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no official definition of when a \"wave\" begins or ends, but generally speaking, it requires a peak in infections followed by a substantial reduction. A new rise and peak would signal the start of another wave.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States had a peak of infections in April, a small reduction, and then a new higher peak recently.
