The photos appeared to show that in one update overnight, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden received a sudden influx of 138,339 votes in Michigan while other candidates received none.\u00a0\n\"An update gives Biden 100% of new votes \u2014 128k+,\" said Matt Mackowiak, founder of a GOP political communications firm, in one of the first tweets\u00a0that spotlighted the two screenshots.\nMackowiak later deleted his tweet, which Twitter had labeled as potentially misleading. \"I have now learned the MI update referenced was a typo in one county,\" he wrote in a second tweet.\n\nA screenshot of Matt Mackowiak's since-deleted tweet about Michigan.\nBut the correction hasn\u2019t gotten nearly the same attention as the first tweet, which was spread widely among conservatives. Many claimed the photos showed proof of \"fraud\" or \"theft\" or illegality by Democrats in Michigan who had \"magically found\" ballots for Biden, the former vice president.\nTrump shared a retweet of Mackowiak\u2019s tweet, writing, \"What is this all about?\"\nWHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? https://t.co/6487pYLZnL\u2014 Donald J.

They were not indicative of voter fraud, mysteriously surfaced votes or other nefarious actions by Democrats.\n\"It was a simple error from a file created by the state that we ingested,\" McCoy said of the viral screenshots, noting that Decision Desk HQ does not make changes to state-provided files.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on February 5, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNewly discovered video shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Clara Hendrickson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The state noticed the error and produced an updated count,\" McCoy said. \"Once they did, we updated the count accordingly. This happens on election night, and we expect other vote tabulators in (Michigan) experienced this error and corrected in real-time like we did.\"\nThe correction appears to be reflected in tweets Decision Desk HQ sent as the results trickled in from Michigan on Nov. 4. In one tweet posted at 5:04 a.m. EST, the service reported 2,130,695 votes for Biden and 2,200,902 votes for Trump. In another tweet at 5:43 a.m. EST, the service reduced the vote count for Biden, putting him at 2,019,899 votes to Trump\u2019s 2,217,540.\nAs the Detroit Free Press noted, several Twitter users responded to the 5:04 a.m. EST tweet saying that the error seemed to be linked to the vote totals in Shiawassee County.\n\"This kind of funkiness is typical,\" said Alex Halderman, a professor of computer science and engineering and elections security expert at the University of Michigan. \"Preliminary results are sometimes updated manually by copying and pasting from a spreadsheet. The error could simply be that one candidate's totals were updated but not the other's.\"\nVotes that were cast legally on or before Election Day are still being counted in Michigan and in other battleground states, as is routine for presidential elections and unsurprising in a pandemic. Experts have warned for months that results could be slowed by the high use of mail-in ballots.\nAbsentee ballots in the state are expected to tilt toward Biden, the Detroit Free Press reported.\nMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a Nov. 4 press conference that she was not aware of the social media posts alleging a mysterious or fraudulent influx of overnight votes cast for Biden. She warned about \"the use of false graphics to try to indicate that there\u2019s some sort of problem happening\" and encouraged the public to consult official state sources for the results.\n\n\"We understand that the eyes of the nation are on Michigan right now, and our voters and these ballots,\" Benson said. \"We\u2019re committed to ensuring accuracy and that every vote is counted and every ballot is validated.\"\nOur ruling\nA number of tweets claimed that Biden received a suspicious, potentially fraudulent influx of 138,339 votes in Michigan overnight while other candidates received none.\nThe update that appeared to show large numbers of ballots delivered to Biden all at once was the result of a data error, the spokesperson for Decision Desk HQ told PolitiFact.\u00a0\nThe error was promptly corrected and not indicative of voter fraud or any other nefarious action by Democrats or the state.\u00a0\nWe rate such claims False.\nPolitiFact Michigan reporter Clara Hendrickson contributed reporting to this fact-check.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections\u00a0FactChat\u00a0#Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18450"}
