A recently circulated social media medium provides justification for the footsteps of the minimum wage - that is, the minimum wage in the United States is far below the minimum wage in other developed industrialized countries. Here is the text on MIM, which was posted by Sean Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, on Facebook, among other things: \"Minimum wage worldwide in United States dollars: Denmark $21/h, Australia $15.81/h, Germany $11/h, France $12.35/h. United States US$25.7 per hour Share if you agree that we should join the rest of the world.\" We wondered how accurate the mima is, so we took a look. There are two main ways to compare minimum wages between countries. The MIM uses the simplest method -- using exchange rates to convert the amount of remuneration from foreign to United States dollars. Using this method, the meme is not perfect, but it's very close. More recently, Australia &apos; s minimum wage has risen to $16.87 per hour in Australian dollars. At current exchange rates, this amount is US$ 14.81 - slightly below the US$ 15.81 stated in MIM, but still well above the US$ 7.25 per hour. Germany recently established a national minimum wage for the first time, amounting to Euro8.5 per hour. Germany (formerly had a variety of different rates). This is up to US$ 10.79, not far from the US$ 11 mentioned in Meem, and still slightly above the US minimum wage. In France, the minimum wage is currently Euro9.53, equivalent to $12.10. This is very close to $12.35 in Mem, which is well above the minimum wage in the United States. Of the four countries mentioned in Meem, Denmark is less accurately described. In fact, there is no minimum wage in Denmark, according to a summary published by the United States Department of State. According to that summary, \"unions and employers' associations negotiate the minimum wage. The average minimum wage for all collective bargaining agreements between the private and public sectors was approximately DKr 110 ($20) per hour, excluding pension benefits.\" In other words, the Danish \"floor wage\" of $20 or $21 is in fact an average of all minimum wages in various sectors. This means that many Danish workers will work in companies or industries with a \"floor wage\" of less than $20 or $21. This reduces the value of the concept of the \"floor wage,\" which is supposed to be the minimum wage. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. So, using foreign exchange rates, the meme is very close to Australia, France and Germany, and somewhat misleading to Denmark. But that's not the only way you can use it. The consideration of exchange rates addresses the problem of comparing the minimum wage in one country with the other. However, the difference in the cost of living between countries has not been felt. This difference can be addressed by using the so-called \"PPP\" or \"PPP.\" If there is a higher wage but also a higher cost of living in a given country, consideration of purchasing power parity will adapt. In two of the four countries - Australia and France - consideration of purchasing power parity reduces the gap between the United States minimum wage and the other country's minimum wage. (We have not been able to find comparable data for Denmark or Germany.) The data come from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a research group for developed industrialized countries. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the minimum wage adjusted for purchasing power parity in Australia is $10.20, rather than $15.81 shown in MIM. At the same time, the minimum wage adjusted by purchasing power parity in France amounts to $10.60, instead of $12.35, as in the case of Meem. This represents a 36 per cent decrease in the figure for Australia and a 14 per cent decrease for France. Gary Portless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, says that PPP-adjusted pay is better for this type of comparison. \"Most economists agree that the PPP exchange rate provides a better measure of the standard of living comparisons between countries than the commercial exchange rate.\" \"And also, PPP exchange rates fluctuate from year to year below commercial exchange rates.\" Our provision \"The M\" states that countries with a minimum wage are $7.25 per hour higher than the United States, including Denmark for $21, Australia for $15.81, Germany for $11 and France for $12.35. The figure for Denmark is questionable because the country does not have a single minimum wage. At the same time, the figures for the other four countries have been converted into United States dollars, but they do not take into account the differences in the cost of living in each country - in other words, to what extent this remuneration could go into the purchase of goods and services. Economists tend to prefer to take purchasing power into account when making comparisons of this kind between countries. When purchasing power is taken into account, the gap between other countries and the United States is narrowing, although not disappearing. The claim is partially accurate but leaves important details, so we evaluate it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07243"}
