Coronavirus spoof fools the unwary", "text": "Some people just don\u2019t get a joke.\nAn April 22 Facebook post had a mock screenshot of beachgoers crammed cheek by jowl to enjoy the waves at Arizona\u2019s ever popular seaside. The image looked as though it was pulled from television news and under the headline, \"Crowded beaches in AZ,\" was the summary \"People defying stay-at-home order fill Arizona beaches.\" (We tweaked the image to avoid spreading bad information.)\n\nSome users appreciated the phony timestamp of 0:01.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Except some users were taken in.\n\"Are people really that ignorant?\" one person commented.\n\"Wow, this took me forever until I realized AZ doesn\u2019t have beaches, does it?\" said another.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArizona has much to recommend it, but ocean frontage isn\u2019t one of them. The closest major beach lies along the Gulf of California, in Mexico, about 50 miles from the border.\u00a0\n\nSource: Google Maps\nArizona does have its sandy deserts, and it has plenty of places to swim. There are lakes, rivers and swimming holes, with small patches of sand. Lake Havasu State Park on the state\u2019s western border with California has some beachfront looking out on its placid reservoir.\nBut the surfing is a lot better at Muizenberg Beach in Cape Town, South Africa, which is where this image appears to be from, judging by the row of painted huts on the sand.\nArizona Gov. Doug Ducey issued a stay-at-home order that runs through April 30, and has made no decision on whether to extend it. He said he\u2019ll be looking at the trends in coronavirus cases.\nMeanwhile, save your swimsuit for Arizona\u2019s swimming holes and go after the crisis passes.\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17014"}
