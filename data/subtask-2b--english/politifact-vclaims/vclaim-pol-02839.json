The article claimed that the pilot and co-pilot of the plane were combat vets who did not take kindly to Saints players partaking in the\u00a0\"Take A Knee\" protest\u00a0and decided to take a knee of their own and exit the plane.\n\"Looks like the group of thugs should have just considered themselves lucky they\u2019re allowed to make millions for playing a game and stood with respect like they\u2019re told to do in the league rulebook.\" said the post.\nAlthough the \"Take a Knee\" protest has been a point of controversy in the past few weeks, there is no evidence that this incident ever took place. (There is also no mention of the national anthem in the 2017 NFL rule book, though a spokesman did confirm\u00a0the \"game operations manual\" requires players to stand for the song.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Saints,\u00a0who played the Dolphins in London on\u00a0Oct.2, made a team\u00a0decision to take a knee during the coin toss then stand during the anthem as \"a way to show respect to all,\" tweeted\u00a0quarterback Drew Brees.\nThe article was first published on Oct. 1 to Freedumjunkshun.com, a satirical news site with a format that resembles Christopher Blair\u2019s, TheLastLineOfDefense.org. Blair, a self-proclaimed liberal troll, is known to run a number of joke news sites responsible for publishing stories meant to \"mess with conservatives,\" he told PolitiFact in an email last spring.\nThe owner of Freedumjunkshun.com\u00a0is listed as a private registrant, so there is not any definitive proof that Blair is behind this site. But a quick look at the website\u2019s About Us reveals the site referring to itself as \"Freedom Crossroad,\" the name of another website that we found to be run by Blair.\nRegardless of its origins, the post claims that a protesting flight crew stranded the Saints.
