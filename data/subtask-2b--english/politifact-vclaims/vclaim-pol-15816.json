But Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that tracks federal spending, says the number is $7.7 billion.\n\n\nWhy the big difference?\n\n\nThe Democrats count the number differently.\n\n\nBefore we explain, here's a little context. These numbers aren't just a matter of arcane bookkeeping. They are significant because earmarks have become a key political issue. As a candidate, President Obama\n\npromised to reduce earmarks\n\nto the levels from 1994, the year that Republicans took control of Congress. So it's important to measure them accurately.\n\n\nThe Democrats' $3.8 billion figure has been widely reported. We found it in\n\nCongressional Quarterly\n\n, the\n\n\nNew York Times\n\n,\n\nthe\n\nAssociated Press\n\nand\n\n\nUSA Today\n\n\n, among others. Most stories attribute the number to the Democratic leadership in Congress, while\n\nUSA Today\n\nspecifically cited Kirstin Brost, a spokeswoman for the Democratic staff of the House Appropriations Committee.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrost told us that she specified to reporters that the number was for \"non-project-based\" federal programs, such as water projects for dams, navigational improvements and beach renourishment. These programs have such a high percentage of earmarks that Democrats exclude them from their totals. Their reasoning is that if they promise to cut earmarks by a certain percentage, as they have in the past few years, these programs will be disproportionately cut.\n\n\nBut Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said they should be included in the definition of earmarks because the projects being excluded meet Congress' own definitition \u2014 the funding is requested by lawmakers for specific projects that in most cases are in their districts or home states. (For more on the definition, see\n\nthis earlier PolitiFact item\n\non White House claims that there were no earmarks in the stimulus bill.)\n\n\n\"According to Congress, these are earmarks. So to say there are $3.8 billion in earmarks (in the Omnibus) is misleading at best,\" Ellis said.\n\n\nEllis invoked a weight-loss analogy to explain what the Democrats are doing.\n\n\n\"It\u2019s easier to make your weight loss goals if you don\u2019t count your rear end,\" he said.\n\n\nBrost says she has been precise with reporters that she was referring to the \"non-project-based\" numbers. But judging from the number of times we found the number cited as the Democratic estimate for earmarks, her nuance was not caught by reporters or by Democrats who have cited the figure.\n\n\nEither way, the number is not a fair account of the total earmarks. We find the Taxpayers for Common Sense estimate to be right and we find the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15816"}
