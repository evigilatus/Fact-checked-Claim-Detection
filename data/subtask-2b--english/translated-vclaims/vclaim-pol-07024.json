The Pocket of Bush - a son of one president and a second brother - can look for the White House himself. In a recent fund-raising letter sent on behalf of the Foundation for Excellence in Education, Bush discusses one of the issues related to its signature. \"In order to have any lasting success, we must first change our failed educational system and have no tolerance for the K-12 system that focuses on adults and that exists today. \"The American education system is a major example of a government that is completely out of control. Instead of focusing on what's best for our children, education in America focuses on adults who organize well over 13,000 federal government monopolies. \"As a result, American high school graduation criteria are shamefully low. Only 25% of high school graduates in America are ready for college or their profession. \"A third of American high school graduates need treatment. One third of our children drop out of school, they can't go to college or start a career. \"This is a tragedy unfolding in our country in ways that will dominate us.\" This is a lot of chewing, but we decided to check out one of these allegations -- that one third of American students \"let the university go, they can't go to college or start a career.\" The problem we found quickly is that the number of one third of Bush is not true for the drop-outs alone, for those who do not go to university, or for the combination of the two. Before we look at the numbers, we must make it clear that there is more than one way to measure the frequency of leakage. Facebook was published on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook video showing the man upset because he was added to the no-fly list to break into the Capitol. On January 11, 2021, one of the most common is the \"school dropout rate,\" which, at a given time, measures the percentage of people in a particular age group who drop out of school. With this measure, Bush's number is very large. In 2012, 6.6 per cent of children between 16 and 24 years of age were not enrolled in school and did not have an alternative accreditation certificate in secondary schools, such as a general education certificate. This is one fifth of the Bush issue. Another way to measure dropouts is to use the \"drop-out rate\" This measures the percentage of persons between the ages of one who dropped out of school during the previous year. In 2011 -- the last year these statistics were calculated -- it was 3%. This is less than 10% of what Bush said. So what's going on here? When we asked Bush staff to explain their logic, they said that many reports showed that large numbers of minority students, black and Spanish in particular, did not graduate from high school. He referred to another federal estimate -- one that looks at the number of general secondary school students who started as juniors in secondary school within four years. According to the provisional data, the average graduation rate, as is known, found that 78.2 per cent of the interns had completed their studies in four years. This figure was 66.1% for black students and 71.4% for Spanish students. This aspect is that approximately 34 per cent of black interns and about 29 per cent of Hispanic interns did not graduate in four years. The education week data showed similar figures for members of the secondary class in 2012. However, the fund-raising letter does not mention anything about minority students. So the most appropriate number to use is the total number -- this is going to be 19 percent to 22 percent, depending on the parameters that you use. In both cases, this is well below one third. Bush officials also referred to data from the publishers of the college entrance examination. It found that 31% of those who graduated from high school and took ACT were not ready for elementary school courses in college in English, reading, mathematics or science. Nevertheless, ACT graduates represent a small proportion of all students, and it is not wise to assume that they are the same, as David Beals, an educational professor at Iowa University, said. On the whole, Beals said that the Bush camp's justifications make him pick up cherry. He said, \"I think we're getting a very stimulating use of data.\" \"One third of our children drop out of school (in high school) cannot go to college or start a career,\" said our Governor Bush. Traditional dropout figures indicate that the drop-out rate is between 3 and 6 per cent, and even the most generous figures for university failure are only 22 per cent for the United States population as a whole. The percentages are higher for Afro-American students and Spanish students, and can reach one third at the highest levels. However, Bush &apos; s claim did not say anything to limit statistics to minority students, and thus the use of such evidence to support that claim is misleading. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, so it is often wrong.
