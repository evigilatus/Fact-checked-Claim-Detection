Wrong", "text": "Just how insignificant is Russia in the global economy? Quite insignificant, argued Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., in a Dec. 20 interview with MSNBC\u2019s Hallie Jackson.\nKhanna was discussing President Donald Trump and his warm relations with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin. Khanna told Jackson that he was mystified why Trump would pick Putin as a global partner.\n\"Here is what is so shocking,\" Khanna said. \"Russia is not even a top-10 economy any more. I mean, my district in Silicon Valley has a higher GDP than Russia.\" (GDP refers to gross domestic product, or the sum of all economic activity in a given jurisdiction.)\nDoes a single California congressional district with 777,468 residents really outpace an entire nation of 144 million people?\u00a0\nNo, and Khanna acknowledged that after PolitiFact contacted him.\n\"I misspoke,\" Khanna said in an email. \"What I meant to say is that two companies in my district \u2014 Apple and Google \u2014 have a higher market capitalization, $2 trillion, than Russia\u2019s economy, and that California has a higher GDP.\"\nLet\u2019s look at the numbers.\nRussia\u2019s GDP in 2018, according to the World Bank, was $1.66 trillion. That ranks 11th in the world, behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, India, Italy, Brazil, and Canada.\nAs for Khanna\u2019s congressional district, California\u2019s 17th, we were able to find a calculation by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program. Earlier this year, the think tank calculated GDP for every congressional district in 2018 and published summary numbers in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article doesn\u2019t include individual figures for every district, but Brookings researchers provided a figure for Khanna\u2019s district: $103.9 billion.\u00a0\nSo Russia\u2019s GDP is about 16 times bigger than the GDP for Khanna\u2019s district.\nThe entire state of California, meanwhile, had a GDP just shy of $3 trillion in 2018, so California as a whole does outpace Russia in GDP.\nWhat about Khanna\u2019s point about market capitalization?\u00a0\nMarket capitalization is the total market value of all outstanding shares in a company. It\u2019s a different measurement than GDP, which measures all economic activity within a locale. So the two aren\u2019t directly comparable, but they can give a rough sense of scale.\nApple\u2019s market capitalization was $1.25 trillion on Dec. 20. Google\u2019s was $932.3 billion. So the total for the two companies is $2.2 trillion.\nOur ruling\nKhanna said the California congressional district he represents \"has a higher GDP than Russia.\"\nThat\u2019s wrong, as Khanna acknowledged. Russia\u2019s GDP is about 16 times larger than that of California\u2019s 17th congressional district.\nWhen a speaker we\u2019re checking acknowledges their error before publication, we note their comments but do not change our ruling, since many more people would have seen the interview with the incorrect information. So we rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16725"}
