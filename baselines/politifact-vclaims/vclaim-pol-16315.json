Hillary Clinton made a strong new charge against Sen. Barack Obama on Feb. 28, 2008, suggesting that he doesn't care about the health needs of adults.\n\n\"I want ... each and every member of the family to have health insurance,\" she said at a campaign event in Hanging Rock, Ohio. \"My opponent only wants your children to have health insurance. I don't think that's smart.\"\n\n\nThere's been lots of discussion about the differences in the candidates' health plans, and there are uncertainties about cost estimates and whether the plans could achieve universal coverage. (We have explored the health plans in detail in\n\nthis article\n\nand in previous Truth-O-Meter items on Obama's claim\n\nthat Clinton would force people to buy insurance even if they can't afford it\n\nand on Clinton's claim that\n\nObama's plan would leave out 15-million people).\n\n\n\nBut with her new claim, Sen. Clinton makes her strongest attack yet, suggesting that Obama is ignoring the needs of everyone except children.\n\n\nWe find that is not an accurate description of Obama's plan.\n\n\nWhen PolitiFact asked the Clinton campaign about her comment, spokesman Mo Elleithee said Clinton was referring to the major difference between their plans: She would require everyone to purchase insurance (a mandate that has been likened to state requirements that drivers buy car insurance), while Obama only requires parents buy insurance for their children.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton says the mandate is the best way to achieve universal coverage. But Obama says it could penalize people with modest incomes. If premiums don't drop enough after all his reforms are implemented, people would still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won't, he contends.\n\n\nWe won't go into all the details of Obama's plan, but it includes several elements that apply to adults:\n\n\n\u2022 It would expand Medicaid, the federal program that provides health coverage for the poor.\n\n\n\u2022 It would provide income-related subsidies to help people who don't qualify for Medicaid but still need financial help to buy coverage.\n\n\n\u2022 It would require employers to provide health insurance for their workers, or contribute to the cost of the insurance.\n\n\nIf Clinton had said that Obama's plan \"does not mandate insurance for adults,\" she would have been on solid ground. But she didn't and, given that Obama's plan has elements to expand coverage for adults, it is simply wrong to say he \"\n\nonly\n\nwants your children to have health insurance.\" We find her statement to be False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16315"}
