It was a disaster,\" Trump said in his weekly radio address April 7. \"Yet, with quick and bold steps, we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time. Last month, we saw a 64 percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border.\"\nIt\u00a0wasn\u2019t the first time Trump claimed he inherited a mess, or that he\u2019s turned things around at the border. He\u2019s recently emphasized statistics to show decreases in illegal immigration. In March, he said illegal immigration was\u00a0down 61 percent since Election Day (Mostly True) and down 40 percent since his first month in office (Mostly True).\nIs Trump\u2019s story getting even better?\nWhat we found is that Trump is changing how he's doing the counting in a way that emphasizes progress.\u00a0\nThe \u201864 percent reduction\u2019\nTo get to the 64 percent reduction, Trump isn\u2019t looking at the decrease from February 2017 to March 2017, as he did when he talked about the decrease between January and February.\u00a0\nInstead, he\u2019s looking at the year-over-year reduction (March 2016 vs. March 2017), the White House told us.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection data show that in March 2017 border patrol made 12,193 apprehensions at the southwest border. In March 2016, there were\u00a033,316 apprehensions. That\u2019s a 63.4 percent decrease year-over-year. Add in people who were deemed inadmissable to the country and you reach 64 percent.\nBut if you looked at the decrease from February 2017 to March 2017, as Trump did last month, the drop would not have been as dramatic.\nFrom February 2017 to March 2017, border patrol apprehensions dropped about 35 percent, not 64 percent.\nPoint being, Trump picked the number that showed the biggest decrease, when last month he calculated the figure a different way. Importantly, a\u00a0listener to Trump's weekly radio address would have no way of knowing Trump changed his measuring stick.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from the specific numbers, Trump\u2019s rhetoric and tough immigration stance can be credited for the decreases, experts have told us. But they caution against making early conclusions about the effect Trump\u2019s policies have had.\u00a0Changes on the ground usually take longer to materialize, experts said.\n\nOh, Canada?\nWhile data backs Trump\u2019s claim of decreases at the U.S.-Mexico border, the northern border has actually seen an increase\u00a0in illegal immigration.\n\"As we increasingly secure the southern border, won't that put more pressure on the northern border and other ports of entry?\" Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., asked John Kelly, Department of Homeland Security secretary, during an April 5 Senate committee hearing on border security and public safety.\nKelly said security concerns were not at the same level in the northern border as they are in the southern border. But that sector also needs attention, he said.\n\"We obviously need to watch it, one of the things the Canadians recently did was to allow ... Mexicans to travel to Canada without visas and we're seeing a little bit of increase in Mexicans coming illegally into the United States from the north,\" Kelly said.\n(Since\u00a0Dec. 1, 2016\u00a0Mexicans do not need a visa to visit Canada.)\nIn all fiscal year 2016, there were 2,283 border patrol apprehensions at the northern border, compared to 408,870 at the southern border.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Last month, we saw a 64 percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border.\"\nIt depends on how you define last month.\nThe White House said Trump was speaking about year-over-year changes, from March 2016 to March 2017. Border patrol apprehensions declined 63.4 percent during that time.\nBut if you looked at the decrease from February 2017 to March 2017, as Trump did just a month earlier, the decrease was about 35 percent.\nThat difference would be lost on a listener.
