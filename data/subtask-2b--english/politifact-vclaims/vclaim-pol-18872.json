In the video, the speaker walks across the salon with wet hair and what appears to be a mask around her neck.\nAfter the video aired, Pelosi faced backlash for getting a wash and blow-out amid ongoing coronavirus restrictions in San Francisco. Pelosi said the stylist at eSalon, where she has gone several times, told her she could visit on Aug. 31 within local guidelines \u2014 but the city prohibited non-essential businesses like salons from operating at the time.\nThere are conflicting reports as to whether the owner of the salon OK\u2019ed the appointment, but she called it a \"slap in the face\" for Pelosi to get her hair done while others couldn\u2019t. Pelosi said it was a politically motivated \"setup\" and called for the salon to apologize. President Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter.\nWash, rinse, repeat.\nThe incident inspired a slew of stories on Facebook about Pelosi\u2019s hair, but one widely shared post didn\u2019t take issue with the speaker breaking San Francisco\u2019s coronavirus rules. Instead, it criticized the purported cost of her travel to the salon.\n\"It cost taxpayers $120,000 to fly Nancy to get her hair done,\" the Sept. 1 post says. \"Plus ground travel and protection. That\u2019s what should be in the news.\"\nThis post, shared thousands of times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe reached out to the original poster for evidence, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nDrew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, told us it \"cost nothing\" for the speaker to go to her hair appointment.\n\"She didn\u2019t fly to get her hair done. She was already there,\" Hammill said. \"It was not a trip for the sole purpose of the hair appointment.\"\nThe Facebook post plays into a long-debunked claim that Pelosi flies to and from her home in San Francisco at great expense to taxpayers.\nDuring her first stint as speaker, Pelosi did have access to a 12-seat Gulfstream V due to security precautions put in place after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But she has routinely flown on commercial airlines since 2011 and has been spotted in coach. In 2010, we also debunked claims of Pelosi raking up a $100,000 bar tab on her plane rides.\nEach member of Congress receives a budget called the Members\u2019 Representational Allowance, which covers \"official office expenses\" including \"travel between a member\u2019s district or state and Washington, D.C.\" Members who live in districts far from Washington, such as Pelosi, get a little more than members who live closer to the capital.\nWe could find no evidence that Pelosi\u2019s day at the salon cost taxpayers more than $100,000.\nThe Facebook post makes an inaccurate claim. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18872"}
