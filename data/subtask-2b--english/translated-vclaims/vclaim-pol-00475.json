Even Tony Evers promised to tighten or terminate the decades-long program. This system, which uses taxpayers &apos; funds to send low-income students to private schools, has been modified and discussed but has eventually expanded under Republican control in recent years. In recent comments, a democratic legislator claimed that it had grown into a programme with a 10-digit tax impact. \"The only thing the voucher schools have done for low-income children is increase taxes on their parents' property. This is all, as Head of State Chris Taylor, D-Madison, said, during the 23 May 2019 session of the Joint Committee on Finance, which is the budget-writing body of the legislature. \"They failed to increase the academic performance of low-income children or the graduation rates of low-income children, but raised real estate taxes. Do you know how much before? Since 2011, this is from the Financial (Legislative) Bureau of $1 billion.\" We'll leave the performance arguments for another day and focus on the price card. Did the voucher programme, also known as the school selection programme, really raise property taxes by a billion dollars? Although the voucher programme is often referred to as a single entity, it is in fact four different programmes. The Milwaukee Parent Selection Programme is the first and largest, which began in 1990. The Parent Selection Programme was launched in 2011, the State-wide Parent Selection Programme in Wisconsin in 2013 and the State-wide Special Needs Scholarship Programme in 2016. The programs allow parents to send their children to private schools with a voucher funded by taxpayers. Families must meet certain income limits (although they do not apply for the special needs programme) to qualify for vouchers and must apply again each year. The number of students enrolled in these programmes ranged from 40,000 in 2018-19 to about 75 per cent in Milwaukee. The voucher programme can be financed by the State once the vouchers are paid from the General Fund of the State - the Racine and State-wide programmes that have operated as such - but instead is now done through a complex exchange of funds. Mechanics vary among programmes, but they generally operate in this way: when a student attends a coupon school, the State pays that coupon - about $8,000 per student - to the school and cuts government aid to the public school area where the student lives equally. The State then increases the amount that the county can collect from property taxes by the same amount to compensate for the money of the missing vouchers. This system helps to restore funding levels in the provinces because the loss of a large number of students at different levels does not usually lead to lower provincial costs. In other words, the province cannot eliminate a class or drop a teacher who studies a particular subject simply because two students in one class and one in another move to a coupon school. The province is not required to raise taxes; it can make up for money by cutting elsewhere. However, since 2011, the period cited by Taylor, there has been only one year when Racine or Milwaukee did not raise the property tax to this maximum, according to the state's non-partisan legislative tax office. Dan Ross Miller, Director of State Relations of the Wisconsin Association of School Boards, also noted that the provinces are motivated to impose this ceiling because this is a system of \"use or loss.\" The provinces that do not fully tax this amount in a given year cannot return to this amount in the future. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" By Haley Beller: January 26, 2012, the state is currently changing this system for Meiwaki. The State reduces the funding of vouchers from school assistance (which is offset by tax increases) and replaces them with direct funding from the General Fund. By 2024, the Milwaukee voucher programme will be fully funded through the State General Fund, without affecting property tax. We were told by Taylor &apos; s spokesman who was allegedly allegedly using a tax office memorandum prepared at Taylor &apos; s request. On June 7, 2019, the memorandum stated that the State voucher and independent rented schools resulted in a loss of school aid to public school areas amounting to $1.09 billion from 2011 to the school year 2018-19. Since the provinces have generally imposed the maximum amount necessary to compensate for this - with the exception of $167,000 that was not imposed by Racine County in 2016-17 - the total tax increase is $1.07 billion. Prior to Taylor &apos; s suspension of $1 billion, she referred to budget costs for both voucher schools and independent rented schools. The rented schools are public schools operating under a system that is completely different from the vouchers. However, Taylor &apos; s statement on the impact of the property tax referred only to voucher schools. This changes mathematics dramatically. With contracts coming out of the equation, the tax on the four school voucher programmes has amounted to a total of $556 million since 2011. However, there are many details in this claim. Each province has a revenue limit consisting of State subsidies and local property taxes. Rossmiller, from the School Councils Group, said that provinces in Racin and state-wide programmes could recover some of the money lost because students in voucher schools still count in the formula used by the State to calculate the aid provided to each province (although the formula used for registration the previous year). Since the maximum income limit does not change, this additional aid usually reduces the amount paid by the province. This in turn reduces the burden of property tax. However, this does not happen in practice in all provinces and will not necessarily cover a large portion of the aid lost due to vouchers. In addition, the allegation that voucher schools led to tax increases implies that none of these funds would be spent if the voucher programme did not exist. However, this is only true in an alternative reality where none of these students end up in the public school system. In the school year 2018-19, 34 per cent of students enrolled in the state-wide voucher programme came for the first time from public schools, according to the State Ministry of Public Education. Most of the rest came from private schools (46 per cent), while others had previously received home education or attended school for the first time. The supporters of Fisher such as Jim Bender, head of school selection and Wisconsin, indicate that the State spends less on the education of a student coupon than a public school student. Public school students cost an average of $10,500 when they count government aid and local real estate taxes. Public funding for voucher students from 2018 to 1919 was $7,754 per K-8 student and $8,400 for secondary school students. Therefore, a high school student from a public school to a coupon school can be seen as a reduction of the local property tax by $2,100, and a newly qualified private school for a coupon will add $8,400 to the tax. The Governor Taylor said that coupon schools in Wisconsin had generated a $1 billion increase in property taxes since 2011. But reaching this level requires you to add a completely different program in public rented schools. The actual increase in property tax attributable to the voucher programme is $556 million. Even this figure oversimplifications the issue. It is not considered to be a factor in additional aid, which is at least part of students &apos; income from missing vouchers in some provinces. This means that all these property taxes will disappear if the coupon program no longer exists, and that's only true in a scenario where none of the coupon students end up in a public school. The Taylor point that vouchers are linked to an increase in taxes is therefore correct, but their numbers are reduced in certain ways and do not take into account many of the exact differences in the system. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, our assessment is often wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00475"}
