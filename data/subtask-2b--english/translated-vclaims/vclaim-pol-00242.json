The truth: Thanks to the policies of this pro-growth management, Americans earn more. Since the tax cuts, the real personal income available to each household has increased by $5,205, and the lowest-paid workers have seen the fastest growth in nominal wages (8.9%)! - On 20 August 2019, Vice President Mike Pines had tweeted something similar the previous day. For most Americans, another $5,000 in their pocket should be marked. So is the talking point accurate? Federal data supports the number -- but you can be forgiven if you're wondering where the extra $5,000 is. The figure that is decorated by the White House is average, and your share may be much lower. Where's the number coming from? The first source of this figure comes from a tweet on July 31 from the White House Council of Economic Advisers. He said: \"Thanks in part for the TCJA and other pro-growth policies in @RealDonaldTRomp management, Americans earn more. Since the passage of Act No. TCJA in December 2017, the real personal income available to each household has increased $5,205 as of June 2019!\" Thanks to the Law on Tax Reductions, Jobs and other policies supporting growth in @realDonaldTromp management, Americans earn more. Since the passage of Act No. TCJA in December 2017, the actual personal income available to the household has increased by $5,205 in June 2019! - We have submitted several inquiries to the White House to confirm the methodology used by the Council of Economic Advisers, but it has not been received. We therefore looked at publicly available data from the Economic Analysis Office of the Ministry of Commerce. On a per capita basis, inflation-adjusted personal disposable income rose from $43,414 to $45,473 between the fourth quarter of 2017 (fourth quarter before tax cuts) and the second quarter of 2019 (fourth quarter for which data are available). This is a difference of $2,059. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" However, Ivanka Trump's tweet spoke of the personal income of \"each family,\" while the data on BEA calculates it for one person. We were able to adjust this calculation by multiplying the figure by 2.5, which is the approximate number of persons in the middle household. This leads to a final dollar increase of $5,148, which is close to Ivanka Trump's tweet. So what statistics don't tell you is mathematically accurate. However, it would be wrong to assume that the average American is $5,000 richer today. Here's the reason. It's average. The increase of $5,000 is a national average, not an average, and therefore there will be significant variation in gains on a household-by-household basis. The economist of the Brookings Institution, Gary Bertles, presented a comparison of Microsoft Bill Gates's founder. \"If Bill Gates enters a room with 99 indigent people, the average wealth of people in the room will rise from 0 to 1 billion dollars, although the average wealth in the room is still unchanged at zero,\" he said. In the case of the White House, the large benefits to a modest number of higher-income holders increase the size of the pie that produced $5,000 to generate gains in disposable income. Not everyone has to expect to see their income rise that much. This is partly due to lower tax bills. It should be noted that part of the increase in disposable income comes at least from the tax cuts themselves, not from the economic growth that it has stimulated. \"The fairies in real disposable income are positive news,\" said Bertellis. \"The news will be more positive if we learn that the improvement also reflects faster gains in real income for middle- and lower-income families before taxation. This is because tax cuts for these families are supposed to gradually fall to zero.\" Income was rising, starting with Obama. The performance under Trump exceeds the improvement in the last quarter of Barack Obama's presidency - $1,082 in Obama compared to $5,148 in Trump's. However, it should be noted once again that Obama did not significantly reduce taxes during his last year and a half in office, while Trump was cutting them off during the period observed by Ivanka Trump. The following graph indicates that the trend line for inflation-adjusted personal disposable income per capita has been on a rather steady upward track since early 2013, or almost four years before Obama left office. Our rule, Ivanka Trump, said, \"since tax cuts, the real personal income available to each family has increased $5,205.\" In computational terms, the figure is accurate, but it is worth mentioning some of the contexts that I have ignored. The figure of $5,205 is average, so it's likely to be distorted by large gains among the richest Americans. In addition, these statistics have been rising steadily since early 2013, when Obama was in office, even during periods when there was no significant reduction in taxes. The statement is accurate but requires additional information, so we appreciate the statement that it is mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00242"}
