Edward Markey, D-Mass., attacked President Donald Trump for his stance on drilling and portrayed Congress as doing nothing in the aftermath of the 2010 explosion.\n\"Trump looking to open up E Coast & new areas for offshore oil drilling when Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP,\" Markey tweeted\u00a0April 20. \u00a0\nWe wanted to know what Trump\u2019s plans were and if Congress has done nothing since the explosion.\nThe April 20, 2010, explosion of BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon rig was the worst offshore drilling catastrophe in U.S. history. The explosion killed 11 workers, and 134 million gallons of oil were released into the Gulf of Mexico.\nWe emailed a spokesman for Trump and did not get a reply; however, a spokesman for the Bureau of Ocean Management sent information about the reorganization of federal agencies that oversee drilling during the Obama administration.\nTrump on drilling\nIn 2006, Congress passed a bill to ban oil drilling within 125 miles off much of Florida\u2019s coast and up to 235 miles at some points. The ban is set to expire in 2022.\nThere have been efforts by some Republicans to expand offshore drilling, but so far they have failed. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La, sponsored The American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016 to allow drilling 50 miles off Florida\u2019s Gulf Shores, but the Senate rejected moving ahead on it in November. In response, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., filed a bill to extend the ban by five years, but the Senate hasn\u2019t voted on his bill.\nDuring the campaign, Trump generally spoke favorably of expanding oil drilling, although he sounded skeptical about a proposal to allow offshore drilling closer to the Florida beaches in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times, PolitiFact\u2019s parent company, in February 2016.\n\"They've already got plenty in the Gulf,\" Trump said. \"It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing.\"\nBut later in the campaign Trump endorsed more drilling and promised to \"accomplish a complete American energy independence. Complete. Complete.\"\nTrump\u2019s America First Energy Plan called for opening up onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands.\nA couple months into his administration in March, Trump\u2019s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke proposed leasing 73 million acres offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida for oil and gas exploration and development starting in August 2017.\nThat was similar to the Obama administration plan. As he was leaving office, President Barack Obama banned drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans for the next five years, but allowed it in the gulf primarily in areas other than Florida.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut despite Trump\u2019s rhetoric, the industry hasn\u2019t shown much interest in expanding drilling due to low oil prices, said Athan Manuel, who directs Sierra Club\u2019s Lands Protection Program.\n\"Ideologically the Trump administration wants to push drilling everywhere, but companies are being cautious right now because the cost so low,\" he said.\nOn March 28, Trump issued an executive order that called for a review of agency actions that\u00a0\"potentially burden the safe, efficient development of domestic energy resources,\" including oil.\nRegulations following explosion\nAfter BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon explosion, lawmakers couldn\u2019t agree on safety standard legislation. In 2010, the House approved an overhaul of safety standards, but it never got the approval in the Senate.\nThe Obama administration took some steps to tighten rules in an effort to avoid similar spills, although the rules took several years to develop, and some environmentalists have criticized them as insufficient.\nIn April 2015 -- five years after the explosion -- the administration unveiled a proposed rule to tighten safety standards for blowout preventers, devices that are designed to stop undersea oil wells from exploding. During the Deepwater Horizon explosion, the blowout preventer malfunctioned. The rule was finalized in March 2016.\nBob Bea, an expert on risk management and a former Shell executive, told PolitiFact that little has changed in either the regulatory regime or the industrial regime in the United States. He repeatedly said during the Obama administration that the government hadn\u2019t gone far enough in terms of risk assessment.\n\"Yes, new government 'rules' have been enacted, and new industry 'guidelines' have been issued, but either they have not been implemented or they have not been implemented properly,\" he said.\nThe Government Accountability Office reported in March 2017 that the Interior Department has struggled to successfully implement key initiatives to improve offshore oversight. For example, a risk-based facility inspection initiative was halted due to concerns about its usefulness and unclear protocols.\nOur ruling\nMarkey tweeted, \"Trump looking to open up E Coast & new areas for offshore oil drilling when Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP.\"\nDuring the campaign, Trump frequently expressed support to open up more oil drilling. Since in office, his administration proposed leasing 73 million acres offshore starting in August 2017.\nAfter the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion, Congress couldn\u2019t agree on safety standards.
