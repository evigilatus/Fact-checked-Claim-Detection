Most public employers in Oregon pay the 6 percent employer share, as well as the 6 percent employee share, into the worker\u2019s retirement plan. \n\n\nThe \"employee pickup\" infuriates Republicans and others who say public employee retirement benefits in Oregon are too generous and put other public services at risk. \n\n\nThe analysis: We shot off an email to the Portland Schools spokesman.

After that, it was on the employee.\"\n\n\nNow, we should note that in November 1994, voters narrowly approved Ballot Measure 8, which required public employees pay their share into retirement. The proposal was later invalidated by the Oregon Supreme Court, but in response some government bodies made plans to increase workers\u2019 pay to offset the pension pickup. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in Portland schools. Employees started paying their own retirement contributions in 1995; in exchange they received a 6 percent salary increase. The district continues to pick up the 6 percent employer share. \n\n\nPortland Public Schools is in the minority when it comes to the pickup. \n\n\nAccording to a 2010 PERS report, about 70 percent of active workers have their share of the pickup paid by the employer. State government does that for 100 percent of its employees. Cities and counties for 85 percent of workers. School districts pick up the employee share for only 55 percent of its workers -- the lowest of any employer group. \n\n\nThe ruling: Portland schools employees have paid the employee share of PERS pickup for years. They received a salary increase in order to do so. We rate the statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09546"}
