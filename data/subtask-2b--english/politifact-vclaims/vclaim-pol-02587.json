If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined,\" said the website\u2019s About page.\nYet, we\u2019ve seen website\u2019s claim, though not always attributed to Ladies of Liberty, spread around on Facebook, with some users thinking it\u2019s true.\nHere\u2019s what the post claims:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The State Election Board of Voting Integrity said early on that \u2018more than a third\u2019 of Jones\u2019 votes up to 11 a.m. looked suspicious \u2014 and with good reason. Many of them came from the small town of Bordalama, a rural community about 20 miles outside Birmingham.\nAccording to official tallies, Roy Moore received 953 votes in the small town. Doug Jones received 5,327. If the disparity in numbers isn\u2019t enough to give you reason to smell something fishy, the population of the town should. There are 2,256 residents there and only 1,867 registered voters. In other words, more people voted for Doug Jones than even live in Bordalama.\"\nThe quick facts:\nThe name of the purported board is a variation of the \"State Election Integrity Board\" named in other fake news items, which a spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State previously told PolitiFact does no exist.\nBordalama? Doesn\u2019t exist either. No mention of it in the U.S. Census\u2019 list of places in Alabama.\nAs of 2 p.m. Dec. 15, Moore had not conceded the race, arguing that military and provisional ballots had not been counted yet and that the Alabama secretary of state still hadn\u2019t certified the race. (In a CNN interview, the Alabama secretary of state expressed skepticism that election outcome would be different.)\nLadies of Liberty says its posts are not fake news because they are \"not real.\"\nWe say Ladies of Liberty\u2019s post is Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-12-15 20:12:40 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"UPDATE: \u2018Thousands\u2019 voted for Doug Jones in Alabama town with population of 2,256\"    Ladies of Liberty Bloggers https://ladiesofliberty.net/congratulations-doug-jones/   in a blog post Wednesday, December 13, 2017 2017-12-13    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02587"}
