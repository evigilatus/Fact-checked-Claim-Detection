Let\u2019s check.\nThe Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines pandemic as \"an outbreak of a disease that occurs over a wide geographic area (such as multiple countries or continents) and typically affects a significant proportion of the population: a pandemic outbreak of a disease.\"\nCOVID-19 has struck all continents except Antarctica. As of Dec. 21, there have 77 million cases across the globe, and 1.7 million deaths. Does that qualify as affecting \"a significant portion of the population,\" as the definition requires?\u00a0 Merriam-Webster has no doubt; it cites COVID-19 as an example of a pandemic.\nAdm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was appalled by Good\u2019s statement.\n\"Of course it's a pandemic,\" told CNN on Dec. 16. \"There's a definition of a pandemic and that is a virus that is raging across the world, and this clearly is doing that. We have hundreds of thousands of dead Americans, we'll have millions of people around the world. This is not phony; this is not fake. It is serious.\"\nGiroir said he\u2019d be happy to provide Good with \"technical assistance\" to understand the pandemic.\nWe ran a quick search of 10 science and health authorities around the world and found each one describes COVID-19 as a pandemic. They are:\n\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention;\n\n\nWorld Health Organization;\u00a0\n\n\nAmerican Journal of Managed Care (AJMC);\n\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration;\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association);\u00a0\n\n\nNational Institutes of Health;\n\n\nThe World Bank;\u00a0\n\n\nUnited Nations;\u00a0\n\n\nBMJ (British Medical Journal); and\n\n\nIndian Journal of Medical Research.\n\n\nGood, a self-described \"biblical conservative,\" is a former banker, wrestling coach and athletic fundraiser at Liberty University. More than 300 people have died of COVID-19 in the district he\u2019ll represent, according to The Washington Post. We asked his spokesperson, Courtney Heath, for an explanation of Good\u2019s statement, but didn\u2019t hear back.\nThe day after his statement, Good posted a series of tweets deriding \"government lockdowns and excessive restrictions'' enacted to contain the virus. He compared the risk of dying from COVID to that of dying in an automobile accident.\u00a0 He noted that 5% of Americans have contracted the virus, one-tenth of 1% have died from it, and vaccines will become increasingly available.\u00a0\n\"We have got to stop the insanity, and stop accepting the hoax that says forcing people to wear a mask, forcing businesses to close, prohibiting worship services, and keeping kids out of school will make a significant difference in whether or not we will die from this virus,\" he wrote.\nOur ruling\nGood said the novel coronavirus is a \"phony pandemic\".\nCOVID-19 has spread through every continent except Antarctica, racking 77 million cases and 1.7 million deaths. Leading science and health organizations across the world classify COVID as a pandemic. Good, without clear explanation, says it\u2019s not.\nWe rate Good\u2019s statement Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17305"}
