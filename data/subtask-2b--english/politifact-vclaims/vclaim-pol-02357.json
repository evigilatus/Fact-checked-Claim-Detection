Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, wants additional school resource officers to be part of any school safety package from the Legislature after the Parkland, Fla., shooting.\n\"We have gaps in our school resource officers. We need more school resource officers,\" Galvano said during a Senate Rules Committee meeting Feb. 26. \"Right now, we have roughly 1,500 resource officers dealing with about 3,800 schools.\"\nThe committee approved SB 7026, which would increase the number of officers, raise the age to purchase any firearm to 21, and establish a three-day waiting period for gun purchases.\u00a0\nSchool resource officers have been a major topic of discussion since the shooting, despite the fact that there was an officer on campus when the attack happened.\u00a0Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel suspended the only armed school resource officer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Scot R. Peterson, after Israel said he took cover outside of the building instead of confronting the gunman.\u00a0Peterson resigned.\nStill, Galvano and others want more officers in schools. And Gov. Rick Scott has proposed a separate $450 million plan that would in part go toward the goal of having a resource officer in every school.\nIs the officer-to-school ratio\u00a0as imbalanced as Galvano said?\u00a0\nWe found it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the exact number of schools served by resource officers, in part because multiple schools can share an officer, and officers are funded through various pots of money.\u00a0\nBut Galvano's\u00a0overall point that not every school\u00a0has a\u00a0school resource officer is accurate.\nCounting officers\u00a0\nGalvano\u2019s information traces back to the\u00a0Safe Schools Appropriation Expenditures Report from the state Department of Education.\nAccording to the document, there were 1,517 resource and law enforcement officers\u00a0who served a total of 2,432 schools in the 2015-16 school year (the most recent year provided).\nThe department's report counted the number of school resource officers and law enforcement officers at elementary, middle, high, alternative and \"combination\" schools.\nIn Broward County, home of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, there were 160 school resource officers in Broward County that served 187 schools.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, Department of Education spokeswoman Audrey Walden said the report does not necessarily capture every single school resource officer in the district. Many\u00a0districts have agreements with local law enforcement agencies that allow\u00a0them to have additional school resource officers funded through other sources not captured by the report. (Each school district receives a minimum of $62,660 through the safe schools appropriation.)\nIn other words, there might be more than 1,500 school resource officers in the state.\u00a0\n\"This report might not capture the officers funded through other sources, so we do not have an official statewide total,\" she said.\nWe\u00a0checked other sources for a more comprehensive total of school resource officers\u00a0and came up empty-handed. So while the 1,500-figure might not be reflective of every single resource officer in the state, it's the only data we could find.\nCounting schoools\nWe asked Galvano\u2019s office about the discrepancy in the report\u2019s count of Florida schools (2,432) versus Galvano\u2019s (3,800).\nSenate spokeswoman Katie Betta said that to arrive at the 3,800 number for schools, legislative staff\u00a0counted up state data for elementary, middle and high schools, alternative schools, Exceptional Student Education centers and charter schools.\nMore than 4,000 schools fall under that count, so the staff excluded adult high schools, hospital homebound students, virtual school students, and Florida Department of Juvenile Justice facilities, to get to 3,800.\u00a0But the state report found about\u00a01,500 officers serving 2,400\u00a0elementary, middle, high, alternative and \"combination\" schools.\nGalvano took a specific count for 1,500 school resource officers and applied it to a larger number of schools than what the report actually reflects.\nThe shortage in school resource officers reflects a broader shortage of law enforcement officers in the state, said Commander Dale Tharp of the Escambia County Sheriff's Office, who is also the spokesman for the Florida Association of School Resource Officers. He said most large law enforcement agencies are short 40 to 50 officers.\nOther counties have already started the process of getting more resource officers into schools without waiting for the state. Both Manatee and Hernando counties added resource officers to their schools in the weeks following the shooting.\nOur ruling\nGalvano said Florida has \"roughly 1,500 resource officers dealing with about 3,800 schools.\"\nA Florida Department of Education report found that there were 1,517 resource and law enforcement officers that served a total of 2,432 schools in the 2015-16 school year. However, that report does not include every school resource officer in the state. Galvano arrived at his 3,800 figure by taking the overall number of schools and excluding a handful of non-traditional schools. But\u00a0as the report states, those 1,500 officers served 2,400 schools.\u00a0\nGalvano\u2019s larger point \u00a0\u2014 that many schools lack school resource officers \u2014 appears to be on point.
