Greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, are produced when fossil fuels such as coal and oil are burned for energy. When these gases accumulate in the atmosphere, most scientists say that they trap heat and raise surface temperatures, leading to climate changes such as rising sea levels. Over the years, one of the main arguments put forward by opponents of the United States efforts to reduce carbon emissions has been that high emissions from other large and rapidly growing economies, such as China, can be submerged in any cuts made by the United States. The agreement with China is likely to weaken that argument. But the Republicans in Congress, including the next majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, R-K, were not satisfied with the terms of the agreement. Maconel, representing a coal-producing country, said so in November 2014, while speaking to reporters covering a meeting with the newly elected members of his Republican Congress. \"The president continues to send a signal that he has no intention of moving towards the middle,\" said McConnell. \"I was particularly saddened by the deal he reached with the Chinese on his current journey, which, as I read the agreement, requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years, while these carbon-emitting systems create corruption in other states and states throughout the country.\" Many readers asked us to check whether McConnell was right that the bilateral agreement \"requests the Chinese not to do anything at all for 16 years.\" We moved on to the White House announcement of November 12th. This is the relevant part: \"Today, the Presidents of the United States and China have announced their respective actions after 2020 on climate change, recognizing that these actions are part of the longer-term effort to move to low-carbon economies, taking into account the global temperature target of 2 degrees Celsius. The United States intends to achieve an economy-wide goal of reducing its emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent below its 2005 level in 2025, and to make every effort to reduce its emissions by 28 per cent. China intends to reach a peak of CO2 emissions around 2030 and make every effort to reach an early peak, and intends to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to about 20 per cent by 2030. Both sides intend to continue to work to increase ambition over time.\" The main tasks of China in this deal are: (a) The intention to achieve the maximum CO2 emissions in about 2030, if not more recently, and (2). :: The intention is to increase the proportion of non-fossil fuels, such as renewable energy sources, in China &apos; s energy mix to about 20 per cent. When we requested support from the McConnell office regarding his allegations, he made two reasonable points. First, his office noted that the agreement was based on intentions, not on firm promises of enforcement mechanisms. Manning, a senior colleague of the Atlantic Council, an international think tank and an old warrior in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of President George W. Bush. Manning wrote that \"this is not a binding agreement and does not contain any criteria for measuring progress or penalties to encourage it.\" The second point made by the McConnell Office is that China may already have planned these emission reductions anyway. In an interview with him on 31 January 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \" dropped water in Houston in five days more than in Niagara Falls in one year.\" By Brandon Mulder on 5 February 2021, according to a report in Reuters, the peak date in 2030 was \"in line with expectations already set by many state-supported think tanks, with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in a study last week saying that slow urbanization is likely to mean that industrial emissions will peak in about 2025-2030 and start to decline by 2040.\" In theory, China could simply \"close a lot of plants on 31 December 2029,\" Jonathan R. Nash, Professor of Law at Emory University, said Politi Fact. \"In this case, the same agreement does not require China to take action before 2030.\" Experts said that this was theoretically possible, but, in the real world, it was unlikely. Anne Carlson, Professor of Environmental Law, University of California, said. \"You can't stop your emissions immediately.\" Imagine if China said it would stop emissions today. This requires enormous changes to implement - no increases in driving unless cars are cleaner, no new economic growth without reducing emissions elsewhere, etc. In order to achieve a cap on emissions by 2030, China will have to begin to find clean energy alternatives very soon or seriously reduce economic growth. Michael Upenheimer, Professor of Geological Sciences and International Affairs, Princeton University, agreed. \"In view of the stagnation in China's economic and energy systems and its recent emission growth rates, this can never happen without delay in earlier emissions growth,\" he said: \"No reasonable policy allows\" any different path, he said. But despite doubting that China can do nothing until 31 December 2029, and still achieves goals, there is still a second task for China -- increasing non-fossil fuels to about 20% of the country &apos; s energy mix by 2030. Because such infrastructure cannot be established overnight, China will have to start working on this part well before December 2029. In fact, as Michael B. Gerard, a professor of law at Columbia University, said, these efforts seem to be already under way. He said: \"China is engaged in a massive wind, solar and nuclear power plant construction programme.\" Our Governor McConnell said the climate change agreement between the United States and China \"requests the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years.\" The McConnell staff has the point that the agreement is not binding and may be merely a codification of the changes that China had planned to make. However, his claim is at best exaggerated. While it is theoretically possible for China to achieve its emissions target once the major plants close on 31 December 2029, experts say that it would be less dangerous for the Chinese economy to spend the next 16 years working towards the target, rather than overnight. However, even if China chooses to make a trade-offs overnight on emissions, this does not yet explain China &apos; s commitment to increase the use of non-fossil fuels to 20% of its energy mix. Experts said that building that infrastructure could not take place overnight, and it would take years to implement it. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, so we often assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06990"}
