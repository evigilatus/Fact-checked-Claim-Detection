Rick Scott\u2019s Iowa ad misleads about Joe Biden and prosecutor in Ukraine", "text": "Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., isn\u2019t running for anything in 2020, yet he\u2019s paying for a television ad in Iowa that calls the impeachment case against President Donald Trump a \"charade\" while targeting Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden.\nThe ad contains the same misleading allegations about Biden that have been supplied by Trump\u2019s most ardent\u00a0defenders.\n\"The real story here is the corruption Joe Biden got away with,\" says Scott, looking into a camera.\"Vice President Biden threatened a foreign country and forced them to fire a prosecutor who was investigating a company paying his son $83,000 a month. Biden got away with it, and his son got paid.\"\nThe facts:\n\n\nBiden did pressure Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, but there is no evidence it was in connection with his son\u2019s role as a board member with the Ukranian gas company Burisma.\n\n\nBiden\u2019s position wanting the prosecutor removed was the same as official U.S. foreign policy, and mimicked the positions by governments and anti-corruption organizations throughout Europe.\n\n\nThe prosecutor Scott portrays as a corruption fighter was, in fact, believed to be ineffective and failing to pursue corruption cases.\n\n\nWe asked the Scott for Florida campaign for any new evidence but did not get a response. News reports say the first-term senator and former governor\u00a0has future presidential aspirations.\nRELATED: Rand Paul\u2019s false equivalence about Trump, Biden on Ukraine\nRELATED:\u00a0Ask PolitiFact: Does a video show Joe Biden confessing to bribery? No\nBiden was one of many who wanted prosecutor ousted\nBiden assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine after a popular revolution in early 2014 that led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Viktor Shokin became top prosecutor in 2015.\nMany Western leaders and institutions, as well as Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, viewed Shokin as corrupt and ineffective for failing to prosecute anybody of significance, and for protecting members of the ruling class. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s managing director warned in early 2016 that \"without a substantial new effort to invigorate governance reforms and fight corruption, it is hard to see how the IMF-supported program can continue and be successful\" in Ukraine.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA frustrated Biden in December 2015 threatened that the United States would withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired, in hopes that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law. According to Biden, it worked.\nAt a Jan. 23, 2018, event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, Biden recounted his threat to Ukrainian leaders.\n\"I looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours,\" Biden recounted. \"If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\"\nSteven Pifer, a career foreign service officer who held positions in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, told PolitiFact that \"virtually everyone\" he knew in the U.S. government and among experts on Ukraine \"felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired.\"\u00a0\nWas Burisma under investigation?\nScott\u2019s ad said that Shokin was fired while investigating Burisma. Scott offers no evidence of that to be the case, and news reports cast doubt.\nBurisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky placed Hunter Biden on the Burisma board in the spring of 2014. Zlochevsky had faced accusations of financial wrongdoing for some time. In 2014, the British government froze $23 million in his bank accounts in England, though the court later ordered them unfrozen, suspecting him of laundering money that belonged to Ukrainian taxpayers.\nThe American ambassador to Ukraine criticized Shokin\u2019s office and said it never sent the British the records it needed to make its case against Zlochevsky. Worse, the ambassador said, Shokin\u2019s office told Zlochevsky\u2019s lawyers \"that there was no case against him.\"\u00a0\nA Ukraine court seized Zlochevsky\u2019s homes and a Rolls Royce. But the National Anti-Corruption Bureau in Ukraine ultimately closed the criminal proceedings related to Zlochevsky, according to AnTAC, the Anti-Corruption Action Center.\nDaria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, tweeted in May 2019 that Shokin\u2019s firing was not about protectin Hunter Biden\u2019s company.\u00a0 The firing \"was obviously not because the prosecutor wanted to investigate Burisma & Zlochevsky,\" she wrote.\nShokin claimed in a written statement Sept. 4, 2019 \u2014 after Biden was running for president and Trump began targeting Hunter Biden\u2019s ties to Burisma \u2014 that Shokin\u2019s refusal to formally close the investigations led to his ouster. But Vitaliy Kasko, who served as Shokin\u2019s deputy overseeing international cooperation until he resigned in protest, told Bloomberg that, under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma remained dormant. Kasko said the matter was \"shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015,\" and Bloomberg reported that documents backed up his account.\nOur ruling\nScott said, \"Vice President Biden threatened a foreign country and forced them to fire a prosecutor who was investigating a company paying his son $83,000 a month.\"\nThere is no evidence that Biden\u2019s call for Ukraine to fire the prosecutor general was because of his son\u2019s position with Burisma and an investigation. Western leaders wanted the prosecutor, Shokin, ousted because they considered him ineffective and corrupt, not because he was pursuing sensitive investigations into a company associated with Biden\u2019s son.\u00a0\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17662"}
