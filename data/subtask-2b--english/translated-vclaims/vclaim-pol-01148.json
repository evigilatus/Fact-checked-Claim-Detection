In asking questions from White House correspondents about the United States strategy in Afghanistan, Trump re-examined Russia &apos; s Cold War occupation of the country. \"The reason for Russia's presence in Afghanistan was because the terrorists were going to Russia,\" said Trump January 2 during the Cabinet meeting. \"They were right to be there.\" Documentary evidence shows that Russia invaded Afghanistan as part of a broader strategy of the cold war. However, is there any indication that Trump claims that terrorism is the motive for Moscow? Historians say no. Barnett Robin, an expert in Afghanistan at the Center for International Cooperation of the University of New York, said, \"There have been no terrorist attacks from Afghanistan in Russia since the creation of the universe.\" Some Chechens and Arabs who had gone to Chechnya had participated in terrorist acts in the 1990s. \"None of them came from Afghanistan to do so, although some might have been there at the same time, and no Afghan was ever involved.\" In other words, Trump's account of Russia's invasion is quite wrong. Seth Jones, a political scientist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: \"The main motive of the Soviet Union for the invasion of Afghanistan was to balance the increasing interest of the United States in Afghanistan in the late 1970s.\" \"It was about coolness, calculating power balance policy.\" Afghanistan: Moscow and Washington, the Soviet Union, competed for control of Afghanistan beginning in the 1950s. Its value as a bargaining chip in the cold war lies in the fact that it was the neighbour of the South Soviet Union, with the two countries sharing a border of about 1,500 miles. The competition for Afghanistan began peacefully as a bidding war for Kabul's feelings. At first, both sides tried to prefer through economic aid and other soft power measures, and Benjamin Hopkins, Professor of History and International Affairs, George Washington University. Over the following decades, however, competition has become more tense as Afghan politics decline. The Soviet Union viewed Afghanistan as part of its natural sphere of influence, while the United States saw it as the \"soft interior\" of the Soviet regime, in the words of former American diplomat Graham Fuller. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to provide security for the inauguration, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" \"They saw this as an easier way to undermine the Soviet Union.\" Moscow &apos; s thinking on its political history in Afghanistan, at the Empire Cemetery, was based by the Center for Strategic and International Studies on non-confidential Soviet documents giving a window into Moscow &apos; s thinking at the time. In the autumn of 1979, the Soviet leadership became increasingly concerned that a new Afghan leader, Hafezullah Amin, was unable to influence the West. Or worse, he was a CIA agent. The Russian Intelligence Agency warned the political police that Amin might turn to the United States to help calm the protracted civil unrest in his country. In early December, Soviet leader Leonid Briznev convened his inner circle to discuss options, amid growing fears that the United States was increasingly looking at Afghanistan. The Soviet leadership decided to isolate the KGB and replace it with Babrack Carmel, a leader of the April Revolution last year. The deployment of a large contingent of troops to stabilize the country was also carried out with the weight of Brezhinev and his advisers. By 27 December 1979, there were 50,000 Soviet troops, including 5,000 soldiers and special forces stationed around the Afghan capital, Kabul, according to Jones. The secret Russian intelligence forces launched an attack on the presidential palace, where there was a secretary and security guard. \"Amine guards resisted for several hours,\" John wrote, \"but they were eventually overcome, Instead, the Soviets installed their hand-selected successor, Babrack Carmel, who will lead Afghanistan for seven years. The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan continued for a longer time and ended in defeat in February 1989. Trump could have mixed up several details relating to the Soviet-Afghan conflict. Within days of the Soviet invasion, the United States launched a covert strategy to provide lethal assistance to the Afghan rebel militants fighting the occupied Soviet forces. Osama bin Laden, who would later have become the world &apos; s most famous terrorist, was among a group of Arab fighters who fought against the Soviets alongside the Mujahideen. It should be noted that there is no evidence that the United States was armed or directly funded by Bin Laden (given advice to our friends in Factcheck.org), although it is possible that this common misconception was in Trump's mind at the time of his claim. In any case, United States aid went to the Afghan rebels only after the Soviet invasion. Our Governor Trump said, \"The reason for Russia's presence in Afghanistan was because the terrorists were entering Russia.\" The Soviet Union's motive for the invasion of Afghanistan was the cold war power balance policy. Historians stated that Afghanistan had never served as a launching pad for terrorist attacks in Russia. We value these pants on fire.
