Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat, and Steve LaTourette, the Ohio Republican.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we're again waiting for leadership from the Democrats who run Washington,\" Boehner added, and then refreshed a favorite GOP talking point: \"The Democrat-controlled Senate, it hasn't passed a budget in more than 1,000 days.\"\n\nUltimately the House approved the Ryan budget by a near party-line 228-191 vote, but it isn\u2019t expected to go anywhere in the Senate.

Senate Democrats have neglected one of their most basic responsibilities.\" (Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio)\n\n\"Congress has worked for two years without passing a budget.\" (former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer)\n\nThe U.S. Senate Democrats \"have gone without any budget at all\" for almost three years. (Ryan)\n\n\n\nEach of those statements cites the same starting point as Boehner\u2019s claim of 1,000 days -- April 29, 2009. That was, \u00a0according to the Congressional Research Service and news sources, when the Senate passed a budget resolution for fiscal 2010.\n\nNo budget resolution has passed since then, so Boehner's time tally -- like those of the previously checked statements -- is accurate. The day his video statement was posted, March 28, 2012, was 1,064 days from that date.\n\nThe PolitiFact rulings on these and other similar statements depended on their phrasing, but none was rated entirely True.\n\nKnowing how Congress comes up with its federal budget helps to explain why.\n\nSince the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years. If these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise.\n\nBudget resolutions are policy plans. They are not appropriations bills, or spending bills, which actually allocate money for specific purposes.\n\nIf a budget resolution doesn\u2019t pass, the federal government won\u2019t go dark. In the absence of a budget resolution, appropriations bills have continued to allocate money.\n\nBut, as a previous PolitiFact story said, \"the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.\"\n\nWe wondered if the Senate, under Democratic control, had neglected its basic responsibility.\n\nOur PolitiFact colleagues in Wisconsin, Florida and at PolitiFact national had the same question, and concluded that neither party can claim superiority on budget resolutions.\n\nIn 2010, the then Democratic-controlled House and Senate did not adopt a budget resolution or adopt a single spending bill \"because the Democrats were afraid of being labeled big spenders,\" said Steve Ellis, a budget expert with Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending.\n\nSenate Democrats didn\u2019t pass a fiscal 2011 budget because \"Republicans were threatening to hijack the budget process and waste the American people\u2019s time with pointless political votes,\" a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told PolitiFact Florida. \"Faced with this obstruction, we decided it would be a more productive use of the American people\u2019s time to move on and address other issues critical to middle-class families.\"\n\nOur Florida colleagues also found that the House and Senate have failed to pass a joint budget bill on four earlier occasions since 1983.\n\nFor fiscal year 2003, the Senate, under Democratic control in 2002, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind. For fiscal 1999, 2005 and 2007, the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress.\n\nThose facts lend perspective to Boehner\u2019s statement.\n\nBut on its face, Boehner\u2019s statement is accurate. And it is more precisely worded than those that we\u2019ve previously checked.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, it rates True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11208"}
