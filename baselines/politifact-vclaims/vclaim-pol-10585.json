Warren Kampf was making the case at a town hall meeting for his state to have identification laws similar to Georgia to prevent voter fraud at the polls.\n\nA court battle is under way in Pennsylvania on the legality of the state\u2019s voter ID law.\n\n\"Georgia has a very similar law. They\u2019ve had it for six years. And they had it in 2008, and in those communities which often are said to have been impacted by voter ID laws, the turnout was actually far greater than it should have been demographically,\" Kampf, a Republican, said.\n\nThe comments were initially reported on a Patch.com website in Pennsylvania, and then the Huffington Post.\n\nWe wondered: Was voter turnout higher among some historically disadvantaged groups during Georgia\u2019s 2008 election cycle? And, if so, is there some context to consider?\n\nThis is not the first time someone has used Georgia as a case study on voter ID laws and their impact, or lack thereof, on the 2008 presidential election. The speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives said Georgia\u2019s voter ID law did not dissuade blacks from voting and added it\u2019s been helpful.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio said the claim wasn\u2019t supported by research and rated it Half True.\n\nKampf was apparently talking about black voters. A gentleman in Kampf\u2019s office told us that the percentage of Georgians who are black who voted in 2008 was higher than past years. We asked him for more information to back up the representative\u2019s claim, or to talk to Kampf himself. PolitiFact Georgia did not get a reply. A telephone message left at his office was not returned.\n\nIn 2006, the Georgia Legislature passed a law requiring adults to produce a form of picture identification when voting in person to stop fraud. Acceptable forms of ID include a driver\u2019s license, a U.S. passport, military photo and student ID from a state college. Some black politicians and officials have criticized Georgia\u2019s voter ID law and similar laws in other states as attempts by Republicans to discourage some who typically vote for Democrats, particularly African-Americans, from voting. \n\n\"We call those poll taxes,\" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said during a recent speech to the NAACP in which he equated Texas' photo ID law to instances post-slavery in which blacks had to pay a tax or pass a test in order to vote.\n\nNonsense, voter ID proponents say. \n\nIn 2004, about 76 percent of black women and 66 percent of black men registered to vote in Georgia cast ballots in that year\u2019s presidential election, according to data we found on the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s website. In 2008, an estimated 80 percent of black women and 70 percent of black men registered to vote in Georgia voted in the November presidential election, the website shows. \n\nIn 2004, black voters made up 25 percent of Georgia\u2019s electorate, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. In 2008, according to exit polls, African-Americans cast 30 percent of all ballots in Georgia. Similar increases occurred among black voters nationwide.\n\nWe quickly considered one clear difference between those two elections: Barack Obama. Most black voters were pretty excited about the prospects of the nation electing its first African-American president in 2008. Exit polls found Obama won 98 percent of Georgia\u2019s black voters, the AJC reported.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia spoke to three political science professors with expertise on racial voting demographics. All three said Obama was a factor in the percentage of blacks who voted in Georgia.\n\n\"2008 is not necessarily a good base year for anything because it\u2019s such a special case,\" said Clark Atlanta University associate political science professor William Boone.\n\nBoone said he\u2019s unaware of any data that examines how many people have been turned away from voting because they don\u2019t have an acceptable form of identification. That\u2019s another reason Boone said Kampf\u2019s claim cannot be substantiated.\n\nUniversity of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said Obama\u2019s presence on the 2008 ballot \"undoubtedly\" was a factor in turnout among black voters. Bullock contends that shows people can adjust to any local or state regulations in order to vote if they feel a particular race is important enough to them.\n\nThe 2008 results, Bullock said, \"suggest if you want to go out and vote, you\u2019ll do that.\"\n\nTraditionally, Bullock noted, there are patterns based on education and income. Higher-educated people and the rich vote in higher percentages, he and others say. Emory University associate political science professor Andra Gillespie discussed that point with us.\n\n\"The legislator in question here seems to think that because there was a spike in turnout in 2008, there are no barriers to turnout for any blacks,\" Gillespie said via email. \"This is not the group ... about which advocates are concerned. They are worried about those who are poor, less educated, older, don't drive, don't use social services, or who live in inner cities or rural areas.\"\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any data that examined whether low-income or lesser-educated black Georgians voted at a lesser clip between the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that black voter turnout in Georgia did increase between the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections, but the increase wasn\u2019t, as Kampf said, \"far greater.\" Also, the 2008 election was, as Boone said, a \"special case.\" \n\nKampf\u2019s statement is accurate, but it needs some clarification and context. \n\nOur rating: Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10585"}
