But the amount will likely be in the same ballpark as its scoring of the House bill, which cut taxes by about $1 trillion over 10 years, with high-income households and the health care industry gaining most of those benefits, according to the Tax Policy Center.\nThe Senate bill repeals Affordable Care Act taxes that levy a 3.8 percent fee on investment income, as well as a tax on individuals making $200,000 or more ($250,000 for couples).\nThe bill also eliminates ACA taxes that target health insurers, and makers of prescription drugs and medical devices.\nWe should also note that middle- and lower-income consumers would likely see benefits from tax cuts in the form of lower prices and reduced fees on health savings accounts, as we pointed out in\u00a0an earlier check of a House version of the bill.\nTax cuts paid for by cutting health care\nObama is correct that tax cuts would be offset by cutting spending on health care.\nBut it\u2019s a stretch to say everybody\u2019s health care would suffer, when what\u2019s on the chopping block is federal funding for lower-income Americans.\nIn the individual market, the Senate bill changes the formula for calculating how much help the federal government gives lower-income Americans to buy insurance.\nCompared with\u00a0the Obamacare formula, the Senate GOP version would amount to a 15 percent across-the-board cut in premium subsidies, and result in low-income people paying higher premiums for bigger deductibles, according to Larry Levitt,\u00a0senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care think tank.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting in 2020, the Senate bill also repeals Obamacare\u2019s cost-sharing subsidies that help lower-income Americans defray the cost of deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses.\nBut the biggest cut in federal spending comes out of Medicaid, by changing the share carried by the federal government, relative to states.\nThe Senate bill converts federal Medicaid funding to a per capita cap starting in 2020, placing a ceiling on the amount of funding a state gets per enrollee. Alternatively, states could opt for a block grant, a fixed amount of federal funds. Under either approach, the federal government would provide less to states than under Obamacare.\nSeparately, starting in 2021, the Senate bill begins a three-year phase out of enhanced funding given to the 31 states (plus Washington, D.C.) that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. As we noted in a previous check of the House bill, reducing this funding would likely cause states to end expansion.\n\u00a0\nThis graphic from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is a side-by-side illustration of Obama\u2019s claim that Republicans are rewarding wealthy Americans through a health care cut.\nThe yellow bar shows $33 billion going to the top 400 highest-income households as a result of repealing the Obamacare tax cuts.\nThe red bar shows how removing $33 billion in revenue translates to cutting off funding for Medicaid expansion population of four states\u2015Alaska, Arkansas, West Virginia and Nevada. (Note: This graphic is based on the CBO\u2019s earlier score of the House version, which will likely differ from its score of the Senate).\nOur ruling\nObama said that\u00a0the Senate bill \"hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else.\"\nThe Senate bill does give a tax cut to wealthy Americans and medical-related industry. Assuming a budget analysis of the Senate bill is similar to that of the House version, the tax cut will be to the tune of $1 trillion.\nIt\u2019s a bit hyperbolic to say everybody\u2019s health care would be cut to finance the tax cut; it\u2019s mostly lower-income people who lose out as a direct result of the bill. He\u2019s right that the Senate bill would deliver a tax cut as it reduces the amount of federal funding lower-income Americans would get to help buy insurance. The bill would also repeal funding to defray deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for those eligible. It also lessens the share of Medicaid funding carried by the federal government, relative to states.\nWe rate Obama\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2017-06-26 20:20:50 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  The Senate bill \"hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else.\"    Barack Obama Former President   Facebook Thursday, June 22, 2017 2017-06-22    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03171"}
