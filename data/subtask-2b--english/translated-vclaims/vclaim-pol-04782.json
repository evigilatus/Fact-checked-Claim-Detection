Hypothesis: What would the American economy look like with the responsible Trump? \"Over the years, he said all kinds of things about women in the labour force,\" Clinton said. \"One time he called pregnant employees -- and I quote -- \"annoying.\" Clinton continued, saying that even she couldn't believe Trump made such remarks as \"inappropriate,\" despite assurances from her researchers and author of speeches. We looked for the clamp. The Trump comment stems from an interview with Trump from 2004. The part was, \"Blonde ambition,\" about Caroline Kisher, Tramp's training assistant and Deputy CEO of Trump's golf property. Kibisher just issued Caroline 101 a memo on her work experience. Kibisher describes herself as a direct shot, but as the interviewer pointed out, it seems to be inconsistent with a tale in the book Kisher tells that she was six months pregnant before Trump was told. \"I was worried he might get upset\"? The reporter asked me. \"Maybe, in my mind, he might think that this might be a setback,\" answered Kisper. When the article turned into Trump, the audience answered a question that was not heard because of editing. \"Well you know, pregnancy is never, um-- it's a wonderful thing for a woman, it's a wonderful thing for a husband, it's definitely annoying for business. Whether people want to say it or not, the truth is that it's an inconvenience to someone who runs a business.\" On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy: January 20, 2021, because viewers do not hear the question Trump answers, and the only other person who used the word \"incompatibility\" was a history reporter, this term could have been introduced as part of the journalist's question. Studies have shown that the costs of sheltering pregnant employees are very low. The National Centre for Women &apos; s Law published a fact sheet in 2012, which indicated that the residences already provided by employers to disabled workers are largely the same as pregnant women, only temporarily. And positive gains -- better employment and retention of workers, productivity enhancement, reduced absence, better safety in the workplace -- are higher than any costs, according to the fact sheet. Trump &apos; s views on pregnancy did not affect Kisser &apos; s admiration for her former president. She said: \"If there's one thing I learned from Donald, it's to make a decision, make it fast, and hold on to it,\" she said: \"If there's one thing I learned from Donald, it's to make a decision, and stick to it.\" There is no doubt that Trump did not view his daughter Ivanka's pregnancy as an inconvenience when she stood by him. Trump told the crowds in both states that he would like his daughter to have her baby there. \"You know, she had a kid like five days ago,\" said Trump about Ivanka at the March march in New York, about 10 days after Ivanka was born. \"She did a good job. So I shouldn't say Ivanka, you're fired, right? I promise.\" We searched but were unable to find any additional comments from Trump about the female employee who became pregnant. Our referee, Clinton, said Trump called pregnancy \"annoying\" to employers. Trump used this word in an interview in 2004 with the NBC timeline. \"The truth is it's an inconvenience to someone who runs a job,\" said Trump. Clinton's claim is a minute. We evaluate it correctly. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f3498750-e3e7-457c-ba24-b6bca90e01ea", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04782"}
