In the second democratic debate in Miami, Harris said that Baiden worked with unarmed senators to oppose the bus. Harris asked Payden, \"Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose taking off in America?\" Biden replied: \"No. I didn't object to taking off in America. What I object to is to travel by order of the Ministry of Education. That's what I opposed.\" (We will note that the Ministry of Education was not established until 1979, but its general view was that it opposed the bus if it was a federal state either directly or through funding rules. We found that Paden tried to simplify too much for his complicated bus record. He ignored the fact that he regularly objected to overcrowding, although he supported other measures relating to civil rights such as the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act. In 1972, Bayden won his seat in the Senate on the integration platform, but once he took office, he faced white voters who hated the idea of crowding. In 1974, the Federal Court ordered the consolidation of Wilmington schools by bringing the case to Beit Biden. In the Senate, Paiden began to support many anti-failure legislation. We were told by the historian of the University of New Hampshire Jason Sokoul, who followed Paiden's response to the local opposition, of the amendments endorsed by Paiden \"a rather confusing picture.\" Paiden suggested some amendments that would hinder separation while at other times it was revised. After discussion, Sokol told us that Paden's position on the bus had evolved, but by the late 1970s, he was resisting the bus. Polyte Fruitte said that Paden's claim was for integration, but not overcrowding meant much. \"At that point in history, there were very few school districts voluntarily integrated by other means, which is why judges ordered the bus. He said that he was using a tricky logic. &quot; The Paiden campaign made reference to exceptions, including in 1974 when it voted to introduce a bankruptcy amendment sponsored by Mr. Edward Gorni of the Central African Republic. The amendment to the Education Bill was submitted by one vote on 15 May 1974. The New York Times called a victory vote for liberals. In 1975, Biden supported an amendment by Sin Jesse Helms, Governor of North Carolina who opposed civil rights, while he did not share all the views of those who opposed overcrowding. The purpose of the amendment was to prevent the Federal Government from collecting any data on the race of students or teachers in an attempt to protect provinces that refused integration. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman \u2022 January 11, 2021 \"I have become convinced that overcrowding is a bankrupt concept that actually carries no fruit for which it was designed,\" said Paiden. \"If anything, it obscures today's real issue of whether or not there is equal opportunity in education for all people within the United States.\" ............................................................................................................................. When the Helms Amendment was defeated, Paiden proposed an amendment to prohibit the use of federal funds to recruit teachers or students to school on the basis of race. According to Paden, his amendment would not prevent overcrowding by court order, Jadsden wrote, \"which makes him acceptable to some contradiction between his legislative efforts and the concerns of his white voters who were concerned about the imminent reception jurisdiction ordered by the court.\" The Biden Amendment was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 50. Paiden then introduced another amendment that narrowly targeted bus transport - rather than prohibiting all remedies aimed at eliminating dismissal. This amendment has also been approved. The draft Education Bill was approved by the Senate with the amendments to the Anti-Filming Act by Paiden, but after the Congress between the House of Representatives and the Senate, these amendments were dropped from the final bill. This year, the Washington Post quoted an interview by Bayden with People Paper, Newark, Del, published in 1975: \"integration\" different from \"integration.\" ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ I'm philosophically opposed to quota systems. They guarantee expansion.\" In his book Promesis Conservation, Biden recounted to a group of voters who were angry at the crowd during the 1978 elections. \"Look, I told them, I was against the bus to treat de facto segregation because of housing patterns and community comfort,\" he said, recounting what he said to people at the High School gym in Wilmington. \"But if this is a deliberate dismissal, I will personally pay for the helicopters to transport the children. There was a howling in the crowd.\" The Paiden campaign referred to a story about Paiden in 1975 in which he defended overcrowding in some scenarios. \"In cases where the school system is ethnically separated by the lines of Gerrymaandering or other legal means, Paiden said that he supports dismissal by any legal means within his reach - including overcrowding,\" according to the Wilmington News Journal. \"But for school districts that are all white or black, \"because of the historical pattern that does not involve segregation practices that are not approved by the court,\" it is against overcrowding.\" The Paiden campaign referred to examples of African Americans, both in the past and this year, who criticized the idea of mobility in the major cities of the United States \"that was the biggest trick,\" and the educational activist in Wilmington Pepe Cooker said in the Delaware News in April. \"He destroyed our society.\" Our judgment, Paden, said, \"I didn't oppose the traffic in America. What I opposed was to be transferred by order of the Ministry of Education.\" Paden qualified to oppose the bus by saying that the federal government was forced to engage in local communities. But the record shows that Paiden has opposed overcrowding, as shown by his positions on legislation, and his statements several times since the mid-1970s. We will note that while Biden opposed overcrowding in the face of protests by his constituents, he supported many other aspects of the elimination of apartheid and civil rights. We appreciate Paiden's often false statement.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00479"}
