Several readers cited additional information we hadn\u2019t considered, so we have issued a new rating.\nSince\u00a0losing to Democrat Tammy Baldwin in a U.S. Senate race in 2012, former Republican Wisconsin governor and U.S. health and human services secretary\u00a0Tommy Thompson has put energy into getting the nation into better shape.\nThompson -- who, at 70,\u00a0showed during the campaign he could do 50 push-ups -- gave a\u00a0speech in Madison on Sept. 25, 2013, about obesity in America.\nIn an\u00a0interview the same day with WISC-TV (Channel 3) in Madison, Thompson made a claim that might surprise those us who push our love handles out of the way to make sure we don\u2019t miss a belt loop.\nAfter Thompson stated that \"we are not very healthy in America,\" one of his interviewers said, \"Well, in Wisconsin, it\u2019s a particular battle. We\u2019re always battling. We\u2019re one of the fattest states in the country.\"\nThompson responded by saying:\n\"Yes, we are (battling),\" he said. \"But you know something, but you look at the statistics, and across the board, and Wisconsin is not as obese as the national average is. The national average, 35.7 percent of the population is obese. In Wisconsin, it's closer to 26 percent.\n\"So, one out of four, versus one out of three. That\u2019s still not very good, but the truth of the matter is, we\u2019re healthier. But we have to do a better job, in Wisconsin as well as across the country.\"\nBeer-bellied Wisconsin has less-than-average obesity?\nWhat\u2019s \"obese?\"\nWe went to the CDC, a corner tavern, to check on Thompson\u2019s claim.\nJust kidding.\nCDC, of course, is short for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u00a0defines obesity as something less than you might imagine.\nHeight and weight are used to calculate a body mass index. Your BMI determines whether you\u2019re considered obese. An adult, male or female, who is 5-feet-9 and 203 pounds or more is considered obese.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC notes that although BMI is correlated with body fat, BMI doesn\u2019t actually measure body fat. So, some people, such as athletes, may have a body mass index that identifies them as overweight even though they do not have excess body fat.\nAt the same time, obesity is associated with heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.\nNow, that Uncle Sam has us feeling unduly chubby, let\u2019s check Thompson\u2019s claim against the statistics.\nApples and oranges\nOn a national level, CDC calculates obesity rates by weighing and measuring a sampling of the population.\nThe most recent figures are from a January 2012 report. In 2009-2010, an estimated 35.7 percent of U.S. adults were obese.\nNo estimates using measurements are done for the various states.\nConversely, at the state level, height and weight are self-reported by Americans who participate in phone surveys conducted by state health departments. This type of study can produce lower-than-reality obesity rates, according to CDC, because some people overstate their height and understate their weight.\nIndeed, in the phone surveys, no state had an obesity rate above the 35.7 percent found in the national survey in which people were actually measured.\nThe CDC told us that, given the different methodologies, comparing the two studies would be like comparing apples to oranges.\nThe latest state data available when Thompson made his statement was for 2012. Based on the responses in the phone survey, 29.7 percent of Wisconsin residents were rated obese. Nationwide, the figure was 28.1 percent.\nSo, Wisconsin\u2019s obesity rate was slightly higher than the national rate in the telephone survey study. That gives a very different impression that what Thompson said.\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s how Wisconsin's 29.7 percent obesity rate in the phone survey compared with neighboring states: Michigan (31.1 percent), Iowa (30.4 percent), Illinois (28.1 percent) and Minnesota (25.7 percent).\nOur rating\nThompson said: \"Wisconsin is not as obese as the national average is. The national average, 35.7 percent of the population is obese. In Wisconsin, it's closer to 26 percent.\"\nIn one study, 35.7 percent of American adults were estimated to be obese. In another study, which used a different methodology, the rate was 28.1 percent, slightly below Wisconsin\u2019s 29.7 percent.\nThe percentages cited by Thompson contain an element of truth, but the conclusion he drew isn\u2019t valid because the two studies can\u2019t be compared, so we rate his statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08711"}
