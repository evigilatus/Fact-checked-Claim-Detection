It had not been previously identified in humans. No vaccine for it could have been developed before that.\nThe vaccine in the photo is real, but it\u2019s for canine coronavirus disease, known also as CCoV.\u00a0\nMerck Animal Health makes the vaccine and now includes a note on its webpage explaining that canine coronaviruses \"are not the same virus as SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for causing the COVID-19 infection.\"\nAccording to VCA Animal Hospitals, which operates nearly 800 animal hospitals in the U.S., the canine coronavirus comes from the Coronaviridae family and is a \"highly infectious intestinal infection in dogs, especially puppies.\"\u00a0\n\"There are many types of coronavirus, each affecting different animal species, including humans. Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is not the same virus as SARS-CoV-2,\" which causes COVID-19, the company says. \"CCoV does not affect people. CCoV causes gastrointestinal problems in dogs, as opposed to respiratory disease.\"\nA vaccine is available for dogs with canine coronavirus, which causes gastrointestinal issues.
