And it doesn\u2019t require there to be an absolute winner. It says the \u2018apparent winner.\u2019 The apparent winner. And we\u2019ve been unable to get access to the kinds of things we need to know about.\"\nBiden said the agency\u2019s inaction means that his transition team has been prevented from obtaining key information from the Trump administration \u2014 specifically related to any plans for distributing coronavirus vaccines to more than 300 million Americans.\nIs Biden correct about the legal standard for the General Services Administration to initiate the transition process?\nBiden is correctly describing the language used in the law: To kick off the formal transition process, the agency administrator needs to determine whether there\u2019s an \"apparent\" winner, rather than an \"absolute\" winner.\nBiden\u2019s is \"a reasonable statement\" describing the current situation, said Terry Sullivan, a professor at the University of North Carolina who specializes in the presidency.\u00a0\nThat said, experts acknowledge that the law is vague enough that the administrator has some leeway in making the \"ascertainment\" decision.\nWhat the law says about transitions\nThe primary law governing transitions, the Presidential Transition Act, took effect in 1964. It has been updated on several occasions, including laws enacted in 2010, 2016, and 2020.\nThe law says, \"The terms \u2018President-elect\u2019 and \u2018Vice-President-elect\u2019 as used in this Act shall mean such persons as are the apparent successful candidates for the office of President and Vice President, respectively, as ascertained by the Administrator following the general elections held to determine the electors of President and Vice President.\"\nThis language triggers the \"expectation that the administrator of the General Services Administration will make a common-sense decision about the election outcome,\" said Paul C. Light, a professor at New York University\u2019s Robert Wagner School of Public Service. Once that decision is made, the legal basis for \"the infrastructure of support\" for a presidential transition is in place, Light said.\nThe president-elect and his team have approximately 11 weeks between Election Day and Inauguration Day to organize the new administration, and prepare to assume national security and homeland security responsibilities from the incumbent, among other tasks, according to a Nov. 13 Congressional Research Service report.\nIn general, presidential transition activities are coordinated by the General Services Administration and the Office of Management and Budget. Once the president-elect and vice president-elect have been \"ascertained\" by the GSA, federal officials are allowed to provide the transition team with facilities, funds, and services to prepare for the new administration. The money can be spent on salaries, consultants, office supplies, travel expenses and government aircraft.\nThe agency\u2019s current administrator, Emily Murphy, has not signed the required ascertainment document yet.\n\"The administrator is striving to adhere to the language and intent of the law, as well as precedent,\" GSA spokeswoman Pamela Pennington told PolitiFact. \"Please note that the law provides no process or standard by which ascertainment is made.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

The laws governing the transition have enshrined the idea that the outgoing administration \"had a responsibility to hand off matters in a considered and organized fashion,\" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that runs a Center for Presidential Transition that advises on best practices.\u00a0\nRELATED: How we know Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential race\nSome nuances\nLight pointed to a statement by then-GSA Administrator David J. Barram in testimony before Congress in December 2000, at a time when the presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore was so close that it had to effectively be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\"While the Act gives no explicit criteria or deadlines for making this ascertainment, as the legislative history demonstrates, Congress made it perfectly clear that if there is \u2018any question\u2019 of who the winner is \u2018in a close contest,\u2019 this determination should not be made,\" Barram testified at the time.\nIn an interview this week on CNN, Barram said the situation now is \"dramatically different\" than what he faced in 2000. \"To me, it's clear that we should be recognizing Joe Biden as the president-elect,\" he said on Nov. 19.\nThe fuzziness in the law has meant that the ascertainment has traditionally been viewed \"as pro forma,\" Stier said. \"The expectation was that it was important and should be done without having to demonstrate an extraordinary level of proof.\"\nThe absence of a clear concession and Trump\u2019s continuing efforts to fight the election results are the primary reason why the Trump-to-Biden transition has been so rocky, experts said.\n\"For 220 years, our country has had a peaceful transition of power,\" said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied transition issues. Trump has not only refused to concede, but he has \"perpetuated the myth that the election was somehow fraudulent,\" she said.\nStier argues that, even in the absence of a formal ascertainment, the Trump administration could voluntarily start doing some things to help the incoming administration get ready, such as sharing intelligence, encouraging meetings with public health officials, and allowing security-clearance investigations to begin.\n\"This is not about some abstract decision that GSA has to make \u2014 it\u2019s about choices being made to pursue a policy of noncooperation,\" Stier said.\nLight lays the blame on Trump, not on Murphy, who he says is required to answer to a vague law.\n\"Everything here hinges on good faith,\" Light said. \"The GSA administrator may have been well within the boundaries of the statute to deny a formal launch decision, but Trump's interference and threats have poisoned the cooperative relationship that has long marked the process, even after bitter campaigns such as 1980, when Reagan bested Carter for the presidency.\"\u00a0\nRELATED: How narrow was Joe Biden\u2019s victory over Donald Trump?\nOur ruling\nBiden said the law governing the transition of presidential power \"doesn\u2019t require there to be an absolute winner. It says the \u2018apparent winner.\u2019\"\nBiden has accurately phrased the language of the law, but the law is vague enough that it allows some leeway in making an \"ascertainment\" decision.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Trump administration has impeded a smooth transition in spite of the letter of the law, by challenging election results in courts.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18550"}
