He says the nation needs a leader rather than a specialist in foreign affairs and often cites Ronald Reagan as an example of a strong leader without a foreign policy background.\n\n\nBy contrast, McCain plays up his foreign policy credentials from his time in the Senate, especially his role as an outspoken supporter of additional troops in Iraq.\n\n\nIt's clear that Romney didn't say exactly what McCain has attributed to him. It also is clear that while McCain doesn't quote him directly, he's taking Romney's words a bit too literally. The question then is how to judge the accuracy of what McCain has charged. Did Romney say a president doesn't need foreign policy experience? Mostly, yes he did.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16439"}
