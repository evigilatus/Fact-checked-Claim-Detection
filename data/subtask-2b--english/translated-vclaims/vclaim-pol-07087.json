We decided to take a look. Although the Declaration does not call the dictator, it leaves no doubt about his identity. The screen shows Ivory Coast Science and an address from the Daily Mill newspaper in England on April 12, 2011, which says, \"A challenging dictator has been arrested.\" That article detailed the overthrow of Laurent Gbagbo, who had ruled the Ivory Coast since 2000 and was now awaiting trial before the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. The West African nation faced a violent division during the Gbagbo era, and for years the Governor resisted international pressure to run for re-election. At the same time, Gillespie co-founded his lobby company in 2000 with Democratic Jack Quinn, former Chief of Staff of Vice President Al Gore. In November 10, 2004, Queen Gillespie and his partners signed a six-month contract, valued at $510,000, with Ivory Coast to improve the nation &apos; s relations with the United States. The company agreed, inter alia, to organize a visit to Washington for Gbagbo and to hold meetings with United States leaders. But you won't find Gilsby's signature on the contract. This was because he was absent from the company for almost two years when, according to Paul Logan, the spokesman for the Gillespie campaign, the contract was signed. Logan said Gillespie went on vacation in January 2003 to serve as Chairman of the National Republic Commission and did not return until March 2005. Quinn signed the contract and the subsequent federal disclosure to the company that it represented a foreign agent. The company began its work with Gbagbo on 22 December 2004 and ended on 30 June 2005, according to its disclosure to the United States Department of Justice. Jeffrey Conawton, then Vice-President of Queen Gillespie, told the New Yorker newspaper in 2012 that the company had hoped to prove that Gbagbo was ready to hold free and fair elections. Those hopes were on fire, and the article said, when Conaotun flew to Ivory Coast, he met with Gbagbo, and concluded that the leader \"has no interest in democracy -- he just wanted P.R.\" Konatun sent us a statement, which he also gave to the Washington Post, saying that Gilsby made it \"clear\" when the company started not to represent foreign governments. \"He was in the RNC when I decided to take the lead on the Ivory Coast, so if anyone had checked with me or with me, Gbagbo finally agreed to hold elections in November 2010, but lost to Alassane Ouattara, refused to give up power and started a civil war. Gbagbo was arrested in May when French and rebel forces took control of the capital, Abidjan. He was sent to The Hague, where the International Criminal Court accused him of four counts of being an indirect partner in the commission of acts of violence committed by his forces. Human Rights Watch estimates that at least 3,000 people were killed and 150 women raped during the six-month crisis. Kirk Cox stated on January 13, 2012, in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On January 20, 2012, the Warner Declaration also shows that four other countries report that Gilsby's company is represented. David Turner, Warner campaign spokesman, supported the allegation of sending us the detection forms of Quinn Gillespie. The company showed that it worked for it: Pakistan from April 2006 to April 2008 Costa Rica from a few weeks towards the end of 2006 Macedonia from April 2007 to April 2008 Republic of Bosnian Serbs from January 2007 to December 2007 and reported that it earned a total of $3 million from all five States. From the perspective, Quinn Gillespie received $52.3 million from local clients from 2006 to 2008, according to OpenSecrets.org. Payments from foreign countries amounted to 5.4 per cent of the company &apos; s revenue over the three years. Gillespie says he didn't press for a foreign government, and the records support him. The disclosure forms submitted by the company are not included in the list of its pressure team for any of the nations. The teams generally had democratic lobby groups, as evidenced by their contributions to their electoral campaign, which were part of the disclosures. Gillespie left the company in June 2007 to work in the administration of President George W. Bush. The company continued its relationship with Bosnia and Macedonia after its departure and signed new contracts with Japan and Indonesia. Our Governor, Warner, says, \"The confirmed pressure by Gilsby on five foreign governments, including a dictator now awaiting war crimes trial.\" The declaration - carefully drafted - has a pressured point by Gillespie for five foreign Governments, including Ivory Coast, whose former Governor Gbagbo is awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court. However, the efforts made by the Declaration to link Gillespie to a brutal dictator lack an important context. Gillespie was on leave from the company for more than a year when the Ivory Coast deal was signed. None of the company &apos; s federal disclosures indicated that Gillespie was involved in representing any foreign agents, and Gbagbo was charged with crimes against humanity because of events in 2010 and 2011, long after the company &apos; s relationship with Ivory Coast ended. While Warner's claim is accurate, it leaves vital details. We value it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07087"}
