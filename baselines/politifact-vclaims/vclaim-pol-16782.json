After multiple exterminators say they can\u2019t handle the problem, he decides to bring in \"one guy...who guarantees to get rid of them.\" The message suggests that although the man may have shortcomings, such as being an alcoholic, smelling bad or swearing, it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013\u2013 as long as he gets rid of the raccoons.\u00a0\n\"Here's why we want Trump: Yes, he's a bit of a jerk; Yes, he's an egomaniac; but we don't care!\" the analogy continues. \"The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republicans and Democrats can be two-faced and gutless, and illegals are everywhere.. We want it all fixed!\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
