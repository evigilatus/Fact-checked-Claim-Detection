(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe meme did not explicitly accuse Barr of forcing Smith\u2019s ouster, but it misleadingly implied\u00a0that his meeting with Murdoch played at least some role in the matter. Several other public figures, such as MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes and comedian Kathy Griffin, also speculated on Twitter about a link between the Barr-Murdoch meeting and Smith\u2019s exit.\nHmmmmm. Openly gay, honest journalist Shep Smith resigns the day after CORRUPT AG Barr meets w Rupert Murdoch. https://t.co/cOmqHbZHcg\u2014 Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) October 11, 2019 \nBut Chris Giglio, Smith\u2019s personal spokesperson, told the New York Times that \"there is absolutely no truth\" to the notion that the Barr-Murdoch meeting precipitated Smith\u2019s departure.\u00a0\n\"This was Shep\u2019s decision and his alone,\" Giglio told the New York Times. \"He\u2019s taking an extended period of time off to be with his family. Following that who knows \u2014 he is not retiring.\"\nCNN\u2019s Brian Stelter and Fox News\u2019s Howard Kurtz both swatted down the idea that Murdoch ushered Smith out at Barr\u2019s behest, as well.\nCNN reported that Smith asked Fox News management for a way out of his multi-year contract in September, well before Barr\u2019s meeting with Murdoch. Smith was reportedly frustrated by attacks the network\u2019s primetime opinion hosts were making against the news division.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of Fox\u2019s original hires in 1996, Smith was most recently the network\u2019s chief news anchor and managing editor of breaking news. He hosted \"Shepard Smith Reporting\" on weekday afternoons and frequently drew President Donald Trump\u2019s ire for his reporting.\n...Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!\u2014 Donald J.
