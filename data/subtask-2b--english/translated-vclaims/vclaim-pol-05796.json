Under Barack Obama and the large government economy, women &apos; s average wage fell $733, said Cruz during the Presidential Presidential debate in Boulder, Colo. We took a closer look at the income figures of working women and found that Cruz's claim had been cancelled. The census office calculates the statistics closest to those cited by Cruz - the average wage or salary of wage-earners. The Bureau divides these figures by gender and adjusts inflation figures to enable comparisons over time. In 2008, the last year before Obama took office, the average number of women was $28,574. By 2014, this amount had increased to US$ 29,098 adjusted for inflation. This represents an increase of $524 over six years - not a decrease of $733, as Cruz said. So Cruz is wrong to use the most obvious criteria. But he would have been on safer ground if he had said \"income\" instead of \"wages,\" as he intended, Phil Novak, Cruise's spokesman, assured Paulity Fuckett. The Census Bureau separately calculates the average income adjusted by sex. With this measure, the figure was $22,945 for women in 2008. By 2014, this number had decreased to $22,240 - a decrease of $705, close to what Cruz said. On January 18, 2021 in the Committee &apos; s discussion. \u2022 28 January 2021 The statistics on wages and salaries only include the total compensation paid by the employer to employees. In contrast, income statistics take a much larger mix of income flows, including commissions, bonuses, ex gratia payments, self-employment income, interest, profits, rental income and earnings, income from real estate and trust funds, social security and public assistance, child maintenance and maintenance, and unemployment and retirement benefits. Cruz specifically mentioned wages, making his statement less precise. Other wrinkles underestimate the importance of income statistics. Gary Portless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said that wage and salary statistics applied only to 72 million more women than women in paid employment. The income figure applies to every woman over 15 years of age - that is, more than 112 million in total. Since Cruz referred to wages - earned from work - he seems to be talking about the adverse economic trends of working women. In view of this, Bertellis said, \"I'm not sure why the average income figure is relevant.\" Many of the 112 million who received income of any kind were housewives or pensioners, and as the boom generation advanced among children, many women (and men) retired from jobs and began to receive social security or pensions that were not paid as much as their old jobs. This can be the source of income decline, even as wages rise for the smaller group of working women. Our judgment, Cruz, said that \"under Barack Obama and the big government economy, women's average wage dropped $733.\" This is wrong. In fact, wages for women have increased since Obama took office. Crose's spokesman said Cruz intended to use a different sentence. But in the Polyte Fact, we say important words. The statement is not accurate and we're miscalculating it.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05796"}
