It reappeared when John Carlival, a Republican candidate for the post of Foreign Minister, was interviewed on 10 August from the WPRI \"News Outcomes.\" Carlifal said that he supported the current - and controversial - voter identity law, which required voters to present an identity card for photographs. He claimed that the evidence justifying the need arose during the 2012 elections, the first elections in which the law was partially applicable. He said, \"These people who couldn't show the correct identity were given a temporary ballot,\" he said. And what did we learn from that? More than 60 per cent of the provisional votes cast in those elections were not eligible because these people were not duly registered as voters.\" (Temporary ballot papers may also be issued to voters if they appear at the wrong polling place or have not registered 30 days before the election.) These ballots shall be counted later if voter registration is confirmed.) We wondered whether 60 per cent of the persons who obtained a provisional ballot were not registered to vote. We texted Carlifal to request supporting evidence. In the meantime, we contacted the State Council for Elections, where Executive Director Robert Cando reported that 2,357 temporary ballots had been issued in 2012; 1,189 of them were ultimately disqualified because the person had not been registered. This means 50.4%, not 60%, as Carlival said. When he responded to us from Carlival, he stated that he had obtained slightly different figures from the Electoral Council: 2,231 temporary ballots with 1,188 (53.2%) were not counted because they were not eligible. Kando said Carlifal was given incorrect numbers. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" He said in an e-mail that he had misread his remarks, apologizing for the error. It turns out that the number can vary. In the 2010 non-presidential elections, where participation was much lower, there were 918 provisional State-wide ballots, of which only 197 - 21.5 per cent - were excluded because the person was not registered. This was before the implementation of the Electoral Identity Act. We also checked Providence's numbers. Kathy Placencia, Director of Elections for the Kanvassers Council, said that the city had issued 449 temporary ballots for the 2012 general elections, and 98 ballots had been rejected because the person had not been registered by the deadline. This is 21.8 percent. In 2010, the proportion was 38.3 per cent. The Secretary of State's candidate, Governor John Carlival, said, \"over 60 per cent of the provisional votes cast in the 2012 elections were unqualified because these people were not duly registered as voters.\" Data from the Rhode Island Electoral Council show that the actual total was 50.4 per cent. He's out of target, but close enough to earn a half right.
