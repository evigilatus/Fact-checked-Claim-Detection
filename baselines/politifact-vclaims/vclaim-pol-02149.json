That's a hoax", "text": "A website called Newsfeed USA is peddling fake news about former President Barack Obama, claiming he\u2019s planning \"a coup against his own government.\"\n\"Obama\u2019s Private \u2018security\u2019 Company Sets Up Massive Camps Outside 3 Major Cities,\" said the headline of an April 14 post on newsfeedusa.us.\n\"Barack Obama has decided to spend his retirement years planning a coup against his own government,\" the post said. \"In the past two weeks, after receiving an executive declaration issued by his own hand before Trump took office, Obama has built a $10 billion military that he calls a \u2018security company.\u2019 \"\nIt\u2019s unclear what the post meant by saying Obama received \"an executive declaration issued by his own hand before Trump took office.\" But the rest of the post doesn\u2019t add up, either.\nNewsfeedusa.us claims Obama\u2019s alleged company is called NOS United, with NOS standing for \"Novus Ordo Seclorum,\" or New World Order. (Novus Ordo Seclorum is inscribed in the $1 bill. The U.S. State Department translates the Latin text to \"A new order of the ages.\")\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along,\" the post claimed, adding that along with two islands due east of Virginia in international waters, there also are \"massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles.\"\nThe post also claims Obama is holding \"secret meetings\" with bipartisan officials and diplomats from around the world \"in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system.\"\nThat part of the story reminded us of another hoax claiming Obama was trying to take down President Donald Trump by establishing a shadow government outside the White House. That Pants on Fire claim also said Obama held secret meetings with world leaders.\nWe reached out to Newsfeed USA\u2019s Facebook account for evidence backing its claim. A reply said \"Google.\" But there\u2019s no credible information backing Newsfeed USA\u2019s story. If there was any merit to the claim, it would have been in national and international headlines of legitimate news sources.\nNewsfeed USA\u2019s post is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
