An image making the rounds on social media tries to disprove that point by showing a drunk Kavanaugh passed out from too much drinking.\nBut the photo does not show Kavanaugh.\n\"Never been passed/black out drunk, huh.... #kavanaugh,\" the caption on a Facebook image reads. The photo on the left shows a young man holding two beer bottles apparently passed out on a couch, with the year 1982 beneath it. The photo on the right shows Kavanaugh now, with 2018 written below it.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe photo on the left is not actually Kavanaugh in 1982.
