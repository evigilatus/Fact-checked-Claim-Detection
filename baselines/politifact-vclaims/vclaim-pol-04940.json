She's pro-Clinton", "text": "Republicans are hoping to tie the increasingly fraught battle between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination to down-ballot Democrats.\nThat\u2019s the case in Nevada, where the\u00a0National\u00a0Republican Congressional Committee is running automated telephone calls telling voters that Democratic candidate Jacky Rosen hasn\u2019t committed to supporting either Sanders or Clinton.\n\"Jacky Rosen has refused to tell us whether she supports Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton,\" the recorded call says.\nSo has Rosen, a synagogue leader who was recruited by Sen. Harry Reid to run for the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, refused to weigh in on the presidential race?\nIn a word \u2014 no.\nRosen, who announced her candidacy in January, told Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston on May 12 that she caucused for Clinton back in February.\n\"I caucused for Hillary, and it looks like she\u2019s going to be the nominee, and I\u2019m proud to stand on the ticket with her,\" she told Ralston. (This comment starts at 20:30.)\nNRCC spokesman Zach Hunter said in an email that there was a difference between caucusing and endorsing, and that Rosen has generally been dodgy on the issue.\n\"In 2016 when you have such a divide in the Democratic party as it barrels towards a contested convention, the difference is significant,\" he said in an email.\nIt\u2019s true that Rosen has done few media interviews since announcing her candidacy, but it doesn\u2019t appear that she\u2019s really been asked about who she\u2019s endorsed for president.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticles in the Laughlin Nevada Times and Las Vegas Sun don\u2019t mention a presidential endorsement from Rosen.\nAssociated Press political reporter Michelle Rindels interviewed Rosen on April 27 for an upcoming story and confirmed that the candidate openly supported Clinton.\nIt is curious as to why Rosen didn\u2019t speak up about her presidential preference before Nevada\u2019s presidential caucus in February, despite announcing her candidacy back in January.\nThe Clinton campaign in the state didn\u2019t appear to tout her endorsement, and she doesn\u2019t appear on a campaign list of \"100 Nevada women for Hillary\" from November 2015.\nBut her endorsement of Clinton on Ralston Live was straightforward.\n\"She spent eight years in the White House, she was a senator, she\u2019s traveled all around the world talking to world leaders,\" she said. \"And she\u2019s a mom and a grandma and I really think she has a lifelong experience in doing this, having a calm, cool, collected head, being analytical and those are the kind of things that are important to me.\"\nOur ruling\nThe NRCC says Democrat Jacky Rosen \"has refused to tell us whether she supports Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton.\"\nPolitiFact was unable to find an instance where Rosen refused to answer questions about her presidential preference.
