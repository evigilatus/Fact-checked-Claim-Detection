Violence will not bring change, it will only bring destruction.\"\nBut some conservatives continue to criticize Biden for not specifically denouncing antifa, a movement of far-left, anti-fascists cited for using violent tactics, as a domestic terrorist organization.\nNow, a post on Facebook points out that typing in antifa.com automatically redirects internet users to joebiden.com, Biden\u2019s official presidential campaign website.\n\"If you go to Antifa.com, it takes you directly to joe bidens webpage....whats that tell ya...try it yourself,\" the post says.\nThis is actually true, but it doesn\u2019t tell you anything. Anyone can buy a domain name and have it redirect to any existing website.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Kamala Harris was announced as Biden\u2019s running mate. The site was removed about a day later, but has since resurfaced.\nClifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California\u2019s Center for Computer Systems Security, says there are a couple of ways to redirect a website, but that in this instance, when a browser connects to antifa.com, it receives a response from the antifa.com server that tells it to go to joebiden.com instead, prompting the user\u2019s browser to establish a new connection.\n\"Basically the way things work with domain names is, if you own a domain name, whether you\u2019re the original purchaser or you purchased it from someone else, you can redirect your domain name to anywhere you wanted it to go,\" Neuman said, \"and that doesn\u2019t require permission or any or coordination from the person you are trying to redirect to.\"\nNeuman found that the antifa.com domain was first registered in 2000, and was most recently transferred to a new host in April 2020, though information on the new owner is hidden.\nAccording to Whois, an online domain registry, antifa.com was last updated on Aug. 14, 2020. The registrant is listed as \"WhoisGuard Protected,\" meaning the domain owner is using a service to remain anonymous.\u00a0\nThe first time web archives show antifa.com displaying content sympathetic to the antifa movement was\u00a0 May 31, 2020. But this is just a snapshot of the website from that day, and doesn\u2019t mean it was created that day.\nOn July 24, the page included a notice that said a new, updated website was coming soon. And, on Aug. 8, we find the first archived version that redirected visitors to joebiden.com.\u00a0\nJoe Biden has been the target of deceptive website practices before.\nIn 2019, a Republican consulting firm created joebiden.info, a mock website that displayed images and videos of Biden appearing to touch and kiss young women and girls, fact-checking website Snopes reported. The firm also made fake websites about other Democratic primary candidates including Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.\u00a0\nIn 2019, state party chairs of the Democratic National Committee backed a pledge to rule out the use of illegitimate tactics like manipulated videos, fake social media accounts or websites, but party leaders did not bring the proposal to a vote.\u00a0\nThe post is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
