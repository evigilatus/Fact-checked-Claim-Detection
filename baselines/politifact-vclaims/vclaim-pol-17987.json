Newsom has the authority to make masks mandatory In California, legal experts say", "text": "Following Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s announcement last week that all Californians must wear face coverings in certain public settings, some local government officials and viral social media posts alleged the governor has no legal authority to make masks mandatory.\u00a0\nOne Facebook post viewed more than 80,000 times on the day of Newsom\u2019s order claimed the governor hadn\u2019t really made such a requirement and has no power to do so.\u00a0\n\u203c\ufe0fGREAT NEWS!\u203c\ufe0f Contrary to the LA Times story, Newsom did NOT issue any mandatory mask orders in CA! (He has no legal authority to do so.) This was new GUIDANCE (not a public health order) from the CA State Dept of Health, and it is a RELAXATION of the previous orders!!!\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California\u2019s partnership with Facebook).\nThe claim was made by a woman in Orange County who heads a group that also claims healthy people should not wear masks. PolitiFact in May found there\u2019s no evidence that wearing standard masks, such as surgical masks or ones made of fabric, is harmful to the general public.\u00a0\nIn Northern California, Nevada City Mayor Reinette Senum claimed on Facebook \"Our Governor does NOT have that unilateral power to make such orders.\" She linked to a YouTube video of the Orange County woman.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile the act of wearing a mask, or choosing not to, has become politicized nationwide, leading public health officials and recent studies say wearing a face covering is an effective measure for reducing the spread of COVID-19 when people gather.\u00a0\nNewsom\u2019s requirement is lauded by some and seen as an intrusion by others. For this fact check, we wanted to know whether it rests on solid legal footing.\u00a0\nWhat Does Newsom\u2019s Face Covering Requirement Say?\nThe governor announced new rules through a California Department of Public Health press release on June 18. \"Simply put, we are seeing too many people with faces uncovered \u2013 putting at risk the real progress we have made in fighting the disease,\" Newsom said in the release.\nThere\u2019s been some confusion about whether the announcement makes wearing a mask mandatory because the new CDPH requirements are technically termed \"guidance.\"\u00a0\nBut as the Sacramento Bee explained, a previous executive order issued by Newsom that required Californians to follow public health guidelines grants the state the ability to enforce CDPH rules.\nThe governor's office also made the announcement on social media:\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s mandatory under the new rules:\u00a0\nPeople in California must wear face coverings when they are in the \"high-risk situations,\" including:\u00a0\n\n\nInside of, or in line to enter, any indoor public space\u00a0\n\n\nVisiting a hospital, pharmacy, medical clinic, laboratory, physician or dental office, veterinary clinic, or blood bank\u00a0\n\n\nWaiting for or riding on public transportation or paratransit or while in a taxi, private car service, or ride-sharing vehicle\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome law enforcement agencies across the state have said they will not enforce the mandate, but will encourage residents to voluntarily comply with it.\u00a0\nIs The Requirement Legal?\u00a0\nWe asked both the Newsom administration and two constitutional law experts about this issue.\u00a0\nA spokesperson for the administration cited the California Emergency Services Act as giving the governor the power to make masks mandatory. Through that law, \"the State Legislature has given the Governor broad authority to respond to state emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Kate Folmar, a spokesperson for the state\u2019s Health and Human Services Agency, said in an email.\nLeslie Jacobs, who teaches constitutional law at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, agreed that the act along with the state\u2019s broad public health authority gives Newsom extensive power to address the pandemic, including requiring face coverings. It\u2019s the same law he used to justify his statewide stay-at-home order in March.\u00a0\n\"That\u2019s the authority under which the governor declared an emergency on March 4,\" Jacobs said. \"That transfers all the authority of the state to the governor, to the extent necessary, to address the COVID emergency.\"\nJessica Levinson, who teaches at Loyola Law School, also said Newsom has the legal authority to require face coverings.\n\"Short answer \u2013 He does. Medium answer \u2013 He sure does. Longer answer \u2013 He sure as hell does,\" she wrote in an email.\u00a0\nLevinson added in a phone interview that the state has \"broad authority when it comes to health and welfare measures.\"\u00a0\nBoth law professors said they believe Newsom\u2019s order would stand up to a legal challenge, unless new and credible studies show face coverings are not effective.\n\"Based on what we know now, I believe this would stand up,\" Levinson added.\u00a0\nThe professors said Newsom\u2019s position would be strengthened should the Legislature pass a bill requiring face-coverings. But, they said, because Newsom\u2019s requirement is so closely tied to an immediate public health issue, that action is probably unnecessary.\u00a0\nJacobs added that the governor\u2019s powers during the pandemic are far-reaching. Under his authority, he could go even further to mandate things like temperature checks at sporting events or require face shields in some settings.\u00a0\nShould the mask order or any future measures be challenged in court, she said Newsom would have to show that the state truly needs to require them and that they can only be done in the way prescribed by the state.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nSome local government leaders and widely-shared facebook posts claim Gov. Gavin Newsom doesn\u2019t have the legal authority to make face coverings mandatory in California.\u00a0\nTo justify the move, the Newsom administration pointed to the California Emergency Services Act, the same authority it used to order a statewide stay-at-home requirement in March due to the COVID-19 crisis.\u00a0\nTwo constitutional law experts said Newsom, indeed, has broad powers under that law and under the state\u2019s public health authority to make masks mandatory.\u00a0\nUnless face coverings are shown to be ineffective, they said Newsom\u2019s requirement should also hold up against legal challenges.\nWe rate the claim the governor doesn\u2019t have the power to make masks mandatory as False.\u00a0\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17987"}
