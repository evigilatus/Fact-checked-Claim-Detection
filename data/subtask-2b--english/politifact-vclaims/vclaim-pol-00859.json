Andrew Cuomo speaks often about his administration\u2019s efforts to revitalize Buffalo.\u00a0His recent stop on Buffalo\u2019s East Side was no exception.\n\"Every\u00a0number is up. Every arrow is pointed in the right direction,\" Cuomo said. \"It is undeniable. Unemployment is down, jobs are up. Young people coming back. Twenty percent increase in young people coming back to Buffalo after a decade where we lost 10 percent of our young people. So a new energy. Jobs, businesses, growth. \u2026 Buffalo is a national urban recovery story.\"\nThat's a lot to unpack, and we chose to look at the part about the young people. Is he right? Has there been a 20 percent increase in young people coming back to Buffalo?\nA look at the data\nCuomo relied on the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey for population estimates for people ages 25 to 34. The governor\u2019s spokeswoman\u00a0pointed to Erie County data from 2010, the year Cuomo was elected, through 2017. The estimated number of people in that age group in Erie County grew by 21 percent. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of people in that age group fell by 8.6 percent, according to the data.\nCuomo said Buffalo, but he used data for Erie County.\nBuffalo is in Erie County, but separate population statistics are available for Buffalo.\nAnalysis of Census Bureau data for Buffalo shows an even greater increase. The 25-34 age group increased from 38,051 in 2010 to 49,207 in 2017, a 29 percent increase, according to the U.S. Census and American Community Survey.\nWe reached out to William Frey, a senior fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, which employs experts of different perspectives. Frey has studied the movements of different population groups, including millennials. Frey said \"some of this gain\" is because the large millennial generation that lived in Buffalo aged into this cohort, not because people returned to the area from elsewhere. \u00a0\nErie and Niagara counties, according to a\u00a0January study\u00a0by the Brookings Institution, reported a negative net domestic migration of those 25 to 34 years old between 2012 and 2017. It is possible\u00a0that Buffalo attracted some young adult migrants from the rest of the Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls metro area, or had gains from immigration from other countries, said Frey, the study's author.\nLooking strictly at data for Buffalo, we wanted to see if the 29 percent growth\u00a0in young people was mainly from people who had aged in place.\u00a0The age range we're looking at, 25 to 34, would have been ages 18 to 27 in 2010. The 2010 Census breaks out the popularion by age each year. The population of 18-\u00a0to 27-year-olds in 2010 was 49,734. The population of 25- to 34-year-olds in 2017 was 49,207.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Schmitt\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a news conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jill Terreri Ramos \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data suggest\u00a0\"there is quite a bit of aging in place,\" Frey said. But some of those numbers could reflect domestic out migration countered by a similar immigration from abroad, he said.\u00a0Showing similar numbers for this cohort\u00a0does suggest that not many people left, he said.\nE.J. McMahon, research director of the conservative Empire Center think tank, also said that while the population of young people increased, it\u2019s unclear how many of those people came back to Buffalo. Some of the gains could be because people stayed, or they could be from refugee resettlement programs, McMahon said.\nMcMahon, who has tracked New York's population shifts and is a frequent Cuomo critic, said that every community has some people who leave and some who stay, and that is \"clearly\" what happened in Buffalo.\n\"On a net basis, Buffalo is doing better with this population segment than it has in the past,\" he said.\u00a0\"From this, the governor and others weave a story of millennials flocking back to redeveloped inner cities, because they are different from previous generations and don\u2019t live in suburbs. \u00a0That\u2019s grossly overstated, in my view.\"\nOur ruling\nCuomo said there has been a 20 percent increase in young people \"coming back\" to Buffalo after a decade when their numbers fell by 10 percent.\nCensus figures show a 29 percent increase in people ages 25 to 34. In the previous 10 years, the size of that age group fell by 10\u00a0percent.\nIf the governor had just said their numbers grew, he would have been generally correct. He actually understated Buffalo's increase.\nBut he said they were \"coming back.\" The data he relied on does not prove they came back. In fact, one expert called the claim they were coming to be \"grossly overstated.\" While the number of younger people living in Buffalo increased, the cause could be a large millennial population aging into this age group, not solely because people are returning.\nSo his statement is partially accurate but makes a sweeping, unproven conclusion.\u00a0It is unclear how many young people have returned to Buffalo, or settled there after living elsewhere.\u00a0\nWe rate Cuomo\u2019s statement Half True.\n Share the Facts 2019-03-25 13:53:18 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  There\u2019s been a \"20 percent increase in young people coming back to Buffalo after a decade where we lost 10 percent of our young people.\"     Andrew Cuomo Governor of New York https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-photos-rush-transcript-governor-cuomo-announces-50-million-east-side-corridor   in a speech Tuesday, March 12, 2019 2019-03-12    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00859"}
