A month prior, the NCAA wrapped up its years-long investigation by saying that it \"could not conclude academic violations\" in the case and wouldn\u2019t punish UNC in the bogus classes scandal.\nHowever, the leader of the NCAA Committee on Infractions said student-athletes \"likely benefited from the so-called paper courses\" and that it was \"more likely than not\" that UNC athletes received fraudulent credit in association with the courses at the heart of the case. The committee leader also said it was \"more likely than not\" that members of the UNC athletic department steered athletes to those courses in an effort to maintain their eligibility.\nBoard member Tom Fetzer called a million-dollar pay increase \"ludicrous\" and said he was embarrassed by the vote because of the NCAA\u2019s comments on classes that benefitted athletes.\nHaywood Cochrane, chairman of UNC-Chapel Hill\u2019s Board of Trustees, defended the move by saying Cunningham\u2019s old $705,853 base salary left him underpaid compared to other athletic directors at large universities.\n\"This was a reflection of the market, but he\u2019s not at market,\" Cochrane said. \"He\u2019s not even close.\"\nIs that true? Is the going rate for an athletic director in one of the major athletic conferences more than $705,000 a year?\nPolitiFact reached out to members of the Board of Trustees to ask what they consider to be the market rate for athletic directors like Cunningham.\n\nCochrane responded by email, but didn\u2019t elaborate on his position.\n\"Bubba has done an exceptional job!\" he wrote. \"We do look at comps as part of our overall assessment and your research will, I believe, answer your question for you.\"\nAnother trustee, Dwight Stone, responded similarly.\n\"Why not do a little work and look up the top 25 Athletic Director compensations in the country and you can learn a lot,\" Stone said, adding: \"There is this thing called Google and you can really find most anything.\"\nWell, Mr. Stone, the burden of proof in our fact-checking process falls on the person who made the claim. But we went to the interwebs and fired up that Google machine nonetheless.\nHere\u2019s what we found.\nAD pay\nPolitiFact struggled to find a reliable, comprehensive list of salaries for athletic directors across the nation. However, we found data that offers a glimpse of it.\nThe College and University Professional Association for Human Resources, known as CUPA-HR, gathers information on salaries in the academic field. Jacqueline Bichsel, the group\u2019s director of research, provided us with a breakdown of median salaries for Chief Athletics Administrators during the 2016-2017 school year.\nThe group\u2019s findings aren\u2019t comprehensive \u2013 there are a few schools that didn\u2019t provide it with data \u2013 but most did. The median salary for athletics administrators at ACC schools is $549,215. These figures don\u2019t take into account bonuses that ADs might receive if their schools achieve a certain level of academic and/or athletic success.\nThe ACC median ranks lower than the median for each of the other \"power five\" conferences, which include the SEC, Big Ten, Big 12 and PAC 12.\nThe median salaries for the conferences are as follows:\n\nBig Ten: $731,808\nBig 12: $689,325\nPAC 12: $655,000\nSEC: $706,000\n\nN.C. State University is the most comparable school in the state. The base salary for Debbie Yow, N.C. State\u2019s AD, is $690,000, according to Fred Demarest, the school\u2019s senior associate athletics director.\nSo Cunningham\u2019s base salary was higher than the median of schools in the ACC, Big 12 and Pac 12, roughly the same as ADs in the SEC and lower than the median salary for Big Ten ADs.\nBut some athletic directors are paid more because of their level of experience, the difficulty of the job or the reputation of the school\u2019s programs. This is where experts said Cunningham\u2019s situation is unique.\nBubba\u2019s tenure\nUNC hired Cunningham in 2011. He previously worked six years as the AD for the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma.\nThere, GoHeels.com says Cunningham \"guided the Golden Hurricane through its initial move to Conference USA and spearheaded a $60 million athletics initiative. Tulsa won 34 league championships during his tenure, more than any other school in Conference USA, and the football program played in five bowl games in his final six years. He was honored as the 2008-09 FBS Central Region Athletics Director of the Year, an award presented by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics.\"\nSince arriving at UNC, the Tar Heels have won nine national titles and made an additional 10 runner-up finishes.\n2011: Men\u2019s soccer.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHank Aaron\u2019s death was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2012: Women\u2019s soccer.\n2013: Women\u2019s tennis and women\u2019s lacrosse.\n2015: Women\u2019s tennis.\n2016: Men\u2019s tennis, as well as men\u2019s and women\u2019s lacrosse.\n2017: Men\u2019s basketball.\nBubba\u2019s hires\nNone of those championships were won by coaches that Cunningham hired. Cunningham has hired four coaches during his tenure: men\u2019s golf coach Andrew DiBitetto last July; wrestling coach Coleman Scott in 2015; track and field/cross country coach Harlis Meaders in 2012; and football coach Larry Fedora in 2011.\nWith the exception of newcomer DiBitetto, who has yet to coach a full golf season, Cunningham\u2019s hires have fared well. Given the amount of money it generates, the football team\u2019s performance is likely the most important to Cunningham\u2019s job security. So we\u2019ll turn our attention there.\nThe football team won three games and lost nine last year. But Fedora has an overall win percentage of .558. That\u2019s slightly higher than his predecessor Butch Davis, who recorded a .549 win percentage (although some of those wins were retroactively voided by the NCAA).\nFedora in 2015 took UNC to its first 11-win season since 1997. He was a Bear Bryant National Coach of the Year finalist in 2015 and was named National Coach of the Year by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Last summer, Cunningham signed Fedora to a contract extension through the 2022 season.\nOther accomplishments\nThe university notes that, under Cunningham\u2019s leadership, UNC launched an NCAA compliance review to be conducted by an outside firm and a master plan for UNC\u2019s athletic facilities.\nUNC says \"a transformative array of athletics facilities projects -- including a new football practice facility, lacrosse/soccer stadium, field hockey stadium and track and field complex \u2013 are also underway and will be completed by the fall of 2018.\"\nCunningham\u2019s work has led him to prominent positions. He currently serves as president of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics and sits on the board of LEAD1, an association representing the ADs from the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision schools.\nCunningham is also on the verge of signing UNC to a new athletic apparel deal with Nike. UNC\u2019s current deal with Nike, and its Jordan Brand subsidiary, expires in June and is worth about $36.85 million in uniforms, footwear, apparel and cash considerations.\nNike\u2019s recent deals with Texas and Ohio State are worth more than $250 million over the next 15 years. UNC\u2019s contract \"will be a very good deal but not a blockbuster,\" like those schools\u2019 deals, Cunningham said.\nWhat experts say\nTo some degree, people (like houses) are worth what someone is willing to pay them.\nIn that vein, UNC Chancellor Carol Folt said Cunningham is highly sought after. She said at that November trustees meeting that Cunningham had turned down a lucrative offer from the University of Florida because he wanted to stay at UNC.\n\"He has done some extraordinary things for which he is quite well-known nationally,\" she said. \"He\u2019s viewed as probably one of the top five athletic directors in the country right now \u2026 So he\u2019s on every short list.\"\nJay Bilas, an ESPN basketball analyst and attorney, said he considers a \"middle of the pack\" annual salary for elite athletic directors to be about $750,000. He thinks Cunningham\u2019s new contract is \"a great deal\" for UNC.\n\"He is among the very best in his field. Thoughtful, smart, forward thinking, and he did a tremendous job shepherding UNC through the NCAA infractions process,\" Bilas said. \"As you know, he was not at UNC during the period at issue, but was at the helm throughout the entire adjudication of the matter. I couldn\u2019t respect an AD more.\"\nTom McMillen, president and CEO of Lead1, said people should compare Cunningham with ADs at other elite schools.\n\"UNC\u2019s compensation is on the high end of the ACC but not the high end of college sports,\" McMillen said. \"I think that [what Cochrane said] is an accurate statement.\"\nComparables\nRoger Denny is a partner at Spencer Fane, a St. Louis-based firm that specializes in researching salaries of athletic directors and coaches. Denny\u2019s firm published its own set of AD salary data last July.\nHe noted that ADs at other big schools are being paid substantially more than Cunningham. He offered a handful of relevant comparisons from a recent survey:\nJim Sterk, Missouri: $850,000\nDan Guerrero, UCLA: more than $1 million\nSheahon Zenger, Kansas: base salary of $700,000.\nDan Radakovich, Clemson: $875,000.\n\"Bubba led them through perhaps the most complex NCAA case there\u2019s ever been,\" Denny said. \"Just keeping the ship moving forward during that firestorm of issues is an accomplishment in and of itself.\"\nDenny noted UNC\u2019s progress on its athletics facilities master plan. The new football practice facility is long overdue and \"probably a lot of the reason Larry Fedora is still there,\" he said. Building new facilities for non-revenue sports \"is quite impressive.\"\n\"I think he\u2019s distinguished himself to a point that he should be considered among the top quarter of athletic directors,\" Denny said. \"So then, within the Power Five, that suggests that a salary even more than he received would be easily supportable.\"\nOur ruling\nCochrane, the chairman of UNC-Chapel Hill\u2019s Board of Trustees, said Cunningham\u2019s old $705,853 base salary was \"not at market \u2026 not even close.\" It\u2019s a stretch to say that Cunningham\u2019s salary was \"not even close\" to what the market rate is for someone with his experience. However, experts agree that compared to his peers, Cunningham was well underpaid for his work at a university that\u2019s achieved so much success despite facing adversity.
