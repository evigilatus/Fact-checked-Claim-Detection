Gwen Moore tweaked new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with this tweet:\n\"McConnell credits @GOP for recent econ improvements despite just gaining Senate control days ago. #RevisionistHistory\"\nSounds pretty silly. An economic recovery occurring just because Republicans took over the Senate days earlier?\nSo, did the Kentucky Republican really say what the Milwaukee Democrat said he did?\nJust about.\nMcConnell\u2019s claim\nMoore reacted to comments McConnell made two days earlier on the Senate floor, after he took over as majority leader:\n\"After so many years of sluggish growth, we\u2019re finally starting to see some economic data that can provide a glimmer of hope. The uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama administration\u2019s long tenure in Washington: the expectation of a new Republican Congress.\"\nSo, McConnell was saying a recent economic uptick appears to \"coincide\" with \"the expectation of a new Republican Congress.\"\nPolitiFact National rated that McConnell claim False, even leaving aside the question of whether McConnell was crediting the GOP for the uptick.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.

That\u2019s when a consensus emerged expecting that Republicans would win enough seats in the November 2014 elections to win a majority in the Senate.\nMoore\u2019s claim\nMoore\u2019s characterization of McConnell\u2019s remark went a bit further.\nShe said McConnell was crediting the GOP for a recovery because it had taken control of the Senate \"days ago.\"\nBut that expectation would have been in place a couple of months earlier, following the elections -- or perhaps a couple of months before that, as it became clear the GOP would win back the Senate.\nOur rating\nMoore said McConnell credits Republicans \"for recent economic improvements\" even though they took control of the Senate only \"days ago.\"\nMcConnell did say the recovery coincided with the expectation of the GOP taking over the Senate. But that expectation was months earlier, not days.\nWe rate Moore\u2019s statement Mostly True.\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's web page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06847"}
