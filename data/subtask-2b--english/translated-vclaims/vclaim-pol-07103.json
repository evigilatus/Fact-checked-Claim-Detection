This means that we can invest in our priorities.\" This first figure is indisputable and widely reported: the mandate ended from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 in black at $517 million. But Burke challenged Walker's second character. There was a shortfall of $1.8 billion for the 2015-17 budget, not a \"surplus of more than half a billion dollars.\" That's a big difference. To determine whether Walker was right about the projected surplus of $535 million, we turned to the reports issued by the non-partisan budget officer, the Legislative Tax Office. But first, we want to be quite clear about what is being discussed here. This is not a forecast of how the second year of the 2013-15 budget ends. Even Walker is talking about projections of where State funds will be at a time when the next Governor and Legislature will jointly draw up the 2015-17 budget in early 2015. This is usually referred to as \"structural deficit.\" The name is unfortunate. The figure does not reflect \"deficit\" or - if Walker is right - \"surplus\" at the end of the budget year. It is a record of previous decisions - whether in spending or tax collection - for which officials will have to be held accountable in the next two years &apos; budget. As such, it is a criterion for the magnitude of the budget challenge. This process is carried out periodically by the Tax Office, mostly during the budget season. The long-standing method of UNOPS is not to incur any loss of income, gain income or make any changes to expenditure. The application of the same approach provides a consistent picture over time. The latest OIOS estimate was issued on September 8, 2014. In summary, a deficit of $1.76 billion is directed towards the 2015-17 budget. Among the main reasons for the gap are the tax cuts approved by Walker and the Republican-led legislature, which contributed to the slowdown in revenues. So what does Walker refer to as his surplus of $535 million? Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" This figure is contained in the Office &apos; s financial memorandum issued on 18 September 2014 to the representative of the State of the Republic, John Nigren of Marint. Following the estimate of $1.8 billion, Nigren asked UNOPS to look at it differently. He asked for an estimate of the budget challenge on the assumption that legislators would maintain most of the expenditure at 2014-15 levels for the following two years, and that tax revenues would rise at the five-year average of 2.9 per cent. This resulted in a surplus of $535 million. The financial office also received a request from a Democrat named Jennifer Shelling from La Cruz. I have asked the Finance Office to make an estimate based on increases in school spending and to grant government agencies a $1 billion request for expenditure and other changes. Budget requests received on 15 September 2014. This estimate represented a deficit of $2.7 billion. Another Shilling scenario was a $4 billion deficit. I get the idea. Only weeks after the 4 November 2014 elections, both parties found ways to manipulate the Office &apos; s $1.8 billion financial estimates using scenarios ranging from freezing spending to giving agencies everything on their lists of wishes. We don't believe it. Walker's own budgets refer to the number of \"structural deficits\" using the method used by the tax office to obtain $1.8 billion. Legislators in both parties have done the same for years. In fact, Walker used his \"structural deficit\" estimates to his advantage in the past and even made him the focus of his re-election campaign. Every time you hear the governor say he inherited $3.6 billion in deficit from Goof. Jim Doyle, a reflection of the $2.5 billion \"structural deficit\" that the Finance Office estimated in 2011 when Walker prepared its first budget. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... The Walker campaign argues that the Bureau &apos; s financial note is based on some outdated figures and that the assumption of zero growth is unrealistic. However, the Governor seeks them in both directions, filming the Bureau &apos; s method when it fits and rejects it when it does not. The figures will change again when the Finance Office completes its report in early 2015. Our assessment and the discussant Walker told us: \"The next state budget will start with a surplus of more than half a billion dollars -- exactly $535 million.\" This pink number flies in the face of official discretion, which uses a fixed method used by members of both parties, and the Governor's Budget Office. We're assessing the allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07103"}
