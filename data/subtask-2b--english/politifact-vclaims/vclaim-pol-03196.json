There is no date provided for the decision, and we could not find any legislation relating to such news.\nThis is because Jamaica is its own country, declaring its independence from the United Kingdom and creating its own constitution in 1962. The United States then established diplomatic relations with the country and has maintained them to this day.\nTrump met with Jamaican Ambassador to the United States Audrey Marks in early April, when they discussed bilateral trade, but they made no mention of Jamaica becoming a U.S. territory.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story seems to prey on common geographical ignorance; we couldn\u2019t help noticing during our research that a frequently googled question is whether Jamaica is located in the United States. The fourth-largest island in the Caribbean is in fact located about 90 miles south of Cuba. The country does not require visas for visits under six months, but it does require passports from U.S. citizens and permanent residents.\nThe rumor dates back to February of this year, when Mediamaxzone.com reported falsely that the Jamaican prime minister had hinted Jamaica would become a U.S. territory. While it has been circulating for a while, it\u2019s time we shed light on this hoax.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-06-19 21:08:19 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Trump welcomes Jamaica as a U.S. territory    Bloggers CNewsGo.com   in a blog post Friday, June 16, 2017 2017-06-16    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03196"}
