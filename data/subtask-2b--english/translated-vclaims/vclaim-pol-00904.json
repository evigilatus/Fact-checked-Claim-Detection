Scott is the chairman of the committee. Polyte Fact has heard many formulas for comparing wages by 80 per cent and has found that statistics are often misused. Let's take a closer look at Scott's statement. :: Stephanie Lall, Deputy Director of Communications Scott, told us that Congressman Scott had obtained statistics from separate reports published in late 2018 by the Women &apos; s Policy Research Institute and the National Partnership for Women and the Family. Both reports say statistics come from the U.S. Census Bureau. The most recent gender statistics provided by the Office in 2017 show that women received 80.5 per cent of what men achieved - the same percentage as in 2016. In 2017, the average income of full-time men throughout the year was $52,146, compared with $41,977 for women. However, there is a gain: statistics are comprehensive comparisons of all jobs combined and are not specifically comparable between men and women performing the same jobs. Many people, citing statistics, use them wrongly as a comparison between apples and apples for equal work. But what Scott said is very accurate. He states that women receive 80% of the wage for \"similar\" work like white men, which is different from saying \"the same\" work like men. The Office of Labour Statistics provides data on similar jobs and compares the average weekly income of full-time men and women in 121 occupations. Overall, it has been found that women earn 81.8 per cent of what men have achieved - slightly more than census estimates. The wages of women to men ranged from 59 per cent for personal financial advisers to 108 per cent for the dining room, cafeteria maids and waitress assistants. Comparisons between women and men for some other occupations are as follows:: fast food servers, 97 per cent; programmers, 89 per cent; secondary school teachers, 89 per cent; Janitors, 84 per cent; and installation and repair, 83 per cent. \u2022 Lawyers, 83 per cent; Women who have been overpaid in three occupations are: wholesale and retail; front-line construction and metallurgy workers; and, as we have stated, in the dining room, cafeteria maids and bartender assistants. However, verification of the facts requires deeper diving. The percentages we have just discussed compare the full-time weekly income of all women with all men in these occupations. In his statement, Scott compares the earnings of all white women and men in similar jobs. The Institute &apos; s data collection, which compares pay by gender with specific jobs, does not classify men and women by race. However, in 22 broad fields of work, jobs are classified, and in each of these fields women and men are classified by gender. In 2018, in general, women earned 78.7 per cent of white men in the same fields of work. The comparison of women &apos; s wages with white men results in a gender gap greater than that of all men. That's because white males earn more than black males. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On 20 January 2021, white men received women in all 22 fields of employment. Is this all discrimination? In his remarks Scott has repeatedly linked this disparity to gender discrimination. The bill that he passed states that \"Many women still earn far less than men for equal work,\" and states, \"In many cases, wage differentials can only be attributed to the persistence of deliberate discrimination or the residual effects of discrimination in the past.\" The bill would expand the requirements for wage disclosure for employers and add protection to employees who investigate gender pay in their workplace or claim gender pay bias. However, as previously written by Politifact, many researchers have concluded that the causes of gender wage inequality far exceed discrimination. \"The most important source of the gender pay gap is that women bear greater responsibility for raising children than men,\" John O'Neill, an economist at the College of Paroch, wrote in a 2010 Wall Street Journal article. \"This affects the continuity of women's work, affecting their skills and thus their wages. In addition, women often seek to create flexible work schedules, a less stressful work environment and other conditions compatible with meeting the requirements of family responsibilities. That comes at a price - any lower wages.\" An analysis carried out in 2009 by CONSAD in Pittsburgh also concluded that the wage gap was not merely the result of sexual bias. The Board found that three quarters of this disparity can be explained by other trends common to women: they tend to choose professions with relatively low wages; they tend to lead to lower-paid occupations than men; and they tend to have shorter working dates and take longer leave than work for childbirth and childcare. In considering these factors, the Centre stated that the wage gap had been reduced to between 4 and 7 per cent, which could be the result of discrimination. A study conducted by the American Association of University Women in 2013 attempted to correct the impact of child-rearing on women &apos; s wages. There was a pay gap between men and women of 7 per cent after a year of college graduation. Our Governor Scott said, \"Women earn an average of 80 cents on the dollar compared to white men doing similar work.\" Statistics on equal employment opportunities support Scott, which shows that the average wage of white men in 2018 was higher than that of all women in each of the 22 areas of employment included in the data collection. But we object to Scott's context. It presents wage inequality as a result of discrimination. However, gender pay is a complex subject and there are many reasons - in addition to discrimination - for a gap: women tend to work less hours than men; they tend to choose occupations that are less paid than men; and they tend to take longer leave than men to care for children. Scott &apos; s statement and all his speech are lacking in this context. So we evaluate his claim mostly true. Correction: Women earned 78.7 per cent of white men, overall, in 22 broad fields of employment in 2018, according to data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics. An earlier version of this story was wrong in the preparation of statistics.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00904"}
