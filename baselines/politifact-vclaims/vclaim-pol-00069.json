Levin claimed, without evidence, that the whistleblower hired \"left-wing lawyers, left-wing firms, Soros involved in funding one\u00a0of them.\"\npic.twitter.com/WaLS3cL5ng\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019 \n\"He happens to get a Schumer-Clinton lawyer, who happens to work with a group called Whistleblower Aid,\" Levin said in the video. \"And Breitbart has a great piece on this. They were founded in 2017 for the purpose of taking down the Trump administration.\"\u00a0\nWe reviewed voter registration information, campaign finance filings and LinkedIn profiles for each of the whistleblower\u2019s three lawyers, who did not respond to requests for comment.\nWe found little evidence that they are \"left-wing lawyers\" working for \"left-wing firms,\" and no evidence whatsoever that their work is being funded by George Soros, the billionaire Democratic donor.\nWho are the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys?\nThe whistleblower is represented by Compass Rose Legal Group, a Washington law firm focused on security clearance, federal employment and national security issues.\nThe firm\u2019s three attorneys \u2014 Andrew P. Bakaj, Mark S. Zaid and I. Charles McCullough III \u2014 have represented the whistleblower \"from the outset,\" according to a statement. (McCullough has not signed on to more recent statements.)\nBakaj, the lead attorney, is a former intelligence officer and criminal investigator who was himself a whistleblower while working for the CIA inspector general, according to the Washingtonian.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Zaid runs his own national security law firm. McCullough is a longtime government official who most recently served as the first ever intelligence community inspector general, working under the director of national intelligence from 2011 to 2017.\nAre they liberals?\nWe checked public records from Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia. Currently, Bakaj is registered to vote in D.C. with no political affiliation, Zaid is registered in Maryland with no political affiliation, and McCullough is registered in Maryland as a Republican.\nSo where did Levin, Trump and others get the idea that they are \"left-wing\" lawyers?\nLevin did not respond to our requests for comment, but his claims that the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers lean to the left can be largely traced to reports from conservative news outlets such as Breitbart and the Washington Free Beacon.\nOn Sept. 24, Breitbart reported that Bakaj\u2019s \"resume includes work for\" former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and current Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following day, the Washington Free Beacon reported that Bakaj donated this year to former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.\u00a0\nThe same outlets have also drawn attention to tweets Bakaj and Zaid have posted about Trump, in which they have poked fun at Trump, questioned his fitness for office, urged officials to blow the whistle on government misconduct and offered lower rates for would-be whistleblowers.\nIt\u2019s true that Bakaj donated to Biden. According to filings with the Federal Election Commission, he gave $100 to the Biden campaign on April 26.\u00a0\nThe Breitbart story leaves out that Bakaj worked as an intern, not as a staffer, for Clinton, Schumer and the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, according to his LinkedIn profile. Bakaj was not on their full-time staffs, nor did he represent them as a lawyer.\nIn response to a related critique from Fox New host Laura Ingraham, Zaid dismissed Bakaj\u2019s internships on Twitter. \"Andrew \u2014 when he was 19/20 & in college \u2014 interned w/ Senators Schumer & Clinton,\" Zaid wrote. \"Almost 20 years ago.\"\nZaid donated to the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee between 2005 and 2014. In an interview with The Hill, Zaid said the donations were silent auction biddings that he made as a guest at the committee\u2019s spring ball. We could not find record of any individual donations from McCullough.\nOn Twitter, Zaid listed a number of times when he has represented conservatives. He twice represented GOP members of Congress on cases related to the Freedom of Information Act, and he has represented the Republican National Committee as well.\nHe also represented five CIA whistleblowers in the Benghazi case, and he represented the Daily Caller, a conservative publication.\u00a0\n\"The partisans are trying to smear the legal team as some liberal opposition,\" Zaid wrote. \"We are anything but that.\" The Hill quoted two colleagues of Zaid saying he\u2019s hardly political.\nAs far as we could tell, Bakaj has not made any similar public statements.\u00a0\nLevin\u2019s other allegations\nLevin also claimed that Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit legal group that supports whistleblowers, was created \"for the purpose of taking down the Trump administration.\" Zaid and Bakaj are affiliated with the group, which set up a GoFundMe to help pay for the whistleblower\u2019s services.\nSupport for Levin\u2019s claim seems to come from Breitbart, which noted that an old version of the group\u2019s website said \"our Republic is under threat.\"\nBut aside from that now-deleted language and the fact that the group was founded in 2017, during Trump\u2019s presidency, there\u2019s no evidence that the group is targeting Trump. When it was created, founder John Tye explicitly said it was \"not a partisan effort.\"\nThe claim that Soros is involved is more far-fetched. A Breitbart article mentions Soros numerous times, but each alleged link shows the billionaire several degrees of separation away from the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers. We could not find any credible evidence connecting Soros to the whistleblower\u2019s efforts.\nOur ruling\nLevin said the whistleblower hired \"left-wing lawyers, left-wing firms, Soros involved in funding one\u00a0of them.\"\nOne of the lawyers, Bakaj, donated $100 to Joe Biden and worked as an intern for Schumer and Clinton almost 20 years ago. None of the lawyers are registered Democrats.\nFurthermore, there\u2019s no evidence that their firm leans to the left or receives funding from Soros.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\nCorrection, Nov. 6:\u00a0We have corrected a minor word in Levin's quote; it now reads \"one\" on all references.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00069"}
