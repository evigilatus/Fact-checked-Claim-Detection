Scott Walker's opposition to abortion. But one television commercial from Emily's list, a Washington, D.C.-based group, may be the most awful. In the middle of the road to a 30-second spot, released on October 21, 2014, the novelist Walker says, \"Some women are forced to undergo a magnetic probe for an abortion.\" As they say, there is an address on the screen that says, \"Scott Walker is in favour of charging ultrasound devices through the vagina.\" It's made to look like a newspaper address, but it comes from an article on the left-hand progressive thinking blog. A medical system is also offered. A group of readers asked us to verify the claim. \"Reproduction\" is the word for attention in the claim. However, as we will see, the reference to \"some women\" is also important. Abortion and ultrasound refers to a law in July 2013 in Wisconsin requiring women seeking abortion to have access to ultrasound - either across borders, which is done externally, or across borders. Wisconsin is one of the 24 states requiring ultrasound prior to abortion. In Wisconsin, there are exceptions in cases of sexual assault or medical emergency. The Governor's Office commended this measure, saying that \"women are better able to make an informed decision that protects their physical and mental health now and in the future.\" The medical association in Wisconsin, among others, opposed the law. The society has said that this measure is \"direct infringement of the patient-doctor relationship\" and \"undeveloped state states of government in medical sciences.\" (c) A further part of the Act is prohibited, according to which doctors who perform abortions shall be granted admission privileges in a court of law. As we move on to Emily's list claim, there is one observation: the use of ultrasounds among abortion service providers is not new, although the Wisconsin law that demands them is new. Two weeks after Walker signed the procedure, the director of the clinic and another employee of the Associated Medical Services Department, an abortion service provider in Milwaukee, indicated in an article in the Huffington Post that their clinic needed \"always\" ultrasound. \"If you go to an abortion clinic that does not insist on ultrasound, you must go out the door. It's just bad medicine. They wrote. However, Milwaukee clinic staff also indicated that the Wisconsin Act did not require the use of ultrasound via vagina and that they would have opposed this requirement. They said that their clinic only carries transsounds when they are considered medically necessary -- in cases of early pregnancy, sick obesity, or anatomy variables in the uterus. In an interview with Fox News on January 17, 2021, President Donald Trump said: \"There is nothing he can say (about the riots in the American Capitol Building) because the platforms have removed it.\" Bill McCarthy said on January 18, 2021 Tracy Witz, Assistant Professor and Director of the Programme for the Advancement of New Reproductive Health Standards at the University of California, San Francisco, that national vaginal ultrasound is routine among early pregnancy abortion providers. They can verify pregnancy no later than four weeks early, which means that women do not have to wait for weeks of symptoms of pregnancy and distress before choosing an abortion. As we have explained, the law signed by Walker does not require ultrasound via vagina - although the main title used in the declaration says that Walker supported the authorization of this procedure. Instead, the law provides for \"ultrasounds of pregnant women using any transformer chosen by women\" - either via vagina or through blood - according to an analysis by the non-partisan legislature. But there's more to think about. Under the law, the person performing ultrasound must inform the pregnant woman during the operation of \"the image of ultrasound,\" including \"the dimensions of the unborn child and a description of any external features and internal organs present and seen on the image.\" The person must also display ultrasound images so that the pregnant woman can see them, but the woman cannot be forced to see them. Family planning in Wisconsin told us that only ultrasound via vagina would enable a medical doctor to meet the requirements of the law for early pregnancies, up to 12 weeks. According to a report issued in August 2014 by the State Ministry of Health Services, 84 per cent of abortions in Wisconsin take place in 12 weeks or less. At the same time, Emily's list indicated that according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, ultrasound via vagina is often used for early pregnancy, while ultrasound via blood is often used after about 10 weeks of pregnancy. The Guttmacher Institute, a non-profit institution that studies reproductive rights, says: \"Routine ultrasounds are not considered medically necessary as an element of first-stage abortion.\" \u2219 Barbara Lyons, former Executive Director of Rights to Life in Wisconsin, who opposes abortion, told us that even if the medical condition suggests that a woman seeking abortion should have an ultrasound via vagina, the woman still has the last word, and the Wisconsin Act does not impose one on the other. \"In the end, she got to make a decision,\" said Leonce. \"There's no warrant\" In summary: The law does not provide for the use of ultrasounds via vagina. However, for some women, the fact that ultrasounds are required means that they will have to perform the sexually transmitted operation, rather than a Hebrew operation, in order to perform an abortion. Our evaluation in a television ad, Emily's Walker's list said, \"Forcing some women to submit to a probe via my vagina to perform an abortion,\" while a picture on the screen says, \"Walker\" orders incitement to vaginal ultrasounds. The law does not provide for the use of ultrasound via vagina, but provides that women seeking abortion can choose either ultrasound via vagina or blood. However, medical professionals say that, in practice, the new requirement means that some women must receive ultrasounds via the vagina. For a partially accurate statement, but it leaves important information, our classification is half correct.
