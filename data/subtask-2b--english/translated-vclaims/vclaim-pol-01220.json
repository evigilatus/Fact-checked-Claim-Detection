The holiday season shows a lot of good, but it's also a major time for old rumors, decorating and bluffing. One example is the allegation of Obama's administration war on a Christmas scene in the White House. Social media bulletins (such as these) claim that Obamas removed the birth scene, but \"return to the White House thanks to First Lady Melania Trump.\" The story was highlighted as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) These articles are incorrect: the Holy Family Show in the Eastern Room has been displayed - without interruption - since its donation to the White House in the 1960s. Here's how we know that. The date of the 47th White House birth scene, known as the White House nursery, was made of carved wood and Terra Kota, and was established in Naples, Italy, in the late 18th century, according to the White House archives. The nursery was donated to the White House by Mohsen Jean Engelhard in 1967 and has been offered every birthday since then. In 1978, Ingelhard donated 10 digits and additional funds for a new painting, which was first presented in 1999. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in an article in Facebook by Nancy Belusi, who was no longer Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. Rumors are said to have begun in 2009, during the first year of Obama. The New York Times reported that the Obama administration was thinking about a \"non-religious\" birthday in the White House, which included the idea of whether to offer a nursery. In the end, tradition won, and the nursery was put in its usual place. In 2015, the White House newspaper Obama also described the nursery as a \"long-term holiday tradition.\" \"Donation to the White House in the '60s, this piece has sat in the East Room on holidays for more than 45 years, through nine departments,\" says the ad. In 2016, photos of the birth scene were taken by HGTV during the White House Christmas tour. You can see the online show for the tour here. Finally, a news statement by the Trump administration about Zaina this year also referred to a series of famous scenes in the White House, saying: \"For the fifty-first year, the nursery in the White House will also be on display.\" Our ruling social media articles say that Obama has banned the display of the famous White House scene of complacency over the years, and they thanked First Lady Melania Trump for returning it. This is an old trick that tends to reappear during the holidays. There was no rest for White House patients. The Obama team continued the tradition of showing the trauma scene in the Eastern Chamber, according to previous news bulletins, archives, fact checks and photographic evidence. A statement by the Trump Administration also indicates that the scene was on display more than 50 years ago, since it was donated in 1967. We're assessing this pants claim on fire.
