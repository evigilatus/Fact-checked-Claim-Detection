Sarah Palin, the party\u2019s 2008 vice presidential nominee. After the court's decision was announced on June 28, 2012, Palin tweeted, \"Obama lied to the American people. Again. He said it wasn't a tax. Obama lies; freedom dies.\"\n\nWe aren\u2019t able to fact-check whether \"freedom\" is dying, which is solidly in the realm of opinion.\n\nHowever, we can check her claim that Obama said the individual mandate, a requirement that people buy health insurance or face a tax penalty, \"wasn't a tax.\" That was the basis for the court's decision to uphold the law.\n\nDid Obama say the individual mandate wasn\u2019t a tax?\n\nGiven how unpopular taxes are, it\u2019s understandable why Obama would not trumpet the notion that the mandate was a tax. \u00a0But has he said it was not a tax?\n\nWe could find only one example after Obama was president in which he or a top aide explicitly stated that the mandate wasn\u2019t a tax. (When we asked, the Republican National Committee couldn\u2019t come up with any other examples, either.) The one instance came on Sept. 20, 2009, in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. Here\u2019s an excerpt:\n\nStephanopoulos: Under this mandate, the government is forcing people to spend money, fining you if you don\u2019t. How is that not a tax?\n\nObama: Well, hold on a second, George. Here \u2014 here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. You and I are both paying $900, on average \u2014 our families \u2014 in higher premiums because of uncompensated care. Now what I\u2019ve said is that if you can\u2019t afford health insurance, you certainly shouldn\u2019t be punished for that. That\u2019s just piling on. If, on the other hand, we\u2019re giving tax credits, we\u2019ve set up an exchange, you are now part of a big pool, we\u2019ve driven down the costs, we\u2019ve done everything we can and you actually can afford health insurance, but you\u2019ve just decided, you know what, I want to take my chances. And then you get hit by a bus and you and I have to pay for the emergency room care, that\u2019s\u2026\n\nStephanopoulos: That may be, but it\u2019s still a tax increase.\n\nObama: No. That\u2019s not true, George. The \u2014 for us to say that you\u2019ve got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase. What it\u2019s saying is, is that we\u2019re not going to have other people carrying your burdens for you anymore than the fact that right now everybody in America, just about, has to get auto insurance. Nobody considers that a tax increase. People say to themselves, that is a fair way to make sure that if you hit my car, that I\u2019m not covering all the costs.\n\nStephanopoulos: But it may be fair, it may be good public policy\u2026\n\nObama: No, but \u2014 but, George, you \u2014 you can\u2019t just make up that language and decide that that\u2019s called a tax increase. \u2026 What if I say that right now your premiums are going to be going up by 5 or 8 or 10 percent next year and you say well, that\u2019s not a tax increase; but, on the other hand, if I say that I don\u2019t want to have to pay for you not carrying coverage even after I give you tax credits that make it affordable, then\u2026\n\nStephanopoulos: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m making it up. Merriam Webster\u2019s Dictionary: Tax \u2014 \"a charge, usually of money, imposed by authority on persons or property for public purposes.\"\n\nObama: George, the fact that you looked up Merriam\u2019s Dictionary, the definition of tax increase, indicates to me that you\u2019re stretching a little bit right now. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t have gone to the dictionary to check on the definition. I mean what\u2026\n\nStephanopoulos: I wanted to check for myself. But your critics say it is a tax increase.\n\nObama: My critics say everything is a tax increase. My critics say that I\u2019m taking over every sector of the economy. You know that. Look, we can have a legitimate debate about whether or not we\u2019re going to have an individual mandate or not, but\u2026\n\nStephanopoulos: But you reject that it\u2019s a tax increase?\n\nObama: I absolutely reject that notion.\n\nSliced up into brief sound bites, the back-and-forth between Stephanopoulos offers some clear evidence of Obama arguing that the mandate is not a tax, most obviously when he says that the mandate \"is absolutely not a tax increase.\"\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth noting that Obama made the case that the alternative was worse -- that not having an individual mandate would be unfair and inefficient. The absence of an individual mandate, Obama argued, means passing on the costs of treating Americans uninsured to people who are insured, which amounts to a \"tax\" on those with coverage, even though it may not be literally fit the dictionary definition of a tax. In essence, Obama was brushing off complaints that he was imposing a tax by contending that a \"tax\" was already in place under the status quo.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPalin is correct that Obama \"said (the individual mandate) wasn't a tax.\" It\u2019s right there in the video. We rate the statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: BuzzFeed has collected videos of Obama administration officials being asked about whether the individual mandate was a tax.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10852"}
