The Republic of the United States of America, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, challenges the current democracy, Sen Mark Brewer, in a narrow race that can decide which party controls the Senate. Like many other Republicans facing current Democrats, Cotton Brewer is often attacked to vote in accordance with Obama's policies. In the first discussion of candidates in October 13, Cotton said: \"Mr. Brewer said that President Obama has little to offer to rural America and states like Arkansas. I agree. I just don't understand why he's voting with him 93% of the time.\" Cotton made this claim and loved him very much throughout the campaign, while Brewer wrote a supposedly independent record. In the 2013 National Congress elections, Brewer in the middle of the Senate was the 53rd highest liberal and the 44 most conservative. We've decided to check on how many times Brewer votes in line with Obama. We contacted Cotton's campaign, and they didn't call us back. But these statistics usually come from CQ Roll Call, which tracks Congressional data. Since 1953, when Dwight D. Eisenhower became President, the Board of Governors has calculated presidential support in Congressional votes. In voting studies, CQ editors select \"Voices in favour of the presidency,\" based on clear statements made by the President or his or her spokespersons on particular votes. The degree of presidential support among members reflects the number of times they vote in agreement with the President &apos; s position. Here is the Prior presidential support rate since 2009, when Obama took office. Presidential support rate 2009 95 per cent 2010 92 per cent 2011 95 per cent 2012 91 per cent 2013 90 per cent By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, Brewer's voice lined up with Obama's stated position on that vote between 90 and 95 percent of the time over the past five years. The number of cotton - 93% - is the right slap in the middle. (average 92.6 per cent) So it's very accurate. In 2013, Brewer supported the President less than the Democrats in the Senate, according to CQ. That year, Democrats in the Senate voted generally with Obama 96 percent of the time in 2013, which, according to CQ, was \"the highest level of support for the general leader of either party in at least six decades.\" It is reasonable to assume that this measure will also indicate how Congressman voted with his party - given the party environment. But this is not quite the case. Here, Brewer's vote has been recorded in terms of the number of times he voted in the Democratic Party since 2009. The support rate of the General Party 2009 91 per cent 2010 85 per cent 2011 85 per cent 2012 85 per cent 2013 80 per cent although it voted with Obama at least 90 per cent of the time, Prijor voted with the Democratic Party often less, especially last year. In contrast, Cotton - who served as representative for only one year - voted with Obama for only 12 per cent of the time in 2013. I voted with the Republican Party 97% of the time. The CQ number is a roll-call vote, and therefore does not count other ways in which a congressman may have acted against the President &apos; s agenda, such as adopting legislation that never allows for a vote. The Prijor campaign referred to its co-sponsorship of legislation in 2013, which would have maintained social security benefits in the future - and called on Obama to make changes in his budget request. The Obama proposal was seen as an olive branch for the Republicans who hoped to take austerity measures. The campaign also noted that since the Conservative Party does not weigh votes, this may not reflect the fact that Brewer voted against Obama on key legislation. They noted the Senate &apos; s rejection of a draft arms control law that included background checks for all, which Obama supported. Prior was one of five Democrats to oppose the bill. The Governor Cotton said, \"Voices with Obama 93% of the time.\" Since Obama became President, Brewer voted in accordance with the President's positions between 90 and 95 per cent of the time, with 92.6 per cent -- essentially 93 per cent -- as an average, according to the best rating system at our disposal. However, Brewer does not vote with the Democratic Party as he often does, and in 2013 his pro-presidential votes were lower than all members of the Democratic Senate. The number of cotton on a target basis is based on data, but Brewer also opposed Obama on a few key issues. We assess his claim mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07101"}
