But we hadn\u2019t heard the claim about Truman, so we decided to take a look.\nThe minimum wage, as written into law, has been $7.25 an hour since 2009. Here\u2019s a table that covers the years of Truman\u2019s tenure in office. We calculated the inflation-adjusted wage using the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 inflation calculator.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nNominal minimum wage\n\n\nReal minimum wage (2013 dollars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1945\n\n\n0.40\n\n\n5.19\n\n\n\n\n1946\n\n\n0.40\n\n\n4.79\n\n\n\n\n1947\n\n\n0.40\n\n\n4.19\n\n\n\n\n1948\n\n\n0.40\n\n\n3.88\n\n\n\n\n1949\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.40\n\n\n3.93\n\n\n\n\n1950\n\n\n0.75\n\n\n7.27\n\n\n\n\n1951\n\n\n0.75\n\n\n6.74\n\n\n\n\n1952\n\n\n0.75\n\n\n6.61\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n7.25\n\n\n7.25\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo in 1950 -- which was during Truman\u2019s time in office -- the inflation-adjusted minimum wage was $7.27, which is higher than today\u2019s minimum wage. Two cents more isn\u2019t a lot, but it\u2019s enough to give some credibility to the president\u2019s claim.\nWe should add, however, that 1950 was the exception. That was the year the minimum wage was raised -- indeed, it was nearly doubled. And with each subsequent year, inflation ate away at the wage\u2019s purchasing power.\nUltimately, during seven out of the eight calendar years when Truman was in office, the inflation-adjusted minimum wage was lower than it is today -- not higher.\nDoes that matter? It\u2019s a judgment call.\n\"The point wasn\u2019t to isolate the eight years of Truman presidency, but the fact that we\u2019re back at the same level as it was in 1950,\" said Bobby Whithorne, a White House spokesman.\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, agreed.\n\"A lawyer defending the president\u2019s wording would add that the president did not say the current minimum wage is lower than it was in every single year of President Truman\u2019s tenure in office,\" Burtless said. \"Some of President Obama\u2019s listeners would no doubt be stunned to (learn) that the purchasing power of the current minimum wage is below its purchasing power in any year of the Truman administration, even if the difference is only two cents per hour.\"\nOur ruling\nObama said the minimum wage \"in real terms right now is below where it was when Harry Truman was in office.\" That\u2019s correct for 1950, but incorrect for the other seven calendar years of Truman\u2019s tenure. In fact, you could just as easily say that the minimum wage is higher today than it was under Truman, and that would be correct for seven out of the eight years he was in office. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08540"}
