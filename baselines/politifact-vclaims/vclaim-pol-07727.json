Because Cantor was Jewish, the lone voice for religious diversity in the GOP\u2019s congressional ranks will also disappear, argued Bill Maher, host of HBO\u2019s Real Time.\n\"Now there are no non-Christian Republicans. This is an amazing fact,\" Maher said June 13. \"There are 278 Republicans in Congress. They are now all Christian and all white except for one black senator who was appointed. So this is an entirely Christian, white party.\"\nDoes Cantor\u2019s primary defeat mean Republicans in Congress are now all white and all Christian?\nRepublicans \u2018all Christian\u2019\nThe 2012 elections ushered in the first Buddhist in the Senate (Hawaii\u2019s Mazie Hirono, a Democrat), the first Hindu in either chamber (Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat), and the first Congress member to list her religious affiliation as \"none\" (Arizona Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat), according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, which recorded the religious affiliation of members for a 2012 report.\nThey joined two Muslims (Democrats) and a Unitarian Universalist (a Democrat).\nWhen it comes to Republicans, 192 of 278 GOP members identify with a Protestant denomination (Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, etc.), 70 identify as Catholic, three are Orthodox Christian, and 12 are Mormon (more on that in a moment). Cantor, a Republican from Virginia, is Jewish and makes No. 278, but Brat, the Republican who could succeed him after the November election, is Catholic.\nThe only possible hang-up to Maher\u2019s claim when examining the current makeup of Congress when it comes to religion is how you view Mormonism. Some Christians do not recognize Mormons, belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as Christians. Mormons\u00a0do consider themselves Christians.\nRepublicans \u2018all white\u2019\nMaher also said the GOP\u2019s congressional ranks are all-white except for one appointed African-American official. That\u2019s Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who resigned his House seat for a Senate appointment in January 2013.\nTo say the other Republicans in Congress are all white depends on your definition of \"all white,\" which isn\u2019t always so easy to define.\nThere are no other African-American Republicans in Congress (there are 43 black Democrats). \u00a0There also are no Asian or Pacific Islander Republicans in Congress (there are 13 Democrats).\nBut there are three Hispanic Republican senators and seven Hispanic Republicans in the House, according to the Congressional Research Service. That includes Cuban-American Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Florida Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, and Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, born in Puerto Rico.\nThe Census Bureau, however, does not include Hispanic or Latino as a racial designation, instead using the categories white, black, Asian, Pacific Islander and American Indian. The Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnicity, which is based on cultural or linguistic\u00a0similarity. Hispanics could identify with any race depending on the region from where they descend, or list none at all.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPew says as many as 6.2 percent of census respondents selected \u00a0\"some other race\" in the 2010 census, the vast majority of whom were Hispanic. And there is a movement to include Hispanic as a racial category in future censuses, says Kevin Dougherty, Baylor University sociology professor.\n\"To say they are all white, you think they have very fair skin and have European descent,\" Dougherty said. \"It does mask an important source of diversity that is present among Republicans in Congress.\"\nIt\u2019s not just Hispanics who are unaccounted for in Maher\u2019s claim. We know of two Republicans that are enrolled members of federally recognized American Indian tribes. The first is Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who is a member of the Chickasaw Nation tribe. The second is freshman Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., a citizen of the Cherokee Nation.\nThe timeline of all this\nOne more critical point: When Maher says the Republicans in Congress are \"now\" all white and all Christian, that\u2019s not accurate -- Cantor isn\u2019t going anywhere yet. The GOP\u2019s lone Jewish member will not leave until his replacement is sworn into office in early 2015, after the midterm elections.\nAnd as he leaves office, it\u2019s possible that new non-white, non-Christian Republicans could take seats in Congress. There are several possibilities:\n\n\nMia Love, a Republican African-American running for Congress in Utah, is a\u00a0far-and-away\u00a0favorite to win a seat in the U.S. House come November.\n\n\nWill Hurd, an African-American Republican, secured the GOP nomination in Texas\u2019 most-competitive House district (which backed Mitt Romney for president in 2012).\n\n\nT.W. Shannon, an African-American Republican, has the support of Texas\u2019 Cruz in Shannon\u2019s bid for an Oklahoma Senate seat. (His primary is June 24.)\n\n\nA Jewish Republican and state lawmaker, Adam Kwasman, is running in the Republican primary in Arizona\u2019s 1st Congressional District.\n\n\nOur ruling\nWithout Cantor, Maher said, the GOP in Congress is \"now all Christian and all white except for one black senator, who was appointed.\" Maher\u2019s show did not respond to a request for comment.\nIf we learned anything from this fact-check, it is that straightforward sounding claims about religion and race are rarely that straightforward. Still, Maher\u2019s unequivocal statement glosses over some diversity within the GOP\u2019s ranks.\nOn religion, Maher's claim comes down to how you view Mormonism.\nOn race, the question is even more murky. There are two members of federally recognized American Indian tribes, which is classified as a race by the U.S. Census Bureau, and there are as many 10 Republicans in the House and Senate with Hispanic roots. Some may consider their race white,\u00a0Hispanic or something else.\nAlso, Cantor isn\u2019t leaving office until the end of his term in January. It\u2019s possible the November elections will bring non-Christian or non-white Republican members who will take office when Cantor leaves.\nMaher\u2019s statement is partially accurare\u00a0but leaves out important details.
