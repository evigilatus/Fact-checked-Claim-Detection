We wanted to know if the $25-million figure was true.When we contacted the Lynch campaign, spokesman Bill Fischer said the number also includes furnishings, such as desks and office equipment, and the sources were a Providence Business News story, which he could not locate, and an Oct. 5, 2009, Providence Journal story.We checked the Journal story but there was no reference to $25 million being spent on anything.When we asked Fischer about that, he cited this sentence in the story:\"But Blue Cross president and chief executive officer James E. Purcell is proud of his $90-million ($125 million when you include furnishings and \u2018soft\u2019 costs such as fees and engineering) building and insists it is actually saving money for the health insurer.\"Fischer said the campaign arrived at the $25-million figure by taking the $35 million difference between $125 million and $90 million, then subtracting $10 million to be on the safe side. He said the Lynch campaign has repeatedly sought more reliable information from Blue Cross and the state Department of Business Regulation, which uses data from the health-insurance giant to rule on premium increases. But both, he said, have refused to disclose that data.\"It\u2019s the best information we could ascertain from the limited information Blue Cross will provide on this matter,\" said Fischer.No it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a number pulled out of thin air.Fischer added that Lynch has publicly repeated the $25-million claim in several venues, in news releases and on the radio. \"Not once did Blue Cross refute it,\" he said.They don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s up to a candidate to know what he or she is talking about. Repeatedly presenting rough guesstimates as hard facts does not make them true.\"We stand by our number,\" Fischer said.And we stand by our rating: Pants on Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, we asked Blue Cross how much it spent on furnishings and received this response from Kimberly R.

The actual cost was modestly in excess of $7 million.\"Reingold said \"modestly in excess of $7 million\" means less than $7.5 million and was based on \"invoices received from multiple vendors.\"We asked Blue Cross for documentation to back up that number. The company declined to provide it.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14845"}
