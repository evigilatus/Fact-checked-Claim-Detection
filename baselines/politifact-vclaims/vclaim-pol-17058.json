(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe woman on the left in the photo is Angela Merkel when she was 18 years old. The other people in the image published by Time in 2015 are only identified as \"friends at a New Year\u2019s Eve party in Berlin in 1972.\"\nWe reached out to Merkel, May and Grybauskait\u0117 about the Facebook post but did not receive replies.\nHowever, we couldn\u2019t find any corroborating evidence that the former British prime minister and the former president of Lithuania were photographed with her.\u00a0\nRather, the available evidence points away from the Facebook post\u2019s claim. It\u2019s extremely unlikely that two public figures like May and Grybauskait\u0117 would not also be identified in the photo alongside Merkel if, in fact, they were in the photo alongside Merkel.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe didn\u2019t find any photos of Grybauskait\u0117 as a teenager but photos of May around the time this photo was taken do not resemble the person pictured next to Merkel.\nThe three women also did not attend the same schools or universities.\nMerkel attended high school in Templin, Germany, and then enrolled at what\u2019s now known as the University of Leipzig in Germany.\nMay was born in October 1956 and would have been 16 at the time the photo was taken. According to the BBC, she was mainly educated at Wheatley Park Comprehensive School in England before going to Oxford University.\u00a0\nGrybauskait\u0117 was born in March 1956 and would have also been 16 at the time the photo was taken. She attended Vilnius Salomeja Neris Secondary School in Lithuania before studying at what was then known as Leningrad University in Russia.\nWe lastly emailed Stefan Kornelius, who wrote \"Angela Merkel: The Chancellor and Her World,\" an authorized biography about the leader. Did the photo show May and Grybauskait\u0117?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Come on,\" he said. \"This is nuts.\"\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17058"}
