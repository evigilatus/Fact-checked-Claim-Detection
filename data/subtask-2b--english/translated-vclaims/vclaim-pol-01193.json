The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Federalist papers.org quotes Fox News, which in turn quotes San Diego Union-Tribune. The Federation of San Diego-Trib\u00f3n reported that on 11 December, two groups of Central American immigrants travelled separately to the American Consulate in Tijuana, \"requiring that they be treated through the asylum system more quickly and in greater numbers, that deportations be stopped and that President Trump either allowed them into the country or paid $50,000 each to return home.\" According to the newspaper, the group requesting payment or acceptance is approximately 100 persons. Another group of some 50 people requested that the United States expedite and increase the processing of asylum-seekers &apos; applications. Both groups had a letter and were reportedly received by United States Consulate officials, but they were not aware of each other &apos; s demands, as the Union of San Diego-Trep\u00f3n had said. In December 11, the Consulate posted on its website a warning of a planned march that day at the Consulate. Polyte Fact contacted the Consulate to confirm the details of the letter but did not receive a reply. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 3 February 2021, the letter concerning the request of $50,000 was sent to Tramp, paying tribute on behalf of all members of the convoy and expressing complaints in Honduras. \"If you need any further evidence that migrant convoys on our southern border are not what it looks like, now these invaders are making a new application,\" said the article on Federalist.org. \"Now these 'immigrants' say 'Give us $50,000 each to return home, or we will destroy your borders'.\" Steve Strapp, website manager, Politi Fuckett, reported that his website was one of the opinions, not a news site, that his story was clearly described as \"the opinion,\" and that she did not claim that all immigrants were asking for $50,000. \"We are proud of the fact that the content of our articles is based on the truth and we use only the main sources or other legitimate sources as the basis for our story,\" said Strobe. At some point, it was estimated that up to 8,000 people in convoys from Central America were walking to the United States-Mexico border in an effort to enter the United States. Some 6,000 people arrived in Tijuana in November, but it is believed that the number of people still seeking admission to the United States is much lower. Hundreds have returned to their countries, hundreds of others have been deported by the Mexican authorities, and many others have applied for permission to stay in Mexico, according to the news reports. Our ruling is a headline on the Federalist papers.org, which says, \"Migrants call $50,000 each to return home, or otherwise.\" A group of about 100 immigrants who went to the American Consulate in Tijuana requesting permission to enter the United States or to get $50,000 each, according to the Union of San Diego-Trepone. This letter is addressed to Tramp and presents a greeting on behalf of all members of the convoy. Another group that had a separate correspondence to the Consulate on asylum procedures stated that it was not aware of the other group &apos; s requests. It is therefore possible that not all migrants are aware of and receive such a request. The function is precise but requires clarification or additional information. We're mostly assessing it right.
