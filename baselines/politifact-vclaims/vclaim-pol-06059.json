Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\nBut Hillary Clinton won't pledge to reinstate Glass-Steagall if she becomes president. And Bill Clinton says criticism over the law\u2019s repeal is unfounded.\n\"Look at all the grief I got for signing the bill that ended Glass-Steagall,\" Bill Clinton said in an interview with Inc. magazine for its September issue. \"There's not a single, solitary example that it had anything to do with the financial crash.\"\nGiven the significant attention on Glass-Steagall among Democrats, we wondered if it\u2019s true that it didn\u2019t have \"anything to do with the financial crash.\"\nOur research shows the law\u2019s demise was part of a broad deregulatory push that greatly contributed to the financial crisis. But Clinton has a point that a direct line from the 1999 repeal to the market crash in 2007-08 is hard to identify.\nToo\u00a0big\u00a0to\u00a0fail\nCongress passed Glass-Steagall in 1933, in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash that led to the Great Depression. The law kept commercial banks (where customers deposit money and take out loans) separate from investment firms (which hold securities and make investments) -- more colloquially, the law separated Main Street from Wall Street.\nSome experts and lawmakers want to keep these kinds of activities separate, because they\u2019re worried that merging them could put the public\u2019s money at risk. Here\u2019s a simple hypothetical: A bank merges with an investment firm to create a massive company. The investment side makes a huge bet on an investment that fails big time, so the commercial bank side\u2019s money -- money individuals have deposited for safe-keeping -- could be at risk. Because those deposits are federally insured, it might require a government bailout. (Think too-big-to-fail.) Supporters of the law say keeping these activities separate prevents this kind of domino effect.\nIs this what caused the most recent financial crisis? There\u2019s plenty of room for debate here, given that there isn\u2019t a single what-caused-the-crisis narrative that every economist accepts. It\u2019s safe to say, though, that there is not a prominent group of economists who argue \"but for the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall, the crisis would not have happened.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawrence White, an economist at New York University, doesn\u2019t see Glass-Steagall playing any role in the financial crisis whatsoever. He pointed to the crisis\u2019 biggest culprits: firms\u00a0such as Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs and AIG, to name a few. He added that much of the crisis hinged on activity by these institutions\u00a0that would have been possible with or without Glass-Steagall, such as mass investment in notoriously bad mortgage loans. (Clinton\u2019s staff linked us to commentary by several other experts who share White\u2019s view.)\nWe also contacted Barry Ritholtz, a wealth management expert and commentator, who\u00a0said\u00a0Glass-Steagall would have done nothing to stop the financial crisis, but not having it made the crisis worse. It encouraged banks to get bigger and to take on riskier investments, so the ripple effects of the crisis were bigger than they would have been otherwise, he said, adding that it wasn\u2019t just the headline-making banks that struggled.\nThe extent over Glass-Steagall\u2019s effect on the financial crisis is a topic on which reasonable people can disagree. More so in Clinton\u2019s favor is the fact that Glass-Steagall was a shadow of its former self by the time 1999 rolled around.\nDeregulating like it\u2019s 1999\nA few decades out from the Depression, starting in earnest in the 1970s, there was a push to roll back financial regulations that continued throughout the administrations of former presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. As part of that movement, banks and lawmakers steadily chipped away at Glass-Steagall and took advantage of loopholes. Banks were engaging in the kinds of activity Glass-Steagall was intended to stop even though the law was still on the books.\nBy the time Clinton signed the Financial Services Modernization Act, commonly known as Gramm-Leach-Bliley, repealing the key components of Glass-Steagall in 1999, the regulation was nearly toothless. The law was simply catching up to what the market had already accomplished in the previous 10 to 15 years, said Kathleen Day, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University and an expert in financial crises.\nTake for example the poster child of the end of Glass-Steagall: The merger of Citicorp, a bank, and Travelers Group, a financial conglomerate, was announced in 1998 before Glass-Steagall was repealed. Even though this was the exact type of merger Glass-Steagall was intended to halt, the financial industry did not see many obstacles for the creation of Citigroup.\n\"Citigroup and others wanted and got the repeal of Glass-Steagall in order to validate what they had already been allowed to do,\" said Simon Johnson, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nSo the overall, decades-in-the-making decline of Glass-Steagall might have contributed to the financial crisis and its fallout, as it was part of the deregulatory push. But Clinton putting pen-to-paper on the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 probably didn\u2019t make any meaningful difference.\nBut Clinton\u2019s hands aren\u2019t clean of the financial crisis, because his administration played no small part in the longer term deregulatory trend. Clinton and his administration did not make an earnest attempt to maintain oversight over the big, hybrid banks created by the demise of Glass-Steagall, Day said. Additionally, the administration\u2019s firm decision not to regulate other aspects of the financial market played a meaningful role in the crisis -- for example, the absence of regulations regarding over-the-counter derivatives, which were becoming increasingly prevalent, despite internal warnings.\nClinton\u2019s claim \"might be technically true, but it\u2019s a sin of omission,\" Day said.\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"There's not a single, solitary example that\" signing the bill to end Glass-Steagall \"had anything to do with the financial crash.\"\nBy focusing on the bill that officially repealed Glass-Steagall,\u00a0Clinton's statement ignores the fact that the demise of Glass-Steagall took place over decades, amid a deregulatory push in which the Clinton administration\u00a0played a role. By the time the law to repeal hit his desk,\u00a0Glass-Steagall had been whittled down so much that it wasn\u2019t very meaningful.\u00a0It's a matter of\u00a0debate how much of a role the overall demise of Glass-Steagall had in causing\u00a0the financial crisis,\u00a0but we couldn't find any\u00a0economists who argue that the regulation was the sole linchpin keeping the financial system stable until its official repeal in 1999. Overall, we rate Clinton\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06059"}
