The Texas Senator of Western Canada was born in Calgary City, Alberta, in 1970 to a Cuban father and an American mother. His mother &apos; s nationality automatically makes her son an American citizen, and most legal authorities agree, however, that he is eligible to run for president. (In May 2014, Cruz also renounced his dual Canadian citizenship.) However, in August 2015, the former Governor of Florida, Jeep Bush, who nominated himself for the presidency, said that Cruz had benefited from the granting of citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment to anyone born in the United States, and Pulitico had said in a news story. Cruz, who said that he wanted to end granting \"the nationality of automatic birth rights to the children of those who are here illegally,\" to Bush's journalists, seemed confused about legal immigration versus illegal immigration. \"With regard to legal citizens,\" Cruz said, \"I am a citizen of the United States because my mother was a citizen of the United States, born in Wilmington, Delaware. Cruz said, \"The law has been since the beginning of the country that the children of American citizens born here or abroad are American citizens by birth.\" We were curious about his summary of legal history. At the outset, the United States Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Office in 2013 indicates that Cruz ranks among some 2.75 million citizens born abroad (including this correspondent) at least one of the parents of a United States citizen. The Cruz campaign did not respond to our requests for backup information. However, legal experts, and ultimately the writings of the Supreme Court of Justice, helped us to realize that children born to citizens living abroad had been granted citizenship by law from the first years of the country, although the way Cruz obtained his nationality - through his mother - had not been legally settled until the 1930s. 1790 to our investigations, experts in American nationality, advised us that the law passed by the First Congress in March 1790 states that children born abroad to citizens can be American citizens - a form of \"aggravated citizenship.\" Christopher McNate Nichols, historian of the State University of Oregon, said by e-mail: \"Since the Naturalization Act of 1790, Congress has clearly attempted to create citizenship rights for children born of citizens abroad.\" The 1790 Act, which is less than 300 words long, initially stated that any \"free white person\" may become a citizen after meeting the conditions of residence for two years (later amended to five years) and convince the court that it is \"a person of good character, sworn or confirmed by law in support of the Constitution of the United States.\" Similarly, the law provides that non-adult children of \"very naturalized\" persons are considered citizens. The law then passed on to children born abroad, stating: \"The children of United States citizens who may be born outside the sea, or outside the borders of the United States, are natural citizens born,\" although it added that \"the right to citizenship does not belong to persons whose parents have never lived in the United States.\" John Trasvinia, Dean of the Law School of the University of San Francisco, referred to an article published in March 2008 in the annual survey of the University of New York by students on American law, in which he stated that when Congress approved the granting of citizenship to children born abroad, he acted like the Parliament of England, which had previously moved to the granting of citizenship to those children. Citizenship through fathers only? Once again, the article written by students and legal experts has led us to wonder whether children born abroad to a citizen mother are always granted American citizenship. According to various accounts, including the Supreme Court's opposition of 2000, Congress did not settle for citizenship through mothers until 1934. The article noted that the Act of 1790 \"created the first distinction between citizens and the father and mother. Although the first item uses 'gender-neutral citizens &apos;, the residence requirement limits the ability of citizen mothers to grant citizenship to their children born abroad. In other words, \"a foreign child born to a foreign father and mother will certainly acquire the derived nationality, but a foreign child born to a foreign mother and father will not acquire the derived nationality unless the foreign father is a resident of the United States. Additional changes may have led to further confusion. In 1802, Congress revised the Birth Act to read: \"The children of persons who are now, or were citizens of the United States, although born outside the borders and jurisdiction of the United States, are citizens of the United States.\" In 1855, Congress again revised the law to grant citizenship to children born abroad to parents of citizens who had previously lived in the country. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 February 3, 2012, citizenship at birth through a mother and what about citizenship through mothers? To get connected to that, we went to the 2011 article by Christine Collins, Professor of Law, Boston University. Collins wrote that Congress addressed this gap in 1934 after \"years of constant pressure from women's organizations\" and \"the citizenship derived from fathers and children on an equal footing at last for married mothers and fathers, at least as an official matter.\" We arrived at Collins, who said by e-mail that it was fair to say that \"some children born abroad of American parents are citizens at birth. On the other hand, Sin Cruz's description of the history of the American Nationality Act is slightly misleading, especially with regard to individuals like him who are children of American mothers born abroad.\" Collins summarized the following: \"Until 1934, under the Federal Nationality Act, which defines the nationality of children born abroad to American fathers, children born abroad to American mothers did not acquire citizenship at birth - some children born abroad were only American parents at birth. But in 1934, Congress edited the law so that nationality passed through mothers as well as fathers.\" Collins said it would be more accurate to say that since the beginning of the country it has been the law that some children of American citizens born abroad are citizens of birth. We also recruited the historian Candace Bredbner, based in North Carolina, who wrote a book on women and citizenship in 1998. She replied by e-mail that \"policies regarding the granting of citizenship at birth to children born abroad to a married citizen have changed considerably over time. Thus, Cruz's assumption that since the founding of the country, the federal government has recognized the right of the mother to pass on her American nationality to a child cannot be supported by evidence.\" In fairness to Cruz, I followed, \"Even a person who has some modest interest in this subject can easily be confused.\" Judge Jensburg also e-mailed the opposition Collins a copy of an article she wrote in May 2000 to analyse the case of the United States Supreme Court in 1998, where Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in opposition, took note of the 1790 Act, which sets out the way to acquire citizenship through the parents of the child as long as the father is a resident of the United States. Jensburg also wrote: \"The papers passed in 1795 and 1802 were similarly conditional on the nationality of the child born abroad at the father's place of residence at least once\" (United States). \"The residence requirement of this father,\" wrote Ginsburg, \"Suggestions that Congress intended a child born abroad to acquire citizenship only when the father was a citizen. That was, in fact, England's law at the time.\" On the other hand, I wrote, \"The legal language... was mysterious. One can read the phrase \"children of citizens\" as meaning that a mother's child is a United States citizen and a foreign father would be eligible for citizenship if the father had resided in the country at some point.\" In the eighteenth century, Ginsburg wrote, there was an unsuccessful push to change the law to grant citizenship to children born abroad to mothers of American citizens as well as parents. Instead, Ginsburg, Congress in 1855, wrote, \"I make it clear that citizenship will not be passed on to children born abroad only when the father\" was an American citizen. The same law automatically granted citizenship to women who married United States citizens. In 1934, Ginsburg wrote, \"Congress moved in a new direction. He ended discrimination against United States mothers in respect of children born abroad,\" and amended the law to read: \"Any child born later outside the United States and its jurisdiction, whose father, mother or both, at the time of the birth of that child, is a United States citizen, declares himself to be a United States citizen; but citizenship rights do not belong to any such child unless the father or mother, as the case may be, has resided in the United States prior to the birth of that child.\" At that time, Ginsburg wrote the reports of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the law stating the change that had been made \"to establish full equality between American men and women in the matter of citizenship for themselves and their children.\" A report issued today by the Congressional Non-Party Research Service on the qualifications of the President and the impediments to \"natural birth\" citizenship referred to the existing provisions on citizenship for children born abroad. The Act provides that the individual shall be a citizen at birth, including \"a person born outside the geographical boundaries and foreign property of the United States of America to two parents, one of whom is a foreigner, and the other a United States citizen who, prior to the birth of that person, was physically present in the United States or its remote property for a period or periods of not less than five years, at least two of whom were after the age of 14.\" \"The law has been since the beginning of the country that the children of American citizens born abroad are American citizens by birth,\" said our government Cruz. Since 1790, the Federal Act provides that children born abroad to American citizens shall become citizens, provided that other conditions are met. However, the law was not explicit on mothers of nationality (how Cruz became American at birth) until 1934. We're mostly assessing this statement right.
