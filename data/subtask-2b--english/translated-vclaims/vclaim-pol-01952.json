However, some Republican commentators argue that politics is essentially a continuation of previous administrations. \"You know what the irony is? The same way Barack Obama did, \"The governor's commentator said Matt Shelb during the 15th June edition of Fox News America. \"That's the problem with all these things, the anger you see coming from the left. There was no anger over Barack Obama separating children from adults.\" While Obama &apos; s approach to migration was not without controversy, it is simply incorrect to say that it has a policy to separate families. Let's summarize Trump's policy on what the Trump administration is doing, before we move on to Obama's dealing with migration. In April, Attorney General Jeff announced a \"no tolerance\" policy, which means that every person arrested crossing the border illegally will be prosecuted by the federal courts. There are a large number of these adult immigrants who travel with children. Under the law, when adults are detained and criminally prosecuted, their children cannot be accommodated with them in prison. Instead, children are placed in a shelter under the Ministry of Health and Human Services until they are released to a legal guardian. Some 2,000 children were separated from adults with whom they were travelling across the United States border, according to the latest figures from the Department of Homeland Security. Children were separated from 1,940 adults from 19 April to 31 May as a result of cross-border trials. The Obama immigration experts with whom we spoke said that Obama's policies led to some family separations, but rarely relatively so, and not close to Tramp's management rate. ( Speaking on behalf of the Ministry of Internal Security, the Obama Administration said that there were no more separated families at the border.) \"Obama generally refrained from prosecuting cases involving adults crossing the border with their children,\" said Peter Margolis, a professor of immigration law and national security law at Roger Williams University, Law School. \"In contrast, the current administration has chosen to prosecute adults across borders, even when they have children. This is an option -- a radically different choice from that made by Obama and the two former Presidents of both sides.\" Dennis Gilman, Professor of Law who runs the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas Law School, said that immigration lawyers \"from time to time\" saw separate families under Obama's administration. \"In any case, these families are usually reunified quickly once they have been identified,\" she said, \"even if it means releasing one of the parents from adult detention.\" In the case of Trump, family separation is a feature of border management policies, not an insect, as stated by David Fitzgerald, who is co-directed by the Centre for Comparative Migration Studies. \"The separation of the family is not the small-scale side effect of border policy, but a deliberate initiative.\" He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2021, former Obama officials in recent interviews made a clear distinction between Trump's policy and that of his predecessors. The current approach to Trump management is modelled on the simplification process, the 2005 programme under George W. Bush, according to Obama Erik Schultz. The main difference was that, while the 2005 programme had brought all illegal immigrants to trial, it had made exceptions for adults travelling with children. J. Johnson, Minister of Homeland Security of Obama from 2013 to the end of his term of office, said that such secessions had occurred in rare cases, but never as a policy. \"I can't say that never happened. There may have been some urgent cases, some emergency,\" said Johnson NPR 9 June. \"There may have been some doubt as to whether the adult accompanying the child is actually the father of the child. I cannot say that it never happened - but not as a matter of policy or practice. It's not something I can ask the border patrol or immigration officers to do.\" Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, Supreme Adviser for Internal Policy, Obama, stated that the Obama administration weighs briefly between the separation of parents and children, before deciding against them. \"I remember looking at each other like, \"We wouldn't do that, would we? We spent five minutes thinking about it and we concluded it was a bad idea,\" said The New York Times. \"Ethically clear.\" \"That's not who we are.\" Andrew Sealy, President of the Institute for Migration Policy, said that, as a deterrent, the Obama administration had begun to prosecute those who had been deported at least once. \"But very few of these people crossed with the children, so they didn't become a visible issue,\" he said. \"There was some separation of children and some regression by immigrant advocacy groups about it, but numbers were very limited. \"The idea of trying people crossing the border illegally the first time they were arrested is entirely new,\" added. \"So we've never seen children separated from their parents on anything close to this level before.\" There is no doubt that Obama &apos; s immigration policy was not debatable. In 2014, in the midst of the influx of asylum-seekers from Central America, the Department established large family detention centres to detain parents and children - perhaps indefinitely - as a means of deterring other migrants. This practice eventually lost a legal appeal which led to a decision in 2016 prohibiting families from being detained together. Shellab told us that his claim indicates that Obama and Trump are bound by the same procedures prohibiting family detention. However, Schlap &apos; s complete comment gives the misleading impression that Trump basically continues Obama &apos; s policy, while Trump &apos; s zero tolerance policy is in fact quite different. \"The same way Barack Obama did,\" said the Governor Schlap. In particular, Obama &apos; s immigration policy sought to avoid the disintegration of families. While some children were separated from their parents during the Obama era, this was relatively rare, and occurred at a much lower rate than in the Trump era, where the practice stems from the zero tolerance approach to illegal border crossing.
