Beach Drive in Fox Point, an upscale suburb in Milwaukee County.\nGronik\u2019s Twitter account and campaign website also say he lives in Fox Point, where his home has an assessed value of $1.4 million.\nBut Gronik portrayed himself as much more urban at a May 13, 2018, education forum for the Democratic candidates for governor, which was co-hosted by the Milwaukee teachers union and partly focused on central city kids. He went so far as to say:\n\"I\u2019ve lived (in Milwaukee) all 61 years of my life.\"\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nWhen it comes to living in Fox Point or Milwaukee, Gronik seems to want it both ways.\n\u2018Our neighborhood\u2019 in MKE\nGronik and lawyer Matt Flynn were the only candidates on the dais at one point during the forum, which was held at a theater on Milwaukee\u2019s east side -- where Flynn has lived for nearly 40 years.\nIn a wide-open primary contest with a crowded field, connecting with voters in heavily Democratic Milwaukee is important.\nGronik and Flynn were asked their position on choice (also known as voucher) schools, which are focused on central city Milwaukee families who are unhappy with their neighborhood public schools, not suburban families.\nFlynn made it a point to say he is the only gubernatorial candidate who lives in the city.\nWhen it was his turn, Gronik said he would gradually wind down voucher schools in the city -- and suggested he lives in Milwaukee.\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGronik said:\nSo, for me as governor, I\u2019m going to focus resources on public schools -- and hear me on this -- stop the expansion of vouchers, sunset those things over five years. We have a real plan to make it happen. But I\u2019m going to also make sure that we\u2019re not taking any kid out of a productive learning environment until that school in their neighborhood is the best choice. \nI want to put it in just stark terms here, because I did speak to parents all throughout our neighborhood in Milwaukee. And I\u2019ll give it to you in just blank terms here. Black families are sick of white people telling them where to send their kids to school; that\u2019s just the reality. So I am going to be a governor that\u2019s going to fight for every kid. We have lost generations -- \u00a0generations of children -- and we\u2019re not losing another generation on my watch.\nSo, in the context of choice schools in the city, Gronik says he \"did speak to parents throughout our neighborhood in Milwaukee.\" And the neighborhoods that he refers to as having \"lost generations\" of children are in Milwaukee.\nNot his neighborhood in Fox Point.\n\u2018I\u2019ve lived here\u2019\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few minutes later, responding to a question about supporting unions for teachers, Gronik again gave the impression he lives in the city, saying:\nWe need to make sure that we restore teachers\u2019 voices in that classroom, (that) we spend more one-on-one time with those kids, that we have the resources to help kids that are at-risk; that before we lose another generation of children in my neighborhood, too -- I\u2019ve lived here all 61 years of my life. And I\u2019ve watched what\u2019s happened with kids throughout these neighborhoods, our neighborhoods, kids that do not have the kind of bright future that they should have. It\u2019s a huge reason I\u2019m here.\nAgain, Gronik\u2019s reference to a lost generation, and to kids lacking a bright future, is to kids in the city, not \"in my neighborhood\" in Fox Point.\n\n\n\n\nLatest Gronik fact checks:\n\"Black Americans still earn less than 73 percent of what white men make.\" Half True.\nWisconsin 'guaranteeing' nearly $3 billion to Foxconn with no job guarantees. Half True.\nScott Walker \"has taken money away from internet expansion in our state.\" Mostly False.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nHis explanation\nGronik promptly called us when we told his campaign spokesman that we would be fact checking his claim that he\u2019s lived in Milwaukee his whole life. He started off by acknowledging that he grew up in Glendale, another Milwaukee County suburb, and lives in Fox Point.\nGronik also told us:\n1. \"As you well know, when I plug in my ZIP code (53217), it says Milwaukee.\"\nIf you run a Google search of Gronik\u2019s street address, depending on the website you choose, some responses show Fox Point while others show Milwaukee.\nBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Gronik lives in Fox Point, not Milwaukee.\n2. \"I consider Milwaukee to be my hometown. I\u2019m not trying to suggest that I grew up other than where I grew up.\"\nGronik is trying to have it both ways -- saying he\u2019s from Milwaukee, but not denying that he grew up in a suburb (and now lives in another suburb).\n3. \"I\u2019ve never made any bones about the fact that I live in Fox Point. I really think that you\u2019re splitting hairs. I am in no way, shape or form misleading anybody as to my address. But I do consider everyone in Milwaukee County to be part of my community.\"\nIf Gronik were asked in an airport in Atlanta where he lives, saying Milwaukee would be fine; most people have not heard of Fox Point.\nBut in speaking to Milwaukee teachers about Milwaukee schools, to say you\u2019re from the city when you really live in a high-income suburb, is misleading.\nOur rating\nGronik told an audience made up largely of Milwaukee teachers at an education forum in Milwaukee: \"I\u2019ve lived here (in Milwaukee) all 61 years of my life.\"\nGronik acknowledged to us that he grew up in one Milwaukee suburb, Glendale, and now lives in another, upscale Fox Point.\n\"Milwaukee\" as sort of a blanket term for the city and its close-in suburbs is not entirely wrong. But in the context of Gronik\u2019s claim, it\u2019s misleading.\nWe rate his statement Mostly False.
