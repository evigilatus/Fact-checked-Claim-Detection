Runoffs occur when no candidate draws more than 50 percent of the primary vote.\n\nHirsch said the information on Dewhurst\u2019s spreadsheet was drawn from historical election returns kept by the state.\n\nAccording to Dewhurst\u2019s spreadsheet, 13 statewide GOP Texas primaries led to runoffs from 1998 through 2010. By phone, Hirsch told us the party had no statewide runoffs in 1992, 1994 or 1996, though we later confirmed there were runoffs in 1996.\n\nAnd of the statewide Republican primaries that led to runoffs, four fit the Dewhurst campaign\u2019s conditions, according to the spreadsheet. That is, three judicial primaries and a primary for a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission involved candidates garnering more than 43 percent of the primary vote who later won their runoffs.\n\nIn four of the other GOP primaries resulting in runoffs, the candidate who led the primary won the runoff, according to the spreadsheet. Yet five GOP primary leaders -- including 1998 attorney general hopeful Barry Williamson -- lost their runoff. Two eventual losers carried 38 percent of the primary vote and one drew nearly 43 percent \u2013 not quite the \"over 43 percent\" figure aired in the Dewhurst campaign\u2019s memo. Dewhurst\u2019s spreadsheet shows that in a 2002 Texas Supreme Court primary, Elizabeth Ray drew nearly 42.92 percent of the vote to Dale Wainwright\u2019s 31 percent. Ray lost the runoff, however, drawing 45 percent to Wainwright\u2019s 55 percent.\n\nOnline recaps posted by the Texas secretary of state, which oversees election returns, confirmed the campaign\u2019s examples of runoffs won by individuals who earlier drew over 43 percent of the primary vote. Specifically, Paul Womack, running for a spot on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, drew nearly 45 percent of the 2002 primary vote and won the runoff with nearly 57 percent. Also that year, Tom Price drew 47 percent in the primary and 57 percent in the runoff. In 2004, Victor Carrillo, running for the railroad commission, carried nearly 50 percent of the primary vote, 63 percent in his runoff. And in 2006, Charles Holcomb won 45 percent of the primary vote for a Court of Criminal Appeals seat, drawing 54 percent in the runoff.\n\nOur review of each primary since 1992 unearthed three 1996 Court of Criminal Appeals runoffs not on Dewhurst\u2019s spreadsheet. One of these runoff winners, Price, prevailed after barely trailing -- by 30.53 percent to 30.35 percent -- in the primary.\n\nBottom line: Four primaries resulting in runoffs neatly match up with the Dewhurst camp\u2019s conditions.In contrast, a dozen primaries resulting in runoffs do not perfectly fit the parameters because the leader in the primary carried 43 percent or less of the vote, meaning he or she fared worse than Dewhurst in the 2012 primary -- and half of these other primary winners won the runoff, while half lost.\n\nOur ruling\n\nWe are not judging the predictive value of Dewhurst\u2019s claim, which would be speculative beyond the bounds of a backward-looking fact check.\n\nFor instance, skeptics might stress that only four of the 16 GOP statewide primary-runoff combinations from 1992 through 2010 fully support Dewhurst's claim. Half of the remaining dozen primary leaders lost the runoffs.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden \u201chas issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut another way, however, there are no instances since 1992 of a Texas Republican candidate for statewide office drawing more than 43 percent of the primary vote and losing the runoff, which is Dewhurst\u2019s point.\n\nWe rate the claim as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11006"}
