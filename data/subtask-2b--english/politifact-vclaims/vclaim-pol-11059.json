At the end of his speech, Booker, talking about \"the carnage that happens when we fail to live up to the promise of this nation,\" told a story about the death of a boy he knew when he first took office in 2006.\n\nWhile recounting that story, Booker stopped himself and said: \"I know the data. I see what's happening to young minority men in this country. I see how much, when looking from a financial perspective how much we as taxpayers pay, billions of dollars in New Jersey for a prison system or correctional system that doesn't correct. Recycling the same people over and over and over again. A prison system that is 61 percent African-American even though our state is just 13 percent black.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey checked Booker\u2019s statistics on the state\u2019s prison population and found that he knows the data well.\n\nNew Jersey housed 23,810 people in all of its correctional facilities, including halfway houses and county jails, as of Jan. 3, according to data from the state department of corrections.\n\nOf those nearly 24,000 offenders, 61 percent, or 14,469 people, are black. By comparison, 22 percent, or 5,300 inmates, are white and 16 percent, or 3,785 inmates, are Hispanic.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s prison population, excluding offenders held in a facility for women and another facility for adult male sex offenders, is smaller, with 15,407 inmates. Of that population, 62 percent are black.\n\nHow does the racial makeup of the state\u2019s prison population compare with the state\u2019s overall population?\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, 13.7 percent of New Jersey\u2019s population is black.\n\nSo Booker\u2019s numbers are right. But we wondered how New Jersey compares with the rest of the nation.\n\nBased on estimates from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, nearly 38 percent of prisoners under state and federal jurisdiction at the end of 2010 were black. According to the same data, about 32 percent of prisoners were white and more than 22 percent were Hispanic. The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than one year.\n\nOverall, 12.6 percent of the U.S. population is black, according to 2010 census data.\n\nJohn M. Paitakes, professor of criminal justice at Seton Hall University, said there are many factors behind these statistics, citing prior records and legal representation. He also noted that profiling and prejudice could be factors, but said, \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any more in New Jersey than in other areas.\"\n\n\"I think before you draw any conclusions you have to look at all those factors to get a realistic picture of what it is,\" he said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBooker said New Jersey\u2019s prison system is \"61 percent African-American even though our state is just 13 percent black.\"\n\nData from the state corrections department and U.S. Census Bureau back his statistics.\n\nWe rate the claim True.\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11059"}
