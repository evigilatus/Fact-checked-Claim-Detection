We revised our classification from \"true\" to \"real half\" and saved the previous version here. In the third presidential debate, Marco Rubio faced a question about many lost votes in Congress. He asked CBBC why he didn't care and do more before he was sent to the Oval Office. Rubio basically said the country didn't have time to wait for him. Rubio said, \"See this broadcast tonight, there are millions of people living their salary to pay.\" \"They work as hard as they've ever done, everything costs more and hasn't been increased for decades. You have small businesses in America struggling. For the first time in 35 years, we have more business closed than the beginning, as he said. Rubio spoke of the birth and death of businesses before. It was accurate at some point, based on census data, and we assessed the validity of the claim in June 2015. We evaluated the statement correctly on the night of the discussion as well. But an alert reader called us to say that the census had published more data than we considered in our original report. So we decided to check it out. The United States Census Bureau collects data on births and deaths as part of a project called Business Dynamic Statistics. The figures go back to 1977. From this starting point until 2008 and the large recession, new companies appear each year more visible than existing ones that go away. In the three years from 2009 to 2011, this trend has been reversed. The number of deaths was higher than the number of births. The Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, published a report in May 2014 entitled \"Unlocking the Business Dynamics in the United States: A View of the United States and the Metro.\" The authors used census office data but the data they used at that time passed only during 2011. The most recent data are now going through 2013, the most important of which is that the tide has changed in 2012. In that year, the country experienced net gains of some 36,000 companies and, in 2013, a small but still positive increase of just over 5,000 new companies. It should be noted that the difference for 2013 is very small. This graph, which is based on business dynamics statistics in the Census Bureau, shows the decline and the flow. When the Blue Line is above the Red Line, fixed births are greater than fixed deaths. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, we contacted Ian Hathaway, a co-author of the report. Hathaway confirmed the latest data and provided an updated table. \"Now we have data for 2012 and 2013, both of which show more births than deaths,\" said Hathaway. \"Robio's information is old.\" This does not mean that companies are born in anything close to the passage the country has seen in recent years. Between 1978 and 2007 (the recession began in December 2007), an average of some 497,000 new companies emerged each year. The average for 2012 and 2013 is about 409,000. The pace of growth is therefore much slower, but the net figure may not be in the negative area described by Rubio. 2014 data are not available. It should be noted that the number of closed companies has remained fairly stable. The average since 1978 is approximately 390,000 per year. In 2013, about 400,000 had closed their doors. We've reached out to Rubio's campaign, and we haven't heard a reply. Our rule, Rubio, said, \"For the first time in 35 years, we have more dead jobs than we start.\" In the latter period of 2014, researchers reached this conclusion in view of census office data from 2009-11. This is the information that Rubio is likely to rely on in making his claim. However, more up-to-date information on the census indicates that the trend has been reversed and that in 2012 and 2013, more businesses began to close. The balance is very narrow in 2013 and we do not have figures for 2014 or 2015. We're assessing this claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05802"}
