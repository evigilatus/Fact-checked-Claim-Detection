Look beyond the Senate debate in Iowa on September 28, 2014, between the Republic of Johnny Ernest and the Democratic Bruce Braley. During the public participation segment of the debate, a local university student named Jake asked Ernest this question: \"You said you wanted to abolish the Ministry of Education. What are the implications for students receiving Bill's scholarships and federal student loans?\" Here's Ernest's response. \"Thank you, Jake, that's a great question. It does not do anything to those who receive Bill's scholarships and student loans. These are very necessary programs for college students, but they can be easily accommodated in the Treasury Department. Now, when it comes to the Ministry of Education, 94 per cent of those employed in the Federal Ministry of Education were considered by the Ministry as non-essential employees. So I'd rather see the dollars that go to these non-essential employees being directed to the states so that they can be used by our managers and teachers to make sure that our students in Iowa receive a great education.\" Is Ernest right that 94% of the employees in the Department of Education \"considered them non-essential\"? Her campaign was no longer an investigation, but we took a closer look. First, some background. The government stops working when a certain kind of federal funding stops flowing -- the money that Congress adopts. Bills are supposed to be passed annually, although the clash between Congress and the President in recent years has made it happen irregularly. This occurred most recently from 1 October 2013 to 16 October 2013, when Congressional Republicans refused to fund President Barack Obama &apos; s health-care law and Obama refused to sign spending bills unless they included funding for the law. There's an atom of right supporting Ernest's claim. During 2013, the Ministry of Education authorized 3,983 employees from a workforce of 4,195. This represents 94.9 per cent of all staff of the Section. However, the employees were not considered \"unnecessary.\" While the term \"non-essential personnel\" has been used in the media in the past to describe federal employees who were cleared during the closure, the term has not been formally used to describe employees. The word \"unnecessary,\" which has been used since a memorandum issued in 1980 by the Office of Administrative and Budgetary Questions, has been applied to activities, not to staff. The conditions of the employees themselves are \"exempt/unexempt\" or \"exempt/non-exempt.\" More importantly, the way Ernest uses the term \"unnecessary\" - which suggests that the staff section classifies them as employees and that their salaries are better converted into government education budgets - is misleading. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2021. What prevents an employee from taking leave while the government closes is to perform \"emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" (Some federal employees could continue to work because their salaries were paid in full from user fees or trust funds and, as a result, were not delayed by the outstanding expenditure bill). Few employees of the Ministry of Education save lives or guard property. The department &apos; s budget is highly weighted towards paying student loans and providing aid and supervision to state schools. It has the lowest number of employees in any federal government ministry. (The number of staff in the smallest department, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, is double the number of staff. Since much of what the Department is doing is writing cheques, it is not surprising that 94 per cent of its staff have been dismissed; neither life nor property is at risk. If the word \"essential\" is defined only as saving lives or protecting property, most of the United States business will be classified in the \"non-core\" camp. David Beals, Professor of Education at Iowa University, said Ernest was \"at best and perhaps much worse.\" Palgota, Vice-President for Public Policy with the Public Service Partnership, agreed. He said: \"The law does not indicate whether an employee's work is important, meaningful and/or valuable to the agency's mission.\" One last observation: Remember when Ernest said, \"I'd rather see the dollars that go to these non-essential employees head to the states so that they can be used by our managers and teachers to make sure that our students in Iowa get a great education\"? Well, the money provided by \"non-core\" employees wouldn't do much to help schools on the front lines. If approximately 4,000 employees are magically transferred from the Ministry of Education to government or local educational posts, they will increase the number of education staff at state and local levels by a small 4/100 per cent, according to our calculations from the Labour Statistics Office. The Governor, Ernest, said, \"94% of those who work for the Federal Department of Education were considered by the Ministry as non-essential employees.\" While it is true that 94% of its employees were cleared by the Ministry of Education during the 2013 government closure, these employees were not called \"unnecessary\" in official documents and were not \"unnecessary\" in any occasional definition of the word. The Ministry of Education &apos; s leave rate was 94 per cent because its employees were not saving lives or protecting property - the exemption standard. The allegation contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, so it is often wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07231"}
