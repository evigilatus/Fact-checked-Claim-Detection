In view of his high role in the General Assembly in Missouri, we thought that the time had come to consider his recent priorities. Rhoden sent his annual legislative mail, which included four bills under the main section of legislative achievements. One such project was the Housing Bill 1991, also known as the Law on Publication of Uniform Small Telecommunications Facilities. In the post, he claims that HB 1991, which has passed the last legislative cycle, \"it is expected to create more than 20,000 jobs and attract $2 billion in capital investment, resulting in nearly $4 billion in economic growth over the next few years. Bolift Vack can't predict the future, but we wanted to check if his numbers were consistent with analysts' expectations. It appears to be from the telecommunications industry itself. What is small cell technology? As wireless technology advances towards mobile fifth-generation technology (5G), the infrastructure for the use of these systems has also advanced. :: Berkeley Tiati, General Affairs Specialist of the National Congress of State Legislatures, provided us with an update on how small cell technology works. \"The small cells, which generate less energy, collect and transmit signals in a short range of each other,\" according to the latest article of the 5G Act and the small cells in NCSL. But to use this technology in fact, small cells must be spread by radio and telecommunications companies across communities in Missouri and throughout the United States. These cells are usually associated with existing structures, such as power poles on the side of roads. The draft law, which was signed into law on 1 June, supplements the laws relating to the wireless infrastructure in Missouri that will enable the installation of small cells. It makes specific provisions on how communities and telecommunication providers can work together to bring 5G radios into their communities. A large part of that infrastructure will begin to emerge next year. On January 17, 2021, in an interview with Fox News, President Donald Trump said, \"He can't say anything (about riots in the American Capitol Building) because the platforms removed it.\" We contacted Rodin, whose team referred to us as the 2017 Axentor study, which estimates the economic impact of the total deployment of 5G to cities throughout Missouri and the United States. ...................................................................................................................................................... Fifty cities were selected in Missouri, including Kansas and St. Louis. Petri told us that despite the use of the city formula, not the entire state, it is possible to estimate the benefit to Missouri by bringing together 50 cities studied. When the amount is combined, it is consistent with Rodin &apos; s claim. Network investment, or \"capital investment,\" as Rodin calls it, amounts to $2.097 billion, slightly higher than his claim. The estimated GDP growth is $3.888 billion, which remains under its demand for an economic growth of $4 billion. The creation of posts is estimated at 23,841, or approximately 4,000 posts above its claim. We were told by Doug Brac, Director of Broadband and Spectrointestinal Policy of the ICT Foundation, that these figures seem to be on the optimistic side of what is possible of this kind of legislation, but they are not beyond possibility. He cautioned, however, that the figures in the study were estimates based on all the benefits of the spread of 5G, such as smart networks, optimal use of transport, monitoring of infrastructure, and not just the deployment of small cells themselves. He said: \"The small cell bill improves the conditions to achieve that spread, but the two are not the same.\" The total figures for the study show a similar positive view of Missouri across the United States. The total investment of the network is expected to be about $275 billion and the projected economic growth of $500 billion from the deployment of five Gs. However, the effects vary considerably depending on the mandate, depending on its current wireless infrastructure and relevant legislation. The governor Caleb Rodin said that \"the small cell bill is expected to create more than 20,000 jobs and attract $2 billion in capital investment, Rhoden relies on an estimated 50 cities in Missouri to look at the situation in relation to the total prevalence of 5G, not just the legislation of small cells. However, Rodin's figures are often accurate for study, beyond his claim, given the benefits of the spread of 5G as a whole, and not just the deployment of small cells. Basically, the bill opens up more than 20,000 jobs, $2 billion in capital investment and $4 billion in economic growth, but it will not be the only reason. For these reasons, his statement is half correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01218"}
