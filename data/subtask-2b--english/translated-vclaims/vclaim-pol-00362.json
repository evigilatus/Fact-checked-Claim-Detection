Criminal justice reform ranks high among its priorities. \"People of every race use illicit drugs at similar rates, yet African-Americans are more vulnerable to imprisonment than whites,\" says on its website for its campaign. \"African Americans are three or four times more likely to be arrested for drug offences and nine times more likely to be imprisoned.\" We asked whether their statistics were correct. On July 26, Beyom Coleman told us that the campaign worker published them and that she did not know their sources. She will contact us again with more information, but we have heard nothing from her. We got to her again on August 2, and she said she'd call us back. This call didn't come from his writing. So, we left alone. Drug abuse and arrests may have referred to data in the 2014 National Research Council report on \"The growth of the prison in the United States: exploring causes and consequences.\" Pages 60 and 61 focus on drug offences. This study has not been updated. The report states: \"The prevalence of drug abuse among blacks is slightly higher than whites for some illicit drugs and slightly lower for some illicit drugs; the difference is not significant. There is also little evidence, when all kinds of drugs are considered, that blacks often sell drugs more than whites.\" This is consistent with data from the National Drug Abuse and Health Survey 2017, conducted by the Department of Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services. It found that 11.8 per cent of whites and 13.7 per cent of blacks 18 or more said that they had been using illicit drugs over the past month. The report of the National Research Council states: \"In recent years, the rate of arrests of blacks for drugs has been three or four times higher than that of whites. In the late 1980s, the rates were six times higher for blacks than for whites.\" Marco Rubio stated on January 27, 2021 in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World you do not see this routine use to prosecute former leaders.\" These figures are hard to find. In similar fact-finding exercises, Polyte Fact was transformed into Nazgul Gandenosh, a research analyst for the sentencing project, an advocacy group in Washington. It noted racist breakdowns by the Office of Judicial Statistics on the number of persons in prison for drug offences. These numbers aren't perfect for our comparison. For example, state prison data contain only a list of prisoners based on their most serious crimes, so a person who is also convicted of a drug offence may not be included in that category if the person is given a longer sentence for assault. We compared the latest data of the Office with estimates of the ethnic population by the United States Census Bureau and found that the rate of black imprisonment for drug offences towards the end of 2016 was 6.45 times higher than the rate of whites. This is close to confirming in the Anti-Narcotics Agency's Criminal Justice Fact Sheet that \"the rate of African-American drug imprisonment is almost six times that of whites.\" The statistics are neither dated nor exported. In Virginia, blacks were imprisoned for drug offences at a rate of 6.1 times that of whites at the beginning of 2019. According to an ethnic breakdown of prisoners whose most serious drug-related crimes were sent to us by the State Ministry of Corrections, compared with the census estimates. \"American Africans are three to four times more likely to be arrested for drug offences, and more than nine times more likely to be imprisoned,\" says our judgment, Benom Coleman. No sources have been provided for this statement. It is at stake that blacks are three or four times more likely to be arrested for drug offences, which corresponds to the findings of a study conducted by the National Research Council in 2014 that has not yet been updated. There is clearly a huge imbalance in prison rates between black and white in relation to drug offences, but not nine times greater for blacks claimed by Phnom Coleman. Our research shows that it was 6.45 times larger in 2016 - the latest statistics are available in the year. In Virginia, it was 6.1 times higher for blacks at the beginning of 2019. In general, we evaluate her claim mostly correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00362"}
