Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla.), and whip up an air of illicit love and it\u2019s not hard to assemble clickbait gold.\nIf you can suspend all common sense, that is.\nThe website Freedomcrossroads.us -- topped by a patriotic flag, a bald eagle, and the motto, \"AMERICA -- LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT!\" -- recently ran an article headlined, \"BREAKING: The Democrat James Comey Has Been Having An Affair With Was JUST REVEALED! (DETAILS).\"\nThe article posits that the website has uncovered an affair lasting at least eight months between Comey and Wasserman Schultz. (For the record, both are married.)\nLet\u2019s get quickly to the bottom line: This allegation is complete and utter hooey.\nWe are fact-checking it because Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to fight fake news.\nAs of July 7, 2017, the post had been shared 2,200 times. A reprinted version at a separate site, thelastlineofdefense.org, prompted additional shares.\nComey\u2019s paramour, according to the article, is \"none other than the DISGRACED former Chair of the DNC, Debbie \"Whiny Democrat\" Wasserman Schultz \u2014 talk about a match made in Heave\u2026 errrrr\u2026 Hell! These two dimwits were probably attracted to each other because they are both LOSERS who can\u2019t accept defeat, but that doesn\u2019t really differentiate them from the rest of the crybaby Democrat Party, now does it?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe website cites \"our exclusive sources\" to support the idea that the two \"couldn\u2019t put aside their lust for each other and decided to have an affair. Not exactly shocking, considering they\u2019re two liberal sickos \u2014 and we all know, ANYTHING goes for them.\"\nThe article suggests that Comey\u2019s criticism of Trump, the man who fired him, stems from a desire to \"impress his GIRLFRIEND. Pathetic.\"\nNeither Comey\u2019s nor Wasserman Schultz\u2019s camp commented for this article, but debunking this item is straightforward: Freedomcrossroads.us is a self-styled parody site that operates for clicks that earn advertising money.\nIts modus operandi is to troll social media users susceptible to believing overheated conservative rhetoric.\nAt the bottom of the home page, the site says, \"We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won\u2019t find any of it here.\"\nOn another page, the site informs readers, \"Freedom Crossroads is a magical place where patriots and God-fearing, Trump-loving Americans can go to find like-minded friends, read all about the buzz in the conservative community and be a part of the revolution to make America great again.\"\nThe site, it says, \"uses facts that don\u2019t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth. In fact, there is likely no truth at all in what you will read here. All of our articles are basically a crock of doody and should be considered satirical whimsies for today\u2019s aging conservative. All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations.\"\nSuch disclaimers, however, are nowhere to be found on the actual article page, which makes it easy for some readers to miss the joke.\nOur ruling\nFreedomcrossroads.us published an article that said \"James Comey Has Been Having An Affair With\" Debbie Wasserman Schultz. As the website itself acknowledges on another page, this is all a \"crock of doody.\" Only one rating fits: Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2017-07-10 16:11:50 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says \"James Comey Has Been Having An Affair With\" Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
