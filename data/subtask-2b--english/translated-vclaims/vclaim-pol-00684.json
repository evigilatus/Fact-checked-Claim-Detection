The Paiden campaign did not immediately respond to an e-mail from Poletti Fruitte asking whether the quote was correct. We didn't find him either. He called himself optimistic before. In 2010, for example, when he gave a speech about American-Israeli relations, he was talking about \"the prospects for peace,\" not about the Second World War. Or in October 2018, when he was speaking at Yongstown State University in Ohio. \"I'm optimistic,\" Vindicator quotes him as he says. \"I'm optimistic because I know the history of this country's journey, we've always had faith in the ability of ordinary people to do extraordinary things.\" But we found no evidence that Baiden never blamed Germany for blowing up Pearl Harbor. (Japan is responsible.) When we looked for a quote regarding Joe Baiden in Niixes, a news story database, there were no results. In our search for news stories linking the previous convoy to Germany and Pearl Harbor, we found cases of other politicians mistaken in the history of the attack. In 2012, Keith Ellison, then a member of the Minnesota Congress, said, \"They attacked Pearl Harbor\" on Fox News, as Bill O'Reily spoke about Nazi Germany. In 2017, President Donald Trump misquoted Franklin D. Roosevelt, who on 8 December 1941 called the bombing a day earlier \"a date that will live in shame.\" In the same year, Melania Trump echoed the attack and said that it occurred in November before the message was republished in the right date, and then the Pol\u00edtico newspaper was published. We also found the 2014 Christian Science Watch story wondering whether Joe Biden is John Peloshi of the Democratic Party. In so doing, the editor-in-chief of Washington Peter Greer quotes an interesting speech by Beluchi in his role, often quoted as John Pluto Blutersky in \"The Animal House.\" Greer writes: With Democrats on the verge of shrinking the vote, Mr. Biden played the role of a challenger this weekend. He sat down with Gloria Burger from CNN and said that he didn't buy all the predictions that showed that the global system was making great gains. \"I don't agree with probabilities,\" said Paden. \"I expect we'll keep the Senate.\" Okay, so Joe wasn't as excited as John Belucci in his famous speech \"The Animal House.\" \"Nothing ends until we decide it! Did it end when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? No!\" We're assessing this Facebook mail pants on fire!
