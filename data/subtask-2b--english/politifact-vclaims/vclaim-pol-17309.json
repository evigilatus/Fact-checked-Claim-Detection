Oil and gas has long been a primary driver of Texas\u2019 prosperity, but does its share of the state economy remain at 35% even after a historically tumultuous year?\nThree tiers of economic analysis\nDetermining the oil and gas\u2019 industry\u2019s share of the state economy \"is a hard number to pin down,\" said Jesse Thompson, senior business economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThere\u2019s a multitude of ways an industry\u2019s economic impact can be measured, Thompson said. Impact could be an industry\u2019s share of a state\u2019s gross state product, or the number of jobs it creates, or the amount of income it generates, or some combination of the three.\u00a0\nFurthermore, there are three different levels upon which economists analyze economic impact: an industry\u2019s direct, indirect and induced effects on the economy. Direct effects include the revenue generated by oil and gas companies; indirect effects include the businesses supplying equipment or services to those oil and gas companies; and induced effects include the spending of people in the industry as a result of increased personal income.\u00a0\nFor example, induced impacts could include an interior decorator in Houston who is hired by an oil and gas employee.\n\"There\u2019s a lot of very reasonable ways to break this up, that\u2019s why there\u2019s not necessarily a right answer,\" Thompson said.\nDirect impacts are the most straightforward measurement. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a federal agency, the oil and gas sector directly comprised around 15% of the state\u2019s gross state product between 2019 and early 2020. That share fell to around 14.2% as the coronavirus swept the globe and forced the industry to shed jobs and shut down drilling rigs in the second quarter of 2020, the latest period for which economic data is available.\nAccording to Craddick\u2019s spokesperson, the 35% figure Craddick cited represents the oil and gas sector\u2019s direct impacts to the gross state product combined with its indirect and induced impacts. The 35% figure is also a projection for how the year will end after the industry\u2019s bounce back from its April nadir.\u00a0\n\"We have seen improvements throughout the remainder of the year, so the number is definitely going to land somewhere between 30% and 40%, so 35% was an easy middle point,\" said Craddick\u2019s Director of Public Affairs Mia Hutchens.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain indicators are already showing the sector\u2019s recovery. The Texas rig count has shown a slight uptick since October corresponding with an improving global demand for oil and natural gas. After nearly 60,000 oil workers lost their jobs between February and August, around 2,100 jobs were added in September and October, according to the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association. The association\u00a0also projects that, by year's end, the industry will be supporting at least 300,000 direct jobs and 2.1 million indirect jobs in Texas.\nThe 35% projection was calculated using data from the Texas comptrollers office, the Texas Pipeline Association and the Texas Oil and Gas Association, the sector\u2019s largest industry group in the state, according to Hutchens.\u00a0\nAt the beginning of 2020, before COVID-19 had reached all corners of the globe, the Texas Oil and Gas Association pegged the industry\u2019s share of Texas\u2019 gross state product at 30.5%. According to a spokesperson, the trade group\u00a0determined that number by finding the sum of the industry\u2019s direct contributions to Texas\u2019 gross state product\u00a0\u2014 $223.1 billion, or about 13.5% of the state economy.\u00a0\nThen, to capture the industry\u2019s indirect and induced \"ripple\" effects, the Oil and Gas Association multiplied the industry\u2019s direct gross state product by 2.3, meaning that every dollar spent in the industry was modeled to generate $2.30 in\u00a0spin-off economic activity. This multiplier produces an estimated $502.6 billion of economic impact in the state, or 30.5% of the private sector\u2019s gross state product.\nTo Karr Ingham, a petroleum economist with the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, the association's method of calculation using a multiplier of 2.3 is \"pretty close to correct.\"\n\"That\u2019s not high. If anything that could be a touch low,\" Ingham said. \"I\u2019ve heard commissioners in the past and other political types and other industry cheerleaders say the multiplier for oil and gas is 7.\"\nUnderperforming years\nBefore the pandemic, Texas producers were coming off a couple of down\u00a0years in 2018 and 2019.\nIn 2018, about four years after the global oil prices collapsed and slammed the brakes on Texas\u2019 fracking boom, the industry was hampered by a credit crunch as lackluster oil prices remained volatile. By mid-2019, oil jobs were in decline as companies struggled to provide steady income and growth.\n\"It\u2019s been the worst-performing sector on the S&P for the last couple years,\" said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. \"If you take the value of all the producers and add them together, by 2019 they collectively were worth less than Apple.\"\nAccording to Gilmer, there are \"at least three tough quarters in front of us\" before the industry will begin to reassert itself and shake off lasting effects of the pandemic.\u00a0\n\"By the time we get to 2022 \u2014 and it will take that long for us to feel really good about the economy \u2014 oil and the U.S. economy will be back,\" Gilmer said.\nCraddick\u2019s 35% figure reflects the commissioner\u2019s belief that the industry will begin next year stronger than it began 2020. Although several indicators point to an upward trajectory of the industry \u2014 like oil prices, jobs, and rig count \u2014 Karr said the 35% projection may be slightly optimistic.\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s a little hard to take issue with [Craddick\u2019s number] just because it\u2019s guesswork,\" Karr said.\nOur ruling\nCraddick said earlier this month that the oil and gas industry comprises 35% of the Texas economy. Craddick's\u00a0office clarified that this figure represented the industry\u2019s combined direct, indirect and induced economic impact, and that it represents a projection of how the industry will end the year after its recent bounce back.\u00a0\nThe oil and gas industry has comprised as much as 40% of the state economy during the last decade\u2019s fracking boom, yet shrunk to 30% before the pandemic shocked the world economy. Firm quarterly data showing the industry\u2019s recent gains will not be released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis until late 2021.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17309"}
