These voters now make up nearly one third of the active voters in the nation - and they may decide to vote in the near race next week's elections. The Democrats are trying to increase the turnout in the voting block, which has traditionally been partially supported by the postman who urges African Americans to vote \"if you want to stop another Ferguson.\" A deal called \"challenging\" and a failed attempt to compare Georgia with the city of Missouri, which was overrun by protests following the shooting of a black teenager, Michael Brown, by a white police officer. \"Georgia elected African American leaders -- mayors, district commissioners, etc. -- more than any other state in the country,\" said the agreement in the story of Atlanta Journal-Document. \"We have a long history of good ethnic relations, and I cannot understand why the Democratic Party of Georgia is trying to destroy it.\" Does the nation's peach nation lead by the number of black elected officials? This is the allegation that yelled for the O-Meter truth test. We started, as we always do, to ask the campaign of agreement where it came from. The woman speaking Jane Talber wrote in an e-mail that \"Georgia has historically been a leader in African American positions,\" citing a 1987 publication that ranked her among the first five states of discrimination. She also referred to the 2013 story in which the President of the Association of Black Elected Officials of Georgia counted 1,000 members in addition to \"the number of the first three states included in the above-mentioned survey.\" However, the GABO website states that the collection is open to members of all races, as well as to candidates and former staff. The membership does not reflect the current number of black elected officials. In an attempt to support the Governor &apos; s statement, Polyte Fruit found similar standards that put Georgia at the highest levels but not at the top. The Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies, a liberal research centre in Washington focusing on race issues, prepared annual reports on the number of black officials in each possible office between 1970 and 2002. These reports have consistently shown that the number of blacks serving in elected positions in the southern states is greater than anywhere else in the country. However, in specific cases, the figures varied. In 2000, when Democrats were still in control of State and domestic politics, Georgia had 582 black elected officials at all levels, as stated by Diane Penderhoggs, a professor of African studies and political science at the University of Notre Dame. By 2002, the last year available, this number had risen to 611. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" The nearby Mississippi has consistently led the nation, with 897 in 2000 and 892 black officials elected in 2002. \"Georgia certainly isn't no. David A. Bossets, Senior Political Analyst at the Center who wrote the annual reports, said. The same applies to the examination of the most recent figures, which include only State and local data, and not all elected posts. Georgia had 452 black leaders in all state and local offices, according to the Gender and Intercultural Leadership Project, which examines demographic characteristics in politics. These figures are based on 2006 data for all offices except the Governor and Deputy Governor, which dates back to 2007. Based on these figures, Louisiana had 467 black elected officials at the time, and Alabama had 498. Mississippi was once again the national leader, with 530 black state and local elected officials. Bossets, now acting as an independent researcher on race issues in politics, said that the most recent data were not available to a large extent because research funding had dried up. However, he cautioned that figures alone were not necessarily something that States should boast. It appears from reports that Mississippi leads largely because it has the highest black population in the country, and therefore has several small jurisdictions with elected leadership from all blacks, as he said. By comparison, Colorado is only 4% black but had two black conservatives and a black speaker from the house in his history. \"I don't think there are any states in the south that can brag about race relations,\" said Bossets. But that is exactly what both sides are doing in the narrow battle for the Governor. Membership in a black political group does not translate into statements in support of the allegation of agreement on the number of black elected officials in Georgia. Nevertheless, both the deal and the PolitiFact found Georgia research, which is consistently inconsistent with his claim. Georgia is consistently classified among the States with the largest number of elected leaders, but was not at the summit. The only thing that prevents this from being completely wrong is the lack of newer data. We're mostly assessing his statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07079"}
