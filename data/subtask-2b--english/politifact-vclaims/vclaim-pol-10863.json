The reason? Year by year, federal revenues haven\u2019t been keeping up with spending, due to the struggling national economy (which has held back tax revenues) and a continuation of tax cuts. And each year there\u2019s an annual deficit, the national debt grows.\n\nThat led to the frequently cited -- and wrongly exaggerated -- claim that the debt has increased more under Obama than under all previous 43 presidents combined.\n\nIt also led to this blog posting by Rep. Jim Renacci, the Republican incumbent facing Democratic incumbent Rep. Betty Sutton in Ohio's newly redrawn 16th congressional district:\n\n\"In less than one term, (Obama has) racked up more debt than any president in history \u2014 over $5 trillion.\"\n\nThe statement interested PolitiFact Ohio because it was less sweeping and more specific than\nmany others.\n\nResponding to our inquiry, Renacci's staff cited a CBS News story from March, which compared the debt growth under Obama's three years and two months in office to eight years under George W. Bush.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2009, the date Obama took office, the debt stood at $10.6 trillion. At the time of the CBS story, it had increased by $4.9 trillion.\n\nBy \u00a0the day Renacci's statement was posted, the Treasury Department's online \"Debt to the Penny\" calculator showed the debt at more than $15.7 trillion -- an increase of $5.1 trillion.\n\nDuring the two terms of the Bush presidency, whose debt exceeded all predecessors, the debt rose $4.899 trillion.\n\nSo Renacci's numbers checked out.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Renacci's statement that Obama \"racked up\" the debt, fails to account for factors beyond Obama's control.\nObama did approve the stimulus bill and a deal to extend tax cuts, both of which contributed to the debt.\n\nNot surprising though, that Obama\u2019s Treasury Department blames most of the current debt on decisions made under Bush, including tax cuts (which it says cost the government $3 trillion), the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (which it tallies at $1.4 trillion) and the Medicare prescription drug program ($300 billion).\n\nThey may have a point that there is plenty of blame to spread around. It is clear that some elements of the increase in the debt are a result of decisions made before this administration took office.\n\nAnd it\u2019s worth noting that the president doesn\u2019t operate in a vacuum. Legislation that increases spending, such as the extension of the tax cuts, requires approval from Congress. In the case of the tax cuts, that support came from both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nExperts note, too, that the weak economy has contributed to the debt, given the reduction in federal revenues and greater spending on items like unemployment benefits.\n\nRenacci is accurate in asserting that the national debt has increased since Obama took office by more than $5 trillion, more than any previous administration.\n\nBut his statement assigns direct control -- and blame -- to Obama. Lost in that is the impact of the faltering economy, decisions made before Obama took office and the fact that others, such as Congress, also have had a role in increasing the debt.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, Renacci\u2019s claim rates Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10863"}
