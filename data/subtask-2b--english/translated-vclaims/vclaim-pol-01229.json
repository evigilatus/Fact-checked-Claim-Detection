This story was highlighted as part of Facebook &apos; s efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story of the Strange News doll did not support its headlines. The story is linked to the April book of National magazine (another convoy roaming the southern border of the United States at the time) on the pretext that the United States churches are helping \"unlegal migration\" and that Catholic groups have long sponsored and supported \"the destruction campaigns of the nation.\" The story of Strange News highlights part of the article of the National Journal that the Vatican donated at least $20,000 in 2009 to a shelter in southern Mexico for Central America that is passing northwards. She also referred to another part of that article, which said that Catholicism, \"has become more than $12 million\" over the past five years in ministries along the southern border of the United States. \"We now have the first evidence that refers to Vatican funds affecting convoys, illegal convoys, and church groups along the borders in America that help them. It's time to punish the Vatican!\" \"Strength\" said the doll news article. According to the headline of the dolls, the Vatican pays members of the convoy in cash. There is no evidence of this. The new evidence he's quoted is a letter from months ago, talking about actions years ago. The Catholic Guidance Programme builds churches throughout the United States and provides funding for the resource-deficit parish of the United States. The Catholic extension said it wasn't the Vatican's arm. It is a non-profit Catholic entity. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 On 3 February 2021, the Catholic Guidance Program Poletti Fact reported that since its establishment in 1905, its funds have come from private donations and do not receive funding from the Government of the United States, nor from the Vatican. \"Catholic expansion helps build churches and supports key ministries in some of the poorest communities in our country that include the southern border region - one of the most intensive Catholic areas in our country,\" said Tom Gordon, Chief Operations Officer of the Catholic Guidance Authority in a statement. The Catholic Guidance Programme stated that, according to its funding guidelines, the funds it contributes to any American Catholic parish \"negotiates individually with the local bishops in response to the pastoral needs it identifies in its parish, with a view to helping to strengthen these Catholic communities.\" In July 2018, the Catholic Guidance Authority stated that it provided cheques to Catholic ministries along the southern border that housed, sponsored and defended migrants. (The organization said that the Texas Shelter near the border receives calls from immigration officials asking them to receive released immigrants and asylum-seekers. The assistance provided by Vatican or Catholic organizations to build or support asylums for migrants is not equivalent to \"financing\" migrants. While migrants benefit from this aid, the headline in the Doll News gives the misleading and false impression that the Vatican gives them money to migrate. The article also falsely claims that \"there is evidence of Soros' support for the invasion of the convoy.\" That's not true. We assessed several false copies of that allegation. The Strange News page on dolls says that the site was created by veterans of the United States Navy who \"decided to enter alternative news to tell the truth as best they could.\" Pupting String News did not respond to PolityFact's inquiries sent to its Facebook and Twitter accounts. Its headlines, which say, \"The surfaces of evidence in the Vatican finance convoys that target America with money,\" are inaccurate and misleading. We assess it wrong.
