We took a closer look.\nWhen we contacted Byrd, he pointed to an article in the Houston Chronicle about international student enrollment declining in Texas, a state that has enacted a campus carry law.\n\"International applications to Texas' four-year public universities have plummeted over the past year by at least 10,000, a 12.5 percent decrease from last fall, according to a Houston Chronicle review of university data,\" the article said.\nThe article cited possible explanations by experts, including Jeff Fuller, a former admissions director at the University of Houston.\nThe most prominent explanations were \"a sluggish global economy,\" \"greater competition from other countries,\" and \"President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric,\" which Fuller said \"has made some international students uncomfortable.\"\nA less prominent explanation in the article was Texas\u2019 campus carry law, with Fuller saying it was \"a sticking point for some applicants.\"\nHowever, this is not especially strong evidence to support Byrd\u2019s assertion. Byrd said \"states,\" but Texas is just one state. He also didn\u2019t specify international student enrollment, which the article did. It\u2019s also not clear that campus carry was the primary factor driving Texas\u2019\u00a0decline.\nSo we decided to take a broader look at states that enacted campus carry. Pedro Ribeiro, a spokesman for the Association of American Universities, said his group had no systematic data on the issue. So we dug through the numbers ourselves, state by state.\nStates that have campus carry laws\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 16 states explicitly ban carrying a concealed weapon on a college campus, while in 23 others, the decision is left up to each college or university. For instance, Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., allows campus carry despite the absence of a state law. Tennessee, meanwhile, allows the right for faculty members but not students or the public.\nHere, we\u2019ll focus on the remaining 10 states that have either legislation or court rulings that allow the carrying of concealed weapons on public post-secondary campuses: Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin. (Private schools are not included in the data because they are not required to follow the same guidelines.)\nWhat does the data show?\nWhen we looked at the data state by state, we found that public university enrollment trends in campus carry states have been, at best, inconsistent. Some states actually saw an increase after the law came into effect. We did not assess Arkansas, because we could not find data for the relevant period.\nFour states -- Colorado, Kansas, Oregon, and Wisconsin -- did see decreases after passage, though they were fairly small.\nThe campus carry law in Colorado took effect in 2010. Between that year and 2015, the most recent year available, enrollment fell by 5.8 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Kansas, the campus carry law has only been in effect for a little over a year. Between 2017 and 2018, the enrollment decrease was 1.1 percent.\nOregon initially saw a 2.9 percent increase in enrollment in 2011, the year its campus carry bill came into effect. Since then, enrollment has fallen by 4.6 percent.\nWisconsin\u2019s campus carry law also came into effect in 2011. Through 2015, the most recent year available, enrollment declined by 8.8 percent.\nTwo states saw no clear pattern in their enrollment figures.\nMississippi\u2019s campus carry law took effect in 2010. For the first year, the number rose. Enrollment dropped for the next three years, then increased again in 2015, the most recent year with available data.\nUtah saw an increase after its campus carry law took effect in 2004. Since then, there was a three-year decrease, followed by a four-year increase, another decrease in 2012, an increase in 2013, and another decrease in 2014, the last year for which data is available.\nThe remaining three states actually saw increases in their enrollment.\nTexas passed its campus carry law in 2016 but data shows a 2.9 increase in enrollment between 2015 and 2017.\nGeorgia\u2019s campus carry law took effect in 2017. Enrollment has increased by 2.2 percent since before the law.\nFinally, Idaho\u2019s enrollment rose by about 11 percent after its campus carry law took effect in 2014. The most recent data for Idaho runs through 2015.\nTo sum up: Four of the nine states we looked at saw fairly consistent enrollment declines after a campus carry law took effect, while two showed no consistent pattern and three saw enrollment increases.\nIn other words, there was a lot of variability, contrary to what Byrd said.\nBut even in the cases of the states with modest declines, it\u2019s not clear that gun laws were the driving force.\nMany other factors -- such as the size of a state\u2019s college-age population, whether universities are expanding or contracting their offerings, and broader economic forces -- can affect enrollment numbers. For instance, improving economic conditions after the Great Recession may have led some students to take jobs rather than enroll in college.\nDavid Bills, a University of Iowa sociologist who studies education, said it\u2019s not impossible that there could be some relationship between campus carry and enrollment declines, but he said he\u2019s never seen research on this question.\n\"Establishing a causal relationship between a particular law and enrollment trends would demand a very rigorous research design,\" Bills said. \"The standard of evidence would have to be pretty high. \u2026 If that research exists now, I'm not aware of it.\"\nOur ruling\nByrd said, \"The states that have passed (campus carry laws) have seen enrollment drop significantly.\"\nHis evidence for this assertion was one newspaper article that speculated that campus carry was a reason why international enrollment has declined in Texas. But that\u2019s a far narrower finding than he indicated -- and other factors have as good a claim, if not a better one, for being the driver of that decline.\nWhen we looked at the numbers more broadly, there is no consistent pattern in states\u2019 enrollment fluctuations following the enactment of campus carry laws. In fact, a slight majority of states either saw increases or a zig-zagging trend line. And even in the states where enrollment dropped, it is hard to say that campus carry was the reason.\nWe rate his statement False.\n Share the Facts 2019-04-16 17:46:55 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"The states that have passed (campus carry laws) have seen enrollment drop significantly.\"    Andrew Byrd West Virginia delegate https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/democrat-tries-unsuccessfully-to-kill-campus-carry-bill/article_83faef5a-b845-50d0-8246-12e14f8b5396.html   a legislative debate Monday, February 25, 2019 2019-02-25    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00755"}
