The article did say pundits attacked Conway for the comment. We couldn\u2019t find any instance of a reliable media report that corroborated the story, or any pundit who reacted to it.\nThe post also said Conway drew criticism on social media, but good luck finding anything on this specific (fake) comment that doesn\u2019t track back to LondonWebNews.com.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe site does not appear to be filled entirely with fictional stories, like some fake news websites. It looked to include posts taken from many places, including reliable news sources. One post, for example, was about the June 14, 2017, Grenfell Tower fire in London. This kind of mix would make it very difficult for a reader to be able to discern this particular item is fabricated.\nThe site\u2019s disclaimer said only that the site made \"no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability\" of anything it posted. \"Any reliance you place on such information is therefore strictly at your own risk,\" it warned.\nWe tried to contact LondonNewsWeb.com via the email address provided on the site\u00a0but didn\u2019t receive a response. There was no byline listed with the story.\nWe did reach a White House spokesman, who didn\u2019t want to give an official comment about the post.\nBut there\u2019s no proof Conway made this comment, either way. It looks as if the website (or its original source) made the story up entirely.\nWe rate this statement Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-06-20 15:36:11 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says Kellyanne Conway said liberal women hate her because of her \"striking beauty and intellect.\"    LondonWebNews.com  website   in an Internet post Thursday, June 1, 2017 2017-06-01    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03193"}
