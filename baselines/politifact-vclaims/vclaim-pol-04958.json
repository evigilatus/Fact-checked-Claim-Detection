We decided to see if Lew was right.\nLooking at the data\nCensus data shows a small, but steady increase in the number of people leaving Puerto Rico for the mainland. More than 360,000 people went from Puerto Rico to\u00a0the United States btween 2010 and 2014.\nHowever, the Census data isn\u2019t out for 2015, which is the year Lew was talking about.\nSo where did Lew get that figure?\nThe estimate comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation, which tracks passengers departing from and arriving to the island. The Treasury Department has\u00a0relied on this data before, according to department spokesperson Daniel Watson.\u00a0\nThe data show\u00a0about 90,000 more people left Puerto Rico for the United States than came in. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCensus vs. Passenger data\nCreate bar charts\n*The American Community Survey showing total out-migration of Puerto Rico to the US mainland\n**T-100 Domestic Market Data (US Carriers) \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nNone of this data includes people leaving Puerto Rico for somewhere other than the United States. Islanders mostly tend to head to\u00a0the mainland, however, countries in Latin America, the Dominican Republic and Spain have been attracting Puerto Ricans as well. So the total number of migrants leaving the island is actually larger.\nRecent qualitative interviews by researchers from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies found that the people leaving Puerto Rico in the greatest numbers are nurses, paramedics, police officers, teachers, college professors and lawyers. They are often recruited and going to states with growing Hispanic populations in need of bilingual professionals.\nThe surge in departures has led to the\u00a0social media tag\u00a0#yonomequito (\"I am not going anywhere\"). On Facebook this movement has been\u00a0liked by 70,000 people.\nOur ruling \nLew said that \"almost 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year.\"\nThat appears to be close. Airline data suggests about 89,000 more people departed Puerto Rico for the United States then entered it in 2015. While that\u2019s not a perfect estimate to measure out-migration, all the population trends suggest Puerto Rico is experiencing a surge in out-migration, as residents leave for better jobs and prospects in the United States.\nLew\u2019s statement is Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/560a7d4a-b482-4617-b070-ebed036363f7", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04958"}
