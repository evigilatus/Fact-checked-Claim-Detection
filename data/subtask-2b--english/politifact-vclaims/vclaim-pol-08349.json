Bush -- announced his candidacy on Jan. 16. Five days later, he launched a web ad featuring 2009 video snippets of Gillespie criticizing Obamacare and Warner defending it.\nThe screen turns black and these words appear: \"Obamacare passed by just one vote in the Senate. It wouldn\u2019t have passed without Mark Warner\u2019s vote.\"\nWe explored whether Warner\u2019s vote was essential to passage of the health care package.\nPaul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said the claim is based on a vote Warner cast in 2009 to prevent a Senate filibuster on Obamacare.\nUnder the Senate\u2019s cloture rules, it takes 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to end debate on most types of legislation and allow an up or down vote on the bill. On Dec. 23, 2009, the Senate voted 60-39 to halt debate on Obamacare. Warner joined all of his fellow Democrats and two independents in voting to stop a threatened Republican filibuster.\nThe next day, the Senate passed Obamacare with an identical 60-39 vote. But Warner\u2019s vote wasn\u2019t as important this time because only a simple majority was required to approve the legislation.\nWe should note that Warner is hardly the first Democratic senator to be attacked for his or her vote to end the filibuster. Republicans have charged each of at least four other Democrats with casting \"the deciding vote.\" In Virginia last November, then-Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli claimed Warner cast \"the tie-breaking vote\" to pass Obamacare.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitiFact\u2019s standard ruling on those claims has been Mostly False. We, and our colleagues in \u00a0other states, have said it\u2019s misleading to accuse one senator of casting the pivotal ballot when the same could be said of 59 others who voted to end the filibuster.\nOur ruling\nGillespie says \"Obamacare passed by one vote in the Senate. It wouldn\u2019t have passed without Mark Warner\u2019s vote.\"\nThis is an improvement on past Republican efforts to blame Warner for casting the deciding vote to block a filibuster against Obamacare when, in fact, he was joined by 59 colleagues. It casts Warner as part of a collective weight that tipped the scales -- not the final grain of sand.\nWarner was one of 60 who voted to block the filibuster -- the bare number required under Senate rules. That allowed the Senate the following day to vote on the Obamacare bill and here\u2019s where Gillespie\u2019s statement comes up a little bit short.\nThe bill, with Warner\u2019s support, passed by a 60-39 vote. But since it only required a simple majority in the 100-member Senate to approve the legislation, Warner\u2019s vote was not essential this time around. The actual Obamacare bill would have passed with or without him.\nSo Gillespie\u2019s statement is largely accurate but needs a technical clarification. We rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08349"}
