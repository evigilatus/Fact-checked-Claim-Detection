The study uses 2011 income data.\n\nThe top 5 percent alone get 41 percent of the total tax savings associated with these breaks, the study found. The \"middle\" 60 percent of earners, by contrast, get less than a third of the benefit, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.\n\nThe effect is even more pronounced if just the major itemized deductions are eliminated, but other breaks are kept, Williams said.\n\nIt makes sense, Williams said. Lower earners have lower tax rates, so they get less benefit from the breaks than wealthier people who have more to deduct and pay higher tax rates.\n\n\"They do benefit disproportionately,\" he said.\n\nDaniel Mitchell, a Cato Institute senior fellow who studies tax reform, said the state and local tax deduction and charitable contributions deduction are \"very heavily tilted to the rich.\" He added: \"The mortgage interest deduction is tilted to the rich as well, but not as dramatically.\"\n\nWe should note that Romney\u2019s tax reform plan does not call for dumping all tax deductions. He has said that if some deductions were eliminated, overall rates could be lowered. While he\u2019s provided some specifics, the fate of many deductions is left unclear.\n\nAs always in tax matters, there are some nuances here.\n\nIn sheer numbers, some tax deductions such as the mortgage interest deduction are claimed by far more middle- and lower-income people than by people in the top brackets, IRS data shows. That\u2019s in part a reflection of how broad the middle class is compared to the upper-income tiers.\n\nTax savings from various preferences are spread throughout the population, from tax credits for low-income people to investment tax breaks for the wealthy, Williams noted.\n\nRyan\u2019s campaign cited IRS data showing greater benefits as you rise through the tax brackets, and that\u2019s confirmed in the Tax Policy Center analysis, we found.\n\nOur third expert, William McBride, chief economist for the Tax Foundation, said judging Ryan\u2019s statement \"depends on the definition of rich.\"\n\nRyan gave a clue - people in the \"top brackets.\" But in 2011 there were six income tax brackets ranging from 10 percent to 35 percent, and drawing the line between the middle class and \"wealthy\" is a subjective call.\n\nThe big benefits for the top fifth of earners, as found by the Tax Policy Center, are in a group whose incomes start at $103,000. Is that \"wealthy?\"\n\nWhat if, like President Barack Obama, you set $250,000 and up as a benchmark for raising tax rates for the \"wealthy?\" People in that group got less than 40 percent of the tax savings -- a figure that is somewhat at odds with the \"most\" description used by Ryan.\n\nStill, our experts said that, overall, it\u2019s clear the benefits are tilted heavily to the upper end of the income scale. One more example: Just 0.1 percent of earners alone got 13 percent of the benefits, the Tax Policy Center study found.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRyan, countering criticism of Romney tax plan, said that wealthy taxpayers, not middle-income earners, get \"most of the deductions\" in the tax code.\n\nHe\u2019s on target, with the caveat that it partly depends on the definition of \"wealthy.\" Wealthier people pay higher tax rates and tend to get more benefit from deductions than lower-income earners.\n\nWe rate his statement Mostly True.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10495"}
