(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWhat the theory fails to take into account are the so-called \"lunar overshoes\" the astronauts wore when they actually rested their feet on the moon\u2019s surface. These overshoes are what left the footprint that is being scrutinized in this post.\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the photo of the footprint.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo 11 carried cameras for collection data and recording the moon landing mission. The photo of the footprint in question was taken by astronaut Buzz Aldrin, not Armstrong. And, according to a series of images on the Lunar and Planetary Institute\u2019s website, it\u2019s a photo of Aldrin\u2019s own footprint, not Armstrong\u2019s. The institute, perhaps aware of this particular conspiracy theory, also draws readers\u2019 attention to another image of Aldrin descending onto the moon.\nThe soles of Aldrin\u2019s boots and the footprint match. Armstrong left a similar footprint with the same kind of tread.\nThat\u2019s because while the photo of his space suit is authentic (you can see lots of images of it here, including the soles of his shoes) \u00a0both Armstrong and Aldrin wore these lunar overshoes that were left behind.\nAccording to a 2017 Forbes story, Armstrong and Aldrin abandoned about 100 tools, gear and pieces of trash on the moon\u2019s surface. \"NASA wanted the mission to bring back as many samples of lunar rocks and dust as possible,\" the story says, \"which meant the crew needed to leave behind everything they didn\u2019t actually need for the trip back to earth.\"\nMoon landing conspiracy theories endure, but so do the first footprints on the moon\u2019s surface. There\u2019s no wind to blow them away, according to NASA, and they\u2019ll be there for a million years.\nWe rate this Facebook post as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00668"}
