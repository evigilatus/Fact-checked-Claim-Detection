The story did not take much time to turn into a false allegation that Ocacio-Cortez was paid personally, which is not true. On February 12, I shared the Facebook page \"We the People,\" repeating a rumor that says, \"It's interesting that the socialism that described itself... The article, which received approximately 4,500 shares in just a few days, says: \"I was in Congress as a 'public servant' for a month and is already a millionaire.\" \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Okasio Cortez, and other women who showed up in the film, don't get any money from Netflix. \"She gets zero dollars for the film,\" said Corbin Trent's spokesman. \"Not 10 million, not 100 million, not 2 million-0.\" The documentary, called \"Voice on the House,\" documents the campaigns of four progressive candidates: Amy Villa, Corey Bush, Paula Jean-Sorrengen, and Ocacio-Cort\u00e9s, who were the only winners among the group.

Shortly after winning, Netflix obtained distribution rights for a $10 million record, which was first reported by Hollywood Entertainment News. The story spreads rapidly on the Internet, and somewhere along the way it turned to Okasio Cortez to get a full $10 million \"pay\" from Netflix. Okasio-Cortez does not own the film, and therefore no company can make up for the distribution rights deal. :: Lairs Production, Jupele Films, responded to one of many tweets accusing Ocacio Cortez of being a political buyer of the transaction. \"FYI, a dollar to sell #KnockDown The Hoose goes to production companies, producers, sales agent and, of course, taxes,\" published by the production company on Twitter. \"It means that we can give to others who are profitable and deserving and we don't have to live on credit cards to make our next film. But he doesn't go to @AOC or the other candidates!\" For your information, a dollar to sell #KnockDownThe House goes to production companies, producers, sales agent and, of course, taxes. This means that we can give eligible non-profits, and we don't have to live on credit cards to make our next movie.
