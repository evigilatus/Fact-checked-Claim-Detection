Whitehouse said on the Senate floor: \u201cEverybody in Rhode Island who disagrees with me about Obamacare is an Aryan, is a white supremacist.\u201d", "text": "It looked like the 2012 election season was getting under way when Republican Kenneth V. McKay IV was interviewed Feb. 27 on the ABC6 news show \"On the Record.\"\n\nMcKay, former chief of staff for ex-Gov. Donald Carcieri, and then for the Republican National Committee, is running for the state Republican chairmanship. At one point, the conversation turned to the possibility of either McKay or Carcieri challenging Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse if he runs for reelection next year.\n\n\"Let\u2019s take a look at the record,\" McKay said of Whitehouse. \"This is a guy who stood up in front of the U.S. Senate and said, \u2018Everybody in Rhode Island who disagrees with me about Obamacare is an Aryan, is a white supremacist.\u2019\"\n\nWe remembered Whitehouse making a passionate -- some said inflammatory -- Senate speech in 2009 about the decline in civility in politics. But we didn\u2019t remember him castigating every Rhode Islander who opposed President Obama\u2019s health care plan.\n\nWe asked McKay for his source and he referred us to the 20-minute speech we remembered, which Whitehouse delivered Dec. 20, 2009, during the health care debate.\n\nIt was a speech that lit up the blogosphere. Democrats and progressives called it historic and brilliant. Conservatives called it outrageous. One called it a lunatic rant.\n\nMcKay drew our attention to one paragraph that he called \"the relevant part.\" Here it is:\n\n\"And why? Why all this discord and discourtesy, all this unprecedented, destructive action? All to break the momentum of our new, young President. They are desperate to break this President. They have ardent supporters who are nearly hysterical at the very election of President Barack Obama: the \u2018birthers,\u2019 the fanatics, the people running around in right-wing militias and Aryan support groups. It is unbearable to them that President Barack Obama should exist. That is one powerful reason.\"\n\nMcKay wrote that when you read or hear the entire speech, you understand that Whitehouse is talking about Republicans in the Senate and their supporters in the fight against health care.\n\nThen he reasoned that Whitehouse was suggesting that \"anyone in Rhode Island who is an ardent supporter of the fight against Obamacare are (sic) \u2018nearly hysterical . . . the \u2018birthers,\u2019 the fanatics, the people running around in right wing militias, and Aryan support groups.\"\n\nWe read the speech and disagree on several counts.\n\nFirst, Whitehouse was excoriating Republican senators, not Rhode Islanders. In fact, he said nothing about Rhode Island in the entire speech.\n\nSecond, despite his strident language, nowhere in the speech did he come close to saying that everyone who disagreed with the health care plan is an Aryan or a white supremacist.\n\nHe accused his Republican colleagues of engaging in a campaign of obstruction and delay \"affecting every single aspect of the Senate\u2019s business.\u2019\n\nHe said they engaged in a \"campaign of falsehoods: about death panels, and cuts to Medicare benefits, and benefits for illegal aliens and bureaucrats to be parachuted in between you and your doctor.\"\n\nAnd he accused the GOP senators of voting against funding for soldiers, as another tactic to stall the health care vote.\n\nBut in the paragraph McKay cites, it\u2019s clear that Whitehouse was criticizing fringe groups who are \"nearly hysterical at the very election of President Barack Obama\" \u00a0not just opponents of the president\u2019s health care plan.\n\nIn suggesting that Whitehouse labeled all opponents of the health care plan Aryans and white supremacists, McKay seriously distorted the senator\u2019s speech. His further suggestion that, by extension, Whitehouse was applying the label to Rhode Islanders who disagreed with the president, is even more of a distortion.\n\nPants on Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13477"}
