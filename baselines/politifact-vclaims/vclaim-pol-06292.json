Scott Walker has said enacting a new state budget is so important that he would not announce whether he will run for president until one is in place.\nAlong the way, Walker has expressed confidence -- with fellow Republicans in control of both chambers of the Legislature -- that the two-year budget will be adopted by June 30, 2015.\nThat\u2019s the end of the state\u2019s fiscal year, though if lawmakers miss the deadline, spending simply continues at current levels. Unlike the federal government, there is no shutdown.\nBut in recent days, GOP lawmakers have struggled to reach agreement over transportation funding, a proposed new arena for the Milwaukee Bucks and other matters -- putting the June 30, 2015 deadline in jeopardy.\nWalker, meanwhile, is eyeing July 13, 2015 as a potential presidential announcement date, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported.\nAnd now Walker is saying his marking point is -- and has long been -- the end of the fiscal year, not the date work on the budget is completed.\nWhat gives?\nTime to roll out the Flip-O-Meter, which tests whether a politician has changed position on an issue. Our requisite reminder: It does not measure whether any change is good or bad policy or politics, only whether the candidate has been consistent. \nA recent chronology of Walker\u2019s statements on the budget and a presidential announcement show he has repeatedly said any presidential announcement would only come after work on the budget is completed -- that is, the Legislature approves a budget and he signs it:\nApril 22, 2015: Walker says\u00a0while visiting a business in Grand Chute, Wis.: \"I won't make any decision until after the budget's complete.\"\nMay 7, 2015: The Associated Press reports Walker said he would make no announcement \"of any kind\" about running for president until after the state budget is signed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 17, 2015: Walker says on CBS\u2019 \"Face the Nation\" he\u2019ll announce whether he\u2019s formally jumping into the race after he completes work on the state budget.\nMay 30, 2015: Campaigning in New Hampshire, Walker says: \"For us, we have yet to make an announcement. We\u2019ll do that after our budget is done, at the end of June.\"\nJune 3, 2015: Walker tells \"Fox & Friends\" about a 2016 presidential bid: \"I haven't made an announcement yet and won't until after the budget's done at the end of this month.\"\nContrast that with what Walker told reporters June 18, 2015 in Ripon, Wis.\nWhen asked about his 2016 announcement plans, Walker told reporters:\n\"For us, my goal has always been to get through the end of the budget year which ends June 30th. We'll see after that. Sometime in July is a pretty good time.\"\nThat\u2019s a change -- something immediately picked up on in the media.\nWhen we asked Walker campaign spokeswoman AshLee Strong about the change in Walker\u2019s statements, she said by email: \"As the governor has said, he is optimistic an agreement will be reached in the coming weeks. When we have a public announcement, we will let you know.\"\nOur rating\nWalker has repeatedly said he would not make an announcement on whether he\u2019ll run for president until after work is complete on the 2015-\u201917 state budget -- with his hope being that the budget would be in place by June 30, 2015, the end of the state\u2019s fiscal year.\nNow with that deadline in jeopardy, Walker is changing what he said. He claims he always wanted to merely get past the June 30, 2015 deadline before announcing his plans for 2016.\nIn other words, Walker no longer is saying a budget has to be in place before he\u2019ll make his announcement. For that reversal of position, we give Walker a Full Flop.\u00a0\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06292"}
