Police are still investigating the altercation, which left Sir Christopher Meyer bloodied but in stable condition.\nSome bloggers have connected the attack with President Donald Trump\u2019s visit the next day and the protests that went alongside it. On July 13, protesters gathered in the city, guiding a large, baby Trump balloon past Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Meanwhile, Trump met with Prime Minister Theresa May at a military demonstration.\nEarlier that week, Meyer was beaten in the Victoria London Underground Station.\nAn article, posted on clickbait site Neon Nettle, claimed that Meyer was \"savagely beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of anti-Trump protestors because he \u2018welcomed\u2019 the U.S. president to the United Kingdom.\" This seemed out of line with other reports of the event, which did not mention political motives.\nWe decided to investigate whether Trump\u2019s visit was tied directly to Meyer\u2019s attack.\nThe editorial\nA few days before the protests, the Independent published\u00a0an editorial\u00a0written by Meyer. That same day, he was attacked.\nIn the piece, Meyer cautioned protesters against angering Trump.\n\"Our security and prosperity depend in large measure on keeping our close and long-standing partnership in good working order,\" he writes.\nMeyer argued that in spite of Trump pulling the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris agreement on climate change,\u00a0engaging with the president and maintaining close ties between the countries is imperative.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeon Nettle hypothesized that this show of support was enough to rile up \"a gang of anti-Trump protestors.\"\nThe attack\nMeyer\u2019s wife told The Times that she suspected the attack was politically motivated: \"He is opinionated, and sometimes people have different opinions.\"\nHowever, London police said it is more likely that Meyer\u2019s assailants wanted to rob him. There has been no evidence released thus far to tie the attack to the protests or to suggest that Meyer was targeted.\nThe Neon Nettle article says that Meyer was attacked by \"a mob of thugs\" involved with the protests against Trump. However, only two suspects were arrested: a 15-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy. They were released from custody while the investigation into their involvement continues, according to a press release by the British Transport Police.\nAdditionally, the attack took place on Wednesday, July 11, two full days before the official protests and a day before Trump arrived in the country.\nThe Neon Nettle also alleges that \"violent riots\" have occurred throughout London in response to Trump\u2019s visit. While there were massive protests against Trump in the capital, there were few news reports of violence. In a single altercation outside of a pub, one man was arrested for hitting a Trump supporter.\nOur ruling\nThere has been no evidence released linking the attack of a former ambassador\u00a0to Trump\u2019s visit to the United Kingdom.\u00a0\nMeyer was beaten by two teenagers, not a \"gang of anti-Trump protestors,\" as Neon Nettle alleges. The protests against Trump, which took place two days after the attack, were relatively uneventful as far as violence goes.\nBecause police are still investigating the incident, we cannot conclusively say that it was not motivated by politics. However, for that same reason,\u00a0Neon Nettle goes too far to say that it was. Further, it\u00a0is an overstatement to say that the anti-Trump protests were \"violent riots.\" Our ruling is Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-07-17 20:03:16 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"An elderly British politician has been savagely beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of anti-Trump protestors because he \u2018welcomed\u2019 the U.S. president to the United Kingdom.\"    Bloggers Neon Nettle https://www.neonnettle.com/news/4514-british-politician-beaten-by-protestors-for-welcoming-trump-to-the-uk-   in a blog post Friday, July 13, 2018 2018-07-13    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01850"}
