And he is the grandson of David Rockefeller. Zuckerberg is German for \u2018sugar mountain.\u2019 Their clandestine word for \u2018Facebook\u2019 No doubt: A mountain of information from which they can extract billions. The Rothschild\u2019s own nearly 10% of all Facebook shares and FB was funded with $500,000,000 USD from a CIA owned bank, which is not a secret.\"\nAll of this is nonsense. Zuckerberg\u2019s \"real\" name is not Jacob Greenberg, his grandfather was not David Rockefeller, and there is no evidence of a money-making scheme involving the CIA.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

He was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, N.Y.., to parents Karen and Edward Zuckerberg.\nA Facebook spokesperson told PolitiFact the Rockefeller claim is false.\u00a0\nThis bizarre theory appears to date back to 2012, when a man named Jacob Greenberg was arrested for marijuana possession in Arizona and some people thought his mugshot looked a lot like Zuckerberg.\nBut a close look shows they\u2019re not the same person. Zuckerberg was a billionaire at this point, so an arrest for drugs in Arizona would have been covered by local and national media outlets.\u00a0\nStill, there are conspiracy theorists who say Zuckerberg is secretly the grandson of Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg, who was once a member of the Rockefeller-founded trilateral commission, and who supposedly married one of Rockefeller\u2019s four daughters. Maurice Greenberg did marry a woman named Corinne Phyllis Zuckerman, but she\u2019s not David Rockefeller\u2019s daughter and doesn\u2019t appear to share any relation with the Rockefeller family \u2014 or with Mark Zuckerberg.\u00a0\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17807"}
