Dentists are the only physicians that believe you can get away with leaving dead tissue in the body. One root canal tooth can shut down 63% of your immune system.\"\nThe text outside of the picture advises people to watch \"Root Cause\" and also makes the startling claim that, of all the women diagnosed with breast cancer, \"98% had a root canal on the same side.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Instead of extracting an infected tooth, endodontists drill into the center of the tooth\u2019s root to clean and fill the canals.\nThe film alleges that infections inside of root canals cause a myriad of serious health problems, including cancer. It instructs viewers to have any teeth treated with root canals removed and replaced with a bridge or implant.\nThe documentary reportedly includes commentary by alternative medicine physicians who have taken controversial stances on health topics including vaccines and Ebola treatments, according to an article by the Philly Voice.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on January 20, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO admits their testing grossly overstates individuals testing positive for COVID.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y.

(The film is no longer available on Amazon Prime video but can still be rented or purchased on Vimeo.)\nThe groups shared the concern that the documentary spreads misinformation, and that hosting such a film \"does a disservice to the public because it may cause unwarranted alarm to the point where people might avoid a very necessary dental procedure.\"\nThe American Dental Association added that approximately 25 million new endodontic treatments, which includes root canals, are performed safely each year.\nThe UCLA School of Dentistry also released a statement regarding the film:\n\"The people in this movie are spreading misinformation and confusion about root canal treatment that is misleading and harmful to the consumer public. Their premise is based on junk science and faulty testing conducted more than 100 years ago that was debunked in the 1950s, continuously since then and is even more discredited today by physicians, dentists and academics. Mainstream medical and dental communities overwhelmingly agree that root canal treatment is safe, effective and eliminates pain.\"\nThe idea that bacteria trapped inside an endodontically-treated tooth will cause illness stems from research conducted by Dr. Weston Price in the 1920s.\nPrice\u2019s research suggested bacteria trapped in \"dentinal tubules\" during a root canal could \"leak\" and cause almost any type of degenerative systemic disease including arthritis and diseases of the kidney, heart, nervous, gastrointestinal, endocrine and other systems, according to a fact sheet on root canal safety by the American Association of Endodontists.\nThe organization reported that Price advocated for extraction instead, resulting \"in a frightening era of tooth extraction both for treatment of systemic disease and as a prophylactic measure against future illness.\"\u00a0\nIn the time since, multiple reports and reviews published in scientific journals \u2013\u2013 such as the Journal of the American Dental Association and the Journal of the American Medical Association \u2013\u2013 have criticized Price\u2019s research methods and discredited his findings.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim about root canals\u00a0leading to serious illnesses False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16780"}
