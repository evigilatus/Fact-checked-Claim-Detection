The email compares \"black Americans\" with just white men, while the Pew report is saying black men have 73 percent\u00a0the hourly earnings of white men.\nThe Pew report uses 2015 data and is based on median hourly earnings for each race. It does not take into account differences between the education levels of white and black workers, their experience, occupation or other factors.\n(The unadjusted earnings data from Pew showed Asian men earn 117 percent\u00a0what white men do and Hispanic men earn 69 percent\u00a0what white men do.)\n\"From a statistical standpoint you\u2019d want to compare apples v. apples, and those comparisons with unadjusted data would be comparing apples to oranges really,\" said Mark Perry, a scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics at the University of Michigan-Flint. \"You\u2019re not controlling for any of the factors that could explain differences in earnings.\"\nThe left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank, examines these factors each year and put the black-white wage gap at 14.5 percent\u00a0for 2016. The calculation controls for gender, race, education, experience and geographic division.\nTheir data shows the gap has steadily widened in recent years. The wage gap was around 9 percent\u00a0in the late 1970s and 10 percent\u00a0in the 1980s, rising to a record 15.2 percent\u00a0in 2015 before dropping slightly in 2016.\nThe wage gap varies greatly between men and women. The institute\u2019s detailed 2016 study tabbed the gap as 22 percent\u00a0between white men and black men and 11.7 percent\u00a0between white women and black women, when adjusted for education, experience, metro status and region.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences in factors such as education and experience levels explained only about one-fourth of the black-white wage gap for men and one-third for women, the study said.\nThe study struggled to identify a cause for the rest, saying the gaps are growing due to either discrimination \"or racial differences in skills or worker characteristics that are unobserved or unmeasured in the data.\"\nSegments show larger, smaller gaps\nMore detailed data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the wage gap rises and falls between various educational and occupational groups.\nExamples from a 2016 comparison of median weekly earnings:\n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among college graduates, black workers earned 78 percent\u00a0of what their white counterparts earned.\n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among those with less than a high school diploma, black workers earned 89 percent\u00a0of what their white counterparts earned.\n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Black workers in management, professional and related occupations earned 80 percent\u00a0of what white workers did.\n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Black workers in natural resources, construction and maintenance occupations earned 93 percent\u00a0of what white workers did.\n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Black men earned 76 percent\u00a0of what white men did overall.\n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Black women earned 84 percent\u00a0of what white women did overall.\nOur rating\nGronik said \"black Americans still earn less than 73 percent\u00a0of what white men make.\"\nHis claim runs into problems on several levels. First, he garbled the statistic, comparing all black workers to only white men. He also referred to unadjusted earnings data, which does not account for differences between workers\u2019 experience and backgrounds that explain some of the wage gap.\nHe also used 2015 data, when 2016 data is available from various sources.\nBut his central point \u2014 that there is an observable difference between what black workers and white workers make \u2014 is supported by the data. Experts vary in their methodologies and definition of a wage gap, and more nuanced calculations show it is notably smaller than the figure Gronik cited. But a gap does exist, both between all workers and between workers who are similarly situated.\nWe rate Gronik\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02837"}
