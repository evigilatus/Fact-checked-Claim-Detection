Here\u2019s what we found out.\nCDC asked to revise guidelines\u00a0\nBiden\u2019s campaign pointed us to a May 7, 2020, Associated Press report, which found that the Trump administration shelved part of a CDC document that contained step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen businesses and public areas amid the pandemic.\u00a0\nThe 68-page CDC report, titled \"Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework,\" was supposed to publish on May 1, according to the AP, but the White House called it \"too prescriptive.\" The White House told the agency revise its guide because it didn\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s strategy of giving states the final say.\u00a0\nThe CDC released the approved 62-page report on May 20. (Some sections were released a few days earlier.) While it\u2019s slightly shorter than the original, it still provides a detailed reopening roadmap for schools, camps, restaurants, child care facilities and transit organizations.\u00a0\nIn a May 8 press briefing, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany countered that the CDC guidelines weren't ready and said that a rogue employee leaked a draft that was still in the editing process.\nAfter the final guidelines were released, she was asked in another briefing why Trump didn\u2019t make an announcement. McEnany said that sections of the document were already out and different appendixes had to be discussed first.\n\"The 60-page document was merely an aggregation of a lot of what was already out there, so it\u2019s not as if this was new information that we were announcing, but it was more guidance pursuant to our \u2018reopening of America\u2019 guidance that was issued several weeks ago,\" McEnany said.\u00a0\nThe CDC also said the guidelines are meant to be taken together with the White House\u2019s reopening guidance issued on April 17, 2020. But the White House version makes clear reopening decisions are up to state and local officials, while the CDC\u2019s version includes more details, such as recommendations to help businesses decide when to shut down in the case of future outbreaks.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original plan also included instructions for faith-based organizations, which were stripped out of the final version.\u00a0\u00a0\nCNN reported that this section was one of the main holdups for publishing the CDC documents, because the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office for Civil Rights argued that faith-based organizations were being unfairly targeted. The department asked the CDC to ease social distancing recommendations for those groups, according to CNN, and encouraged federal health officials to let churchgoers congregate, saying that this aligned with the president\u2019s agenda.\nThe shelved CDC guide also recommended that nonessential travel should be avoided until the last phase of reopening, while the released version only mentions nonessential travel in relation to high-risk persons. The White House plan is looser on nonessential travel, too, and advises that communities \"minimize\" travel in Phase 1, and that in Phase 2, \"non-essential travel can resume.\"\nSome health experts and officials have criticized the delay, saying that detailed recommendations should have been available earlier.\n\"While it is not unusual for there to be White House review of forthcoming guidance, it is highly unusual for there to be a wholesale rewriting of guidelines at the request of the White House,\" said Jeffrey Levi, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University.\u00a0\n\"The holding back of recommendations regarding places of worship was particularly egregious given the high level of risk such indoor, mass gatherings can pose,\" Levi said. \"The shorter versions that were first released diminished their effectiveness, since they didn\u2019t provide as much detail as people needed to know how best to implement them. This delayed implementation of best practices \u2014 which could potentially have placed people at greater risk.\"\nBut the CDC told PolitiFact the report\u2019s revisions were part of a standard interagency process with the White House coronavirus task force.\n\"There is an iterative effort to ensure effective, clear guidance is presented to the American people,\" said Benjamin Haynes, a spokesperson for the CDC. \"As part of the Administration\u2019s whole of government approach to combating COVID-19, the CDC followed an inter-agency process of drafting considerations and submitting them to the White House Task Force for review and comment before posting the guidance for states to safely reopen.\"\nPolitiFact reached out to the White House for comment but did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nBiden said that the Trump administration \"delayed and scaled back\" the CDC\u2019s COVID-19 reopening guidelines.\u00a0\nBiden is mostly on target. The CDC said that the delays were caused by review and revision that was part of a standard process. Still, the White House did request that the public health agency revise its initial guidelines to align more with Trump\u2019s approach of leaving reopening decisions up to state and local governments.\nWe rate this Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17692"}
