Ryan appears to be referring to that definition since each time he used the term, he attributed it to actuaries.\nSo this isn\u2019t a fact check on the health or success of Obamacare, but on whether the present condition is consistent with what industry number-crunchers call a \"death spiral.\"\nThe term refers to a cycle where shrinking enrollment leads to a deteriorating risk pool (that is, healthy people leave the plan due to the cost). That leads to higher premiums, which causes enrollment to shrink even further, continuing the cycle.\n\"It\u2019s a well-known and documented phenomenon,\" said David Cutler, a Harvard University economics professor who was among the early users of the term in a 1998 paper, though he doesn\u2019t believe he was the first.\nThree elements to a death spiral\nSo a death spiral requires 1.) shrinking enrollment, 2.) a deteriorating risk pool and 3.) rising premiums. Let\u2019s look at those one by one.\nThe\u00a0latest figures show enrollment in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance exchange is up slightly from last year. Through Dec. 24, 2016, some 11.5 million people were signed up for coverage, an increase of 300,000 from the same point last year.\n\"This market is not merely stable, it\u2019s actually currently on track to grow,\" said Aviva Aron-Dine, an economist with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \"These (death spiral claims) are claims that have been sort of demonstrably false for a while, but it\u2019s even more irresponsible to be repeating them now when we actually have enrollment data for 2017.\"\nAs for the risk pool, Aron-Dine said it improved in 2015. Data for 2016 isn\u2019t available yet, but the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u00a0reports the share of people signing up for 2017 in the low-risk demographic \u2014 ages 18-34 \u2014 is on par with 2016, at 26% of enrollees.\nLarry Levitt, vice president of the health care-focused, nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, noted the 26% number in a Jan. 10, 2017, tweet, adding, \"You'd expect that number to go down in an insurance \u2018death spiral.\u2019\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd data maintained by Standard & Poor\u2019s shows the pool of people insured through the marketplace is improving, as the insurer cost per enrollee dropped below costs in the employer-sponsored market for the first time since Obamacare began, said Ben Wanaker, deputy assistant secretary with HHS.\nThe role of premiums is more nuanced.\nPremiums are going up significantly this year. The benchmark plan used to gauge changes increased an average of 24% across the 50 states and Washington, D.C., the Kaiser Family Foundation\u00a0reported.\nBut most consumers won\u2019t see any increase in what they pay because Obamacare includes subsidies that cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400% of the federal poverty level (in 2016 that would be $47,520 for a single person).\nAmong the people who have signed up so far for 2017, 81% will receive a subsidy.\nAs a result, for most there is no direct connection between premiums and enrollment \u2014 the core connection that defines a death spiral. For example, Arizona has by far the largest premium increase for 2017 (145%) but has still seen Obamacare enrollment\u00a0increase by 8 percent so far.\n\"When the premiums go up, people don\u2019t drop coverage because the amount they pay hasn\u2019t changed,\" Cutler said.\nWhen asked for evidence of the death spiral, Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana provided links to other people who have claimed the system is in a death spiral and details on how premiums are rising and insurers are leaving the marketplace. But he did not provide any data that showed the conditions being met for the actuarial definition of a death spiral.\nNone of this is to say things are rosy for Obamacare.\nSeveral of the country\u2019s largest insurers have abandoned or drastically scaled back their involvement in the exchanges, meaning one-third of counties will now have only one company offering plans on the exchange.\nBut that\u2019s not a death spiral.\nMark Pauly, a conservative health economist at The Wharton School, said it was a \"poor choice of words\" by Ryan.\n\"It\u2019s not a death spiral, it\u2019s just a downward spiral,\" he said.\nOur rating\nA death spiral is a health industry term for a cycle with three components \u2014 shrinking enrollment, healthy people leaving the system and rising premiums.\nThe latest data shows enrollment is increasing slightly and younger (typically healthier) people are signing up at the same rate as last year. And while premiums are increasing, that isn\u2019t affecting the cost to most consumers due to built-in subsidies.\nSo none of the three criteria are met, much less all three.\nWe rate Ryan\u2019s claim False.
