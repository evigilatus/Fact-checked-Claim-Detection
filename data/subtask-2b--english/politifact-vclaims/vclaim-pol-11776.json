In Florida the map shows a sign reading \"Debbie\u2019s District abandoned.\"\n\nHarrington said Wasserman Schultz is \"more concerned with headlining fundraisers for President (Barack) Obama and the DNC than she is with fulfilling the responsibilities owed to her constituents,\" adding, \"In 2011, Wasserman Schultz missed 62 congressional votes \u2014 one of the worst records of a member of Congress.\"\n\nWe decided to see for ourselves: How many votes did Wasserman Schultz miss in 2011, and how did she stack up with her peers?\n\nWe soon discovered that the numbers add up quickly when you\u2019re talking about 435 members of Congress and more than 900 votes. But a web team at the New York Times\u00a0tracks congressional votes in an online database.\n\nThe New York Times posted an analysis in October that showed nearly 20 members had missed more than 10 percent of the votes in 2011 -- mostly due to their own illness or that of a family member. Wasserman Schultz was not on that list.\n\nThere were some not so-surprising names included. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who was shot Jan. 8, missed the most. Presidential candidates Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and Ron Paul, R-Texas, were also on the list. And Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo., \"might have been the first paternity leave for a gay member of Congress,\" the Times wrote.\n\nThe article reflected about 814 votes -- not the full year.\n\nWe contacted Derek Willis, a web developer at the New York Times, who shared internal data with us that showed 948 votes between January and Dec. 20, 2011. The votes are roll call votes and omit voice votes or unanimous consent.\n\nWillis told us in an e-mail that the voting data, which comes from the Clerk of the House, showed that Wasserman Schultz missed 62 votes, which equals 6.4 percent of all House votes in 2011. She tied for 45th among the top missers of votes in the House. The median was 17 missed votes or about 1.8 percent.\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 analysis showed that Wasserman Schultz didn\u2019t top the Florida delegation for missed votes. Frederica Wilson, D-Miami, missed the most votes -- she ranked No. 11. Wilson had gallbladder surgery in October, according to the Miami Herald\u2019s \"Naked Politics\" blog.\n\nThree other members of Florida\u2019s Congressional delegation missed more than Wasserman Schultz: C.W. \"Bill\" Young, R-Indian Shores; Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Miami; and Kathy Castor, D-Tampa.\n\nOur ruling\n\nHarrington said, \"In 2011, Wasserman Schultz missed 62 congressional votes \u2014 one of the worst records of any member of Congress.\" She\u2019s right that Wasserman Schultz missed 62 votes. That means Wasserman Schultz is No. 45 among members who have missed votes, out of 435 sitting members, a fairly high ranking. On the other hand, she's not even the worst in the state and has a better voting record than four other members of the Florida delegation. So the record is mixed on whether she is \"one of the worst.\" We rate the statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11776"}
