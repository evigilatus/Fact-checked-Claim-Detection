Simply put, the walls work and the walls save lives.\" This was not the first time Trump had welcomed the El Paso barrier as a solution to the crime. The latter may not be: Trump plans to be in El Paso on February 11th to organize an election campaign. But the allegation is not true. At first, El Paso was not considered one of the most dangerous cities in the country. The violent crime rate was much lower than the national average compared to cities of similar size. Moreover, the rate of violent crime - not low, as Tramp claimed - rose after the construction of a border fence in the region. The crime data show that El Paso was not \"one of the most dangerous cities of our nation\" the FBI tool that allows users to see the violent crime rates reported by police agencies from 1985 to 2014. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Consolidated Crime Reporting Programme classifies four crimes as violent crimes: murder, manslaughter, rape, theft and aggravated assault. Every year from 1985 to 2014, the rate of violent crime in El Paso was much lower than the average in all localities of similar size. (Note: Not all departments reported data each year.) El Paso falls under the 500,000 population group of 999,999 (total cities of 24). The other cities in that group are Tucson, Ares, Boston, Fort Worth, Texas. We have been told by immigration and crime researchers that El Paso has not historically been considered one of the most dangerous cities in the United States. Guadalupe Correa Cabrera, a co-professor of government at George Mason University, whose experience includes relations between Mexico and the United States. The border fence did not reduce the rate of violent crime. The White House did not respond to the questions of Politifakt about the specific years or the barrier on which Trump based his claim. Trump is likely to echo the remarks of the Texas Prosecutor Ken Paxton. At a border security round table in January 10, Tramp reported that a barrier of more than 100 miles had been placed in El Paso, and the crime rate had become one of the lowest in the country. \"I think he was under Bush administration,\" said Paxton Trump. In a news release, the Paxton office later stated that it was talking about a 131-mile fence completed in 2010. Texas has about 131 miles of infantry fence. But not all of this is in El Paso, and it has been added over several periods. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 On 3 February 2021, former President George W. Bush signed the Security Act 2006, which called for the construction of barriers on the south-west border, including the El Paso area. Some 42 miles of fence was built in El Paso between August 2008 and July 2009, and was reported in a United States customs and border protection report. As the Paxton office said, it is not clear which specific fence ended in 2010. However, Trump's pride in the immediate fall of the crime does not stand. In 2007, the year before the construction of the fence, the violent crime rate in El Paso was 417.8 per 100,000 inhabitants. From 2007 to 2010, the rate rose by 5.5 per cent. From 2007 to 2011, the rate rose by 3.2 per cent. It also increased from 2006 to 2011, by 9.6 per cent. Despite the high rate of violent crime after the fence, this does not necessarily mean that the fence caused the nails to rise, as Charles E. Coburn, a scientist in criminology at the University of California-Irvine, said. Similarly, if the rate of violent crime decreased, it would be inappropriate to say that it was only because of the fence. \"If you really want to make a conclusion in one direction or another, you have to do a study that isolates the effect of a wall on crime, control other factors,\" said Coperin. Empirical data indicate that there is no significant difference in the average rate of violent crime in border and non-border urban areas, as mentioned in a report on border security issued in 2016 by the Congressional Research Service. However, \"the specific impact of border enforcement on border area crimes is unknown, as the available data cannot separate the impact of border enforcement from other factors,\" as the report said. Our Governor Trump said, \"The border city of El Paso, Texas, had very high rates of violent crime - one of the highest crimes in the country, considered one of the most dangerous cities of our nation. Now, live on its building, with a strong barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country.\" Crime data show that El Paso was not one of the most dangerous cities in the country. From 1985 to 2014, the rate of violent crime in El Paso was much lower than the average in cities of similar size. The border authorities added a fence in the El Paso area in the late 2000s. In the years before and after construction, the rate of violent crime increased, contrary to Trump &apos; s claim. Trump's statement is inaccurate. We assess it wrong.
