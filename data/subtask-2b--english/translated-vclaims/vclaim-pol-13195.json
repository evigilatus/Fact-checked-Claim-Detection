For general school teachers, the shift means that teachers &apos; assessments will be taken into account in their salaries. The new law, known as Senate Bill 5, has been signed by the Government of the Republic. (John Kasesh) but has not yet entered into force. Organized action groups and Democrats are trying to abolish SP5 through the referendum this fall because they say that the law is unfair to middle classes and working families. Tim Greendale, a Republican from Chesterland who voted against SB5 criticized the new structure for paying teachers during a television forum on the state budget on 18 April in Cleveland. \"In Senate Bill 5, there's this new method of evaluating teachers... you're also going to evaluate what parents think of you and can send home questionnaires and surveys to parents,\" said Greendale. Greendale said that allowing parents to play a role in evaluating teachers - and ultimately determining the amount of their remuneration - was problematic, as teachers were responsible for discipline of their children. Since Polyte Fact Ohio was still the subject of intense debate, and because lawmakers accused teachers &apos; unions of misleading their members on how the law would affect salaries, they decided to verify Greendale &apos; s claim. Under Strategic Plan 5 - The dramatic change in the law that reviews the collective bargaining of public officials and sets out many rules on wages and benefits - is a section devoted to paying teachers. The Act repeals the previous structure set out in the Act, which establishes increases based on the teacher &apos; s level of education and work experience. The law stipulates that school boards must adopt a wage structure based on teacher performance. The law does not provide for dollar amounts of salaries, but provides that the provinces must include five categories in the performance-based wage scale: any type of teacher's license, whether the teacher is \"highly qualified\" as defined by State law, student performance in classrooms, teacher performance assessments, and any other criteria the Council decides to include. The Greendale claim was for teacher evaluations, so let us withdraw from that aspect of the performance-based wage structure. The SB5 describes what teachers &apos; evaluations will be. The Act requires the State Council for Education to establish a framework for assessments. Local school districts then adopt their own specific assessments based on the State framework. Evaluations will include whether parents and students are satisfied with the teacher, \"which can be measured through surveys, questionnaires or other forms of feedback,\" as the law says. The teacher &apos; s assessments will also measure how the teacher works in the classroom, which can be measured by observations in the classroom; how the teacher communicates with pupils, parents, colleagues and members of the community; and the student &apos; s test scores. The local school community will have some discretion in deciding how to assess the various parts of teacher evaluations, but each of the factors provided for in the new law is expected to be covered. As Greendale pointed out in the budget forum, the law calls for the development of parent questionnaires to measure parental satisfaction. We're evaluating the statement right.
