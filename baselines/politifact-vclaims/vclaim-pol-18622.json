Bill #HR 7120.\"\nThe account that posted the claim noted in comments that the legislation is also called the \"George Floyd Justice Act.\"\u00a0\nOne person replied that they felt Floyd\u2019s death \"was plotted and manipulated.\"\u00a0\n\"Praying\u2026. emailing\u2026. calling\u2026.\" someone else said. \"WE SAY NO! NO! NO!!!\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nBut HR 7120, a piece of legislation that\u2019s also referred to as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020, does not even mention the United Nations.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill, which passed the Democratic-led House on June 25, is described as legislation \"to hold law enforcement accountable for misconduct in court, improve transparency through data collection, and reform police training and policies.\"\u00a0\nIt was introduced after the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed when a white police officer pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck. It\u2019s the \"most sweeping federal intervention into law enforcement in years,\" the New York Times said. \"It would eliminate legal protections that shield police officers from lawsuits, make it easier to prosecute them for wrongdoing, impose a new set of restrictions on the use of deadly force, and effectively ban the use of chokeholds.\"\nIt would also create a national registry to track police misconduct, require law enforcement agencies to report use of force data, ban no-knock warrants in federal drug cases, require officers to use more body and dashboard cameras, and tie some federal grants to law enforcement agencies adopting anti-discrimination training and practices.\u00a0\nHouse Republicans said the bill overreaches, and it has stalled in the Senate. President Donald Trump has also threatened to veto the legislation if it did reach his desk.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn June, Floyd\u2019s brother urged the United Nations to investigate racism, police brutality and police killings of unarmed Black people in the United States, the New York Times reported.\u00a0\nBut this bill in no way empowers the United Nations to run police boards in dozens of cities in the United States. The legislation does describe developing and creating best practices for civilian review boards \u2014\u00a0\"an administrative entity that investigates civilian complaints against law enforcement officers\" \u2014\u00a0 but as this 2018 Justice Department report notes, \"civilian oversight of law enforcement agencies is nothing new.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18622"}
