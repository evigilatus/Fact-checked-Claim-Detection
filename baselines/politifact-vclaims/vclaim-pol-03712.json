The primary election is Feb. 21, 2017.\nTo back up his claim, Humphries\u2019 campaign pointed to an analysis by the Wisconsin Reading Coalition, a grassroots group of educational advocates that wants changes in reading instruction.\nThe group has endorsed Humphries and believes Evers has not pushed education schools to use new methods for instructing teachers how to teach reading, said Steven Dykstra, a psychologist who co-founded the coalition.\nThe coalition published a historical look at Wisconsin\u2019s reading ranks based on annual results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which bills itself as the \"largest nationally representative and continuing assessment of what America's students know.\"\nThe ranking\nThe NAEP test, taken by a small sample of students, is the best source to analyze Humphries\u2019 claim, though it is not without drawbacks.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the 4th-grade scores, the only elementary-school grade that NAEP tests.\nNAEP publishes two types of rankings. One simply orders states by their average reading scores. But because those scores often are too closely bunched to be significant, NAEP also reports how many states have statistically higher or lower scores.\nHere\u2019s the history on Wisconsin\u2019s rankings, using both methods:\n1998: 6th by raw order; 1 state significantly higher\n2003: 22nd, 8 states significantly higher\n2005: 24th, 11 states\n2007: 25th, 8 states\n2009: 30th, 19 states\n2011: 25th, 15 states\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013: 31st, 15 states\n2015: 25th, 12 states\nSo by the cruder measure, the raw ranking, Wisconsin was a top-10 state.\nThe most recent year showed a ranking of 25th -- not the 30th Humphries claimed. But its ranking has been as low as 31st on 4th-grade reading during Evers time as superintendent. (Wisconsin\u2019s scores were stagnant while the national average increased).\nOn Evers\u2019 watch?\nSo the history helps Humphries\u2019 case, but did that decline come, as Humphries claimed, under Evers\u2019 watch?\nOnly if you define Evers\u2019 \"watch\" as dating to 2001, when he was appointed deputy superintendent of public instruction under newly-elected State Superintendent Elizabeth Burmaster.\nEvers took control of the agency after he won the spring 2009 election. At that point, Wisconsin\u2019s reading rank already had fallen to 30th, with 19 states significantly ahead.\nThat gives a different perspective on Evers\u2019 record.\nComparing the first test in Evers\u2019 time atop the agency to the most recent, the ranking improved from 30th to 25th, and from 19 states significantly better to 12 states.\nTwo final notes before we grade this.\nThe picture for Wisconsin is somewhat brighter using the second, more statistically precise ranking method published by NAEP.\nIn 1998, Wisconsin was sixth in raw order, but only one state was \"significantly higher.\" In the most recent three tests, Wisconsin\u2019s rank in raw order was 25th to 31st, but only 12-15 states were \"significantly higher.\"\nThe state Department of Public Instruction, the agency Evers heads, has used both measurements in its public statements on NAEP over the years.\nFinally, Wisconsin looks better on 8th-grade reading, where it ranks 9th. But Humphries\u2019 claim focused on referenced elementary school, generally considered Kindergarten-5th grade.\nOur rating\nHumphries said Wisconsin has \"dropped from a top 10 state in elementary reading to 30th in the nation\" under Evers.\nThe drop is real, by an oft-cited ranking from a credible source, but the latest rank is 25th, not 30th.\nAnd Facebook readers who aren\u2019t deeply familiar with Evers' career might assume from Humphries claim that the decline happened while Evers was state superintendent. Evers was a top staffer for much of that time, but most of the decline came before he took over.\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.\n\nShare the Facts\n\n\nPolitifact\n\n\n3\n6\n Politifact Rating:\n\u00a0\n\n\"We've dropped from a top 10 state in elementary reading to 30th in the nation\" under State Schools Superintendent Tony Evers\u2019 watch.\n\n\n\nJohn Humphries\nWisconsin state school superintendent candidate\n\n\nIn a Facebook post\nThursday, January 12, 2017\n01/12/2017\n\n\nRead More\ninfo", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03712"}
