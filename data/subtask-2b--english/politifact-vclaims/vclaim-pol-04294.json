Parker Briden, a campaign spokesman, said Greitens was referring to television attack ads aired against Greitens right before the primary.\n\n\nCampaign finance records\n\n\nBriden referred us to Missouri campaign finance reports filed by the Chris Koster campaign detailing contributions from Jobs and Opportunity, a political action committee. Koster won the Democratic primary for governor and will square off against Greitens in the general election in November.\n\n\nBeginning two weeks before the Aug. 8 primary, the PAC made four \"in-kind\" contributions \u2014 contributions of goods and services and not cash \u2014 to Koster for Missouri, Koster's campaign.\n\n\nThe in-kind contributions carried a total valuation of over $1 million, according to the reports filed by the Koster with the Missouri Ethics Commission. The largest contribution was reported as $713,082, made on July 29. The same week, two other contributions were made \u2014 one valued at $112,560, and another for $150,080. On Aug. 5, three days before the election, the committee made a final contribution valued at $25,710.82.\n\n\nAfter the donations were made, the Greitens campaign issued a press release titled \"Koster Caught in Conspiracy to Hijack Republican Primary.\"\n\n\n\"This is an attempt by national Democrats to steal an election in Missouri through meddling in the Republican primary,\" the release read.\n\n\nAttack ad\n\n\nThe reported contributions coincided with a series of television ads attacking Greitens that aired in the five days before the primary. A group called Jobs and Opportunity is credited for paying for the ad. A YouTube video of the ad was posted on July 29, about a week before the primary.\n\n\nAccording to Koster's campaign finance expenditures, his campaign normally pays between $500,000 and $700,000 for media advertising. No other single campaign expenditure comes close to that amount. That puts the PAC's contribution in perspective \u2014 it's unlikely a $1 million in-kind contribution would buy anything else.\n\n\nThe ad lambastes Greitens for accepting a separate $1 million contribution from Michael Goguen, a California-based tech financier. Goguen is the subject of a pending civil lawsuit with a woman who has accused him of sexual abuse.\n\n\n\"While others returned his money, Greitens says he's honored to take it,\" the ad's narrator says.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreitens is right: the Democratic Governors Association is behind money given to his Democratic opponent. The Washington, D.C. address for Jobs and Opportunity that the Koster campaign reported to the Missouri Ethics Commission is also the address for the Democratic Governors Association. A week before the election, Jobs and Opportunity made a $1 million in-kind contribution to Koster, which coincided with a TV ad attacking Greitens.\n\n\nAlthough the political action committee is unaffiliated with Koster\u2019s campaign, Koster's campaign had some knowledge of the ad before it aired, since the in-kind contribution was listed on Koster's campaign finance report.\n\n\nPACs that act independently from a candidate do not have to report contributions to that candidate's campaign, said James Thomas, the campaign treasurer for Catherine Hanaway, who was a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the primary. But when the PAC is in contact with the candidate, related contributions need to be reported.\n\n\nFor example, the PAC could have discussed when the ad's content or when it would be aired with Koster's campaign, Thomas said.\n\n\nSince Missouri has no limits on campaign contributions, it's okay that the PAC talked to Koster's campaign. It would be a different story if this were a federal election, though, Thomas said. Federal PACs can only contribute $5,000 to a candidate, so Jobs and Opportunity\u2019s $1 million in-kind contribution would be illegal.\n\n\nOn July 31, Greitens released an ad in response to the PAC's ad. In the ad, which has since drawn national attention, Greitens fires rounds of a machine gun into an open field.\n\n\n\"Eric Greitens is under attack from Obama's Democrat machine,\" the narrator of the ad says. \"When he fights back, he brings out the big guns.\"\n\n\nAfter the primary, Greitens said no other Democratic groups launched attack ads against any other Republican gubernatorial candidate, according to the Associated Press.\nWe also asked Austin Chambers, Greitens' campaign manager, why Greitens repeatedly cited President Barack Obama's involvement in the ad buy.\n\nChambers said the company the PAC hired to purchase the airtime for the ad is the same Obama has used for his ads. The company, named GMMB, produced ads for Obama during both of his presidential campaigns.\n\nAnd though Koster's donations were big, they were legal, despite Greitens' press release connoting Koster's involvement in illegal activity.\n\n\nKoster's campaign directed all questions to the spokesman for the PAC.\n\n\nMarvin Overby, an MU political science professor, said large donations like the PAC's are common before an election.\n\n\n\"This happens a lot. It's just part of the rough and tumble of politics,\" he said. \"I'm not sure the Greitens' campaign wouldn't have done the same thing.\"\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nGreitens said the Democratic Governors Association and \"the Obama political machine\" spent $1 million against him leading up to the primary election.\n\n\nA PAC with the same address as the Democratic Governors Association made four in-kind contributions totaling that amount in the weeks leading up to the election.\n\n\nAnd though both Obama and the PAC hired the same company to work on their ads, there's no evidence to support Greiten's statement that the \"Obama political machine\" colluded with the PAC.\n\n\nWe rate this claim as Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04294"}
