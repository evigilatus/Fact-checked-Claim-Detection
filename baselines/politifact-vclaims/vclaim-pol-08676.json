Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., hammered home her concern about the country\u2019s growing national debt.\nWhen she met with about 60 people at a town hall forum in Hudson, N.H., Ayotte stood beside a national debt counter projected onto a screen. It ticked away each new dollar added to the country\u2019s debts, which recently topped $17 trillion.\nAyotte said both parties bear responsibility, and that the debt can only be addressed through bipartisan cooperation.\n\"It took two parties to get us into debt. It\u2019s going to take two parties to get us out of debt,\" she said. \"Under President (George W. Bush), we added $4.9 trillion to the debt. Under President Obama, since he\u2019s been in office, we\u2019ve added $6.5 trillion to the debt,\" she said.\n\"I think all of us sort of on a gut basis understand why the $17 trillion debt is bad for the country, because at home, if we didn\u2019t pay our bills, eventually we get to a point where if our bills end up being more than we\u2019re taking in, we go bankrupt.\"\nThroughout his first term, Obama was saddled with criticism that deficit spending has ballooned under his watch. PolitiFact has checked a variety of these claims in the past, but with Ayotte again drawing attention to the national debt, we thought it would be useful to take another look.\nIt\u2019s somewhat tricky to calculate how much money Obama is responsible for adding to the national debt. The point at which Obama starts to bear responsibility for debt increases is a matter of dispute.\nNormally, presidents inherit budget policies from their predecessors, but because Obama took office during an economic free-fall, several big-ticket budgetary items, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program, could plausibly be ascribed to a combination of the two presidents. (See a full discussion here and here.)\nHowever, the simplest way to analyze Ayotte\u2019s claim is to look at the size of the debt on the day Obama took office -- January 20, 2009 -- and compare it to the debt level today. This is what Ayotte was getting at when she cited the increase in the national debt \"since he\u2019s been in office.\"\nAnother challenge in assessing Ayotte\u2019s claim is the fact that there are at least two ways to measure the national debt.\n\"Public debt\" is one measurement commonly used by the U.S. Department of Treasury. It includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Bass\n\n\nstated on June 8, 2012 in an email to the press on June 8, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Ann Kuster said the debate over America\u2019s debt limit is not an important issue of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Maryalice Gill \u2022 June 29, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother commonly cited figure is the country\u2019s total debt, or gross federal debt. This number is higher. It includes public debt plus government debts, such as the money borrowed from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds to fund government operations, which are effectively government IOUs to itself.\nHere, the context in which Ayotte made her claim is helpful in determining whether she was referring to public debt or total debt. Before discussing Obama, Ayotte said that former president Bush added $4.9 trillion to the national debt during his time in office.\nBush did in fact increase the national debt by $4.9 trillion if you measure by total debt, or gross federal debt. For this reason, we\u2019ll assume Ayotte was also speaking about total debt when she discussed the $6.5 trillion increase under Obama.\nCrunching the numbers\nOn Jan. 20, 2009, the date of Obama's inauguration, the debt held by the public stood at roughly $6.307 trillion, according to the Treasury Department\u2019s \"Debt to the Penny\" calculator. The total debt, or gross federal debt, was about $10.627 trillion.\nNext, we need to calculate how much the debt increased as of Oct. 24, 2013 -- the date Ayotte made her remark in Hudson. By that date, the debt held by the public was about $12.122 trillion and total debt had climbed to nearly $17.1 trillion.\nSo, since Obama took office, debt held by the public increased by about $5.815 trillion, and total debt increased by about $6.451 trillion.\nSo she was right on the money. Ayotte overstated the increase by about $49 billion, which is a lot of money, but it\u2019s a tiny fraction of the country\u2019s multi-trillion dollar debt.\nOne final note: On claims where a speaker takes credit or assigns blame for a statistic, we usually take a two-part approach to rating the claim\u2019s accuracy. Is the number right? And is the credit or blame correctly assigned?\nIn this case, Obama doesn\u2019t deserve full \"blame\" for the debt growth on his watch, since about two-thirds of the annual deficit during his term has been from entitlements and interest. Entitlements, such as Social Security and Medicare, are less susceptible to a president\u2019s policy preferences than discretionary spending that Congress must approve on an annual basis. Entitlements are also more heavily driven by demographic factors, such as the aging of the population, which is also out of any president\u2019s control. Meanwhile, a sizable share of the interest being paid today is paying off debts accumulated under previous presidents.\nThat said, we\u2019re not going to dock Ayotte for how she assigned blame, because her claim was carefully evenhanded. Even as she applied \"blame\" to Obama, she said the same applied to Bush. Her statement that \"it took two parties to get us into debt. It\u2019s going to take two parties to get us out of debt\" is distinctly bipartisan in tone.\nOur ruling\nAyotte said that the country has added $6.5 trillion to the national debt since Obama took office and $4.9 trillion under Bush. When measuring by total debt, she\u2019s correct on both counts. We rate her claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08676"}
