You know, we're pretty much at the 50 percent mark,\" Trump said June 28. \"We're getting them out as fast as we can get them out, and we're freeing up towns.\"\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s comment caught our attention since this is one of the most notorious gangs in the country. Is he halfway there in deporting thousands of MS-13 gang members?\nNot exactly.\nThere\u2019s an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. The latest data shows immigration officials have deported 2,798 gang members in fiscal year 2017 \u2014 that\u2019s members of all gangs and includes several months when former President Barack Obama was in office.\nMS-13 in the United States\nTrump\u2019s June 28 remarks weren\u2019t the first he\u2019s made about MS-13 and his administration\u2019s efforts against them. At a rally this month in Iowa, he told supporters his administration was \"moving them out of the country by the thousands.\"\nIn April, he falsely tweeted that Obama\u2019s policies allowed MS-13 to form across the United States, and again that his administration was removing them fast. But multiple experts told us there is no evidence Obama\u2019s policies caused the gang\u2019s growth in the country.\nMS-13 grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s.\nIt\u2019s grown into an international criminal organization with more than 30,000 members worldwide, the Justice Department said in an April 18, 2017, fact sheet.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to peg down exactly how many MS-13 gang members there are in the United States.\nTrump\u2019s Justice Department in April said there were more than 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. FactCheck.org noted that for years the 10,000 figure has been a consistent estimate.\nMS-13 deportations under Trump\nWe asked the White House for evidence backing Trump\u2019s claim, but did not get an on-the-record response.\nA specific number of MS-13 gang members deported is not available because officials don\u2019t track removals by specific gang, Dani Bennett, spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement previously told us. (The FBI says there\u2019s around 33,000 violent street gangs, motorcycle gangs, and prison gangs criminally active in the U.S. and Puerto Rico \u2014 with an estimated 1.4 million members.)\u00a0\nBut ICE \"does specifically target MS-13 members for arrest and removal on the basis of their immigration violations,\" Bennett said, adding that deportations include foreign fugitives wanted for crimes committed abroad and who are removable under U.S. immigration law.\nSo far in fiscal year 2017, ICE said it has removed 2,798 gang members.\nEven if all of them were MS-13 gang members, that would still be short of Trump\u2019s claim that \"we're pretty much at the 50 percent mark\" \u2014 since the Justice Department in April said there\u2019s an estimated 10,000 gang members in the country.\nAlso, fiscal year 2017 started Oct. 1, 2016, when Obama was still in office.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"We're pretty much at the 50 percent mark\" on deportations of MS-13 gang members.\nTrump\u2019s Justice Department has said there\u2019s an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States.\u00a0\nThe latest available data from ICE shows 2,798 gang members have been removed in fiscal year 2017. But that includes members of all gangs, not just MS-13. Even if all were MS-13, that would not be half of the estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the country. And fiscal year 2017 includes more than three months that Obama was in office.\nTrump\u2019s statement is not accurate.
