But word of the release prompted panic as legislators and officials scrambled to block the action. Before the federal judge\u2019s ruling, at least 21 attorneys general filed suit to stop the blueprints from going live.\nAs conversation heated up, President Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter. \"I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public,\" he said. \"Already spoke to NRA, doesn\u2019t seem to make much sense!\"\nI am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nTrump\u2019s last-minute statement gave us pause, too, so we decided to look at the settlement. Was the Trump administration \u2014 or Trump \u2014 actually behind it?\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment\u00a0(though Trump's press secretary said later that he did not get a chance to weigh in). So we searched elsewhere for our answer.\nLitigation has roots in Obama years\nOn May 5, 2013, Defense Distributed uploaded blueprints online that could be used to make a working 3D-printed gun called \"The Liberator,\" as well as a 53-second video of founder Cody Wilson firing one.\nWilson soon received a letter from the Obama administration\u2019s State Department demanding that he remove the files from the internet. The letter said the \"technical data\" amounted to an illegal gun export in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations, because it could be accessed in countries where the United States does not sell weapons.\nThe State Department instructed Wilson to take down the files until he applied for specific approval of the gun\u2019s multiple components. By that point, the blueprints had already been downloaded 100,000 times.\nIn response, Wilson filed a lawsuit against the State Department with the help of Second Amendment Foundation, a guns-rights organization, in which he sought a preliminary injunction to allow continued publication of the gun files online.\nUnder both the Obama and Trump administrations, the government stuck by its assertion that the \"technical data\" constituted an illegal gun export. Wilson countered that the government\u2019s intervention violated his First Amendment right to free speech.\nUltimately, district and appeals courts both rejected Wilson\u2019s injunction request. But as the case turned to the First Amendment claim, the government made an unexpected settlement offer.\nSettlement offer from Trump\u2019s State Department\nWith the settlement, reached in June and announced July 10, the government waived the relevant export restrictions and allowed Wilson to post the blueprints online as early as Aug. 1.\nSpecifically, the State Department announced that it was \"in the interest of the security and foreign policy of the United States\" to temporarily modify the U.S. Munitions List to exclude the technical data for the 3-D-printed guns.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefense-related items on the munitions list face tight restrictions, because they offer a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States. The U.S. Commerce Department manages a separate export list with fewer restrictions.\nIt is not clear what role Trump or the White House played in the settlement decision, though White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u00a0said during an Aug. 1 press briefing that the Department of Justice instructed the State Department to settle without White House approval. The State Department has said that its role in this issue relates solely to regulation of exports of certain types of firearms and any related technical data.\nBut the move to shift the 3D-printed guns\u2019 technical data outside of the State Department\u2019s purview was not without precedent. The government\u2019s decision came amid a longstanding but relatively behind-the-scenes administrative project \u2014 started under the Obama administration and known as \"export control reform\" \u2014 to restructure the regulations governing exports of weapons and technologies.\nWhy is Obama\u2019s export control reform relevant?\nJust as the litigation against Wilson can be traced back to the Obama years, so, too, can the export control changes that may have opened the door for the State Department\u2019s settlement.\nBeginning in 2009, the Obama administration launched an overhaul of export control in order to refine regulations for items that were subject to both the State Department\u2019s International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administration Regulations.\nThe goal of the reform was to streamline export controls by transferring commercially available items \u2014 such as consumer guns \u2014 off the USML and onto the less restrictive Commerce Control List.\nThe State Department began reviewing the munitions list, sifting through each category and removing items that were not considered military-sensitive. By 2016, it had finished reviewing all but three categories: firearms, ammunition and artillery.\nHowever, reform of those final categories stalled before it could become policy. A proposed rule would have handed jurisdiction of commercial firearms export controls to the Commerce Department in 2012, but it was delayed following the Sandy Hook school shooting.\nThat proposed rule did not regain momentum until 2018, under Trump. On May 24, the Departments of State and Commerce simultaneously published proposals in the Federal Register to amend the final three categories of the munitions list.\nThe proposed revisions would keep military-grade weapons under State Department jurisdiction and place commercially available firearms under the purview or the Commerce Department.\nAccording to the New York Times, these proposals strongly resemble the Obama administration\u2019s 2012 version. CNN reported that the government is currently reviewing them.\nThis may explain the State Department\u2019s sudden decision to settle its case with Wilson. By recommending that commercial firearm exports move under Commerce Department oversight, the May 24 proposals would likely free Wilson\u2019s blueprints from the International Traffic in Arms Regulations that previously restricted them.\n\"My guess is that it was somehow wrapped up in the movement of items from the (U.S. Munitions List) to the (Commerce Control List),\" said Rachel Stohl, managing director at the Stimson Center and an expert in the international arms trade. \"If you deregulate the weapons themselves, it would follow that the technical specs could be deregulated as well.\"\nStohl added that the settlement was \"unexpected\" and \"the State and Commerce Departments have been less than forthcoming on these details.\"\nFor his part, Wilson has agreed to refrain from posting his blueprints for at least another month while the multi-state lawsuit travels through the courts.\nOur ruling\nA headline suggested that the government settlement that would have made 3D-printable guns available for download was actually a Trump administration decision, and that Trump said that didn't \"make much sense.\"\nWe could not independently determine the extent of Trump\u2019s involvement, although Sanders said the president was not afforded the opportunity to approve of the settlement decision. But the State Department under Trump did initiate the settlement after previously taking steps to clear a path for it.\nHowever, the Obama administration\u2019s export control reform made those steps possible, and it is not far-fetched to consider the Trump administration\u2019s move a continuation of that initiative.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2018-08-02 16:16:47 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  Says Donald Trump contradicted his own administration when he said the decision to allow blueprints for 3D-printed guns to be distributed \"doesn\u2019t seem to make much sense.\"    Internet Rumors Bloggers https://addictinginfo.com/2018/07/31/trump-my-own-administrations-latest-decision-doesnt-seem-to-make-much-sense/   in a blog Tuesday, July 31, 2018 2018-07-31    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01775"}
