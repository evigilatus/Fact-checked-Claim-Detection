The news is filled with stories of small businesses and colleges cutting back worker's hours or putting a freeze on hiring.\"\nHe responded, \"I think that's highly misleading. Since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions.\" (The Affordable Care Act is the more formal name of Obama\u2019s health care law.)\nIn the other item, we checked a claim made by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that \"this year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part-time.\"\nThese two comments paint sharply different pictures, so we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nFor Krueger, we checked the change in full-time and part-time employment between March 2010 and July 2013, then determined which of the two types of employment accounted for a larger share of the increase in overall employment.

A shorter time frame would show the opposite pattern, but on the numbers, Krueger is right. We rate the claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09020"}
