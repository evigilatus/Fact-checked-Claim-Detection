The tweet says, \"#GraduateTogether #Classof2020, are you ready to lead in your community? Join us at obama.org.\"\u00a0\n\"This picture is from the Obama Foundation. It was posted May 16th, 2020,\" the Facebook post says. \"George Floyd was killed May 25th, 2020. Why was The Obama Foundation posting this picture of George Floyd before he died?\"\nA spokesperson for the Obama Foundation told PolitiFact that the photo with the George Floyd protest sign was a preview image for the foundation\u2019s website, obama.org. The\u00a0photo was taken May 30 and first used on the site on May 31, according to the spokesperson.\u00a0\nHow could this photo be attached to a tweet posted before Floyd\u2019s death? To understand that, it helps to know how Twitter handles the images that appear with some tweets.\nTwitter allows certain certified account holders to designate a preset image, called a card, to appear automatically with tweets that include a link to the website associated with their accounts. According to Twitter Developer, Twitter\u2019s computers scour sites on the Internet every week or so to check for updates to these designated images. When those computers recognize a change from a site\u2019s owner, Twitter updates the image on all the tweets linking to that site \u2014 including past ones.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe protest image appeared on obama.org, without a photo credit, on May 31 with an Obama Foundation press release about organizations that are working to end systemic racism and police brutality in the United States. (A reverse-image search didn\u2019t turn up any earlier appearances of the photo on the Internet.) When the foundation designated that image as its card for obama.org, the image began to appear on Twitter with its earlier tweets also.\nIt\u2019s similar to the way, say, Facebook shows a user\u2019s current profile picture with a post. When users change their profile pictures, the new one appears alongside future posts, and past ones.\nBut unlike Twitter, Facebook doesn\u2019t retroactively apply the preset images that are associated with websites. So, any Facebook post from mid-May that includes a link to the Obama Foundation\u2019s website would continue to show whatever image was set as the site\u2019s card at that time.\nOur ruling\u00a0\nA Facebook post claims that a tweet from the Obama Foundation appears with a photo from a George Floyd protest before Floyd\u2019s death.\u00a0\nThe photo was not part of the tweet when it was posted. It was a preview image associated with the Obama Foundation website that Twitter applied retroactively to tweets linking to obama.org.\u00a0\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17969"}
