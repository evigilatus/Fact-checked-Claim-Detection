Erickson\u2019s opening sentence hones in on Apple chief executive Tim Cook for what he sees as hypocritical business practices.\n\"To recap: Tim Cook (please, please click this link) and the left are happy to do business in countries that stone to death or otherwise jail gay people, but will not do business with Indiana,\" Erickson wrote, \"which merely passed a law insisting that the \u2018free exercise\u2019 clause of the first amendment be on the same legal footing in courts as the \u2018free speech\u2019 clause of the first amendment.\"\nErickson would not respond to our requests for more information, but his point is fairly evident: Apple will do business in countries where being gay is illegal (there were more than 70 such countries as of 2013) but won\u2019t do business with Indiana.\nThat turns out to be putting words in Apple\u2019s mouth.\nWhat Cook said\nCook, who has been Apple\u2019s CEO since 2011, started speaking out against Indiana\u2019s religious freedom law with a couple of tweets March 27, the day after Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed the measure into law.\n\nCook wasn\u2019t done criticizing the law. In a March 29 Washington Post op-ed, Cook, who is gay, warned that the legislation in Indiana and other states allows people to cite personal religious beliefs as a reason not to serve a customer based on sexual orientation. (Some experts say such refusals along these lines under Religious Freedom Restoration Acts would not win out in court, but the law may lead some people to think they have that right.)\n\"Our message, to people around the country and around the world, is this: Apple is open,\" he wrote. \"Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love. Regardless of what the law might allow in Indiana or Arkansas, we will never tolerate discrimination.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCook also said, \"on behalf of Apple, I\u2019m standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation \u2014 wherever it emerges.\"\nStrong words, yes. But like his tweets, the op-ed said nothing about the company no longer doing business with Indiana.\nWe searched and found no other instance of Cook, or Apple, making comments about Indiana\u2019s law or suggesting they would not do business in, or with, the state.\nErickson did not respond to us via our email, phone or Twitter queries. Instead, he posted a blog on RedState saying \"Seriously. Sometimes a tweet is just a tweet.\" (Erickson\u2019s post was not a tweet, it was a column.)\nErickson isn\u2019t alone among bloggers in the right-wing blogosphere who hold up the company\u2019s Middle East presence in criticizing the CEO\u2019s stance toward Indiana.\nApple has locations in predominantly Muslim countries where some states or sects under sharia law punish homosexuality with death, including Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Qatar.\nAs for Indiana, the state is home to two Apple retail stores in malls in Indianapolis and Mishawaka. Both were still in operation April 2, 2015, when we called.\nAn Apple spokesman\u00a0offered no additional comment.\nOur ruling\nIn trying to call out Apple\u2019s Cook for clashing business practices over gay rights, Erickson said Cook \"will not do business with Indiana.\" \u00a0\nThat is not true based on Cook\u2019s public remarks on Twitter and in an op-ed. Cook has been outspoken in his position against the law and others like it across the country, but Apple stores remain open in Indiana and iPhones, iMacs and everything else is still being sold.\nErickson\u2019s claim rates False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06558"}
