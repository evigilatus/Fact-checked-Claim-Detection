She told a crowd in Michigan that she had the best record of voting against the Cabinet candidates for President Donald Trump. \"I voted against Betsy Davos,\" said Gilbrand, referring to the Minister of Education. \"I voted against most of President Trump's candidates in his Government, because they were either unqualified or did not have the necessary expertise. I have the best voting record against Trump's candidates for anyone else's presidential candidate. Trump presented thousands of candidates for Senate confirmation, from seats in the United States Supreme Court to appointments to various government councils. In the context of Gilbert's statements, we have decided to investigate the New York Senate's record of voting for Cabinet-level positions. The Trump Council of Ministers comprises the 15 executive heads, such as the Minister of Health and Human Services and the Minister of Defence, and other appointments, such as the United States Commercial Representative, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Director of National Intelligence. Most of them require confirmation by the Senate. We examined the voting on each of these votes and took note of the votes cast by six senators running for the Democratic Presidency: Gilbert, Corey Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobochar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. There were 29 votes for Cabinet-level positions in the Trump administration, including 19 currently appointed and 10 appointed and left. Some of these positions were filled more than once because of resignations, as in the case of the Prosecutor, where William Bar Jeff Seaters was succeeded. The President has discretion as to whether certain positions will be part of the Council of Ministers. For example, the post of United Nations Ambassador was at the Cabinet level when Nikki Haile was appointed in 2017. Since Haley's resignation was announced in 2018, an official in Trump said that the post would no longer become a Cabinet-level post. The opposition of Trump was a strong subject in the voting records for senators seeking to take up the office of President. The six voted against several Trump candidates, including Minister of Energy Rick Perry, Minister of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, Minister of the Treasury Stephen Menoshin, and both the Ministers of Health and Human Services Tom Price and Alex Azar. Colin Schmidt mentioned on January 14, 2021 at a press conference \"We have scientific data, from all different levels, but especially from high school sports levels, from many different states that show that it's safe to play what New York thinks of high-risk sports.\" The nomination of Ellen Chow as Secretary of Transportation received 93-6 votes in the Senate, with yes votes from Harris and Klobochar but no votes from Gilbert, Booker, Sanders and Warren. Gilbrand voted only twice to appoint the members of the Council of Ministers in Trump, Haley as United Nations Ambassador, and David Schulkin as the Department of Veterans Affairs. 27 times voted against the candidates for the Council of Ministers in Trump. Warren and Sanders each had 26 votes against and three votes in favour of those candidates in the Council of Ministers. Booker and Harris had 25 votes against them and four votes in their favor. Klobochar voted to confirm 12 Trump candidates, headed by senators seeking to be President, while 17 other Cabinet candidates were voted against. We also considered a roll-call vote for the many other Trump candidates to obtain an idea of the rest of the Gillibrand record, although this number did not affect our judgment. With very few exceptions, Gilbrand also voted against these candidates, such as Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein (one out of six votes to no, along with Booker, Harris Warren) and United States Supreme Court Judge Brett Cavanaugh, whose appointment exceeded 50-48. I voted yes on RD. James to be Assistant Secretary of the Army, who got 89-1 votes, with Sanders opposing. As I voted yes on two judicial appointments, Claria Horn Boom, opposed only by Sanders, and Ralph Eriksson, opposed only by Warren. Many appointments have been approved by the Senate by vote. In his analysis of voting records on all matters (not limited to Trump's appointments), the website FifthThirdEat found that Gillibrand had the lowest index numbers in line with Trump's positions. The ruling Gillibrand sought to distinguish itself from the area of democratic presidential candidates by means of a statement that recorded her vote against stronger cabinet candidates in Trump. I voted against 27 of his candidates while Warren and Sanders modeled 26. Poker and Harris voted 25 times against the candidates of the Trump Council of Ministers, and Klobochar voted 17 times against them. We appreciate that Gilbrand's statement is correct.
