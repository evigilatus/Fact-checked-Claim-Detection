In a recent television announcement echoing attacks late in the campaign that recruits said worked during the GOP tour, Republican candidate David Birdo goes after democracy Michelle Nane for a supposed weakness on border security. But before it reaches this point, the flag begins with a simple statement: \"Michel Nan herself says that she has financed organizations linked to terrorists.\" If this is not clear enough, the accumulation in all major writings illustrates what he calls a \"clear quote\" from Nan's campaign document: \"directs prisoners and terrorists.\" A simple sentence but serious consequences. Is the announcement true that Michelle Nan recognizes financial ties with terrorists? The company Polyte Fact Georgia decided to take a closer look. The conservative national review in July revealed that he had a series of 144 pages of Nan campaign notes from last December. The story was published about a week after Birdo won the Republican nomination, in part by attacking the rival of the American Republic (Jack Kingston) as \"a supporter of amnesty\" and in the pocket of the United States Chamber of Commerce. The leaked notes outline the Nan campaign strategy and include, inter alia, detailed fund-raising plans, a public relations strategy and a list of anticipated attacks in the race. In these attacks and the anticipated weaknesses, reference is made to \"service awards for inmates and terrorists\" during her tenure. The plan calls on its team to have \"pushback\" documents ready for those anticipated issues, as well as the broader joint attacks against democratic candidates. This means that Camp N rightly expected the General Democratic Party to attack her in this matter, and there is no connection with her. And about that connection? The previous spokesperson, Derek Dickie, said that the statement was based first on documents leaked from Nan, and then cited a national review story to follow up on the leak as evidence of the terrorist connection. Dickie said, \"That's not something we pulled out of thin air.\" The story points to the link that Polyte Fact Georgia has already been judged to be often wrong when it was used in a declaration of an attack from the Labour Fund to terminate expenditure. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook that says that Nancy Belusi sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"inducing him to commit to a proven democratic playbook.\" By Sierra Orourc on January 11, 2021, the super-buck - which reached some $2.8 million and injected the most external money into Georgia's Senate race - focused his attack on the Fish mission, a work that had been owned by light spots until 2012 and raised donations from eBay users for some 20,000 charities. One of these charities, the Islamic Relief Organization of the United States of America, received approximately $13,500 in donations from the Fish Mission and participated with the Islamic Relief Group worldwide in disaster relief programmes. A high-ranking Israeli defence official accused the Israeli Republican Army of having links with the Hamas terrorist group and, in June, the Minister of Defence prevented him from working there. In 2012, a British bank closed an IRW account due to counter-terrorism concerns. However, the United States Department of State does not consider the group a terrorist organization or a front. The United Kingdom Committee on Charities, which regulates the affairs of the International Republican Army, has also found no such links. The non-profit organization issued a statement following Israel &apos; s embargo, in which it strongly denied any connection to terrorism. At the same time, Islamic Relief in the United States of America receives an excellent degree from a Navegator charity for its transparency and calculation. The group provides grants to Relief Workers International for humanitarian programmes in developing countries, as it does with other groups, as was said by Defence Adviser Sharif Ali. But it also works with the American Red Cross and other charities in disaster relief, such as ongoing flood assistance efforts in the Detroit area. \"We're not terrorists and we don't support terrorism,\" Ally said. \"Any money disbursed, within or outside the United States, follows all regulations to ensure this.\" Nan refused to be attracted to the debate this summer, when the note was first disclosed. The notes, including the anticipated attacks, had been more advice from supporters than a rigorous blueprint for the electoral campaign. Nathan Nakle, Nan &apos; s spokesman, told Politi Fakt Georgia that N, of course, \"surely\" does not support terrorism or have any links with terrorists. \"That's not what the memo says,\" said the click. \"He's expecting attacks that mischaracterize her record and distort her experience.\" That's exactly what happened.\" Where does this leave us with an attack that says Michelle Nan's internal documents say that she financed organizations with terrorist connections? The Birdo clearly misunderstands what Nan's internal memoirs said and why. The Politi Fakt Georgia company has already ruled that Nan &apos; s non-profit act is linked to terrorism outside Al-Qaida. The effort to establish a link by improperly citing the notes leaked by her campaign is about to do what is ridiculous. We're assessing the allegation of pants on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07245"}
