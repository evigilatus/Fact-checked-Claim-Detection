It starts its historical claim by stating:\n\"After the Japanese decimated our fleet in Pearl Harbor Dec 7, 1941, they could have sent their troop ships and carriers directly to California to finish what they started. The prediction from our Chief of Staff was we would not be able to stop a massive invasion until they reached the Mississippi River. Remember, we had a 2 million man army and war ships in other localities, so why did they not invade? After the war, the remaining Japanese generals and admirals were asked that question. Their answer....they know that almost every home had guns and the Americans knew how to use them.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIt\u2019s not a new claim. In a video posted in 2012, Ed Emery, a Repubican state senator from Missouri, claimed that it is known that Japan was deterred not by America\u2019s armed services but because \"every American was armed.\"\nInvasion not seriously weighed\nThe surprise aerial attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor on Oahu Island, Hawaii, climaxed a decade of worsening relations between the United States and Japan, and precipitated the entry of the United States into World War II, as Encyclopedia Britannica puts it.\nBut the success didn\u2019t mean Japan was poised to march into\u00a0California.\n\"The Japanese didn't plan to invade the U.S., never considered it seriously and knew they couldn't succeed,\" said Jonathan Dresner, a history professor at Pittsburg State University in Kansas whose specialties include Japanese history.\u00a0\nWhen Japan lost its main aircraft carriers in the Battle of Midway seven months after Pearl Harbor, any thought of a mainland invasion \"was doomed and abandoned,\" Fred Notehelfer told us.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

There is only so much a small island state in Asia can do, no matter how skilled its armed forces,\" he said.\n\"Geographic space, logistics, other commitments\u2014these considerations would have outweighed any concerns about an armed American populace.\"\nIan Toll, author of \"The Conquering Tide: War in the Pacific Islands, 1942-1944\" and \"Pacific Crucible: War at Sea in the Pacific, 1941-1942,\" told us that regarding an invasion, the Japanese \"had plans on a shelf, but never seriously considered putting them into action,\" and that \"I\u2019ve never come across anything to suggest that gun ownership was a factor in Japan\u2019s decision.\"\n\"In June 1942, some Americans were concerned the Japanese would advance into Alaska and then through Canada to the northwest,\" he said. \"But the scale of the operation was simply beyond their national capabilities, measured by troop numbers, naval power, or shipping.\"\nPromoters of the guns deterring an invasion theory also point to this quote attributed to Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto:\u00a0\n\"You cannot invade mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind each blade of grass.\"\nBut the quote is \"unsubstantiated and almost certainly bogus, even though it has been repeated thousands of times in various Internet postings,\" FactCheck.org reported.\u00a0\nToll told us: \"It is true that Yamamoto told others in the Japanese government and military that invading North America was unrealistic, but I know of no source that has him citing gun ownership as a factor.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says the Japanese military did not invade the mainland United States after Pearl Harbor because \"they know that almost every home had guns and the Americans knew how to use them.\"\nFour experts told us there is no evidence that Japan ever seriously considered such an invasion and that military limitations, not Americans armed with hunting weapons, were the reasons why.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17575"}
