After looking at the basic data, we found that it's not far. When we contacted the party, they referred to a report prepared by the National Partnership for Women and the Family in April 2019. The report states that \"between women in full-time positions throughout the year in the United States, black women are usually paid 61 cents, indigenous American women 58 cents and Latin women only 53 cents per dollar paid to white and non-Spanish men.\" These figures are not exactly the same as those presented by the party, but correspond to last year &apos; s version of the partnership report. So the data is a little old. In addition, it should be noted that the State party excluded part of the description. The National Partnership for Women and the Family compared women in full-time positions throughout the year, not just women in any amount of time. They were also comparing those figures with white men, other than Spanish, and not with men more generally. It's probably gonna make a difference. So we decided to look at the basic data of the Census Bureau in order to compare tweeting in fact -- the profits of black women, Native American women, and Spanish compared to all men. Overall, according to census data, the average income of all male workers was $44,408. For black women, $29,708 and for women of Spanish origin, $24,245. On January 18, 2021 in the Committee &apos; s discussion. \u2022 28 January 2021, which means that Afro-American women receive 67 cents for every dollar earned by men, while women of Spanish origin receive 55 cents. It was difficult to locate data on Native American women. The National Partnership for Women and the Family referred to a different data set from the Census Bureau. According to this data set, men earned an average of $39,819, while indigenous American women earned $23,214. This is up to 58 cents on the dollar, as the tweet said. In any case, the figure in the tweet for African Americans was four cents off, for Spanish Americans the figure was 1% lower, and for Native Americans the figure was accurate. So, two Twitter numbers are unknown, but not much. Last note: As we have written before, this figure refers to the general disparity between what men and women earn and does not compare apples with apples. These comparisons are not adapted to factors such as the grades and jobs exercised by women, the time they take to care for children, or the years of their experience. Other studies have shown a closer match between men and women in the same jobs. The ruling West Virginia Democratic Party wrote on Twitter: \"Black women earn only about 63 cents while native American women earn 58 cents, and women of Spanish origin earn only 54 cents compared to every dollar made by men.\" The tweet is suitable for indigenous American women, but the figures for black women and women of Spanish origin are 67 cents and 55 cents, respectively. That's not exactly what the tweet said, but it's not far. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.
