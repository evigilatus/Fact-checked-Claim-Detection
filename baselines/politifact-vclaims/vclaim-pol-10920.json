It also cites a March 17, 2009, article in The New York Times about the outcry over disclosures that the American International Group paid $165 million in bonuses. The story does not mention Brown.\n\nWhen PolitiFact Ohio contacted Mandel's campaign, also cited a Fox Business story that the stimulus legislation allowed firms like AIG, which had received funds through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, to give out executive bonuses that had been agreed on prior to the bill becoming law.\n\nPresident George W. Bush pressed Congress to approve TARP to rescue the financial industry and avert what many feared could be a doomsday economic collapse. The Senate approved it 74-25 on Oct. 1., 2008. Brown and Ohio's then-Sen. George Voinovich were among the the 39 Democrats, 34 Republicans and one independent senator who voted for it.\n\nMandel has been publicly critical of Brown\u2019s vote for TARP, which Mandel says he would have opposed.\n\nBut the root of the statement that Brown \"gave huge bonuses to executives\" isn\u2019t in TARP. It is a provision of the stimulus legislation that allowed the AIG bonuses.\n\nThe final stimulus bill included restrictions on bonuses that were less stringent than those in an earlier version of the legislation. The earlier Senate version of the stimulus bill, which Brown voted for, would have capped executive pay and forbidden any firm that received TARP funds from giving out bonuses.\n\nNo such restriction was in the version passed by the House. When the two versions went to closed-door conference negotiations to work out a final compromise, the ban was rewritten to allow bonuses be paid on contracts signed before the bill's passage. That means bonuses that the companies, negotiating with their employees, had already approved.\n\nThen-Sen. Chris Dodd, the Connecticut Democratic who was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, wrote the amendment in the first Senate version of the stimulus bill that would have banned all bonuses. He said his amendment was altered before final passage at the request of the White House and the Treasury Department.\n\n\"At the time,\" the Wall Street Journal reported, \"few objected to that move, which was designed to ensure the measure was constitutional.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo where does that leave the Mandel claim?\n\nBrown did vote for the final version of the stimulus bill. But to label the stimulus bill as a vote to give \"huge bonuses to executives\" isn\u2019t just inaccurate and misleading, it\u2019s ridiculous. \u00a0\n\nBrown, in fact, had voted to ban all bonuses, but that ban was loosened in House-Senate negotiations before the final version was enacted. The legislation prohibited use of federal money for future bonuses.\n\nBut the bill did not enable bonus-paying that would not have existed otherwise. More importantly, while the bill did not prevent the AIG bonuses, it is not accurate to say that the bill -- or Brown -- \"gave\" anything. AIG gave the bonuses to its executives before the stimulus legislation was approved.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim that Brown \"huge bonuses to executives\" rates Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10920"}
