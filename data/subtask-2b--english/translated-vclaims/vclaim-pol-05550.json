If Hillary Clinton became president, she might find herself busy with an FBI investigation, the former state of Florida Goof. The Bush pocket said in a presidential presidential debate in South Carolina. \"She's under investigation with the FBI now,\" said Bush Jan 14. \"If elected, her first 100 days -- instead of setting an agenda, she might go back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.\" Actually, Clinton's not under FBI investigation. The investigation referred to by Bush is conducted about Clinton's private e-mail server, who was used as Secretary of State. It's not a criminal investigation. Here are the facts. In July 2015, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community sent a so-called security transfer to members of the executive branch. The security referral is essentially a notification that confidential information may be located outside the Government &apos; s possession. In this case, the site was a private e-mail server for Clinton. Shortly thereafter, The New York Times wrongly stated that the inspectors had requested a criminal investigation into Clinton's use of e-mail - rather than security referral. However, the newspaper later issued two corrections. The referral was related to the Clinton novel, not whether Clinton itself mishandled the information and did not claim criminal activity. Officials told journalists at the time that the FBI did not specifically target Clinton. As part of its investigation, the FBI considered the security preparation of the home server and the drive containing copies of Clinton &apos; s work e-mail. However, most of the details of the investigation remained confidential. It is even unclear at this stage whether the FBI investigation was merely a preliminary investigation or whether it had evolved into a genuine investigation, according to Politico. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021, the FBI Director James Come described the investigation, and Congress said in October 2015, \"The FBI is working on a referral by the inspectors-general regarding past confidentiality. Clinton's use of a private e-mail server.\" He refused to give further details. Earlier this month, Fox News stated that the FBI had been expanding its investigations to consider whether any link between the State Department under Clinton and the Clinton Non-Profit Foundation violated general corruption laws. Clinton denied that the FBI was following this investigation. However, Fox bases its report on unnamed sources, so we cannot independently verify it, and there are no major media outlets. The Bush campaign and the FBI did not respond to our requests for comments in time for publication. The governor, Bush, said that Clinton is under investigation by the FBI right now. Not quite. The FBI is conducting a public investigation into the security of Clinton's e-mail server. But law enforcement officials said that Clinton herself was not the target of an investigation, not a full criminal investigation. It is clear that Clinton's actions were at the forefront and centre of the FBI investigation. But Bush goes too far to claim Clinton herself is under investigation. We evaluate his statement half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05550"}
