(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nSimilar posts have been shared thousands of times in Facebook groups dedicated to the Pizzagate and QAnon conspiracy theories, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool owned by Facebook. Both conspiracy theories make baseless claims about public figures\u2019 connections to child sex trafficking rings.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nThe conspiracy theory promoted on Facebook after the Beirut explosion goes like this:\u00a0\nHillary Clinton is allegedly part of a cabal that\u2019s involved in a global child sex trafficking operation. Clinton\u2019s Secret Service code name was \"evergreen.\" Evergreen is also the name of a Taiwanese shipping company that\u2019s allegedly linked to sex trafficking. Photos from the scene of the Beirut explosion appear to show shipping containers. Therefore, someone bombed Beirut to cover up Clinton\u2019s tracks.\nThat\u2019s the story. But it\u2019s baseless.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with the facts.\nA large explosion occurred Aug. 4 at the port of Beirut. Lebanese officials have attributed the tragedy to the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate, a chemical commonly used in fertilizer, with the aid of fireworks. However, the developing investigation hasn\u2019t ruled out a \"rocket or bomb\" as a possible cause of the fire.\nIn 2019, the port of Beirut moved more than 1.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units of cargo. Satellite imagery from before and after the explosion shows dozens of shipping containers along the waterfront. Put bluntly: Ports have shipping containers.\nEvergreen Marine Corp., a company based in Taipei, works with the Phoenician Maritime Agency to ship cargo to Beirut. We found no evidence that it\u2019s involved in a human trafficking operation. Clinton\u2019s Secret Service codename was \"evergreen,\" which she herself has said.\nIt\u2019s unclear if the image in the Facebook post depicts an Evergreen shipping container. And even if it did, none of those discrete facts would add up to what the post is claiming.\u00a0\nThere is no evidence that Clinton is involved in a sex trafficking ring. The false conspiracy theory has been circulating since 2016.\nRELATED: QAnon conspiracy theorists seek to link Beirut explosion to Rothschilds\nThe Pizzagate conspiracy theory emerged after WikiLeaks released emails from John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager. Some fringe internet users noticed that Podesta had communicated with the owner of Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington, D.C., to discuss a potential fundraiser, and they claimed that Podesta\u2019s use of the word \"pizza\" was a code word for pedophilia.\nThe successor of Pizzagate is QAnon, a right-wing conspiracy theory that in part alleges President Donald Trump and former special counsel Robert Mueller are working together to arrest child molesting elites. Groups dedicated to the conspiracy theory often float unproven or bogus claims in the wake of major news events.\nWhile investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the Beirut explosion, there is no indication that it had anything to do with Clinton or a sex trafficking ring.
