A new announcement by Michelle Nan, a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate, is making a claim for her Republican opponent, businessman David Birdo, who has aroused our interest. The Declaration states: \"It is proposed to reverse the clock on women's health care.\" The Nun camp is already trying to turn the voters against Birdo with announcements about a lawsuit filed during his term as CEO of the General Low Dollar Company. The lawsuit charged the public dollar with paying male managers more than female managers for the same work. The new announcement made by the Georgian largest company PAC opens the door together to the lawsuit concerning wage discrimination, which was settled by the parent company Dollar General in the amount of $18.75 million several years after Birdo left the company. The announcement is closed by these lines: \"David Birdo - Georgian woman cannot trust him. Michelle Nan -- Georgian women can always trust her.\" In order to verify the facts, we have contacted Keith Mason, a long-standing democratic agent and fundkeeper of the Georgians, the Super People &apos; s Party launched to support the N campaign, which finances the new announcement. We have requested evidence in support of the claim that Birdo proposes to reverse the clock with regard to women &apos; s health care. In an e-mail, Mason said, \"The obligation is supported by the total repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\" Birdo had on his campaign website that he wanted to repeal and replace the anti-corruption law, also known as Obamakari, as Mason said. He also referred to a news report that Birdo and four of his main opponents publicly supported a plan by Mr. Ted Cruz of the United States of America to definance the Australian Anti-Corruption Agency as part of any government expenditure bill, an effort that led to the closure of the Government and ultimately failed. How does this translate into women's health? Mason sent us a link to a Chicago Tribune story entitled: \"Many provisions of the Affordable Care Act specifically benefit women.\" According to the article, most of the plans under the law on contraception include preventive care, which for women means \"visiting a good woman\" annually, support for breastfeeding, contraceptives, contraceptive counselling, annual mammography and cervical cancer tests. The William S. Group, Director of the Health Services Research Centre at the State University of Georgia, said that there was an argument that women of childbearing age would be more affected by the repeal of the Anti-Discrimination against Women Act. The health-care needs of women under 45 years of age were higher than those of men in the same age group. Before the implementation of this law, premiums in the individual market were higher for women than for men, and coverage often excluded preventive care - for example, mammography - and maternity care, as Custer said. \"The Affordable Care Act prohibits insurance companies from imposing different premiums on men and women. It also requires plans to provide maternity care and preventive health care (coverage). He said. \"So while many Georgians may lose coverage, or face higher costs with the repeal of the Anti-Corruption Act, women may feel more lost than men.\" Former spokesperson Derek Dickie said that the candidate &apos; s position was clear. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: 2 February 2021 \"David supports the complete abolition of Obamakari,\" said Dickie. The spokesperson would have liked to see him replaced by an alternative \"led by the consumer,\" such as the First Patient Empowerment Act of the United States Republic of America, Tom Price. But Nan's camp announcement is \"mistake,\" Dickie said. He said: \"If Nan's campaign believes that the abolition of Obama's care is \"to go back on the hour of women's health care,\" they should say so. \"Anyway, they can't 'cause carmacare is incredibly unloved.\" The polls point to a dicky right to people's feelings. In a survey conducted in August and September, the Kaiser Foundation for the Family found that public opinion in the Affordable Care Act remained more negative than positive. Of the registered voters, 49 per cent consider the law inappropriate and 35 per cent prefer it. The opinion is more negative among potential voters, 51 per cent versus 35 per cent, and the poll was found. The Republicans in Congress have been maneuvering over the past four years to try to repeal or withdraw the Anti-Corruption Act, which was signed into law on 23 March 2010 and endorsed by the United States Supreme Court on 28 June 2012. Some political analysts link the rise of the conservative Tea Party movement to the Republican takeover of the United States House of Representatives in the 2010 mid-term elections and public anger over the debate and enactment of the law. Kerwin Swint, Head of the Department of Political Science at the Kensau State University, said that he \"fully understood\" the strategy behind the suit of Georgians together. \"Noon camp and their supporters want to take full advantage of the gender gap by pushing Birdo downs among the voters,\" said Swent. \"But if their only evidence of \"backwards on a woman's healthcare watch\" is Birdo's support for ACA abolition, this is too lame.\" Recent reports showed about 316.00 Georgians opting for market plans, 57% of females and 43% of males Larry Sabato, Director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said that this type of advertising became standard in democratic campaigns this year. Sabato said that if it was not to repeal the Anti-Abortion Act, it supported the amendment of the personality or the imposition of stricter controls on abortion. \"Democracy must make every effort to widen the gender gap in their direction. The control of the Senate depended on whether women strongly supported candidates like Nan.\" \"The Republicans will carry men as usual, and the Democrats will win women, but margins are important.\" Our judgment It is alleged by both the Georgian-proteinist party, the Georgian party, that it contains some truth. Some women may be affected by the repeal or replacement of the Affordable Care Act or the Obama Welfare Act, which has extended certain benefits to some women. But the ad never mentioned Obamaker. This is a major omission. The voters also need to know what Birdo suggests -- cancel and replace Obamacker -- others tried to do it and failed. You can argue that almost any group assisted by the Obama Foundation can be harmed by its abolition. There's a lot of context missing in this announcement of attack. We value it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07226"}
