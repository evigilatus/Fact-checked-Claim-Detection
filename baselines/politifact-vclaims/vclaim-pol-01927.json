Putnam touted his Secure Florida First Agenda, which includes establishing a community deportation system with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\"In other words, Florida should have that relationship with ICE because Florida taxpayers are sick of paying tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens who ought to be in the custody of the feds and oughta be deported,\" Putnam said June 7.\nThe economic impact of immigration is widely debated, so we wanted to take a look at Putnam\u2019s statement. We found it\u2019s uncertain how much money \"illegal\" immigrants in Florida prisons cost taxpayers. That\u2019s because Florida doesn\u2019t keep\u00a0tabs on whether inmates are in the country legally or illegally.\nFlaws in Putnam\u2019s evidence\nPutnam campaign spokeswoman Meredith Beatrice said that there are two ways to calculate the \"tens of millions\" dollar figure he is referring to.\nThe problem, though, is that his calculation for \"illegal immigrants\" includes inmates who are not U.S. citizens but are in the country legally.\nPutnam\u2019s team multiplied the total state Department of Corrections budget ($2.3 billion) by the percent of \"criminal illegal aliens\" in Florida\u2019s prisons, which Putnam said was 4.8 percent. That 4.8 percent of Corrections budget is roughly $110 million.\nIn the second calculation, Putnam multiplied the average cost to incarcerate an inmate for a day ($55.80, according to the Florida Department Of Corrections) by the number of days in a year. Then he multiplied that total ($20,367) by the number of \"criminal illegal immigrants\" in Florida prisons, which he said was 4,754.\nThat works out to around $96.8 million.\nBut terminology matters. Putnam is referring to that 4,754 figure as all \"illegal aliens,\" but in fact the state prison system labels them simply \"aliens.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat might sound like a small difference, but it isn\u2019t. The term \"aliens\" actually refers to all people who are not U.S. citizens, those who arrived both legally and illegally. The state of Florida only keeps a count of all aliens.\nAccording to the Florida Department of Corrections, \"the vast majority of alien inmates\" are released to ICE for further immigration processing, including possible deportation.\nIt's possible undocumented immigrants make up a good share of the \"alien\" population, but Putnam still would have no way of knowing the exact numbers.\n\"If the state of Florida doesn\u2019t track illegal immigrants in prison (they don\u2019t) then that number is not knowable,\" said Cato analyst Alex Nowrasteh.\nAnother problem is that even if 4.8 percent of the prison population were released from the prison system, it does not mean it would have a direct 4.8 percent reduction on the total budget because of fixed costs, such as the cost to keep a prison running and administrative and security costs.\nBryce Peterson, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, said that reducing a small number of people from the prison will only really reduce the cost of clothing, food and direct health care service to that individual. \"If they were to release all 5 percent of those people that\u2019s probably not going to be enough to start laying off people and closing prison,\" Peterson said. \"It's unrealistic to think it's going to have a direct five percent impact on their total budget.\"\nOur ruling\nPutnam said Florida taxpayers \"pay tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens.\"\nPutnam's estimates for how much\u00a0undocumented immigrants in prisons cost Florida\u00a0taxpayers have several major problems. For starters, the state only tracks inmates who are not U.S. citizens, without diving into whether they are in the country legally or illegally.\nEven if we had the right numbers, experts told us that fixed costs for the prisons mean reducing the population yields uncertain cost savings. Eliminating a small percentage of inmates doesn\u2019t mean the overall prison budget can be reduced by the same percentage.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-06-26 14:06:38 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Florida taxpayers \"pay tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens.\"    Adam Putnam Agriculture Commissioner  Florida taxpayers \"pay tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens.\"   in an interview Thursday, June 7, 2018 2018-06-07    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01927"}
