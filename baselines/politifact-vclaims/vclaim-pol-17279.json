But a recent Instagram post appears to claim that the federal health agency then delivers food and supplies to make those weeks more comfortable.\n\"If you know anybody (that) test positive with COVID-19 the CDC has funding,\" the post says. \"They deliver groceries and cleaning products (2) twice while you\u2019re in quarantine. Call the CDc intake hotline.\" The post then lists two phone numbers with Philadelphia area codes.\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe abbreviation \"CDC\" usually refers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of the federal health agencies that are coordinating the nation\u2019s COVID-19 response.\nA spokesperson for the agency told us that delivering groceries and cleaning products is \"beyond the CDC\u2019s role,\" which includes detecting and responding to public health threats and promoting healthy and safe behaviors.\u00a0\nIn that vein, the CDC does include information on its website about grocery shopping and running errands during the pandemic.\nThe agency advises limiting trips to stores if possible, because generally, the more closely you interact with someone, the greater the risk of catching COVID-19. Order online or choose curbside pickup instead, the CDC says.\nThe website also includes recommendations on meal kit and food delivery safety, guidance for food and grocery delivery drivers trying to stay safe, and resources for people seeking food assistance during the pandemic.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt lists two numbers for information about meal sites, food banks and other services: 1-866-3-HUNGRY for English speakers and 1-877-8-HAMBRE for Spanish speakers.\nWe called the two Philadelphia numbers in the Instagram post. They turned out to be access numbers for a health center\u2019s voicemail system.\nJames Garrow, director of communications for the Public Health Department in Philadelphia, told us the numbers are for contact tracers with the city\u2019s COVID-19 containment division.\nContact tracers try to connect people who test positive for COVID-19 with services and support if they need it, but the health department doesn\u2019t provide those services, Garrow said.\u00a0\nHe also said he was unaware of other organizations, including any that may use the abbreviation \"CDC,\" offering such services to people in quarantine in Philadelphia.\u00a0\nIn any case, the numbers listed as the \"CDC intake hotline\" are actually city numbers that are not for arranging food deliveries.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe tried contacting the user who made the post, but did not immediately get a response.\u00a0\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17279"}
