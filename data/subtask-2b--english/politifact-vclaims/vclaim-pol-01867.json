But what he said was more nuanced.\nFacebook flagged this story as part of the company\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nSo we decided to investigate.\nIt turns out that a large part of the article is copied, word-for-word, from a 2017 Reuters article titled, \"Pope says migrants\u2019 rights should override national security concerns.\" The only differences between the two are that the opreminfo.com article omits the final two paragraphs of the Reuters story, and it also has a different headline singling out Muslim migrants. \u00a0\u00a0\nReuters is a reputable source, and a 2017 Guardian article corroborates much of their story.\nBut this recently posted article has a few problems.\nFirst, there's an issue of timing.\nThe story begins with the statement, \"Pope Francis urged political leaders on Monday to defend migrants.\" The Reuters article began with those same words, but it was published in August 2017, and was referring to a\u00a0message\u00a0the pope put out that same month, ahead of the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s World Day of Migrants and Refugees.\nIn it, the pope reiterates an earlier address and says, \"Our shared response may be articulated by four verbs: to welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe then goes on to describe the task of \"welcoming\" as follows:\n\"Once again, I want to emphasize the importance of offering migrants and refugees adequate and dignified initial accommodation \u2026 The principle of the centrality of the human person, firmly stated by my beloved predecessor, Benedict XVI, obliges us to always prioritize personal safety over national security \u2026 The situation of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees requires that they be guaranteed personal safety and access to basic services. For the sake of the fundamental dignity of every human person, we must strive to find alternative solutions to detention for those who enter a country without authorization.\"\nThe opreminfo.com article, published July 10, 2018, refers to that message. However, it says the pope \"urged political leaders on Monday,\" even though the pope\u2019s remarks were published nearly a year ago. \u00a0\nSecondly, the Reuters article makes no reference to \"Muslim migrants.\" Rather, it mentions that the pope called for \"broader options for migrants and refugees to enter destination countries safely and legally.\"\nWe didn\u2019t find any reference to Muslim migrants in the pope\u2019s message.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nAn article on Facebook claimed, \"Pope says that the rights of Muslim migrants trump any safety concerns that you might have with them in your country.\"\nThe pope\u00a0discussed ensuring all migrants' \"personal safety over national security.\" But this article\u00a0cherry-picked\u00a0a subgroup of migrants to make it seem like he was only talking about Muslims. \u00a0\nIn addition, the text of the article is copied from a 2017 Reuters article, even though it is framed as though the speech happened recently.\nFor a partially accurate claim that takes things out of context, we rate this headline Half True.\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2018-07-12 18:18:28 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  \"Pope says that the rights of Muslim migrants trump any safety concerns that you might have with them in your country.\"    Bloggers opreminfo.com https://www.opreminfo.com/2018/07/10/pope-says-that-the-rights-of-muslim-migrants-trump-any-safety-concerns-that-you-might-have-with-them-in-your-country/   in a blog post Tuesday, July 10, 2018 2018-07-10    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01867"}
