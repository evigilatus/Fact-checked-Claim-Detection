At that point, the budget gap was $1 trillion, and members of the Republican Congress called Obama because the deficit had been reduced by only 15 per cent. But there was a president at the 2014 Workers &apos; Festival in Milwaukee who declares \"we have reduced our deficit by more than half.\" In his first speech of September 2014, the President announced a list of key political decisions that he claims helped to strengthen the economy and improve the Government &apos; s minimum. We can't cover all of these here, but the allegation of disability has attracted our attention. Was it cut in half? The White House Bureau of Administration and Budget referred to an outline prepared by that office in 2013 as evidence of Obama &apos; s claim. It compares the annual deficit under Obama, which is expressed - as is often the case - by a share of the entire national economy, measured by GDP. At the beginning of the term Obama, the graph showed that the figure was 9.2 per cent. The last figure was 4.1 per cent. This seems to support Obama's statement. But let's examine this in detail. To do so, we have reviewed the figures published by the Budget Office of Congress as well as the Bureau of Management and Budget of the White House. We have also consulted with independent financial experts. The base year for comparison is fiscal year 2009, which ended on 30 September of that year. This was the last budget from President George W. Bush, where Obama took office in January of that year. The last full fiscal year is 2013. These are the same years that Obama's scheme showed. Our analysis easily showed a 50 per cent decline, which was in fact somewhat higher than the Obama scheme might suggest. As a share of the economy, we found -- and our experts confirmed -- the decline was from 9.8 per cent in 2009 to 4.1 per cent in 2013. In fact, Obama's graph reflects a lower deficit figure in 2009, thus a lower share of GDP, 9.2%. This is because instead of using the actual 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion, Obama is reducing it by $200 billion from the excess spending on the deficit that he - and not Bush - paid in the stimulus plan to address the crisis that has turned into the Great Recession. This resulting figure is what Obama calls the deficit he inherited from Bush. However, whatever figure is used, the deficit as a share of the economy still falls by more than half. Show me the money. There's another way to look at this. This, in raw dollars -- the way in which attendance at the trade union event is likely to take place. In fact, deficits are often expressed in this way as well. The White House and Community Organizations figures show that the deficit in 2009 was $1.4 trillion. As a share of GDP, it is easily higher in any year since World War II, and Steve Ellis, Vice-President of non-partisan taxpayers, has said to the general sense. By the end of fiscal year 2013, the deficit figure had fallen to US$ 679.5 billion unadjusted for inflation. This is a 52 per cent decrease. Here is the annual trend of the dollar in 2009: Jordan Rachel stated on January 16, 2021 in tweet that a minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy: January 20, 2021 the deficit as a share of GDP 2009 412,688,000 9.8 per cent 2010 294,373 million 2011 299,593,000 8.4 per cent 2012 086 0.963 000 6.8 per cent 2013 679,502 4,000 4.1 per cent there is one wrinkle. When Obama &apos; s methodology is used to compare Obama &apos; s inherited deficit -- the result of 2009 minus the stimulus package for 2013 -- the deficit decline is slightly less than half, at 48%. Ellis and Mark Goldwin, Senior Policy Manager of the Non-Party Committee for the Responsible Federal Budget, included an additional year, fiscal year 2014, just a month after the end. On 27 August 2014, civil society organizations estimated this year &apos; s budget, fiscal year 2014, that the deficit continued to fall to $506 billion, or 2.9 per cent of GDP. These numbers will put Obama's claim on the top regardless of how the numbers are broken. Looking forward, Ellis warned that talking about the sums of the deficit in crude dollars did not really give a good sense of balance: \"The deficit of $400 billion in an economy of $10 trillion is much higher than the deficit of $400 billion in an economy of $17 trillion.\" He and Goldwin stressed that while the deficit had been halved, it had fallen by half from the height of the cloud. In the decade before the deficit exploded in 2008 and 2009, it averaged just over 1 per cent of GDP, including three years of surpluses, which we calculated. In 2013, the figure was 4.1 per cent. The growth in the deficit from 2007 to 2009 was due mainly to factors related to the large recession, as stated by Goldwin. Tax collection declined as people lost jobs and corporate profits declined; spending on food stamps and other aid programmes increased as needed; and incentive and tax-exempt legislation was enacted, as did bailouts of financial companies. \"Economic recovery, retrenchment of incentives, reflection of TARP/Fanny coefficients, and low interest rates really caused our deficit to fall significantly,\" Goldwin told us. He also referred to reductions in estimated expenditure. Looking ahead, the organization cautions that the deficit in the next decade as a share of the economy will increase and that federal debt will rise without changing current policies. But it's fair to say that Obama was talking about change during his presidency. His claim corresponds to the Politic Fact National case, which was verified in July 2013, where Obama &apos; s real claim was assessed that the deficit had decreased at a faster rate than 60 years ago. Our assessment at a union gathering on Labor Day, Obama declared \"We have reduced our deficit by more than half.\" The figures support Obama's claim: thanks to higher income tax revenues and lower spending on emergency aid, the US deficit has fallen by more than 50% from its highest point since the Second World War to a lower level of $733 billion. We're assessing the claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07349"}
