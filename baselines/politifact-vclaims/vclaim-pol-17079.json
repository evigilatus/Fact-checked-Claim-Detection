Under the March COVID-19 relief bill, the CARES Act, the employer portion is on hold until the end of the year. The CARES Act says\u00a0 that companies need to pay back half by the end of 2021 and the other rest by the end of 2022.\u00a0\nAs for whether a worker will see the extra money, employers could decide not to pass along the deferral. Some business advisers are suggesting they do that as a hedge against uncertainty. We don\u2019t know what employers will do, but this is a possibility.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims, Trump\u2019s plan \"would suspend the 7.65% your employer matches. See? You will NOT get that, nor will your wage or salary increase by 7.65%\"\nThe employer and employee payroll tax contributions are already separate, and the government already had deferred employer payment until the end of 2020. Trump\u2019s action applies to the employee contribution, and it\u2019s yet unknown if that deferral will reach the pockets of employees and when.\nWe rate this post Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17079"}
