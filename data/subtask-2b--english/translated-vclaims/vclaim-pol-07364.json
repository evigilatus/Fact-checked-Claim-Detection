Twelve months later, the situation in Syria remains a worrying international crisis, exacerbated by the growing presence of the terrorist group \"Islamic State,\" also known as ISIS, throughout the region. Throughout all five major political presentations on Sunday, the Republicans - and even some Democrats - criticized the management response to the unrest, with many politicians and fanatics heeding Obama's observation on Thursday that \"we do not yet have a strategy\" to deal with the Islamic State. Among the critics were R. Peter King, R.N.Y., who said to the nation, \"I wish our President had shown the same leadership as the British Prime Minister David Cameron. What's President Obama waiting for?\" \"All this began a year ago\" added the king. I remember being in the White House with Dennis McDonough talking about the importance of air attacks in Syria, and we had allies lined up and then the President pulled the carpet. And these allies will now be very difficult to return to the alliance.\" We considered a similar allegation in March, when former Vice President Dick Cheney said, \"Many allies have signed this (for air strikes in Syria). At the last minute, Obama retreated.\" We've assessed this statement as mostly wrong. In view of recent developments, we thought the King's comments on what happened a year ago deserved to be reviewed. Unlike Cheney, the King does not go so far as to claim \"many allies have fallen on\" for air strikes. The push to intervene in Syria came to the head on August 21, 2013, when the Assad regime attacked an area controlled by rebels on the outskirts of Damascus using chemical weapons. A year ago, Obama said, \"A red line for (military intervention) is that we are beginning to see a whole range of chemical weapons moving around us or being used.\" Within a week of the attack, the Department was talking about air strikes on weapons depots and military command posts in Syria. To that end, Obama and Foreign Minister John Kerry have tried to mobilize support from the international community. The leaders in France and Britain immediately jumped on the idea of limited air strikes. On 27 August 2013, French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said: \"France is ready to punish those who have made the terrible decision with innocent gas.\" A British senior official was quoted as saying, \"It's reasonable to assume that our armed forces are making contingency plans.\" However, Prime Minister Cameron suffered an embarrassing reprimand on 29 August 2013 by Parliament - controlled by his party - which voted narrowly to defeat a proposal to support military intervention in Syria. According to the telegraph, it was \"the first time a British government was prevented from carrying out a military deployment.\" Cameron later canceled a military deployment. It was also difficult to obtain support among other European States. Italy stated that it would continue only if the United Nations Security Council agreed to the use of force (which had not occurred). It is clear that Germany, a central player, was against military action. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: 11 January 2021, Germany signed the G-20 statement describing the use of toxic gas as a war crime and said that the Syrian Government was the potential culprit. However, the statement added, \"At the same time, the European Union stresses the need to move forward in addressing the Syrian crisis through the United Nations. Operation.\" The strongest legal justification for an air strike will come through the United Nations Security Council. This is impossible because two permanent members, Russia and China, indicated that they would object to any such decision. Within NATO, Turkey was a major supporter of intervention. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia was the most eager to see an attack on Syria, a long-standing political enemy. Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were also on board. However, the League of Arab States, which includes Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, has never agreed to launch a military strike. In the end, the most important manifestation of unity with the Allies was the joint statement issued on 6 September by the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom calling for \"a strong international response to this grave violation of the rules and conscience of the world, which will send a clear message that this kind of atrocities can never be repeated. Those who committed these crimes must be held accountable.\" However, \"a strong international response\" was not defined, and ultimately even France said that it wanted to wait for the final report of the United Nations chemical weapons inspectors. The King also claimed support between the Allies was lost because Obama \"extracted the carpet\" from plans to launch air strikes. It is not clear exactly what moment the King refers to (his employees did not reply to an e-mail asking for further clarification). However, the widespread reluctance to intervene among the international community has been evident from the outset. Even before Obama sought Congressional support for targeted military strikes on 31 August 2013, Britain had already voted against any military action, rather than unilateral action. In fact, Obama had a hand in stopping military action when the United States and Russia concluded an agreement to condone the use of force in exchange for Syria's renunciation of its chemical weapons (which has since been completed). At that stage, an important international movement of military intervention has been lost since the elimination of the source of alarm - the use of chemical weapons by Assad. However, support was already fading anyway. Our governor said, \"We had allies lined up (to launch air strikes on Syria) and then the president pulled the carpet.\" A bunch of \"Sustain\" allies for air attacks. We have considered France, Turkey and Saudi Arabia to be supporting countries. How can we learn from the Bible? Among the crowds were \"no\" key allies such as the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. The League of Arab States and the United Nations have also retreated. Any support faded after Russia helped to find a diplomatic solution in which Syria agreed to abandon its chemical weapons. The statement is partially accurate but omits important details. We value it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07364"}
