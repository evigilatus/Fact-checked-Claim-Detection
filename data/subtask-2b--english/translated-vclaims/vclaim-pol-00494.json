Tony Evers and the other Democrats. But the former Republican government Scott Walker says that the health care system in Wisconsin is in good shape. :: During the discussion of socialism on Twitter with the United States, Sun Bernie Sanders, a democratic presidential competitor from Vermont, Walker moved his achievements as governor. \"Under the control of Democrats in the state, WI was waiting to cover health care under Medicaid. I've canceled the waiting list and everyone living in poverty is now covered \"Wooker said on May 30, 2019 on Twitter. \"WI is the highest 10 states to cover health care.\" We're gonna focus on the last part of that -- is Wisconsin really the first nation at the national level to cover health care? This is not the first claim in this context for Walker. We gave him the wrong classification in August 2017 for claiming that Wisconsin had moved from the lower 10 states to the first 10 states of employment. Many organizations do these classifications, but only one of the eminent persons has listed Wisconsin this high. In this case, Walker's claim is slightly narrower, referring not to health care in general, but to health care coverage. There is no lack of arrangement for health care, each with its own methodology and focus. Many organizations are trying to measure the quality of health care in general, but we have found three highly respected national groups dealing with coverage or access to health care more specifically. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job.\" For a better sixth in the country, Wisconsin was linked to 5% of the uninsured population in 2017. * Latest United States News and World Report, 8th place health care in Wisconsin for access to health care based on child care visits, health insurance registration, adult health visits, adult dental visits, child dental visits and affordability of health care. Access to these services was one of three factors in the public public health-care system that arranges publications. *The Commonwealth Fund, an institution seeking to improve access to and quality of health care, Wisconsin 11 for care and affordability in its 2018 State Health System Performance Measurement Register. The arrangement is based on the rates of insurance coverage for different age groups, expenses from private funds and other cost barriers to care. As a quick aspect, we will note that the public health-care system in Wisconsin has also achieved fairly high grades among the various grades - albeit not always at the top 10. The United States News and World Agency ranked the Wisconsin health-care system in general 14th place, the Commonwealth Fund ranked the eighth state, and the Federal Agency for Health Care Research and Quality and Wisconsin ranked the highest 12 below a specific grade. Two other companies have also studied the order in various health-care subjects: SmartAsset collected the standards to rank it sixth in Wisconsin, while the Whitsop data set arrived in Wisconsin on 23rd. Our reign, Walker, said Wisconsin was the top 10 states to cover health care. The most recent preliminary data on the percentage covered show that 95 per cent of the Wisconsin population has health insurance, which is associated with 6 per cent in the country. There are two other prominent national arrangements in the Wisconsin VIII and XI lists in common standards that examine coverage and access to health care. We appreciate Walker's claim that it's true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00494"}
