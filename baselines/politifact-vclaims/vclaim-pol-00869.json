Kamala Harris asks \"How can you dream when you are drowning in student loan debt?\" in a section on the rising cost of living in America.\nOn the campaign trail, the Democratic presidential hopeful has called student loan debt \"one of the biggest challenges facing our country and our students.\"\nIn the Senate, she helped re-introduce the Debt-Free College Act, a bill she says will help reverse the growing student debt crisis. Specifically, it would provide states incentives through matching grants to increase investments in public higher education.\nThe senator then made this eye-popping claim about how fast student loan debt has grown in a news release on March 6 announcing her support for the bill:\n\"College debt has increased 170 percent since 2006 and now exceeds $1.5 trillion dollars, which is second only to mortgage debt and surpasses even credit card debt.\"\nShe\u00a0tweeted a similar claim a few days later.\n\nBut is student loan debt really growing that fast? And is it really second only to mortgage debt? We decided to crunch Harris\u2019 numbers in this fact check.\nOur research\nTo support the statement, a spokesman for Harris cited a Federal Reserve table showing the nation\u2019s cumulative student loan debt for each year from 2006 through 2018. He also cited articles from The Washington Post and MarketWatch. \u00a0\nThe Federal Reserve table shows student loan debt at the end of 2006 was $521 billion. By the end of 2018, the most recent period available, it had grown to $1.57 trillion \u2014 which matches with Harris\u2019 claim that it \"now exceeds $1.5 trillion.\"\nBut after calculating the numbers, we found an increase of 201 percent, an even faster rate than the 170 percent Harris referenced. \u00a0\n\"I\u2019d say that her statement is mostly correct,\" said Mark Kantrowitz, a national financial aid expert. \"The one slight error: She actually underestimates the growth of student loan debt outstanding.\"\nKantrowitz is publisher and vice president of research for SavingforCollege.com, a guide to college savings plans. \u00a0\n\"The only way I get to 170 percent,\" he added, \"is if I compare the current debt outstanding to 2007 instead of 2006. That works out to be 170 percent.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHans Johnson, director of the Public Policy Institute of California\u2019s Higher Education Center, also reviewed the data and found a 200 percent increase based on the most current Federal Reserve figures.\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve student loan data.\nWhy is college debt growing so fast? \nMore students going to college accounts for some of the growth of student loan debt, but only a small portion, Kantrowitz said.\nIn 2006, there were 15.2 million college students. A decade later, that number had increased 11 percent to 16.9 million, he said, citing figures from the National Center for Education Statistics.\nKantrowitz added that another factor is that federal grants have slowed as tuition has gone up. States often cut tuition assistance at the first signs of a financial crisis.\nThe average student loan debt was nearly $30,000 for students graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018, Kantrowitz said. That is up from nearly $21,000 in 2006.\nCollege debt \"second only to mortgage debt and surpasses even credit card debt\"\nWe found this part of Harris\u2019 statement is accurate. In 2014, PolitiFact Virginia reported that \"student debt began to outpace credit card debt in the second quarter of 2010,\" citing data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nAt the end of 2018, the nation\u2019s overall credit card debt was $870 billion and mortgage balances stood at $9.1 trillion, according to the data.\nOur rating\nSen. Kamala Harris said \"College debt has increased 170 percent since 2006 and now exceeds $1.5 trillion dollars, which is second only to mortgage debt and surpasses even credit card debt.\"\nShe actually understated how fast student loan debt is growing. The most recent Federal Reserve figures show it\u2019s increased\u00a0201 percent since 2006.\nHarris was right about college debt topping $1.5 trillion, and being second only to mortgage debt.\nWe rate her overall statement Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2019-03-21 23:54:56 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"College debt has increased 170 percent since 2006 and now exceeds $1.5 trillion dollars, which is second only to mortgage debt and surpasses even credit card debt.\"    Kamala Harris U.S. Senator     Wednesday, March 6, 2019 2019-03-06    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00869"}
