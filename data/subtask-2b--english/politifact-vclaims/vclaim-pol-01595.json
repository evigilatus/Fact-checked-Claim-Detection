You could kill someone and you cannot frighten a hurricane. I cant believe I actually have to write this.\"\nHowever, one website pointed to the event and claimed it led to tragedy when a \"Myrtle Beach man\" did just that: shot a gun at a hurricane.\n\"The 33-year old is believed to have fired a large calibre (sic) weapon earlier this afternoon; however, the bullet ricocheted and ended up entering the man\u2019s head,\" the post said. \"It\u2019s believed he died instantly.\"\nThis story was made up. It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nPartway through the story, the \"Myrtle Beach man\" is identified as a man from Florence, which is the name of the hurricane as well as a South Carolina city further inland.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMyrtle Beach\u2019s local newspaper, Myrtle Beach Online, contacted police departments in both Florence and Myrtle Beach, and neither was aware of such an incident.\n\"I have not heard a a single call in any way, shape or form about anything like that,\" a police corporal in Myrtle Beach told the newspaper.\n\"The only thing I\u2019ve heard about that was a satirical group on Facebook,\" Florence Police Department Lt. Mike Brandt told PolitiFact. \"There were no reports of shooting at the hurricane in the city limits of Florence.\"\nThe story was published on CGC News, a blog that was created Sept. 9, 2018 according to whois.com, which tracks website domains. No credible news outlets covering the storm have picked up this story.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Facebookers have somewhat jokingly declared they\u2019d shoot at an incoming storm.\nThe joke Facebook event is similar to one that popped up last year: \"Shoot At Hurricane Irma.\" The creator was a bored 22-year-old who said at the time that the joke became \"something a little out of my control\" after more than 43,000 people RSVPed.\nWhile the Facebook event \"Shooting guns at Hurricane Florence to scare it away\" has generated its fair share of interested attendees, there is no credible evidence that anyone died trying to square off against the hurricane.
