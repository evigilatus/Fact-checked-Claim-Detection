In 2017, Osteen came under fire after he initially did not open his 16,800-seat facility to serve as a shelter for Hurricane Harvey victims.\u00a0\nNow, a screenshot is circulating on social media of what appears to be a woman asking for prayers for her marriage on the Facebook page of Joel Osteen\u2019s Ministries, only to be told that she needs to purchase a \"prayer request account.\"\nThe screenshot shows a woman writing on the (supposed) Joel Osteen\u2019s Ministries page: \"I am requesting prayer for my marriage,\" and then displays the following response from the page:\n\"Unfortunately, your Joel Osteen prayer request account has not been activated. In order to activate your account, you will need to add a monthly donation of $24.99, which will give you access to 3 prayer requests per month. If you donate $49.99 each month you will become a Platinum Prayer Request member, which gives you access to over 10 prayer requests per month and a chance to buy tickets to my next performance at your local arena.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
