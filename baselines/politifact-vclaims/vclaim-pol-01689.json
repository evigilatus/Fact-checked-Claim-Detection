The aggregated findings, posted on the companies\u2019 websites in January, do not reference Trump.\nHowever, bloggers then took the survey and linked the results to Trump.\nFor example, the conservative website Think Americana published an article titled, \"MAGA: Black business ownership jumps 400% in one year under Trump.\"\n\"On Monday President Trump\u2019s approval rating with African Americans hit 31%,\" the article said. \"That\u2019s not all. Black business ownership jumped 400% in one year.\"\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe 31 percent approval rating comes from a recent Rasmussen Reports poll, which was updated a few days later as 36 percent. Rasmussen Reports consistently cites higher approval ratings for Trump than most pollsters. Gallup\u2019s numbers hover in the 10 to 15 percent approval range for African-Americans, and Reuters monthly polling for July had black approval at 12.8 percent.\nIn November 2017, small business financing company Guidant Financial and online credit marketplace LendingClub Corporation sent out an email survey to their clientele nationwide; they received responses from about 2,600 \"current and aspiring entrepreneurs.\" The companies both posted general articles about the results of that survey on their websites in January without making any distinctions about race or ethnicity except that 47 percent of \"aspiring entrepreneurs\" surveyed were minorities.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 400 percent increase in black-owned businesses claim, however, was not made until a subsequent graphic was published on Guidant\u2019s website on Aug. 8.\nIt was not clear from the released results how the companies came up with the 400 percent jump. The percentage of African-American respondents who owned businesses was not published, nor was that figure from last year.\nThe survey sample was not random, the response was voluntary, and the margin of error was not made public.\nThis graphic said it relied on the same survey data, and it highlighted the African-American business owners in the pool. The methodology the companies provided did not break down respondents by race, only saying that minorities accounted for 47 percent of aspiring entrepreneurs who responded.\nPolitiFact contacted Guidant about the claim in the graphic on Aug. 21. Two days later, a new version of the graphic was posted, this time without any mention of a 400 percent increase.\n\"We have found that the 400% statistic is being misrepresented in its context and therefore we have decided to pull that statistic from our info graph,\" public relations consultant for Guidant Stacia Kirby said in an email. \"Our mission is to help people get started and funded in owning their own business.\"\nWhen it comes to black-owned business numbers, we couldn\u2019t find another source that supports this increase from 2017 to 2018. The Annual Business Survey data about Business Owner Characteristics for 2017 is not yet available, and most recent census data related to minority-owned businesses is from 2016.\nRobert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California-Santa Cruz, studies entrepreneurship and authored a book about its relationship with race in the United States.\n\nFairlie said there was no indication that African-American businesses had seen significant growth in the past year.\n\"That would be great if there was a 400 percent increase given that African-American rates are so low, but everything that I have seen from Census and BLS data does not show that kind of growth,\" Fairlie said.\nBecause of the small sample size and lack of corroborating data, we rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-08-27 18:56:36 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Black business ownership jumped 400% in one year.\"    Think Americana Bloggers https://thinkamericana.com/2018/08/20/maga-black-business-ownership-jumps-400-in-one-year-under-trump/   in a blog post Monday, August 20, 2018 2018-08-20    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01689"}
