Davis is one of the top targets of the super PAC, but he's not No. 1.\u00a0\nHere, we look at just how much is being funneled into the district from CLF and how it\u00a0measures up to other House races around the country.\nWhat the Davis campaign says\nThe Davis campaign told us the claim is based off a\u00a0CNN report released in late September.\nIn the report, CNN examined the top districts where the Congressional Leadership Fund\u00a0was spending its money on ad buys.\nIt found that, as of Sept. 21 (when the report was published), CLF had poured $1.9 million into the district, nabbing the top spot on its list.\nColorado\u2019s 6th Congressional District and California\u2019s 48th followed with $1.6 million and $1.5 million spent by CLF.\nMost of the television advertising were attacks on Democrats.\nThis is definitely visible in KS-2. In September alone, the PAC aired four attack ads against Davis.\nHow much is actually being spent in the district by outside groups and CLF\nWe checked the OpenSecrets.org database, a widely cited campaign finance tracking resource published by the Center for Responsive Politics.\nInterestingly, the database shows that so far in the race, CLF has spent more than $3.2 million, nearly double CNN\u2019s estimate, but still doesn\u2019t list the district as the top one for the group's spending.\nBesides more than $6 million spent attacking Jon Ossoff, who lost to Republican U.S. Rep. Karen Handel in a 2017 special election, the top Democrat CLF is spending against is Democrat Joe Radinovich, who is running against Republican candidate Pete Stauber in\u00a0Minnesota's 8th District. So far, CLF has spent nearly $3.9 million against him.\nBut while Davis isn't the top Democrat that CLF is spending money against (he comes in at No. 7), the KS-2 race overall takes 4th place when\u00a0factoring in\u00a0the money the super PAC has spent in support of Watkins.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRaces\n\n\nCLF $ Against \nDemocrats\n\n\nCLF $ For \nRepublicans\n\n\nTotal $ Spent\n\n\n\n\n1.
