Clinton's campaign severely denied it. \"Sure Hillary Clinton doesn't want to cancel the second amendment,\" said Clinton's spokesman, Josh Shorn. We have found no evidence that Clinton has ever called for the repeal or repeal of the second amendment. Schorin &apos; s comments are largely consistent with what Clinton has said in the last few years about the right to bear arms. However, defenders of arms rights argue that it is reasonable to conclude from some of Clinton &apos; s comments that they want to retract the second amendment as currently interpreted. In both the 2008 and 2016 White House performances, direct shootings on the campaign path called for stronger background verification requirements, while affirming support for the right to bear arms. Clinton wants to keep weapons out of the hands of \"people who we all agree should not have - domestic aggressors, violent criminals, and those with serious mental illness,\" said Dan Gross, head of the Brady Violence Prevention Campaign. However, Trump's charge overestimates the controls she wants to put in and ignores what she said in the record. \"I believe in the Second Amendment. People have the right to bear arms. But I also think we can deal with this in a general sense,\" she said in a democratic presidential debate in January 2008. In response to the murders on the air of a news crew in Virginia in August 2015, she said: \"We are smart, kind enough to balance the legitimate concerns of Second Amendment rights with preventive and control measures, so whatever the motive for this killer... More recently, in April 2016, I quoted, \"We can protect our rights in the second amendment and take joint steps to prevent armed violence. It's just a matter of whether we choose it.\" If we set aside the bulk of Clinton's comments on the protection of the Second Amendment (e.g. here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here), we will now touch upon two points that some arms rights defenders and experts say give Trump some credibility. Two smoked pistols? Klinton disturbed the gun lobby with two comments on the eyebrows last fall. Clinton said in October 2015 that the national weapons buyback program like Australia's mandatory program was \"the search for value.\" After having killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, Australia banned semi-automatic and automatic weapons and enacted a mandatory law for the purchase of newly banned weapons. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security purposes, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman: January 17, 2021, this program is \"uncompatible to private ownership of weapons,\" Eugene Volke, Professor of Law at the University of California, Los Angeles. Dave Kobel, a pro-arms lawyer and research director at the Conservative Independence Institute in Denver, shares her view on Australia's program that \"it wants to repeal the second amendment.\" (The National Republican Army shares this view.) However, the full context of Clinton's response suggests that it may have misspoked or not fully understood the Australian program, as it has also invoked voluntary purchases as possible models for the US program. \"The communities have done so in our country. Several communities have implemented programmes to repurchase weapons. But I think it would be useful to consider at the national level if this could be arranged,\" she said, before comparing the cash repurchases to Clonkers, Obama's voluntary vehicle-trading programme. Second, Clinton stated that it did not agree with the historic Supreme Court decision in the District of Columbia v. Heller case. In its decision 5 to 4, the Court repealed the ban on firearms imposed by Washington and recognized that the second amendment applied to the right to bear arms. \"The Supreme Court is wrong in the Second Amendment,\" she said in a leak recording private fund-raising. He called the comment \"smoking rifle\" which reinforces Trump's charge. Both pointed out that former officials of the Ministry of Justice under the leadership of President Bill Clinton and his appointment Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg had argued in the Heller case that the weapons regulations did not violate the second amendment because they related primarily to well-organized militia and not to the right of the individual to bear arms. Both comments were put together, Trump was right, and NRA Amy Hunter said. At the same time, the second amendment expert at the University of California, Adam Winkler, said that the accuracy of Trump &apos; s charge depended on the reasons for Clinton &apos; s rejection of Heller. * (In accordance with 2008 election news reports, supported the Washington ban on handguns.) \"If she thinks logic was wrong, but the right result, then she'll fit in with a number of strong supporters of guns,\" he said. \"though, if she believes that there should be no protection of the rights of the weapon, Trump's claim is approaching the truth.\" The Clinton campaign told us that Clinton believed that Heller had mistakenly decided that cities and states must have the power to formulate laws of common sense to preserve the safety of their inhabitants. This indicates that Clinton disagrees with the court that declared the region's prohibition of guns unconstitutional, not necessarily on the individual's own right - a position that is somewhat consistent with the George W. Bush Administration's position on the recognition of Heller's right but allows for a reasonable reduction. Our Governor Trump said, \"Hillary Clinton wants to cancel the second amendment.\" There was no evidence that Clinton had literally said or explicitly suggested that it wanted to repeal the second amendment, and much of Clinton &apos; s comments suggested the opposite. She has repeatedly stated that she wants to protect the right to bear arms while taking measures to prevent violence with firearms. The arms advocates say that Trump's claim is supported by Clinton's openness to the weapons buyback programme and others to the Supreme Court's decision on the second amendment. However, whether these two cherry comments actually reveal Clinton &apos; s intentions is a matter of interpretation. In order to maintain water, support for the second cancellation of the adjustment should be more direct. So we assess it wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/132d21e9-e2e0-4082-b319-0d67d30341e8", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04975"}
