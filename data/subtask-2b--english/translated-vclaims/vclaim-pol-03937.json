Trump said his kids were gonna run his business deals. In the past, many presidents have placed their assets in a blind trust fund, which is the case when an independent trustee manages the assets of another person without a person &apos; s contribution. But Trump really doesn't have to do any of this because the laws of financial conflict of interest do not apply to him as President, as former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said, who is said to be on the short list for a seat on the Trump Cabinet. \"Well, first of all, you realize that these laws don't apply to the president, do you?\" Tell Julien Jake Taber Nov, CNN, 13. \"So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. For some reason, when the law was written, the President was exempt.\" Giuliani has almost the right law. Trump, as President, has no legal obligation to separate himself from his business and financial interests. The law in question is Title 18, Section 208, of the United States Act. It states that employees of the federal executive branch cannot participate in government matters in which they or their immediate family have a financial interest. Because of this law, some federal employees put their investments in blind trust. This allows them to avoid organizing and to participate in a matter that may otherwise constitute a conflict of interest. However, the President and Vice-President, although staff members in the executive branch, are exempt. According to the definitions of the Act, section 208 does not apply to it, nor does it apply to members of Congress or federal judges. \"The presidents seem to have fled mostly from the regular network of ethics and conflict of interest laws,\" said Scott Amy, general adviser in the government oversight project, a non-partisan observer for government accountability. My mother added that presidents were allowed to accept gifts in many cases as well. Thus, at least since 1974, when the Ministry of Justice issued a letter stating that section 208 of section 18 did not apply to the President. The exemptions were expressly recorded by Congress in 1989. In its 1974 letter, the Ministry of Justice stated that the legislative history of this conflict of interest provision indicated that it was never intended to apply to the President. In addition, the Ministry of Justice stated that the development of conflict of interest laws for the President could restrict it in a way that might be unconstitutional, although it did not give specific examples. \"As head of the executive branch, the president may not be able - and it can be said under the Constitution that it may not be possible to ask the president - to give up government decisions,\" said Richard Bravo, a professor of law at Columbia Law School. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" While section 208 of Part 18 is the main conflict of interest provision, other relevant rules, including a couple, do not exempt the President. Trump and Vice President Mike Pines must disclose their money, which is required of all high-ranking federal officials, as Prefot said. However, the statements are not as detailed as the details of the federal tax returns, which Trump did not release. Then there is the Constitution &apos; s remuneration clause, which prohibits United States government officials from accepting gifts or compensation from foreign governments, cited by Kathleen Clark, an expert in legal ethics and a professor of law at the University of Washington, St. Louis. Trump has numerous foreign relations, including several overseas real estate transactions with potential foreign government associations. In 2012, for example, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan attended the tape cut ceremony of the Trump Burgess complex in Istanbul. Clark said: \"If any of the Tramp trading arrangements involves receiving payments from foreign governments, I believe that he or his entities from which he receives funds will have to give up such payments, or will have to separate them from those entities.\" It is not quite clear, however, that Presidents are bound by the remuneration requirement, nor is there a court that weighs the answer to this question. The way this requirement is built - it does not specify the President, unlike other provisions of the Constitution, for example - and the fact that President George Washington himself took gifts from the French Government without asking for permission from Congress, Our judgment, Giuliani, said that a conflict of financial interest \"laws don't apply to the president, do they? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust.\" In fact, the President is exempt from the main conflict of interest provision of United States law. Therefore, the Presidents have no legal obligation to place their financial holdings in a blind trust fund or to separate themselves from their financial interests in any way. As President, Trump will have to comply with the requirements of financial disclosure, in any event, and is likely to be bound by a provision in the Constitution concerning income from foreign governments. We appreciate Juliani's claims with appreciation. January 12, 2017: We updated this story to add more information on the remuneration requirement. Our assessment hasn't changed.
