It's no wonder the Democrats failed to retake either of the legislatures and the Assembly will face the largest majority of the Republicans since Barca was a small child in the mid-1950s. Here Barca reacted when Frederika Friberg of Wisconsin Public Television asked him the question in November 7, 2014: \"We must communicate differently with the middle class, because there is no doubt that the middle class is much stronger with the Democratic Party. Even in our state, twelve times the tax exemption was for people who earned more than $350,000 from the average middle class person. We should go back to the drawing board.\" This allegation of income tax cuts has drawn our attention. Democratic candidates around the state, including Mary Burke at the top of the ticket, beat their opponents from the General Democratic Party at intervals of income tax breaks approved by the Republican-led legislature and the Government. (Scott Walker) They argued that the interruptions were too tendentious to the higher income level. The Republicans responded to the separate tax cuts that Walker signed for beneficiaries at all levels. The second Walker budget, 2013-15, reduced income tax rates (with a reduction in the number of tax brackets from five to four). Subsequently, in 2014, Walker signed the legislation, which again dropped the lowest rate (from 4.4 per cent to 4 per cent). When asked to support the claim, Parka Laura Smith &apos; s spokesperson referred to a report issued in June 2013 by the Legislative Bureau for Taxes, which is responsible for assessing the state budget. That report detailed the impact of the first income tax cuts - approved in 2013 - in terms of the value of the crude dollar among income groups. Smith said that the mention of a \"medium class person\" referred to the average family income in Wisconsin. That was $52.627 from the latest census in the United States for an average of five years. The Bureau &apos; s tax report shows that the average tax savings for 2014 were estimated at $112 in the income range of $50,000 to $60,000. At the level of $300,000 and above, the Barca example of \"$350,000,\" savings were estimated at $1,518. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 On January 26, 2012, according to our calculations, the maximum comfort period for beneficiaries is 13.5 times the size of the intermediate group. The study did not calculate the percentage of income represented by these periods. However, Barca &apos; s analysis excludes the second tax reduction approved by the World Democratic Party - a reduction in 2014 for the lowest part of people &apos; s income. We found the financial office note from July 2014 that considered the combined effect of both reductions. There, the difference is somewhat smaller. The savings of the higher income groups were estimated at $1,402, compared with $161 for those between $50,000 and $60,000 - approximately 9 times higher than the upper group. The 2014 report presented another way to consider the distribution of discounts - a way that takes into account the fact that top-down price cuts mean that higher wage earners will get the biggest break, because they pay the most in taxes. The highest income holders will receive a reduction of 2 per cent of their income, while the \"average\" income holders mentioned by Barca will receive a break of 7 per cent. We are quite sure that most people measure the amount of tax exemptions they grant in real, affordable dollars, not percentages. However, this percentage of income shows that higher tax rates have not been reduced to the extent that older households have received the lowest percentage of income. This second method of considering tax cuts is used to analyse the effects of tax cuts from the point of view of capacity to pay, a principle that is a feature of a progressive tax system such as the Wisconsin system, which researchers Richard S. Oxer and Norton Francis told us from the Centre for Tax Policy for Urban Innovation. Barca points to precise figures in clarifying the point that Walker and the Republicans could have designed tax reforms to raise the level of savings in crude dollars for the various groups, but his claim needs further discussion, as they said. Our assessment, Barca, said that the Republicans agreed to a 12-time tax cut for \"persons who earn more than 350,000\" from \"a middle class person.\" This was accurate for the major tax cuts that Walker signed in 2013, but the gap narrows to nine times when all income tax changes are considered on the basis of global output, according to a reliable budget agency. We assess Parka's claim mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07003"}
