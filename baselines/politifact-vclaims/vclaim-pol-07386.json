It is the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin. It surpassed traffic crashes quite a few years ago already.\"\nIs it true that overdoses from heroin or prescription opioids not only outnumber traffic fatalities, but are the top cause of accidental deaths in Wisconsin?\nThe statistics\nThe latest figures from the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that nationally, there were 41,340 fatal drug overdoses of all types in 2011, making it the leading cause of injury death in the country.\nBut what about in Wisconsin?
