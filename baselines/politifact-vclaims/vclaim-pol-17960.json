This is DEEP.\" It reads:\n\"On February 3, 1903 Jack Johnson became the first \u2018negro\u2019 heavy weight title champion. But, did you know he was also an inventor? While in Jail in Kansas, he invented the wrench! In 1922 he received a patent for his invention. In fact, white people still found a way to tarnish this great accomplishment by dubbing it the \u2018monkey wrench\u2019. A term many use freely today.

It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The International Boxing Hall of Fame shared this description of him: \"A gaudy, bold character who lived just as he wanted, Johnson enraged the defenders of white supremacy with his refusal to accept anything less than equality. He was beloved by blacks and some whites, but thoroughly hated and eventually conquered by those who saw him as a threat to America's divided society.\"\nIn 1913, Johnson was convicted of violating the Mann Act, which made it a felony to transport across state lines \"any woman or girls for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose,\" but was used to prosecute people involved in premarital, extramarital and interracial relationships. Johnson was traveling with his white girlfriend who later became his wife. He served a year at Leavenworth federal prison in Kansas.\nPresident Donald Trump posthumously pardoned Johnson in 2018, saying he had received a request from Sylvester Stallone.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHank Aaron\u2019s death was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson's wrench came later\nJohnson was awarded a patent for a wrench that improved gripping and made disassembly easier.\u00a0\n\"My invention relates to improvements in wrenches and has for its object to provide an improved wrench, which is of simple and durable construction, reliable in operation and easy and inexpensive to manufacture, which may be easily and readily adjusted and which is adapted to exert a powerful gripping action upon the work,\" he wrote in his application, which was filed in March 1921. The patent was awarded in April 1922.\nJohnson had conceptualized and diagrammed a tool to help tighten loosening fastening devices while at Leavenworth, according to the Jim Crow Museum at Ferris State University in Michigan.\u00a0\nBut the first wrench had been patented in 1835, and the first monkey wrench was patented around 1858.\u00a0\nA monkey wrench, by the way, is a wrench with one fixed and one adjustable jaw at right angles to a straight handle.\nThere is some dispute about the origin of the name \"monkey wrench.\" The Jim Crow Museum says that it was named using a purposeful misspelling of the name of the inventor, Charles Moncky. An alternative explanation is that the wrench was invented before Moncky\u2019s wrench and got its name because it was similar to a \"key wrench,\" but was different enough to be called a \"non-key\" wrench.\nOur ruling\nJohnson did get a patent for a wrench he invented while in prison.\nBut it was not the first wrench ever invented, and the original as well as one that became known as the monkey wrench were patented decades earlier. The origin of the monkey wrench name had nothing to do with Johnson.\u00a0\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17960"}
