There is no truth to this article.\nWe saw no disclaimer on the American Revolution website, but the same story was posted on reaganwasright, a website that identifies itself as satire and is a frequent purveyor of fake news.\nJones beat Moore in the Alabama U.S. Senate special election Dec. 12. The Washington Post reported in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper. There have been multiple fake news reports related to the election.\nThis article on the American Revolution website contained no details explaining the supposedly fraudulent votes and contains some fictional details such as stating that Birmingham is in Applevale County -- it is located in Jefferson County.\nIt stated that the three poll workers \u00a0-- Wanda Werkmeister, Olivia Pertuiary and Maureen Brown -- will all face felony charges punishable by up to 10 years in prison and $1 million in fines.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article includes a quote by Fox News host Sean Hannity, but we found no evidence he said this:\n\"Without that inner-city ghetto vote, Doug Jones doesn\u2019t have a chance. It doesn\u2019t make much sense why someone from the city\u2019s vote is so much more important to Democrats, who swear they aren\u2019t at all racist.\"\nThe article stated that Hannity made those comments on Dana Loesch\u2019s show Guns\u00a0God and Grits. A Fox News spokeswoman told PolitiFact that Hannity did not make the statement and Loesch, who hosts a conservative radio show, told PolitiFact that she hadn\u2019t had Hannity on her show in a few years and doesn\u2019t have a show with that name.\nThe American Revolution website linked to the Facebook page for Special News USA. We sent a message to Special News USA via Facebook and a person replied stating, \"I do not know whether or not the news is correct or not, but I distributed it to get the feedback of other people.\"\nWe found no news reports that poll workers were arrested in Birmingham.\nRobyn Bradley Bryan, Alabama Law Enforcement Agency spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that the agency did not arrest any poll workers.\nA spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State, John Bennett, told PolitiFact that there were no poll workers with the names in the article.\nA headline stated \"Alabama state police arrest 3 poll workers in Birmingham.\" There is no evidence that such a crime occurred. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.\n'https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/79fcee64-47e0-40d3-8938-a18c85de3054", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02580"}
