In this photo, a woman is holding an illustration of the father and daughter\u2019s bodies below the word \"caution\" on a yellow sign. She\u2019s smiling and sitting among others, including people standing behind her and aiming their cameras at something out of the frame.\nSome social media users quickly jumped to a partisan conclusion.\n\"A Trump supporter at his rally today,\" reads a July 4 Facebook post with the photo. \"Mocking a dead child. This is what human garbage looks like.\"\u00a0\nThis post, which was shared more than 4,000 times by July 24, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That\u2019s because while the photo is authentic, the Facebook post mischaracterizes what\u2019s happening. The woman was saddened by the drowning of the father and daughter and in an interview with a reporter that was later posted on Twitter, she explains why she\u2019s holding the sign. Though it\u2019s hard to hear everything she says in the video due to background noise, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s not mocking a dead child.\nHere\u2019s what we know.\u00a0\nThe woman was at President Donald Trump\u2019s Fourth of July event on the National Mall. Her photo was taken and shared on Twitter by Alejandro Alvarez, a journalist and photographer with the Washington, D.C., radio station WTOP. Alvarez was covering the president\u2019s \"Salute to America\" event and his reporting included both Trump supporters and protesters. Among the images he tweeted that day was one of a group posing in front of an inflatable diapered baby meant to look like Trump.\nAlvarez also shared the photo of the woman with the caution sign. He explained the image like this text: \"Shocked by an image of a father and daughter dead on the Rio Grande, Jill from Boulder, CO shows me a dark(er) twist on border-region safety signs warning of immigrants crossing roads.\"\nHe\u2019s referring to real immigrant crossing signs that have been used to warn drivers to watch for migrants running across the road. His tweet suggests that the woman\u2019s sign is a commentary on immigration policies. At the least, we know she\u2019s not mocking a dead child.\u00a0\nBut social media users recast the image and rallied to try to identify the woman they claimed was a Trump supporter making light of migrant deaths. MintPress News reporter Alex Rubinstein, who interviewed the woman that day, tweeted screenshots of some of those reactions on Twitter, including one user who said: \"Let\u2019s identify and shame this heartless woman who thinks the death of a toddler and her father is some kind of joke.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubinstein also tweeted the video interview he had with the woman.\u00a0\n\"This woman\u2019s sign has generated a bit of controversy on the internet today, so I decided to post my interview with her from earlier,\" Rubinstein wrote. \"She tells the story of the father and his 2-year-old from El Salvador who drowned trying to make it to the U.S. \u2018It makes me really sad,\u2019 she said.\"\u00a0\nRubinstein asks the woman about the sign, and she explains what happened to the father and daughter \u2014 how they drowned trying to come to the United States \u2014 and how her sign was inspired by the road signs showing migrants crossing the road.\u00a0\n\"And now we\u2019ve got them literally drowning,\" she says, adding that they\u2019re immigrating to try to find a better life. When Rubinstein asks her why that\u2019s an important message for the Fourth of July, the woman says: \"America is made up of immigrants.\" Unless you\u2019re Native American, she says, you\u2019re descended from immigrants. The Fourth should be a celebration of \"us coming over,\" she says.\nShe goes on to say that she\u2019s sad \"by what\u2019s going on\" and mentions \"the children in the cages,\" a reference to the detention of migrant children at the border.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRubinstein went on to tweet that people were trying to dox the woman because of her sign. But, he said, \"I\u2019m not sure how anyone can interpret it as an endorsement of Trump\u2019s border policies - just on its face - but the least they could do is take some time to look into the matter before trying to ruin her life.\"\u00a0\nHe tweeted again later: \"There\u2019s a huge Twitter mob trying to doxx this woman. Agree with the sign or not, it\u2019s clear that she is AGAINST Trump\u2019s border policies. If you see people trying to doxx her, please correct the record by posting my interview in reply.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\nThis Facebook post claims that the woman in the picture is a Trump supporter \"mocking a dead child.\" We don\u2019t know the woman\u2019s political affiliation. But it\u2019s clear from reporting and her own words that she is not mocking a dead migrant child. Rather, she talks about how she\u2019s saddened by what\u2019s happening at the border, and how we should celebrate the United States as a country of immigrants.\nWe rate this Facebook post as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00400"}
