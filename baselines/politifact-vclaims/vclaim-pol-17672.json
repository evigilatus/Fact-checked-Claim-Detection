They will contain RFID Chips,\" the image in the post reads. It continues: \"Many kids will die from the covid-19 vaccine. Just to remind you the 4 kids that took the vaccine, died immediately.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe\u00a0claims in the post\u00a0are\u00a0speculative and misleading in a number of ways, and have\u00a0been debunked by another fact-checking organization.\nCOVID-19 has killed more than half a million people worldwide, including nearly 130,000 in the U.S. Companies around the world are scrambling to develop a vaccine, and many potential vaccines are undergoing safety trials in humans.\u00a0\nHealth officials are struggling to reassure some skeptics that a vaccine can be developed quickly without compromising safety.\nAs of June 30, only one coronavirus vaccine had been approved for limited use. The Chinese government has approved it only for military personnel.\u00a0\nCurrently there is no coronavirus vaccine that has been approved for the American public. And there is no evidence that children have died because they received one of the COVID-19 vaccines being developed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April, PolitiFact investigated a claim that seven children in Senegal died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines and discovered the Facebook post\u2019s claim was false.\u00a0\nIn May, Reuters also reported that social media posts were incorrect in claiming that a TV news report from 2019 showed the deadly results of a COVID-19 vaccination trial in Guinea.\u00a0\nPolitiFact found no evidence that anyone has died from complications related to a trial COVID-19 vaccination.\nPolitiFact has also debunked several false claims involving the coronavirus vaccine and microchips. The U.S. isn\u2019t developing an \"antivirus\" for COVID-19 that will include an RFID chip, for example. There\u2019s also no evidence that Democrats are pushing for mandatory vaccinations or microchip implants to fight the coronavirus.\nAnd there is no evidence yet of any requirement that students be vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning to school, though some states could require it if a vaccine becomes available.\u00a0\nState laws govern immunization requirements for schoolchildren, including those in private schools and daycare centers, but all states allow exemptions for medical reasons, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and some allow exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons.\nOur ruling\nA viral image on Facebook claimed, \"Many kids will die from the covid-19 vaccine. Just to remind you the 4 kids that took the vaccine, died immediately.\"\u00a0\nThere is no evidence that children have died because of the coronavirus vaccines in development, or that a future vaccine will contain microchips.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17672"}
