Material in the letters has been described as racist, anti-gay and anti-Israel.\n\nQuestioned Dec. 29, 2011, by a caller on an Iowa radio talk show, the longtime Republican congressman from Texas said that he wrote pieces on economics for the newsletters but that \"there were many times\" he didn\u2019t edit the entire letters and that he didn't know about the most incendiary passages until years later.\n\n\"These were sentences that were put in,\" Paul said during the interview on WHO-AM in Des Moines, Iowa. \"I think there was a total of about eight or 10 sentences. And it was bad stuff, and it wasn't a reflection of my views at all.\" Later in the interview, Paul elaborated: \"I actually put a type of a newsletter out \u2014 it was a Freedom Report, an Investment Letter, Survival Report, different ways \u2014 every month since 1976. This is probably 10 sentences out of, you know, 10,000 pages, for all I know. I think it's bad that it happened, but I disavowed all these views.\"\n\nWe wondered whether Paul was right that the sentences at issue numbered only eight or 10.\n\nFirst, some background: This is not the first time that Paul has been questioned about the content of his newsletters, which also became an issue in his 1996 U.S. House race and when he ran for president in 2008. In January of that year, the New Republic magazine published a lengthy article on Paul and the newsletters. At the time, it also posted online excerpts from the newsletters, which had such names as Ron Paul\u2019s Freedom Report, Ron Paul Political Report and The Ron Paul Survival Report.\n\nWhen questioned this year about the controversial passages in the newsletters, Paul has repeatedly disavowed them, saying that he didn't write them and didn't review them before they appeared in the newsletters. He has also described himself as a negligent publisher, saying that he should have paid more attention to the newsletters' content.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

Click here for our analysis of the documents.\n\nThe documents sling a range of conspiracy allegations about topics from government control to financial collapse. Several items are anti-homosexual and anti-black; these, as recent news accounts have reported, include a description of the national Martin Luther King Jr. holiday as \"Hate Whitey Day\" and a statement that during the riots after the 1992 Rodney King verdict, \"order was only restored in L.A. when it was time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks.\"\n\nOther examples of inflammatory remarks: A newsletter excerpt that The New Republic listed as being from October 1992 describes \"urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos,\" and an item on AIDS reportedly from a September 1994 newsletter mentions the danger of being infected by \"a malicious gay.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nPaul says the newsletters that bore his name contained only eight to 10 sentences of \"bad stuff.\" Although \"bad stuff\" is in the eye of the beholder, we found nearly three dozen sentences that we think many would find inflammatory \u2014 and that's just in the excerpts we had access to.
