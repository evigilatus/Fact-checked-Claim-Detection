Recently, Obama offered a specific claim about how wealthier Americans would benefit from Romney\u2019s tax plan.\n\nIn a May 5, 2012, campaign speech in Columbus, Ohio, Obama said, \"My opponent won\u2019t tell us how he\u2019d pay for his new, $5 trillion tax cut -- a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country.\"\n\nWe wondered whether Romney\u2019s tax proposal really would be so generous to millionaires. (The Romney campaign didn't respond to our inquiry for this story.)\n\nFirst, some background on what Romney is proposing. Here are some of key elements of his plan, according to the campaign\u2019s website.\n\nFor individuals:\n\n\u2022 Cut marginal rates by one-fifth on a permanent, across-the-board basis\n\u2022 Eliminate interest, dividend, and capital gains taxes for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income below $200,000\n\u2022 Eliminate the estate tax\n\u2022 Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax\n\nFor corporations:\n\n\u2022 Cut the corporate rate to 25 percent\n\u2022 Make permanent the research and development tax credit\n\u2022 Switch to a territorial tax system\n\u2022 Repeal the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax\nThe Romney campaign's website states that lowering both individual and corporate tax rates will stimulate economic growth. High tax rates \"discourage work and entrepreneurship, as well as savings and investment,\" the website states. \"With 54 percent of private sector workers employed outside of corporations, individual rates also define the incentives for job-creating businesses. Lower marginal tax rates secure for all Americans the economic gains from tax reform.\"\u00a0\nAnd in a speech on March 30, 2012, Romney affirmed his plan to cut taxes for everyone:\u00a0\"Taxes should be as low as possible, in line with those of competing nations, and designed to foster innovation and growth. That's why I will cut marginal tax rates across the board. \"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an independent assessment of Romney\u2019s plan, we turned to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a think tank that, among other things, evaluates the tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates. While judging tax proposals is subject to some degree of interpretation, the Tax Policy Center has a significant degree of respect in tax circles.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center looked at two versions of Romney\u2019s tax proposal. We will use the analysis of the more recent of Romney\u2019s two plans, which the group published in March 2012.\n\nBefore we look at the center\u2019s analysis, we should note that the group ran two sets of numbers. One version, known as \"current law,\" essentially gives Romney credit for extending the tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush and for an annual adjustment in the Alternative Minimum Tax. Under this calculation, taxpayers\u2019 savings from these two extensions are added to the total tax cuts from Romney\u2019s tax proposal itself.\n\nThe other version, known as \"current policy,\" assumes that the Bush and AMT tax cuts will be extended, with or without Romney. This method only counts the taxpayer savings from the new proposals in Romney\u2019s tax plan\u00a0 -- a smaller amount of tax savings than Romney would see under the \"current law\" calculation.\n\nIt turns out that the \"current policy\" calculation is the one that backs up Obama\u2019s claim. The Tax Policy Center found that under Romney\u2019s proposal, people with $1 million or more in annual cash income will receive an average tax cut of $250,535. Those in the millionaire category will receive an 11.8 percent increase in after-tax income, easily the highest of any income group. Collectively, the tax savings for millionaires would amount to nearly one-third of all the tax benefits that result from Romney\u2019s plan.\n\nThe \"current law\" analysis shows even bigger gains for millionaires. By this method, the average tax cut for someone with cash income north of $1 million a year would be $390,876, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nAnd the higher you go on the income scale, the bigger the tax cuts become. Under the center\u2019s more restrictive \"current policy\" method, the top one-tenth of 1 percent of taxpayers -- those earning $2,868,534 a year -- would get an average tax cut of $725,716. That accounts for 19.4 percent of all the tax cuts\u2019 benefits.\nOur ruling\n\nEven using the more restrictive of the Tax Policy Center\u2019s two calculations, Romney\u2019s tax plan would save millionaires almost exactly what Obama said -- $250,535.
