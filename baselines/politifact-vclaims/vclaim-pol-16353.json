McCain as a prisoner of war, walking alongside Ronald Reagan and on the campaign trail. Its claims are well supported.\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\"One man sacrificed for his country.\"\n\n\n\nMcCain served 22 years in the U.S. Navy, including five as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down in Vietnam. He has been honored with the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Legion of Merit, Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\n\nOf his remaining Republican contenders, only Rep. Ron Paul has military experience. He served as a medical doctor in the U.S. Air Force from 1963 to 1965 in San Antonio, Texas, and in the U.S. Air National Guard from 1965 to 1968. He did not go to war as McCain did. That appears to be the distinction drawn here.

We need to spend a whole lot more money to get the services back to the people. We need to get the electricity going, the fuel, the water.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has suggested that he, too, would take a different route in Iraq than the president, but McCain was clearly there first.\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\"One man stands up to the special interests.\"\n\n\n\nThis is a reference to McCain's strong opposition to what he calls wasteful pork barrel spending and earmark projects.
