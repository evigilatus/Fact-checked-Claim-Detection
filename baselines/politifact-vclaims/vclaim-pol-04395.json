(On our publication day, the number would have risen to\u00a0270 \u2014 an email from Trump's campaign on publication day declared \"HIDING HILLARY: DAY\u00a0270.\")\nMuch depends on the definition of \"press conference,\" which is to some extent in the eye of the beholder.\nMany independent media outlets have supported Trump\u2019s point. The Washington Post even created a real-time widget showing how long it has been since Clinton last held a press conference:\n\nFor context, Post political writer Chris Cillizza has written, \"The last time Clinton held a press conference was Dec. 5, 2015. That was before: 1. A single state had cast a vote in either a presidential primary or caucus. 2. Major terrorist attacks in Nice, Brussels and Orlando. 3. FBI Director James Comey issued his scathing report on Clinton's email practices while at the State Department. 4. The Bernie Sanders phenomenon. 5. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was run out of the Democratic National Committee in the wake of a massive email hack/leak. 6. This whole Ryan Lochte international gas station incident.\"\nAnd we should note that the Trump campaign has some bona fides for calling Clinton out in this regard: A tally by NBC News counted 17 Trump press conferences in 2016.\nThe Clinton campaign has argued that Clinton has regularly made herself available to the press in ways that are equivalent to press conferences.\u00a0But with one debatable exception, Trump can make a strong case that Clinton hasn\u2019t given a press conference.\nThe Fort Dodge press conference\nClinton\u2019s Dec. 5, 2015 event -- which is the consensus date of her last press conference among reporters and media outlets covering the Clinton campaign -- was held in Fort Dodge, Iowa. (And yes, we counted to make sure Trump's email blast came\u00a0269 days later.) The Clinton campaign provided us with a transcript of the exchange, which we\u2019ve posted in full here.\nClinton answered eight questions. They were heavily focused on substantive topics, including gun control, terrorism, mental health policy, visa waiver rules, and civil liberties.\nGiven the serious tone of the exchanges and the mix of unfiltered questions by members of the traveling press corps, we think the Fort Dodge event qualifies as a genuine press conference, albeit a fairly brief one by standards of a sitting president.\nAnd at least one reporter, CNN\u2019s Dan Merica, referred to the exchange as a \"press conference.\"\nWhile stopping short of labeling them press conferences, the Clinton campaign did offer PolitiFact transcripts of four subsequent events for possible comparison to the Fort Dodge exchange.\nThe Queens press availability\nOn April 4, Clinton visited the Jackson Diner, an Indian buffet in the immigrant-heavy Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, N.Y. The transcript provided by the Clinton campaign is here.\nThis time, the number of questions Clinton took was slightly smaller -- six -- and several were about substantive topics of local interest, including immigration reform and policy toward Wall Street. Other questions, however, were more about campaign tactics and the horse race between Clinton and Sanders. One was on debate preparations, another on incivility among Sanders supporters, and a third was about whether she thought she and her supporters could eventually unify with Sanders and his backers.\nNotably, none of the articles about the event that we found referred to this as a \"press conference.\" One dispatch, in amNewYork, wrote that Clinton \"stopped to take questions from reporters before heading out\" from the restaurant. And the Guardian blogged that Clinton \"has just taken questions from reporters.\"\nThe Compton press availability\nThe next event highlighted by the Clinton campaign took place on June 6 in Compton, Calif., a predominantly African-American jurisdiction near Los Angeles. It came one day before the California presidential primary, the last major contest of the Democratic nominating season.\nClinton took eight questions, with very little about policy matters. Rather, the questions revolved around her electoral prospects in the primary, her battle with Sanders and when President Barack Obama would begin campaigning for her.\nMany dispatches cited a more formal news conference by Sanders on the same day, but most didn\u2019t use the term \"press conference\" for the media\u2019s exchange with Clinton. The Associated Press and the Orlando Sentinel used the phrase \"speaking to reporters,\" while the Guardian used \"told reporters.\" CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin and Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin referred to it as a \"gaggle,\" a term for an impromptu -- and typically brief -- question-and-answer opportunity, often with the politician finishing one event and moving on to another. Griffin referred to it as taking \"a few last-minute questions\" in Compton.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, by the time of Clinton\u2019s Compton visit, some journalists had begun to specifically question the campaign why she hadn\u2019t taken questions for so long.\nAs Fox News reported, reporters covering the campaign rejected Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon\u2019s assertion on CNN that she often \"comes out after an event has concluded\" and \"she'll literally stand there for 15, 20 minutes and answer questions from her traveling press corps.\"\nWashington Post media reporter Callum Borchers called Fallon\u2019s comments \"not true.\"\n\"Talking to reporters in a scrum isn't particularly conducive to live television -- and the comparison here is to Trump's regularly scheduled news conferences, which cable channels often air live -- but at least Clinton would be submitting herself to a similar level of questioning,\" Borchers wrote. (A \"scrum\" is essentially the same thing as a \"gaggle.\")\nBorchers cited calculations by Liz Kreutz of ABC News, who counted \"only nine\" such availabilities, \"none lasting as long as Fallon claimed. In fact, the total duration of all nine was less than 50 minutes, a length that Trump has eclipsed at one single news conference.\"\nFor the Compton event, Kreutz reported that it lasted \"about eight\u00a0minutes -- still well shy of the 15-20 that Fallon said was customary,\" Borchers reported.\nThe Ashland press availability\nThe Clinton campaign also pointed to a joint exchange between Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, and the media on July 31 in Ashland, Ohio. Here\u2019s the transcript.\nReporters got to ask a small number of questions of the running mates, mainly focusing on Trump\u2019s controversial comments about the parents of a fallen soldier, Capt. Humayun Khan, and whether the four fall debates would go off as planned. The opening segment of the exchange is dominated by discussion of the milkshakes they were ordering.\nWe didn\u2019t find any examples of journalists at the time calling this a \"press conference.\"\nThe NABJ-NAHJ conference\nFinally, on Aug. 5, Clinton gave a speech to a joint convention of African-American and Hispanic journalists and followed up with a question-and-answer session. Here is the full transcript.\nThe Clinton campaign pointed to a remark by the NABJ's president, Sarah Glover, who called the event the \"largest press conference with any presidential candidate before a room filled with journalists of color\" when introducing Clinton. NAHJ president Mekahlo Medina also called it a \"press event\" to the Huffington Post. In addition, this was the longest of these events, at roughly 30 minutes.\nKristen Welker of NBC and and Lori Montenegro of Telemundo, the moderators, represented the two journalism organizations; they asked multi-part questions. Three other reporters -- Yamiche Alcindor of the New York Times, Ed O\u2019Keefe of the Washington Post and Kevin Merida of ESPN -- asked a question each. They had been pre-selected by the moderators because they had participated in a preliminary panel.\nHowever, the fact that the moderators chose the questioners from a limited pool of convention participants (and were convention participants themselves) cast doubt for many in the press corps on whether this fit the full definition of a press conference. Politico\u2019s Jennifer Epstein, the Associated Press\u2019 Lisa Lerer, CNN\u2019s Merica, and the Post\u2019s Chris Cillizza and Abby Phillip were among those making that argument on Twitter.\nAfter months of complaints from the traveling press corps that they were not getting a press conference in which they would all have an equal opportunity to ask a question, many were not satisfied that this setup met their demands.\nOther arguments from the Clinton camp\nBeyond pointing to these four examples, Clinton campaign officials have noted that Clinton has made herself available for many interviews.\nFor instance, on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, campaign manager Robby Mook said, \"She's done over 300 interviews this year, and she takes questions in a variety of formats.\"\nWhen NPR looked at the campaign\u2019s documentation on Aug. 25, they confirmed that Clinton had indeed done 350 interviews this year. The analysis also counted nine town-hall sessions from Jan. 1 to July 31, though these question-and-answer sessions were geared more towards members of the public than the media.\nHowever, the analysis noted that about one-fifth of the \"interviews\" were conducted by supporters, rather than journalists, or were done in settings not typically considered journalistic. In addition, NPR reported, \"a spot-check of interviews found most hovered between about three and eight minutes in duration, enough time to be seen on television screens and heard on the air, but short enough time to limit how deeply an interviewer could drill down.\"\n\"Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill, who provided the database to NPR, did not take issue with the network's conclusions when they were shared with him,\" NPR reported.\nCillizza, writing in the Post, found even a large number of interviews insufficient.\n\"Sitdown, one-on-one interviews aren't the same thing as a free-wheeling press conference,\" he wrote. \"There are lots and lots of ground rules that govern sit-downs \u2014 most notably a typically strict time limit that makes pursuing any particular line of questioning in any real depth almost impossible. And then there is the fact that an interview with, say, Jimmy Kimmel, isn't the same thing as a press conference with reporters from the Washington Post, New York Times and the TV networks. Kimmel is a comedian, not a reporter.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump\u2019s email said, \"It has been 269 days since Clinton has held a press conference.\"\nOnly one event in the past 269 days -- Clinton\u2019s appearance before the minority journalists\u2019 convention -- could reasonably be considered a press conference, and there are good arguments for why it isn\u2019t. The questioners were limited to a small pool of convention participants, leaving most of the Clinton campaign press corps \u00a0-- the dozens of journalists who know the campaign the best and who had complained the most about lack of access -- without an equal shot at asking a question.\nThe statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b54d70d-9710-4f3e-9eff-02268f8a0dc3", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04395"}
