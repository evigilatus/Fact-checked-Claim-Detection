{"url": "/factchecks/2017/oct/12/committee-austins-children-pac/claim-about-proposed-austin-school-bonds-silent-in/", "speaker": "Committee of Austin's Children PAC", "vclaim": "Says a proposed $1.05 billion Austin school district bond proposition \"will require no tax rate increase.\"", "truth_label": "mostly-true", "date": "stated on September 24, 2017 in a handout in advance of November 2017 vote on a bond proposition:", "title": "Claim about proposed Austin school bonds is silent on increased dollar costs to property taxpayers", "text": "A handout urging voter support for a proposed $1.05 billion Austin school district bond issue on the November 2017 ballot singles out the need to repair and renovate schools averaging 40 years of age plus a desire to modernize or build 16 schools.\nMoreover, the handout from the Committee of Austin\u2019s Children PAC says: \"Did you know? AISD Prop. 1 bonds will require no tax rate increase,\" a claim the group also makes on its website.\nIs that rate statement accurate?\nTo rehash, the handout says the sought bonds won\u2019t require a \"rate\" increase. It\u2019s silent on whether district residents will pay more in taxes if the proposition passes--which struck Austin lawyer Bill Aleshire, formerly Travis County\u2019s elected judge, as misleading. Aleshire, who brought the handout to our attention, said by email: \"No one in their right mind should believe AISD can borrow $1 billion plus interest and not have a property tax increase as a result.\"\nWhen we asked, David Butts, a consultant to the PAC, told us by phone the group based its rate claim on district presentations. Butts said: \"We\u2019ve never said that you wouldn\u2019t pay higher taxes,\" in that barring an economic recession, escalating local property values stand to drive up how much the district reaps--without the district needing a rate bump. Property taxes are tied to assessed property values which in Austin (like other prosperous cities) lately spiral nearly every year.\nIn this fact-check, we\u2019ll share assumptions behind the no-hike scenario and unpack estimates of how much money the proposed bonds would likely cost homeowners in increased tax bills.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting the speculative quality of tax predictions. To our inquiry, Roger Falk of the Travis County Taxpayers Union, which opposes the proposition, questioned anyone\u2019s ability to fact-check rate-related claims because, he said by phone, tax effects depend on unknowns including whether and how much total appraised property values change and if the district\u2019s intended debt repayment schedules and interest rates bear out.\n\"You cannot assume it\u2019s a sunny day every day,\" Falk said. \"It\u2019s going to rain sometime.\"\nAustin district\u2019s assumptions\nDistrict leaders have said that presuming total assessed property values continue to increase and also that the district repays more than half the proposed debt within a decade, the school board will be spared from considering an increase in the district\u2019s total tax rate of $1.192 per $100 valuation--the bulk of which covers day-to-day maintenance and operations.\nA September 2017 Austin American-Statesman news story elaborated: \"The district points to its last bond election \u2014 $392 million approved by voters in 2013 \u2014 as an example of how it can tamp down the impact on property tax bills. Those bonds were expected to raise the tax rate by 3 cents, or about $38.40 a year to the property tax bill for a $200,000 home.\n\"But instead,\" the story said, \"the district, buoyed by increasing property values, lowered the tax rate by 5 cents per $100 of a home\u2019s assessed value. Homeowners are still paying more, of course, because property values in Austin have shot up 12 percent a year, on average, for the past five years.\"\nTiffany Young, a district spokeswoman, emailed us the district\u2019s August 2017 \"tax capacity analysis\" of the proposed bond costs, which included a summary of annual changes--of late 11-percent-plus annual increases--in total assessed property valuations in the district from 2008 through 2017:\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSOURCE: Document showing tax capacity analysis of proposed bond debt, Austin Independent School District, Aug. 10, 2017 (received by email from Tiffany Young, senior communication specialist, AISD, Sept. 26, 2017)\nThat news story noted that the district\u2019s payback plan for the proposed bond package assumes an annual increase in total assessed property values of 7 percent in the first two years and 1.5 percent for each subsequent year.\n\"Property values actually have a 10-year average growth rate of nearly 8 percent,\" the story said. School leaders advised that if there\u2019s a flattening in property-value increases, the district could tap $46 million in reserves, or savings, to make up for lost revenue.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the story quoted Ellen Wood, who chairs the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce\u2019s board of directors, calling district assumptions behind no tax-rate hike prediction \"conservative and appropriate.\" By phone, Wood told us chamber members based that judgment on talks with the district\u2019s chief financial officer, Nicole Conley Johnson, and a firm advising the district on the proposed issuance.\nTo our inquiries, Conley Johnson reaffirmed the district\u2019s conclusion that the proposed bonds can be paid off without a tax-rate hike. In fact, Conley Johnson said by phone, she expects the district to land interest rates perhaps 2 percentage points less than the 5 percent rate assumed in its modeling, a decrease that would reduce repayment costs. Noting increased assessed property valuations in recent years, Conley Johnson also said it\u2019s reasonable to expect assessed values to surge more each year than the 1.5 percent rate assumed in the modeling past the first couple years.\nIf the\u00a0proposition fails at the polls, Conley Johnson confirmed, the school board could reduce the debt portion of the district tax rate in 2021-22 by $0.0297 per $100 valuation to $0.0833 with additional reductions doable most subsequent years through 2039-40--though that scenario depends, perhaps improbably, on no additional costs accumulating in the intervening years. If the proposition passes, Conley Johnson said, in 2022, the district will need some $35.5 million to pay incremental costs on the proposed bonds. An estimated $35.5 million would be raised by from that $0.0297 per $100 valuation in tax rate, the district projects.\nWorst-case scenarios?\nWe separately asked Conley Johnson and Chris Allen of First Southwest, the firm hired by the district as financial advisers on the proposition, to lay out a worst-case scenario that might cause district officials to recommend a rate increase after all.\n\"You\u2019d have to have a major economic downturn,\" Allen said by phone. \"You\u2019d have to have the housing market plummet.\" Allen, referring to the district\u2019s assumed 7 percent increases in total assessed valuations in both 2019 and 2020, said: \"I think the 7 percent is conservative. If you look around, there are cranes everywhere. The housing\" and commercial \"market is on fire.\"\nConley Johnson said by email: \"We estimate that if\" total assessed valuation \"growth stayed flat for the next 8 years or there was a cumulative decline in AV of 20%, we would need to consider increasing the tax rate. \u00a0Of course.\" she said, \"these events would buck historical trends of the last 10 years where there was only year that AV declined, in 2011 due to the national recession--arguably the worst in history. \u00a0Even still, there was subsequent growth thereafter and the decline was made-up after two years and growth doubled after that.\"\nFalk, the proposition foe, questioned the assumption that the district can repay the bonds at a 5 percent interest rate past this next year. \"There\u2019s no science--no way to know--past one year,\" Falk said. Falk called the assumed annual increases in total property valuations a \"best guess.\"\nWe also asked Charles Gilliland, a land-market expert at Texas A&M University, to evaluate the no-rate-increase claim. Gilliland said by phone the district\u2019s post-2020 assumption that total assessed property values will increase 1.5 percent annually seems \"pretty conservative. The rest of the story is it\u2019s not going to be a nice steady increase,\" Gilliland said. \"There are going to be ups and downs.\"\nGenerally, Gilliland said by email: \"Without exhaustive historical studies of the parameters of their model and an examination of the operating conditions of the district, I have no evidence to cast doubt on the assumptions underlying the\" district\u2019s analysis.\nCosts to taxpayers\nFalk called the tax-rate claim by itself a \"head fake\" intended to dupe voters into overlooking that each taxpayer would be paying more dollars to cover bond repayments. He also emailed us the taxpayer group\u2019s analysis, which provides estimated effects on property tax bills by assuming that \u00a0total assessed valuations within district boundaries won\u2019t go up or down.\nThen again, the district has acknowledged that property owners will pay more in taxes to pay debt service on the bonds, if approved.\nA June 2017 American-Statesman news story on school board members voting to place the proposition before voters initially noted that district officials said the tax rate would remain flat at $1.192 per $100 of assessed property value, with $1.079 designated for operations and $0.113 of the rate going toward repaying debt issued to fund capital improvements. Still: \"For the owner of the district\u2019s average taxable value home of $355,947, the school tax bills would total nearly $4,243. As properties increase in value,\" the story said, \"that same tax rate would lead to increasingly higher tax bills.\"\nDistrict web pages devoted to the proposition similarly indicate property owners will likely face increases in what the district bills. We initially spotted no estimates of how much more, but estimates were provided when we asked.\nLet\u2019s cover those web posts, then turn to what the district gave us.\nHere\u2019s a question on the district\u2019s main FAQ section about the proposition: \"I've heard AISD say this bond will not raise my property tax rate. How is that possible?\" The 202-word reply stresses the district\u2019s plan not to issue the sought debt all at once plus plans to draw on other funds; it doesn\u2019t concede additional direct-to-taxpayer bond costs.\nWe saw this question on a separate district Finance FAQ web page about the proposition: \"So does this mean that I won\u2019t have an increase in my tax bill?\"\nThe district\u2019s reply opens, \"No.\" That reply otherwise says higher taxes depend on the appraised value of taxable property, \"which is determined by the\" Travis Central Appraisal District, \"not AISD. An increase or decrease in taxable property value, even with no change in the tax rate, would result in an increase or decrease in the actual amount of taxes paid.\"\nThe reply goes on to note that residents who qualify for Travis County\u2019s over-65 homestead exemption wouldn\u2019t pay more in school taxes. Moreover, the reply continues, other governing entities levy property taxes including the city of Austin, Travis County, the Austin Community College District and the Travis County Health Care District. \"The rates for each entity are set annually by the elected or governing officials,\" the district says. \"The rate for each of the taxing entities is then applied to your home value,\" it says.\nWe also noticed the last, 18th question on the district\u2019s main FAQ page for the proposition: \"What's the bottom line, the one thing you want voters to know?\" The district\u2019s reply: \"AISD needs to address facility deficiencies and is committed to creating 21st-century learning spaces for our students. We can do so without a tax rate increase.\"\nConley Johnson told us that in 2021-22 (the third year of the district starting to sell and repay the bond debt being presented to voters), the cost to taxpayers of the new debt would range from $29.70 for the owner of a property with an assessed value of $100,000 up to $297 for the owner of a property with an assessed value of $1 million. See the district\u2019s full chart here.\nAccording to what Conley Johnson described as the district\u2019s worst-case modeling of the proposed bonds\u2019 effect on taxes, the owner of an Austin homestead at the average 2017-18 assessed value ($332,103) would see the debt portion of her or his district tax bill increase from $375 in 2017-18 to $484 in 2027-28--driven by expected bumps in assessed property values.\nAbsent the sought bonds or other approved debt, this modeling indicates, the 2027-28 costs to such a homeowner for district debt would total $250.57. An owner of a homestead at the 2017-18 median value ($262,282) would face $382.75 in district debt-tied taxes in 2027-28--up from $296 in 2017-18 and greater than the $197.89 in such taxes the homeowner would face if the district doesn\u2019t issue additional debt.\nThere\u2019s more: As we made our inquiries, the district posted a document estimating each homesteading homeowner\u2019s future tax payments to the district related to paying off the proposed bonds. Upshot: Starting in 2022, some $0.0297 per $100 valuation of the district\u2019s tax rate would generate sufficient revenue to pay debt service on the sought bonds, the document says. The share of the district\u2019s tax rate needed to pay that debt service will escalate in subsequent years, the document says, with that share reaching its maximum of $0.0530 per $100 valuation as of 2029.\nAccording to the document, the district estimates the dollar costs in annual taxes on the median-value homestead in the district--which in 2017 had an appraised value of $287,282--to be $77.90 in 2022 and $139.01 in 2029. At the upper end, the estimated annual dollar costs due to debt service on the proposed bonds to a homestead appraised at $1 million in 2017 is shown as $289.58 in 2022, $516.75 in 2029.\nOur ruling\nThe PAC said the proposed Austin school district bonds \"will require no tax rate increase.\"\nMissing from this claim: Individual homeowners are expected to pay more in property taxes even if the tax rate remains the same, which looks likely thanks to rising property valuations in a hot real-estate market.\nWe rate this statement, which lacks the important clarification that only the tax rate isn\u2019t expected to rise, Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE\u2013The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
