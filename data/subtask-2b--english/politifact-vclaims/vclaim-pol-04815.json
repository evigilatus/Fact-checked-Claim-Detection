I think that\u2019s the press. No. 1, they can\u2019t do it legally. No. 2, I worked for one year, and we won all those delegates,\" Trump said. \"So I win 37 states and somebody else won none, and they\u2019re going to be the nominee? I don\u2019t think so.\"\nTrump has a point that this would be against the current rules, but those rules won\u2019t necessarily govern this year\u2019s Republican National Convention. If the delegates decide to change the rules in July and thwart his nomination, it may seem anti-democratic. But it\u2019s within their authority to do so.\nAt the heart of the matter are the 112 members of the rules committee \u2014 a man and a woman from each state and the District of Columbia. They determine convention guidelines and have the power to change the rules when they convene in Cleveland.\nThe committee has the power to make various moves, such as passing a \"conscience clause,\" imposing a supermajority rather than a majority threshold, or releasing all the delegates to support whomever they want rather than the candidate who won their state\u2019s primary or caucus. The Trump campaign actually seemed aware of this in March 2016.\n\"They can throw out the chairman. You can throw out the RNC members. You can do anything,\" Barry Bennett, Trump\u2019s convention strategist, said in March.\nSo should the rules committee adopt the wishes of the \"Anybody but Trump\" movement, then the nomination \"is still up to the delegates,\" said Joshua Putnam, a government professor at the University of Georgia.\nIn fact, National Review staff writer David French pointed out the only time the delegates were truly bound, according to the rules, was in the party\u2019s only contested convention in 1976.\nStill, having the delegates vote how they wish from the start of the convention would be controversial. Putnam noted that Trump could certainly sue if the conscience clause is adopted. Trump did, after all, secure the majority of delegates and some state party rules and state laws do commit their delegates.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Putnam and others say it\u2019s unlikely the courts will decide in Trump\u2019s favor, given how they\u2019ve ruled in the past.\nHere\u2019s how Eric\u00a0O\u2019Keefe of the Wisconsin Club for Growth and David Rivkin Jr., a constitutional litigator who served in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, put it in a Wall Street Journal op-ed:\n\"State laws that purport to bind delegates can\u2019t be enforced without violating the First Amendment. A political party is a private association whose members join together to further their shared beliefs through electoral politics, and they have a right to choose their representatives. The government has no business telling parties how to select their candidates or leaders: That would be a serious infringement of the rights to free association and speech.\"\nO\u2019Keefe and Rivkin pointed to two Supreme Court cases \u2014 Cousins vs. Wigoda (1975) and Democratic Party vs. Wisconsin ex rel. LaFollette (1980) \u2014 that both held states don\u2019t have the authority to override a party\u2019s nominating process. In other words, the parties are in control of themselves.\nIn Trump\u2019s case, that means the rules committee\u2019s decision to release the delegates would effectively override a state\u2019s law binding its delegates.\n\"Any time the issue of intraparty politics come up, the court sides with the party,\" said Putnam.\nOur ruling\nTrump said delegates seeking to change the convention rules to prevent his nomination \"can\u2019t do it legally.\"\nUnder current rules, the delegates are bound to vote for whomever won their state\u2019s primary or caucus (in most cases, Trump). But if this year\u2019s rules committee votes to change the rules to thwart Trump, it\u2019s well within its authority to do so. And intervention by the courts would be unlikely. Because political parties are private organizations, courts have said they can set their own rules.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fec8deb7-1f35-4b1d-88c8-76cb4e5954a9\n\u00a0\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated the co-author of the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0op-ed.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04815"}
