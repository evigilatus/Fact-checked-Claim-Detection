Abe Lincoln: 22 when he first ran for office. My personal favorite: James Madison was just 25 years old when he signed the Declaration of Independence,\" Cawthorn said.\nWhile Cawthorn\u2019s claims about Washington and Lincoln merit minor corrections, there\u2019s a big problem with his claim about Madison.\nMadison did turn 25 in 1776, the same year the Declaration of Independence was signed. But Madison didn\u2019t sign it. You can see the list of signatories on the website for the National Archives.\nBorn March 16, 1751, Madison was a young adult when he made significant contributions to the foundation of the United States. He participated in the framing of the Virginia Constitution in 1776. Before he became president in 1809, Madison in 1789 introduced a proposed Bill of Rights to the Constitution, according to the National Constitution Center.\nIn an email to PolitiFact Wednesday night, Cawthorn\u2019s spokesman said he meant to point out Madison\u2019s age at the time the Declaration was signed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden \u201chas issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"During the taping Madison Cawthorn wanted to mention James Madison,\" campaign spokesman John Hart said. \"He meant to say James Madison was 25 when the Declaration was written. His point stands that young people have made an enormous impact in this country, and still can.\"\nThursday morning, Cawthorn tweeted about the mistake.\nLet\u2019s briefly review Cawthorn\u2019s claims about the other presidents.\nWashington: Washington was sworn-in as a major of a militia when he was 21 and volunteered for active duty some ten months later, according to the U.S. Army\u2019s website. A possible cause of confusion: Britain adopted a new calendar during Washington\u2019s lifetime.\u00a0\nThe National Archives record shows Washington was born in Virginia on February 11, 1731, according to the then-used Julian calendar. However, Britain and its colonies adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752 \u2014 moving Washington's birthday a year and 11 days to February 22, 1732.\nLincoln: Abraham Lincoln was born on Feb. 12, 1809. He was 23 when he first ran for office in 1832, according to the Library of Congress. He finished eighth in a field of 13 candidates seeking a seat in the Illinois General Assembly, the NPS says. He was elected two years later.\nIn a speech urging viewers to know American history, Cawthorn\u2019s inaccurate claim about Madison stands out.\nWe rate Cawthorn\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17193"}
