To determine the measurement it used in its ranking -- minimum net worth -- Roll Call used the total minimum reported value of the lawmakers\u2019 assets minus the total minimum reported value of their liabilities. So the real amount could well be higher.\nIn addition, the law exempts various types of holdings from disclosure, including the value of a primary residence, the value of personal possessions that aren\u2019t held for investment purposes, and the value of retirement accounts. (The Center for Responsive Politics has a summary of what must be included in these forms here.)\nThese factors led Roll Call to caution in its survey that \"the disclosure forms are imperfect at best.\" Indeed, the data is vague enough that the differences between the net worths of the senators who cluster around Sanders verge on being indistinguishable.\nIn fact, 10 other senators\u00a0beyond the list of 18 above\u00a0had a minimum net worth of less than $400,000 -- Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Robert Menendez, D-N.J.; Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; Bob Casey, D-Pa.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; Mike Enzi, R-Wyo.; and Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.\nThat said, Sanders is largely correct that he\u2019s on the lower end of the chamber\u2019s income scale: The median senator, by Roll Call\u2019s calculation, was $1.1 million, or almost seven times Sanders\u2019 net worth.\nOur ruling\nSanders said, \"I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate.\"\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the financial-disclosure forms produce values too vague to be 100 percent certain of where each senator ranks in net worth. And with a minimum net worth of $160,000, we wouldn\u2019t say Sanders is poor. That said, a credible calculation using financial disclosure forms put Sanders as having the 19th lowest net worth in the Senate. We rate the statement Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8f91756-1e20-48c6-9d55-44f4d3c615b1", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05103"}
