This allegation of advertising has drawn our attention: \"As Commissioner of Insurance, Steve Boyzner has pledged to prevent immigrant children from ever receiving Medical health insurance.\" The Ricardo Lara Insurance Commissioner &apos; s 2018 campaign issued the above-mentioned declaration. Boisner, who served as the Commissioner of Insurance from 2007 to 2011, is running for an open post this year after his party membership has been transferred from the Republican to the Independent. The governor, Dave Jones, a democracy, is named after him. The California Insurance Commissioner regulates the insurance industry and implements State law, but does not establish it. We wanted to know if Lara's allegations about Boisner were accurate. We've begun to verify the truth. When asked about the prosecution, Richie Ross, consultant to the Larra election campaign, referred to an announcement of the election campaign from the 2010 Boisner nomination for governor, when he took many tough positions on immigration. The ad shows a car crashing from the cliff, as Boisner says: \"We all know California is headed straight to the cliff. How did this happen? Years of liberal failure do a lot for many. Take illegal immigration: Politicians lacked the courage to deal with the problem. In my capacity as governor, I will suspend the benefits that are financed by taxpayers for illegal immigrants.\" In the Declaration, Boisner does not specifically mention health benefits, but instead undertakes to make a comprehensive commitment to stop all benefits to undocumented Californians. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" In April, Bouzner told the editorial boards that he had changed some of his attitudes about immigration. \"I regret the tone and direction we took in that campaign,\" he said, in an interview with the Gulf News Group Editorial Board this week, his approach in that race called \"mistake and prejudice.\" Boisner told the editorial board that he now believed that all undocumented people should be \"placed on a path to obtaining documents,\" and that young people in the International Development Assistance Agency (IDA) program should be eligible for American citizenship, as stated by the Mercury News. The editorial board of the San Francisco magazine also reported that it no longer wished to reduce the educational benefits of undocumented migrants. Boisner said that he took his previous positions against immigrants while under \"pressure of anger\" in a competitive initial race against former Ebay Executive Director Meg Whitman, according to the newspaper. The Boisner campaign did not respond to three requests from Polyte Fact California regarding its position on the specific issue of providing health benefits to undocumented children. During his term in the Legislature, Lara extended health coverage to all undocumented Californians. In 2015, Gov. Jerry Brown signed the Health for All Children Act 2015, which gave Medi Cal coverage to undocumented children and adolescents. In a full-page press release, Ricardo Lara claimed that his opponent in the California Insurance Commissioner's race, Steve Boisner, \"meeted to prevent immigrant children from receiving health insurance in Medekal\" when Bouzner took office in the former state. Bosner made a general promise to withhold benefits from undocumented Californians, although eight years ago, in an initial Republican race for the Governor. In a declaration, he said: \"I will suspend the benefits financed by taxpayers for illegal immigrants,\" although he did not specify the type of benefits. It should be noted that Lara &apos; s statement ignores Bouzner &apos; s shift in migration. Bosner told the press this spring that he now prefers some benefits for undocumented Californians and a way of citizenship for the Central Development Assistance Agency beneficiaries, and that his previous approach was \"harmful.\" The Boisner campaign did not respond to requests for health benefits for undocumented children, leaving it unclear. In the end, we found some right to Lara's statement, but he leaves important details and gets things out of context. We value it half right. The truth is now - the statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or leaves things out of context.
