Two days after the election, she was selected by her peers to serve as minority floor leader.\n\n\nQuade spoke with reporters after the selection. She said she \"read an article that we had the largest amount of millennial Democrats running than any other state in the country.\"\n\n\nAt 33, Quade is a millennial herself.\n\n\nBecause she has taken over an important leadership role in the Missouri House, we decided to check out her claim to see if Missouri really did have more millennial Democrats run for state legislature positions than any other state.\n\n\nWhat do the numbers say?\n\n\nWhen we reached out to Quade, she pointed us to a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0and an\u00a0article\u00a0from the progressive PAC Run for Something, whose mission is to support millennial Democrats running for state legislature.\n\n\nThe article links to a study conducted by Run for Something and the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which looks into the number of millennials running for state offices across the United States.\n\n\nThe committee\u2019s communications director, Mara Sloan, said millennials were defined as candidates 18-34 years old and based on candidate filing information.\n\n\nThe start and end points of generations aren\u2019t exact and rather are determined by researchers as tools for analysis.\n\n\nThe Pew Research Center currently defines millennials as those aged 22 to 37 this year. But it acknowledges that many others \"have offered well-reasoned arguments for drawing that line a few years earlier or later than where we have.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it looks like the legislative campaign committee\u2019s numbers are in the same ballpark.\n\n\nThe study presents a state-by-state breakdown of numbers of millennial Democrats who ran for state legislatures in 46 states, excluding Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and Virginia, which don\u2019t hold state legislature elections in general election years.\n\n\nAccording to the data, Missouri had 31 millennial Democrats run for state office, of which 12 would go on to win their elections.\n\n\nMissouri barely edged out Pennsylvania, which had 30, while Nevada and Wyoming had the least, with two millennial Democrats running for office in each state.\n\n\nWe could not find any similar data on number of Republican millennials running for state legislature, either in Missouri or nationwide.\n\n\nMorley Winograd, a millennial politics expert and senior fellow at the University of Southern California, said the reason that there was such large variance in the number of Democrat millennials running in some states over others was likely caused \"by the issues being debated in those state legislatures and the organizing motivation it provided for recruiting candidates of this type in those states.\"\n\n\nLiberal-leaning issues on the Missouri ballot in November, such as medical marijuana and the minimum wage raise, likely contributed to this.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nQuade said that she \"read an article that we had the largest amount of millennial Democrats running than any other state in the country.\"\n\n\nQuade referenced an October study from the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee and the group Run For Something. While the study excluded four states, it found that Missouri had the most millennial Democrats run for office, and we didn\u2019t find any data or expert opinion to the contrary of their numbers.\n\n\nFor these reasons, we rate her statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01213"}
