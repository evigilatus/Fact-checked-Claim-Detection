Martin Luther King, champion in the \u201860s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans, and it is what he was fighting for on the day he was killed in 1968,\" Yang told Iowa voters on Sept. 21. \"A thousand economists endorsed it. It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971.\"\nYang, an entrepreneur seeking the Democratic nomination for president, has made similar claims on Twitter and while debating fellow Democrats.\nYang\u2019s Freedom Dividend plan is a form of universal basic income, guaranteeing $1,000 a month to every U.S. citizen over 18 years old, without having to pass a test or meet a work requirement.\nPolitiFact decided to look into the history of universal basic income, particularly Yang\u2019s reference to Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King, Jr., and 1970s legislation. We found that his comparisons are broadly correct, but not precise.\nRELATED: Andrew Yang\u2019s universal basic income proposal, explained\n\"Thomas Paine was for it at our founding, called it the citizen\u2019s dividend.\"\nPaine wrote that Earth in its \"natural uncultivated state\" was the common property of the human race. He believed that cultivation and private land ownership deprived non-landowners of their \"natural inheritance.\"\u00a0\nPaine suggested a national fund to compensate individuals for that loss, whether they were rich or poor. He proposed a one-time payment of 15 pounds to every person when they turned 21 years old; and that every person aged 50, and all others who arrived at that age, be paid 10 pounds annually for the rest of their lives.\nPaine\u2019s proposal in the 1790s pamphlet Agrarian Justice was in some ways an early version of the Social Security program and has an element of universal basic income, said Harvey J. Kaye, a democracy and justice studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. But it wasn\u2019t the same thing.\nAlso, Paine\u2019s plan wasn't published at the founding of the United States in 1776 but about two decades later, inspired by the French Revolution, said Gary Berton, coordinator for the Institute for Thomas Paine Studies at Iona College and secretary of the Thomas Paine National Historical Association. Paine also never used the term \"citizen's dividend\" in relation to his proposal (he called it \"the plan\"), Berton said.\n\"Martin Luther King, champion in the \u201860s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans, and it is what he was fighting for on the day he was killed in 1968.\"\nIt is true that King supported a guaranteed income in his 1967 book, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?\" But he wasn\u2019t explicitly advocating for it on the day he was killed.\nKing wrote that past approaches to fighting poverty (particularly housing programs, education, and family counseling) were not coordinated, developed at different rates, and were indirect approaches to solving poverty.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective \u2014 the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income,\" King wrote.\nYang is on solid footing in claiming that King sought a form of guaranteed income, even if King is not well known for that position, said Doug E. Thompson, a history professor and director of the Spencer B. King Jr. Center for Southern Studies at Mercer University.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nKing was killed April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn. He was there to prepare for a march on behalf of sanitation workers who were striking and advocating for better working conditions and better pay. King saw the strike as a good way to highlight the need for his Poor People\u2019s Campaign, Thompson said.\n\"Guaranteed income was not on the table in Memphis as much as the plight of folks who worked hard in the U.S. but could not overcome the wealth gaps that kept poor people in cycles of poverty,\" Thompson said. \"It would have been an outgrowth of Memphis, but not its central focus.\"\n\"It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971.\"\nThe House in 1970 and 1971 passed bills that \"were as close as the U.S. has come to passing something resembling a universal basic income,\" said Brian Steensland, professor and chair of sociology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.\u00a0\nThe New York Times in April 1970 reported that the Democrat-led House voted 243-155 for President Richard Nixon\u2019s revision of the welfare system, establishing \"for the first time the principle that the government should guarantee every family a minimum annual income, even if one or more of its members is working.\" The proposal included a work requirement. In June 1971, the House again voted 288-132 for an omnibus bill that included a proposal to guarantee families an annual income.\nWhile there was wide interest in the 1960s and early 1970s for a \"guaranteed annual income,\" the specifics of what the term meant, the proposals, and related discourse changed over time.\n\"Nixon\u2019s plan was more \u2018conservative\u2019 than many of the available guaranteed annual income plans at the time, and his rhetoric was more conservative than the plans themselves,\" Steensland said. \"His rhetoric was very work-oriented. Nixon constantly referenced moving people from the \u2018welfare rolls\u2019 to the \u2018payrolls,\u2019 though in fact many of the recipients would have received income from both sources.\"\nAnother key point about the Nixon plan: It was based on a negative income tax model, meaning the total amount distributed would have depended on recipients\u2019 income level. Universal basic income proposals, like Yang\u2019s, seek to give everyone a flat amount, regardless of how much money they make.\nOur ruling\nYang said about universal basic income, \"Thomas Paine was for it at our founding.... Martin Luther King, champion in the \u201860s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans\u2026 It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971.\"\nPaine supported a one-time payment to all individuals when they reached 21 and a version of today\u2019s Social Security program. King advocated for a guaranteed minimum income. The House passed something close to universal basic income once in 1970 and once in 1971, not twice in 1971.\nOverall, Yang\u2019s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
