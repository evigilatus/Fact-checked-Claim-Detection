Mitt Romney over his record of fiscal stewardship while in office.\n\nThe ad says that Romney \"left Massachusetts $1 billion in debt.\"\n\nWe decided to see if that was accurate.\n\nIn the ad, the Red White and Blue Fund cites three articles that were included in an opposition-research document attributed to the campaign of Arizona Sen. John McCain, who faced Romney in the Republican presidential primary four years earlier.\n\nOne of the articles ran in the Boston Globe on Dec. 30, 2006, during the transition period between the governorships of Romney, who didn\u2019t seek reelection, and his successor, Democrat Deval Patrick.\n\nThe Globe reported that aides to Patrick said the state \"is facing a deficit that could reach $1 billion next year, a looming budget gap that observers say could force Patrick to scale back his ambitious agenda, slash spending, or raise taxes.\"\n\nThe Globe reported that in a Nov. 27, 2006, briefing to Patrick, Romney aides projected a budget deficit of between $400 million and $1.1 billion for fiscal 2008, which was to begin in July 2007, six months into Patrick\u2019s term. The total state budget at the time was $26 billion.\n\nSo the ad has some justification for using the $1 billion figure. But based on our discussions with budget experts in the state, we find the ad ignores important details:\n\n\u2022 The number in question was a projection of a possible future budget deficit. It was an estimate, based on a snapshot of economic data, of what might happen, and it was offered to allow Patrick to figure out how to balance the budget for a fiscal year beginning more than six months later. It was not a final scorecard on Romney\u2019s time as governor.\n\nIn fact, about a month after the private briefing, Romney issued an updated projection that was more optimistic, based on healthier revenue projections. In the Globe article, aides to Patrick accused Romney of offering the public sunnier projections in public than they gave in private. But it eventually became clear that the revenue picture was indeed improving -- enough to allow Patrick to restore $383.6 million in emergency budget cuts Romney had made a month earlier.\n\n\"The revenue did come in a bit better than planned, and ultimately Patrick presented a balanced budget,\" said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent budget think tank. Widmer informally advised Patrick\u2019s transition team. \"There was a tight budget, and it couldn\u2019t fund some of the increases Patrick had proposed in the campaign, but it didn\u2019t result in major cuts, either.\"\n\n\u2022 The ad\u2019s use of the term \"debt\" is inaccurate. The figure cited in the 2006 briefing referred to a projected shortfall for one fiscal year. \"Debt\" in the budgetary context refers to the cumulative total of all past deficits, less surpluses. And this wasn't even a deficit -- it was a projected shortfall that state officials had to address in order to balance the budget.\n\n\u2022 Using the $1 billion figure means taking the high end of a range that begins at $400 million.\n\n\u2022 Massachusetts, like most states, has a requirement that the governor must submit, and the Legislature must pass, a balanced budget. So contrary to the ad\u2019s suggestion, there was never an official deficit, much less one 10 digits in scope.\n\nAnd even if there had been a deficit that big, Romney wouldn\u2019t get full blame.\n\n\"The final budget document is the creation of the Massachusetts Legislature, which now has and did have a veto-proof Democratic majority during Romney\u2019s reign,\" said Fred Bayles, director of the Boston University Statehouse Program. \"Governors submit the first budget draft, which then goes through major changes in the Legislature. It is disingenuous for any governor to take the credit or blame for the final budget.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe ad says Romney \"left Massachusetts $1 billion in debt.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
