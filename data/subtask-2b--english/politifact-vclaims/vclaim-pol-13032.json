During the question-and-answer part of the program, Cantor took several verbal swipes at President Barack Obama, a Democrat. The criticism included that Obama hasn\u2019t done enough to promote more sources of energy, specifically coal, as motorists fume over high gas prices.\n\n\"We are the Saudi Arabia of coal,\" Cantor said.\n\nMore than 90 percent of U.S. coal production goes to generate electricity in the United States, according to the National Mining Association. Cantor explained his point about coal.\n\n\"We ought to be able to figure out a way to use that resource so that we can continue to compete,\" he said.\n\nWe wondered in what way was Cantor attempting to make the comparison to Saudi Arabia. John Murray, Cantor\u2019s deputy chief of staff, said the congressman was attempting to be \"illustrative.\"\n\nMurray added more in an email.\n\n\"Coal is an abundant domestic resource that remains critical to meeting our country's energy needs,\" Murray said.\"While we wait for the administration to present a realistic national energy strategy, we need to harness our existing assets -- like coal -- to generate the power required by American businesses and families.\"\n\nSo let\u2019s look closer at this comparison between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Even Obama has repeated the phrase, during a 2009 television interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Co.\n\nSaudi Arabia exports more oil than any nation in the world, 8.7 million barrels a day, according to one U.S. government estimate. Saudi Arabia also has a larger oil reserve than any other country, the U.S. says. The U.S., by the way, ranks 13th and 14th, respectively, in those categories.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the numbers show, is the king of oil exports and reserves.\n\nNow, is the U.S. the king of coal?\n\nThe U.S. leads the world in the amount of coal in its reserves, according to data kept by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Russia was second, but about 50 percent behind the U.S., the EIA data show. But is the former Cold War foe playing coy with its numbers? Some experts believe Russia and China are not releasing the complete estimates of their coal reserves.\n\nThe U.S. is producing and exporting less coal than some other nations.\n\nThe U.S. produced nearly 1.1 billion short tons of coal in 2009, second to China, according to the most recent data available from the EIA. A short ton of coal equals 2,000 pounds. America\u2019s annual coal production has been about the same since 2000. China, whose economy has boomed during the past decade, has increased its coal production from nearly 1.3 billion short tons in 2000 to nearly 3.4 billion short tons in 2009, EIA data show.\n\nFor eight of the past 10 years, the United States has exported an average of 50 million short tons of coal each year. The U.S. currently exports less coal than Australia, Colombia, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa.\n\nThe U.S. has the world\u2019s most comprehensive and strongest coal mining regulations, the National Mining Association says. Hal Quinn, the association\u2019s president, told a congressional committee Tuesday that the federal government has placed \"high hurdles\" on the industry\u2019s efforts to access land where much of the nation\u2019s coal reserves are held. The association represents about 325 corporations in the mining industry.\n\nOthers question how minable those reserves are. West Virginia University law school professor Patrick McGinley said much of America\u2019s coal is in places that are more difficult to mine. He noted recent research that concludes that the world\u2019s coal production (its highest quality and reasonably minable coal) will reach its peak this year.\n\n\"It\u2019s not realistic to equate the coal reserves in the United States with the oil reserves in Saudi Arabia,\" said McGinley, who served on a panel that investigated the coal mine explosion in West Virginia that killed 29 people in April 2010.\n\nCantor\u2019s argument is supported by data that show the United States currently has the world\u2019s largest coal reserve. America has fallen far behind China in terms of coal production, and the United States is behind several other nations in exporting coal. The congressman\u2019s statement leaves out some details concerning America\u2019s standing in coal.\n\nSince the United States is still the Saudi Arabia of coal reserves, we rate Cantor\u2019s claim as Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13032"}
