There's folks that are not in this chamber today because of that very issue,\" he told radio station WUSF\u2019s Health News Florida. \"People spoke in those districts, and we feel like Medicaid expansion isn\u2019t necessarily a very popular issue on the street.\"\nThe Florida House and Senate are currently debating whether to expand the program to insure the very poor as part of contentious budget negotiations. Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, opposes Medicaid expansion and was speaking broadly about how discussing it had doomed some candidates\u2019 political ambitions. His office said he \"was speaking as a matter of his perspective.\"\nBut we at PolitiFact Florida thought his statement can be verified or contradicted by public opinion polls. And since it's such a critical issue in Florida,\u00a0we decided to take a look.\nIt\u2019s all in the wording\nThe Legislature is debating whether to accept billions from the federal government to increase the number of people eligible for Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act. More than 800,000 currently uninsured Floridians would join the program\u2019s rolls.\nThe federal government would pay 100 percent of the expansion at first, gradually shifting to 90 percent by 2020. (The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 the expansion was optional for states; 28 states and the District of Columbia have expanded the program as of April 2015.) The Florida Senate now favors an expansion while the House opposes it.\nSenators have proposed the Florida Health Insurance Affordability Exchange Program, which would create a state-run private insurance exchange for low-income Floridians with federal dollars. Residents using the exchange would pay premiums and be required to either have a job or attend school. The House has not set forth a proposal of their own.\nSeveral polls over the years have looked at whether Floridians favor making the program larger. In 2013, three polls showed support for expansion as high as 62 or 63 percent, although one from the James Madison Institute was as low as 30 percent. One 2014 University of Florida poll put approval of expansion at 67 percent.\nThat\u2019s a pretty wide range, but it likely had a lot to do with how the poll questions were worded, according to Alan Reifman, a Texas Tech University professor who specializes in social science research methodology.\nThe James Madison Institute poll\u2019s question focused on how the state\u2019s budget would grow with a bigger Medicaid program, with no mention of how many Floridians would be covered or that the federal government would be paying the lion\u2019s share, Reifman said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRick Scott\n\n\nstated on July 2, 2012 in comments on CNBC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Medicaid expansion is \"going to cost Florida $1.9 billion a year.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 July 2, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Public Policy Polling question that included state and federal costs, plus the number of people who would benefit through coverage and new jobs was \"probably the most balanced question-wording of those I\u2019ve seen,\" he said. That poll tallied 62 percent in favor of expansion.\nUpdated for March 2015, the Public Policy Polling survey used a shorter question focusing on federal funding, but still found 58 percent in favor of expansion.\nJoan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, said wide support for expansion in most polls shows that once people understand the issue and how expansion would be implemented, attitudes tend to shift.\nA state solution like what the Senate is offering tends to be particularly popular in Florida, she said. What\u2019s generating headlines from Tallahassee now isn\u2019t so much overwhelming voter opposition, but rather an ideological debate in the Legislature.\n\"This is not a partisan issue in the strictest sense,\" Alker said. \"This is a fight within the Republican Party.\"\nIn April 2015, Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s Let\u2019s Get to Work PAC released a poll that referred to \"significantly expanding the federal Medicaid program under Obamacare here in Florida.\" Scott has recently renewed opposition to the expansion and is threatening to sue Washington over pressure to accept federal expansion money.\nHis PAC\u2019s contentious poll wording may have influenced responses, Reifman said, and sampled likely voters, which favors Republicans. That poll found a 44-44 percent split between those who favored and opposed expansion.\nPartisan attitudes were more apparent when Let\u2019s Get to Work polled a sample of 500 Republican primary voters -- they opposed Medicaid expansion by 75 percent.\nOur ruling\nCrisafulli said, \"Medicaid expansion isn\u2019t necessarily a very popular issue on the street.\"\nHe was speaking broadly about how constituents don\u2019t want the expansion. Several polls give the edge to a majority of Floridians favoring the expansion, although results vary depending on how the questions are worded. A recent conservative poll found that Republicans don\u2019t like the expansion by a wide margin.\nTaken together, those numbers present a more nuanced picture than what Crisafulli suggested.
