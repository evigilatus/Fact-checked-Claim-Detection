Trump did, after all, win the endorsement of NASCAR\u2019s CEO, Brian France, and several current or retired drivers, including Chase Elliott and Mark Martin. Martin introduced Trump at Monday\u2019s rally.\nBut France has made it clear, in an email to NASCAR employees, that his endorsement was merely his own. \"This is my personal and not a corporate position,\" he wrote, according to Motorsport, an online news source that covers NASCAR.\nA NASCAR spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond Monday after Trump\u2019s comments, but a spokesman did tell The Charlotte Observer on March 1 \u2013 the day after France\u2019s original endorsement \u2013 that NASCAR itself did not endorse Trump.\nGranted, it can be difficult to separate NASCAR and the France family. Brian France\u2019s grandfather, Bill France Sr., founded NASCAR in 1948, and it has been controlled by the France family. In 2013, a spokesman told The Sporting News that NASCAR is a private company owned by the France family but the ownership structure was proprietary.\nThe elder France endorsed another controversial presidential candidate, George Wallace, in 1972. But last summer, NASCAR pulled annual banquets from the Trump National Doral property in Florida, after Trump made controversial remarks about immigrants.\nAnd Trump seems to have missed France\u2019s email. In his speech Monday, he doubled down on the murky claim of corporate support.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHank Aaron\u2019s death was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want to thank NASCAR,\" Trump said. \"And, you know, Brian France was with us last week at a venue and he got up on behalf of NASCAR. \u2026 For them to endorse me was really a great honor, so thank you very much.\"\nTrump\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, acknowledged after the speech that NASCAR itself hasn\u2019t endorsed Trump.\nTrump was in Concord ahead of the March 15 North Carolina primary election. The state is home to NASCAR and many of its racing teams, but support for NASCAR isn\u2019t as high as it once was.\nAccording to a 2013 report by Public Policy Polling of Raleigh, about a third of North Carolinians consider themselves NASCAR fans.\nAmong North Carolina natives, the poll found, that number rises to 39 percent. And NASCAR fans are heavily Republican. Among people who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, the poll found, 43 percent considered themselves NASCAR fans. Among 2012 supporters of Barack Obama, on the other hand, 21 percent called themselves NASCAR fans.\nOur ruling\nDonald Trump claimed multiple times in his speech Monday that he was endorsed by NASCAR. He was endorsed by its CEO, Brian France, who went out of his way to say it was merely a personal decision \u2013 a statement echoed by a company spokesman.\nStill, NASCAR is synonymous with the France family. And for several of its drivers, including well-known\u00a0racer Mark Martin, to lend support also increases the public appearance of an endorsement.\nWe rate this statement Half True.
