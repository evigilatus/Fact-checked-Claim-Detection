Birdo, Goof's ex-cousin. Sonny Birdo didn't make bones that he didn't think the election between him and Nan, the daughter of the United States, was long ago. Senator Sam Nan. In a race that could determine which party controlled the Senate, Birdo said that his real opponent was Barack Obama, the democratic president with low degrees of approval in Georgia. Obama chose it. He's funded it. Birdo said in a debate on October 7th in Perry. \"You won't bite the hand that feeds you.\" This subject continued to be discussed on 26 October in Atlanta. And when asked to ask Nan, he said, \"Isn't it just a vote for Barack Obama?\" It is clear that Birdo &apos; s efforts to link Nan to Obama are a repeated charge that Nan would be a rubber stamp for the President if elected. But Nan mentioned many areas where she did not agree with the President and reiterated that she would be an ally of problems and rhetoric in the Senate. \"No one feeds me by hand, David. I spent perhaps 45 minutes of my entire life with President Obama,\" she said in the debate. \"I don't agree with the president as some kind of rubber stamp.\" It could be a political discourse. But with so much at the national level, Politi Fakt Georgia wondered: Did President Nan choose by hand with the expectation that she would blindly support his policies? We began by asking the campaign for the basis of its claim. The speaker, Derek Dickie, did not mention the President, but two potential agents: the majority leader of the Harry Reed Senate and the organizing group, or OFA. In a speech delivered in July 2013 to the Foreign Affairs Bureau, Obama's political arm, Reed was unique to Nan as \"truely good.\" Reid said, \"The president is as strong as Congress.\" \"I spoke to Michelle Nan today. I think there'll be an important announcement outside Georgia tomorrow.\" Nan announced her candidacy on July 22, 2013. She consulted with the Committee for the Democratic Senate Campaign before giving her name in the arena, according to published reports. But she and her father said in the interviews that Red had asked her not to run for the seat. Congressman John Barrow, a conservative democratic party running for re-election to the 12th Circuit, was mentioned as a potential candidate instead for retired United States seats, Saxby Champles. The Committee did not respond to repeated requests for comments. The spokesman for Barrow, Richard Carbo, said Congressman had reviewed applications for the Senate, but in May 2013, he announced that he would abide by his first plans to re-elect the House of Representatives. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he adhere to the proven book of democratic play.\" On January 11, 2021, Carbo said: \"He ultimately decided that he could continue to be a gain for the people in the twelfth district and the entire state in the House of Representatives.\" An opinion poll conducted by the Centre for Social Research, released by the Politico.com political site a day after the Barrow Declaration, gives Nan credibility as his preferred candidate. The poll shows that Nan would be better than Barrow against Gob's then-probably candidate, the U.S. Republic of Jack Kingston. Dickie also points out that the Counter-Terrorism Bureau is committed to channeling donors and funds into Nan's campaign - the first such political effort for the group that is intended to be non-partisan. Since then, the President of Atlanta's radio station has said that Nan's victory in the race \"means Democrats keep control of the Senate\" and his wife, Michelle Obama, \"Barack Obama and his allies undoubtedly chose Michelle Nan to be a democratic candidate and tried to influence the outcome of the initial election on her behalf,\" said Dickie. Such ties may give Birdie a hole - but they do not translate into Nan walking with Obama, or even with the National Democratic Party. Nan, for example, has long mobilized her party to call for immediate action to build the Keystone pipeline. It should be noted that this places Nan in only one prominent democratic corner - her colleague Mary Landrio of southern Louisiana. It has led to a reversal of reductions in military spending, especially against the reduction proposed by Obama on A-10 war pigs. Obama was also criticized for delaying funding and authorizing the deepening of the port of Savannah. \"Berdo's claim is ridiculous,\" said Nathan Claque's spokesman. \"The truth is that from the beginning of this race, Michelle was very clear that she was running to fight for Georgians and bring Georgia's values to Washington -- not Kowowow to party leaders.\" To this end, the preferred candidate means only an increase in the number of senators holding the name D after their nomination, not the participation of all ideology, said Kerwin Swint, Director of the Department of Political Science at the Kinsau State University. Nan was clearly in favour of some of the party &apos; s policies. It is to raise the minimum wage and has supported Obama's care, with some changes. But it is unlikely that you will be a rubber stamp, or even want to be, given state policy, as Sweet said. \"In a state like Georgia, you expect her to take a more conservative stance,\" said Swent. \"It is a moderate democracy in a southern state. They will be welcomed by Democrats with open arms, well aware that they will have serious differences with them.\" So, where will this leave us with Birdo's claim? There is strong evidence that democratic leaders - if not the President himself - have made it clear that they prefer Nan as party candidate in Georgia. However, Nun's declared opposition to some of Obama's major policies supports the idea that it will not be a rubber stamp for the President. In fact, there is a point about Nan's choice by senior Democrats. However, it requires a lot of additional information to be fully understood. We value the claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07040"}
