0001	Donald Trump	Wow, that is so beautiful.
0002	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0003	Donald Trump	What a great song, too, by the way.
0004	Donald Trump	Do we like that song?
0005	Donald Trump	I think so.
0006	Donald Trump	I think so.
0007	Donald Trump	I'd like to use it all the time, but it only seems to work well in West Virginia, right?
0008	Donald Trump	So I am thrilled to be back with all of my friends in the great state of West Virginia.
0009	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0010	Donald Trump	This was a big victory.
0011	Donald Trump	We won by 42 points.
0012	Donald Trump	That's pretty big, right?
0013	Donald Trump	Fortytwo points over a Democrat, right, over a Democrat.
0014	Donald Trump	They didn't do too well.
0015	Donald Trump	And the people of West Virginia, they're loyal, they're hardworking, they're true American patriots.
0016	Donald Trump	Remember that.
0017	Donald Trump	They are great people.
0018	Donald Trump	They're my friends.
0019	SYSTEM	[Audience member calls "We Love You"]
0020	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0021	Donald Trump	I love you too  guy.
0022	Donald Trump	It's a guy, but I love you, too.
0023	Donald Trump	You're proud of our country, you're proud of our history.
0024	Donald Trump	And unlike the NFL, you always honor and cherish our great American flag.
0025	Donald Trump	It was just announced by ESPN that rather than defending our anthem, our beautiful, beautiful national anthem, and defending our flag, they've decided that they just won't broadcast when they play.
0026	Donald Trump	We don't like that.
0027	Donald Trump	So while the players are kneeling, some of them, not all of them at all, you're all proudly standing for our national anthem.
0028	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0029	Donald Trump	The ESPN thing was terrible, just came out.
0030	Donald Trump	Under our administration, America is winning again and America is being respected again all over the world.
0031	Donald Trump	It's America First.
0032	Donald Trump	This is the greatest economy that we've had in our history, the best.
0033	Donald Trump	Our steel mills are back.
0034	Donald Trump	They're roaring back.
0035	Donald Trump	We're making steel again.
0036	Donald Trump	United States Steel announced a massive infusion of cash.
0037	Donald Trump	They're opening up seven different plants.
0038	Donald Trump	Other steel companies all over the country, they're opening up plants.
0039	Donald Trump	People said steel will never be back.
0040	Donald Trump	Steel is back.
0041	Donald Trump	It's one of the hottest industries in our country because of what we've done with our tariffs.
0042	Donald Trump	They were dumping steel all over our country.
0043	Donald Trump	They were destroying our business.
0044	Donald Trump	They're not dumping so much anymore.
0045	Donald Trump	And if they do, they're paying a lot.
0046	Donald Trump	Our military will soon be stronger than it's ever been before.
0047	Donald Trump	We're taking care of our amazing veterans.
0048	Donald Trump	And I know this doesn't matter to you, but we are putting our great coal miners back to work.
0049	Donald Trump	Great people, great people, brave people, I don't know how the hell you do that.
0050	Donald Trump	I'll tell you.
0051	Donald Trump	You guys have a lot of courage but we love clean, beautiful, West Virginia coal.
0052	Donald Trump	We love it, right?
0053	Donald Trump	And you know that's indestructible stuff.
0054	Donald Trump	In times of war, in times of conflict, you can blow up those windmills.
0055	Donald Trump	They fall down real quick.
0056	Donald Trump	You can blow up those pipelines.
0057	Donald Trump	They go like this and you're not going to fix them too fast.
0058	Donald Trump	You can do a lot of things to those solar panels.
0059	Donald Trump	But you know what?
0060	Donald Trump	You can't hurt coal.
0061	Donald Trump	You can do whatever you want to coal, very important.
0062	Donald Trump	And we are working now on a military plan that's got to be something very special.
0063	Donald Trump	So I'm honored tonight to have a friend of mine.
0064	Donald Trump	He was a Democrat.
0065	Donald Trump	And I don't want to say because of me, let's say it's because of policy, he decided to become a Republican and he's a great Republican.
0066	Donald Trump	And I want to bring him up if I could.
0067	Donald Trump	Can I bring up your governor?
0068	Donald Trump	He is the largest, most beautiful man.
0069	Donald Trump	Governor Big Jim Justice.
0070	Jim Justice	OK.
0071	Jim Justice	I deputized you, did I not?
0072	Jim Justice	The other thing I know, you as West Virginians are appreciative people.
0073	Jim Justice	Now just think, we know what this great man right beside me has done for us.
0074	Jim Justice	Now let me say this it's time for us to show that appreciation and deliver back.
0075	Jim Justice	We have to reelect our House members and we cannot, whatever we do, to God above, we cannot put Ojeda on this man.
0076	Jim Justice	But it goes further than that.
0077	Jim Justice	Patrick Morrisey is a little behind right now.
0078	Jim Justice	He needs you.
0079	Jim Justice	He needs all of you.
0080	Jim Justice	He needs you to go out and be warriors and deputies for him.
0081	Jim Justice	He can win this, and this man needs him.
0082	Jim Justice	So I would say God bless this great man.
0083	Jim Justice	God bless this great country, and thank you for having me.
0084	Donald Trump	He's a big man.
0085	Donald Trump	He's all man, 6 foot 11.
0086	Donald Trump	I won't talk about the weight.
0087	Donald Trump	I don't know.
0088	Donald Trump	I don't know what the weight is.
0089	Donald Trump	I won't go there, but he is a big man and he's a great man.
0090	Donald Trump	He's a wonderful friend of mine.
0091	Donald Trump	That is really nice what he just said about the man that you want to be your next senator.
0092	Donald Trump	That's really nice.
0093	Donald Trump	Thank you very much, Jim.
0094	Donald Trump	Also, we have your senator, who's a special friend of mine.
0095	Donald Trump	She's been so helpful to me and so helpful to you, she loves your state, Shelley Moore Capito.
0096	Donald Trump	Congressman David McKinley, Alex Mooney, and Evan Jenkins.
0097	Donald Trump	And Evan, you put up one hell of a fight.
0098	Donald Trump	Thank you, Evan.
0099	Donald Trump	Boy, you are something and your state GOP chairwoman, Melody Potter.
0100	Donald Trump	Melody?
0101	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0102	Donald Trump	Thank you, Melody.
0103	Donald Trump	Also with us is a tremendous senator, somebody that's helped us do our agenda, which is Make America Great Again pretty much, and we have a lot of different names.
0104	Donald Trump	And you see Promises Made, Promises Kept.
0105	Donald Trump	They're copying it now, the Democrats.
0106	Donald Trump	They're copying it now Promises Made, Promises Kept.
0107	Donald Trump	They're copying it, but what are you going to do?
0108	Donald Trump	But this is a man that really  he makes a promise that it's 100% good.
0109	Donald Trump	He's tremendous and done so much.
0110	Donald Trump	He's from a place called Colorado, and he's helping to lead our campaign to elect more Senate Republicans like the man we're going to elect in West Virginia, Cory Gardner.
0111	Donald Trump	Thank you, Cory.
0112	Donald Trump	Thank you, Cory, great job, doing a great job.
0113	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0114	Donald Trump	Then we're thrilled to be joined by the next House members from West Virginia's third congressional district, a woman that works very hard for you, Carol Miller.
0115	Donald Trump	Carol?
0116	Donald Trump	Thanks, Carol.
0117	Donald Trump	Finally, it's my great honor to introduce the person that we are here to support tonight, a tremendous gentleman.
0118	Donald Trump	I got to know him during the campaign.
0119	Donald Trump	He has got an energy.
0120	Donald Trump	It took me a little while to figure it out.
0121	Donald Trump	I have to be honest.
0122	Donald Trump	And once I got to see what was happening  and Evan would be the first to tell you too  he was so tough, he was so smart, he didn't stop.
0123	Donald Trump	He does not stop, and he's going to fight for you like nobody's ever fought for the people of West Virginia, your next senator, Patrick Morrisey.
0124	Donald Trump	Patrick, come up here.
0125	Donald Trump	Come up here, Patrick.
0126	Donald Trump	Come up here, Patrick.
0127	Patrick Morrisey	Joe does have to go.
0128	Patrick Morrisey	Let me just be clear.
0129	Patrick Morrisey	Hey guys, I want to start out by thanking the president for coming back to wild and wonderful West Virginia for the sixth time.
0130	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0131	Patrick Morrisey	Hey, how about this guy?
0132	Patrick Morrisey	West Virginia's never seen anything like this.
0133	Patrick Morrisey	We love you, Mr. President.
0134	Patrick Morrisey	And I'll tell you this we know that President Trump is making America great again.
0135	Patrick Morrisey	But even more importantly, President Trump is making West Virginia great again.
0136	Patrick Morrisey	Look, tonight, we're joined by some of the Mountain State's finest coal miners.
0137	Patrick Morrisey	Can you stand up?A round of applause for our hardworking coal miners.
0138	Patrick Morrisey	Donald Trump and I are fighting every day for our coal miners and the hardworking men and women of our state.
0139	Patrick Morrisey	He's trying to get the man off your back, and I'm working every day to help him do it.
0140	SYSTEM	[Audience member calls "You're the man, Trump."]
0141	Patrick Morrisey	Amen.
0142	Patrick Morrisey	But I'll tell you what, one of the best ways I can help President Trump is to have you send me to the U.S. Senate, where I'll be a big ally of this president.
0143	Patrick Morrisey	West Virginia needs to send a conservative fighter to the U.S.
0144	Patrick Morrisey	Senate to help drain that swamp. Now ...
0145	SYSTEM	[Crowd Chants Drain the Swamp]
0146	Patrick Morrisey	It's pretty good.
0147	Patrick Morrisey	Now let me tell you a little bit.
0148	Patrick Morrisey	I have an opponent in this race.
0149	Patrick Morrisey	His name is Dishonest Liberal Joe Manchin.
0150	Patrick Morrisey	And let me be clear, Liberal Joe is no supporter of this president.
0151	Patrick Morrisey	Manchin strongly supported and voted for Hillary Clinton after  right?
0152	Patrick Morrisey	All right, hang on, hang on  after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work.
0153	Patrick Morrisey	Yes, that's pretty bad.
0154	Patrick Morrisey	Manchin even called Hillary warm, compassionate, engaging, tough.
0155	Patrick Morrisey	Can you actually believe that?
0156	Patrick Morrisey	Let  Joe's got to go.
0157	Patrick Morrisey	Joe has to go.
0158	Patrick Morrisey	Liberal Joe no longer has West Virginia values.
0159	Patrick Morrisey	Let's go through the record.
0160	Patrick Morrisey	Manchin was for Obama.
0161	Patrick Morrisey	Manchin was for Hillary.
0162	Patrick Morrisey	Manchin is for radical gun control, Planned Parenthood.
0163	Patrick Morrisey	He shills for EpiPen, and he opposed the Trump tax cuts.
0164	Patrick Morrisey	Let me be clear  pretty bad, right?
0165	Patrick Morrisey	Remember, this is West Virginia.
0166	Patrick Morrisey	We benefit as much or more than anyone from the Trump tax cuts.
0167	Patrick Morrisey	Joe Manchin no longer has West Virginia values, period.
0168	Patrick Morrisey	When I get to the U.S. Senate, I'm going to be a strong ally of President Trump.
0169	Patrick Morrisey	I'm going to be the conservative fighter that you can rely on.
0170	Patrick Morrisey	We're going to stand up for coal and our energy resources and we're going to tackle this opiate epidemic more aggressively than anyone.
0171	Patrick Morrisey	It's my honor to be here tonight and be on the same stage with the president.
0172	Patrick Morrisey	Mr. President, thank you for your leadership, your work, and for standing up for West Virginia.
0173	Donald Trump	Thank you, man.
0174	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0175	Patrick Morrisey	Amen.
0176	Patrick Morrisey	Together, we're all going help this guy make sure not only that we make West Virginia great again, we continue to make West Virginia great again.
0177	Patrick Morrisey	Best way to do that?
0178	Patrick Morrisey	Liberal Joe's got to go.
0179	Patrick Morrisey	Guys, Joe's got to go.
0180	Patrick Morrisey	And now I will turn this back over to the big man who you're here to see.
0181	Patrick Morrisey	Amen, brother.
0182	Donald Trump	He's got energy.
0183	Donald Trump	He's got a lot of talent and he loves this place.
0184	Donald Trump	He loves the people and he's going to be fighting for you.
0185	Donald Trump	He doesn't sleep.
0186	Donald Trump	He's out campaigning.
0187	Donald Trump	I said how many days are you campaigning?
0188	Donald Trump	Because I said the last 60 days of my campaign every single day, we'd go out every single day as many stops as you could make humanly.
0189	Donald Trump	Humanly, he can't get tired.
0190	Donald Trump	He's got that same thing.
0191	Donald Trump	He's not going to get tired.
0192	Donald Trump	He's every single day and he's got a very special spark.
0193	Donald Trump	You see it and you know him.
0194	Donald Trump	Look, you know him.
0195	Donald Trump	He's done a hell of a job as your AG.
0196	Donald Trump	And you got to get him with us.
0197	Donald Trump	You got to get him with us.
0198	Donald Trump	He's going to bring it back home for the people of West Virginia.
0199	Donald Trump	So this November, voters in West Virginia will face a very simple choice.
0200	Donald Trump	A vote for Patrick Morrisey is truly a vote to make America great again.
0201	Donald Trump	He's going to vote.
0202	Donald Trump	And I like Joe, but Joe doesn't vote.
0203	Donald Trump	He just doesn't vote for us.
0204	Donald Trump	It's a vote for Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, their new leader Maxine Waters.
0205	Donald Trump	But between Waters and Pelosi, you have two people that are in charge of Congress.
0206	Donald Trump	They're not in favor of West Virginia.
0207	Donald Trump	They don't know that West Virginia exists.
0208	Donald Trump	They don't like coal.
0209	Donald Trump	They don't like energy.
0210	SYSTEM	[Audience calls We don't like her]
0211	Donald Trump	And they don't like her.
0212	Donald Trump	So when you cast your ballot for Congress in November, you aren't just voting for a candidate.
0213	Donald Trump	You're voting for which party controls the House and which party controls the Senate, so all these Congress people.
0214	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you, we have to get there.
0215	Donald Trump	We really have to get there.
0216	Donald Trump	So I'm going to be going out as many days as I can and I'm allowed to.
0217	Donald Trump	I have sort of a lid with all the Secret Service and all the fantastic people, but it sort of holds you back.
0218	Donald Trump	Maybe sometimes I'll just make a few trips without them.
0219	Donald Trump	We'll do them quietly.
0220	Donald Trump	But we're going to be out a lot.
0221	Donald Trump	We're going to a lot of different states, and I'm coming back here before the election.
0222	Donald Trump	And it's a very close election.
0223	Donald Trump	A lot of people don't realize there's a 6point spread.
0224	Donald Trump	Six points could be ended by this evening.
0225	Donald Trump	He could be up by 12.
0226	Donald Trump	You've seen what's been happening.
0227	Donald Trump	We've had a good record of endorsements.
0228	Donald Trump	In Georgia, a man who was down 10.
0229	Donald Trump	I endorsed him a short while before the election  good man, for governor  and he won 70 to 30.
0230	Donald Trump	So I guess he picked up 45 or 50 points.
0231	Donald Trump	In Ohio recently there was  he was up and then he went down a little bit.
0232	Donald Trump	We went there, and he won.
0233	Donald Trump	You know that, Balderson, good man, Congressman Balderson now, he won.
0234	Donald Trump	We won eight out of nine special elections.
0235	Donald Trump	Nobody talks about it.
0236	Donald Trump	They don't talk about it.
0237	Donald Trump	Eight out of nine special elections, and they don't want to talk about it.
0238	Donald Trump	And my record  and look, I don't want to brag about it, but man, do I have a good record of endorsement.
0239	Donald Trump	In Florida, we have a great candidate, his name is Ron DeSantis.
0240	Donald Trump	And he called me and asked whether or not I could endorse him, and I said let me check it out.
0241	Donald Trump	And he was a 3.
0242	Donald Trump	This was a few months ago.
0243	Donald Trump	He was a 3, and I gave him a nice shot and a nice little tweak, bingbing, and he went from 3 to like 20something.
0244	Donald Trump	And then I gave him my full and total endorsement, and he's now leading by, like, 19 points.
0245	Donald Trump	And that election is next week, leading in the primary.
0246	Donald Trump	He's a good man.
0247	Donald Trump	And so many others.
0248	Donald Trump	Staten Island, the Congressman Dan Donovan, he was down before the election.
0249	Donald Trump	We endorsed him.
0250	Donald Trump	I think he won by 24 points.
0251	Donald Trump	So if we can do just  all my life, I've heard endorsements don't mean anything.
0252	Donald Trump	They said if you get an endorsement from Ronald Reagan  we like Ronald Reagan  it was a wonderful thing to have but it didn't move the needle.
0253	Donald Trump	And if you get an endorsement from a lot of people, it never really  is that a correct statement?
0254	Donald Trump	If you look, Cory, Shelley, if you get an endorsement, it was nice to have, but it didn't mean anything.
0255	Donald Trump	These endorsements  and I'm not saying it from my standpoint.
0256	Donald Trump	They're going 20, 30, 40, 50 points.
0257	Donald Trump	Fifty points, it's crazy.
0258	Donald Trump	And then you watch the news, will this endorsement mean anything?
0259	Donald Trump	Let me tell you, it's going to mean a lot.
0260	Donald Trump	And I mean a lot.
0261	Donald Trump	And I don't care, I just wanna, we have to get senators in.
0262	Donald Trump	We've got really no majority.
0263	Donald Trump	We have  if you really look at it, probably we could say 4949, 5149.
0264	Donald Trump	We have some people that aren't able to vote.
0265	Donald Trump	We have some people that are a little unreliable.
0266	Donald Trump	They don't exactly like what I've done to their career.
0267	Donald Trump	They don't love what I've done, and that's OK. And I don't like what they've done either.
0268	Donald Trump	But we need to elect five, six, or even seven more senators and I think we can do it.
0269	Donald Trump	I think we can do it, and we have to start with Patrick Morrisey.
0270	Donald Trump	He's going to be fantastic.
0271	Donald Trump	If you vote for Joe Manchin or any other Democrat in November, you're voting for the party that wants to really destroy the coal industry.
0272	Donald Trump	Patrick said it.
0273	Donald Trump	Joe endorsed Hillary 100%, and he got along with her even better after she came out with a statement that she wants to destroy coal and coal companies.
0274	Donald Trump	That's a bad thing.
0275	Donald Trump	The Democrats want to turn America into one big fat sanctuary city for criminal aliens.
0276	Donald Trump	And honestly, they're more protective of aliens  the criminal aliens than they are of the people.
0277	Donald Trump	They want to take away your Second Amendment.
0278	Donald Trump	You see what's going on.
0279	Donald Trump	I don't think you want your Second Amendment played with.
0280	Donald Trump	They want to take over American health care and abuse our courts to rewrite our constitution.
0281	Donald Trump	And how do you like the judges that I've been appointing?
0282	Donald Trump	Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch, Supreme Court?
0283	Donald Trump	There's no worse nightmare for West Virginia this November than Chuck Schumer running the Senate and Nancy Pelosi with Maxine Waters running the House.
0284	Donald Trump	And that is why you must vote Republican.
0285	Donald Trump	You gotta get out of the vote.
0286	Donald Trump	They keep talking about a blue wave.
0287	Donald Trump	I don't see it.
0288	Donald Trump	We have the greatest economy we've ever had.
0289	Donald Trump	Joe Manchin always voted for Obama, and he voted to keep the disaster known as Obamacare.
0290	Donald Trump	And I will tell you it is being chipped away.
0291	Donald Trump	We had it beaten, but one man, I'm sure nobody knows who I'm talking about, voted no, shockingly.
0292	Donald Trump	To  really surprising to a lot of people because he campaigned on repeal and replace  but we've really knocked it out, including the individual mandate.
0293	Donald Trump	We got rid of the most unpopular part of Obamacare, where you have the privilege of paying a fortune for not having to pay a fortune for really bad health care.
0294	Donald Trump	OK, that's not too good.
0295	Donald Trump	We got rid of it.
0296	Donald Trump	A lot of people are very happy about that.
0297	Donald Trump	That came along with the biggest tax cuts in our history.
0298	Donald Trump	And Joe Manchin voted no on the tax cuts.
0299	Donald Trump	The last time I was here, I saw signs along the highway, Joe, you voted no on tax cuts and Joe, you voted no for our president.
0300	Donald Trump	You voted no.
0301	Donald Trump	And he's going to vote no.
0302	Donald Trump	I'm not knocking him, but Schumer's the boss and he may give us a vote on Justice Kavanaugh.
0303	Donald Trump	He should.
0304	Donald Trump	Everybody should.
0305	Donald Trump	I mean, here's a guy  is this Central Casting?
0306	Donald Trump	This is what we want.
0307	Donald Trump	This is a great, brilliant man.
0308	Donald Trump	But Joe's just not voting with us.
0309	Donald Trump	He's voting against your tax cuts.
0310	Donald Trump	He voted against repeal and replace.
0311	Donald Trump	He votes against the things that we want, and he votes against the people of West Virginia.
0312	Donald Trump	You can't do that.
0313	Donald Trump	Joe opposed the wall and he opposed the travel ban.
0314	Donald Trump	And by the way, the wall right now, that wall is coming along.
0315	Donald Trump	We're over $3 billion.
0316	Donald Trump	It's moving along very nicely, very nicely.
0317	Donald Trump	And if you think it's easy with these people, it's not easy.
0318	Donald Trump	It's not easy.
0319	Donald Trump	We're getting the wall built.
0320	Donald Trump	It's going up and we're getting it built.
0321	Donald Trump	And we have a big number in right now.
0322	SYSTEM	[Crowd chants Build That Wall]
0323	Donald Trump	So Shelley and Cory you hear that, right?
0324	Shelley Moore Capito	Yes.
0325	Cory Gardner	Yes.
0326	Donald Trump	So we have $3.2 billion.
0327	Donald Trump	We're looking for $5 billion this year, and all of a sudden it's going to be finished and it's going to be very, very effective.
0328	Donald Trump	You heard about it today with the illegal alien coming in very sadly from Mexico.
0329	Donald Trump	And you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman.
0330	Donald Trump	Should have never happened.
0331	Donald Trump	Illegally in our country.
0332	Donald Trump	We've had a huge impact, but the laws are so bad.
0333	Donald Trump	The immigration laws are such a disgrace.
0334	Donald Trump	We're getting them changed, but we have to get more Republicans, we have to get.
0335	Donald Trump	This election is bigger than any one race.
0336	Donald Trump	It's about whether we want to continue the amazing progress we've made for America or whether we want to surrender that progress to the forces of extremism and obstruction.
0337	Donald Trump	Their little phrase that they like, resist, that's all they're good at.
0338	Donald Trump	They have no policy.
0339	Donald Trump	They're not good politicians, but they're good at sticking together and resisting.
0340	Donald Trump	I have almost 400 people that haven't been approved by their slowwalking.
0341	Donald Trump	Do you know what's slowwalking?
0342	Donald Trump	They're slowwalking them.
0343	Donald Trump	We have almost 400 people in our administration, people that gave up their careers that have been waiting over a year to get approved and they're being slowwalked by the Democrats.
0344	Donald Trump	It's never happened that way in the history of our country and it is a disgrace.
0345	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace.
0346	Donald Trump	The Democrat Party is held hostage by the socalled resistance, leftwing haters and angry mobs.
0347	Donald Trump	They're trying to tear down our institutions, disrespect our flag, demean our law enforcement, denigrate our history, and disparage our great country.
0348	Donald Trump	And we're not going to let it happen.
0349	Donald Trump	New York's Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo even declared that America was never great.
0350	Donald Trump	Oh, I see, OK. Tell that to our great soldiers at World War I, World War II, Korean War, so many others.
0351	Donald Trump	Tell them to the folks that sent a rocket up to the moon and our great astronauts.
0352	Donald Trump	Tell them to all of the great medical research we've done in this country and he says America was never great.
0353	Donald Trump	I would imagine that's careerthreatening, right?
0354	Donald Trump	I would imagine.
0355	Donald Trump	How do you get away with that one?
0356	Donald Trump	Did you hear?
0357	Donald Trump	He was speaking to a room loaded up with socialists and probably others, probably others.
0358	Donald Trump	No not communists, but there could have been a couple of them, too.
0359	Donald Trump	And he made the statement that America was never great and they would go, did you hear?
0360	Donald Trump	They go, whoa,whoa.
0361	Donald Trump	They couldn't even believe it.
0362	Donald Trump	Now that's jobthreatening.
0363	Donald Trump	His comments are an insult to the generations of brave Americans whose blood and sweat and tears built our magnificent country.
0364	Donald Trump	So this November, you can either vote for the party that says America was never great  that's going to be their theme now America was never great.
0365	Donald Trump	Hey, let's do that.
0366	Donald Trump	They copied mine, Promises Made, Promises Kept.
0367	Donald Trump	Let's give them a new theme, "America Was Never Great."
0368	Donald Trump	That's the Democrats' new theme.
0369	Donald Trump	Can we do that?
0370	Donald Trump	Yes.
0371	Donald Trump	We'll retheme their party.
0372	Donald Trump	Or you can vote proudly for everything that we stand for.
0373	Donald Trump	We're the greatest country in the world and we are now the greatest economy that we have ever had.
0374	Donald Trump	We're the greatest economy in the world.
0375	SYSTEM	[Crowd chants USA]
0376	Donald Trump	We've gone up $10 trillion in value since my election.
0377	Donald Trump	We've gone up $10 trillion, think of it, since the election.
0378	Donald Trump	Was that a great election?
0379	Donald Trump	Boy.
0380	Donald Trump	Remember I was here just before the election and I brought a couple of guys into a room and I said, "Fellas, supposing we teach you a new skill, supposing we teach you like how to make little widgets or gidgets or gadgets."
0381	Donald Trump	These are big, strong coal miners.
0382	Donald Trump	They said, "Sir, we want to dig coal."
0383	Donald Trump	I said, "I agree with you."
0384	Donald Trump	I agree, right?
0385	Donald Trump	Remember that?
0386	Donald Trump	Their grandfathers did it.
0387	Donald Trump	Their fathers did it.
0388	Donald Trump	That's incredible and it's really happening.
0389	Donald Trump	We are back.
0390	Donald Trump	The coal industry is back.
0391	Donald Trump	So when I came here originally, West Virginia, frankly, was down and out.
0392	Donald Trump	It was not doing exactly well, one of the last.
0393	Donald Trump	Do you know that a few months ago, it hit where West Virginia on a per capita basis is one of the most successful GDP states in our union?
0394	Donald Trump	So we went from being down and out.
0395	Donald Trump	You're one of the most successful in the union, very close to the top.
0396	Donald Trump	That is some big change.
0397	Donald Trump	And I've had so many people, I was backstage and people are coming up to me, "Mr. President, thank you, sir, for saving our nation," because you understand what that means.
0398	Donald Trump	We couldn't do anything.
0399	Donald Trump	Had the other side won, they would have poured on more regulations, raised your taxes.
0400	Donald Trump	They would have done things that were so bad.
0401	Donald Trump	You had a very low GDP.
0402	Donald Trump	It was 1.2%, 1.2%.
0403	Donald Trump	It was going down.
0404	Donald Trump	It was going to be a negative.
0405	Donald Trump	Last quarter, we just hit, as you all know, 4.1%.
0406	Donald Trump	Nobody thought that was possible.
0407	Donald Trump	If  I always said, if I would have ever said that shortly after winning we're going to hit 4.1%, those people back there would have said, "This guy, no good, fake news, fake news."
0408	Donald Trump	How fake are they?
0409	Donald Trump	Fake news and the Russian witch hunt?
0410	Donald Trump	We got a whole big combination.
0411	Donald Trump	Where is the collusion?
0412	Donald Trump	You know, they're still looking for collusion.
0413	Donald Trump	Where is the collusion?
0414	Donald Trump	Find some collusion.
0415	Donald Trump	We want to find the collusion.
0416	Donald Trump	At the beating heart of this election is border security.
0417	Donald Trump	We have to have that, right?
0418	Donald Trump	We have to have it.
0419	Donald Trump	Iowa officials and so many other countries have been reporting numbers where they're having a lot of problems with people coming in.
0420	Donald Trump	People are coming in, but we're getting them out.
0421	Donald Trump	We have MS13 on the run.
0422	Donald Trump	They poured in here with Obama.
0423	Donald Trump	We have them on the run because we love the men and women of ICE.
0424	Donald Trump	A blue wave in November means open borders, which means massive crime.
0425	Donald Trump	A red wave means safety and strength.
0426	Donald Trump	That's what it is.
0427	Donald Trump	The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE.
0428	Donald Trump	A vote for any Democrat in November is a vote to eliminate immigration enforcement, throw open our borders, and set loose vicious predators and violent criminals.
0429	Donald Trump	They'll be all over our communities.
0430	Donald Trump	They will be preying on our communities.
0431	Donald Trump	Yet while many Democrats are calling to abolish ICE, today our brave ICE officers successfully carried out a 14yearold deportation order against a Nazi criminal who is living in New York, the last known Nazi officer living in the United States.
0432	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get him out for decades.
0433	Donald Trump	President Obama tried.
0434	Donald Trump	They all tried.
0435	Donald Trump	We got him out, gone.He's gone.
0436	Donald Trump	He's back in Germany.
0437	Donald Trump	ICE officers are heroes who uphold our laws and they really do.
0438	Donald Trump	They uphold our laws and they defend our communities like nobody you've ever seen.
0439	Donald Trump	And yes, they're tough, they're strong, they're smart, they have great heart, but they go into these communities loaded up with the kind of criminals you don't want to be dealing with.
0440	Donald Trump	They walk in like it's another day in the office.
0441	Donald Trump	They're tougher.
0442	Donald Trump	They're stronger.
0443	Donald Trump	It's what these other people fear.
0444	Donald Trump	And by the way, our ICE folks and our border patrol folks, they have no fear.
0445	Donald Trump	The job they do is incredible.
0446	Donald Trump	And by the way, while we're at it, law enforcement, these are great, great people and they're doing an incredible job, right?
0447	Donald Trump	Every single day, ICE is tracking down gang members, drug dealers, predators, and killers, and we're either throwing them in jail or throwing them the hell out of our country.
0448	Donald Trump	If you want to save ICE, if you want to protect our border and our border patrol, if you want to stop this craziness of sanctuary cities, where criminals are protected  take a look at Chicago, how about the mayor of Chicago?
0449	Donald Trump	It's like a war zone.
0450	Donald Trump	It's a great city.
0451	Donald Trump	It's like a war zone.
0452	Donald Trump	This is what those policies do.
0453	Donald Trump	Last week, 62 people were shot.
0454	Donald Trump	Twelve died.
0455	Donald Trump	This is like our country.
0456	Donald Trump	There's no reason for this.
0457	Donald Trump	The Republican Party stands proudly with our courageous ICE officers and border patrol agents.
0458	Donald Trump	And by the way, you know who wants the wall more than any of us?
0459	Donald Trump	ICE and border patrol because they know that's going to be a big, big factor in stopping the drugs from coming in, the human traffickers, which is worse all over the world than at any time in the history of our world, human traffickers.
0460	Donald Trump	Who would believe, and it's because of the internet.
0461	Donald Trump	This election is about security and this election is also about jobs.
0462	Donald Trump	Wwe have produced.
0463	Donald Trump	We have produced.
0464	Donald Trump	Thanks to Republicans, our economy is booming like it has never boomed before.
0465	Donald Trump	We've created another number that nobody would have believed if I said it during the campaign 4 million new jobs since the election.
0466	Donald Trump	Nobody would have believed it.
0467	Donald Trump	Almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps, think of that.
0468	Donald Trump	They don't need them because they have a job.
0469	Donald Trump	They're eating better now.
0470	Donald Trump	They don't need food stamps, almost 4 million, think of it.
0471	Donald Trump	Last year in West Virginia, per capita income grew 40% faster than the national average, 40% congratulations.
0472	Donald Trump	Congratulations.
0473	Donald Trump	I told you last time I was here, you weren't so happy like you are now.
0474	Donald Trump	We've added over 400,000 new manufacturing jobs nationwide.
0475	Donald Trump	That number is soon going to exceed 600,000 and our opponent said there's no such thing as manufacturing jobs anymore, right?
0476	Donald Trump	And I'd say, "Oh I see we're not going to make things any more."
0477	Donald Trump	Think of it, we'll be close to 600,000 very soon.
0478	Donald Trump	We have companies pouring into our country.
0479	Donald Trump	They're coming back.
0480	Donald Trump	These are companies that left.
0481	Donald Trump	They're coming back to Michigan.
0482	Donald Trump	They're coming back to West Virginia.
0483	Donald Trump	They're coming back to Pennsylvania and Ohio.
0484	Donald Trump	They're coming to Florida.
0485	Donald Trump	They're coming back, not just opening.
0486	Donald Trump	They're coming back.
0487	Donald Trump	They left and now they're coming back because they want to be where the action is and the action is in the United States of America.
0488	Donald Trump	So the economic growth, as I said, when it hit 4.1%, everybody was like, "That's amazing," except me, because it's going to go much higher than that.
0489	Donald Trump	When I finish these trade deals  and the tariffs are very important  these companies come in and I say to the European Union, very nice people, I say JeanClaude, we'd like to negotiate a new trade agreement with the European Union.
0490	Donald Trump	We lost $151 billion over the last number of years per year.
0491	Donald Trump	Does anyone know what a $151 billion per year is?
0492	Donald Trump	And he very respectfully said, "Mr. President, but we are very happy with the deal."
0493	Donald Trump	I said, "I'd be happy if I were you too.
0494	Donald Trump	I'd be very happy."
0495	Donald Trump	I said a second time, a third time, and a fourth time, but they were happy with the deal but we weren't happy because they have barriers up and because they have tariffs, all the things we don't have.
0496	Donald Trump	You want to build a car and send it to Europe, how many Chevrolets are there in the middle of Berlin?
0497	Donald Trump	Not too many, maybe one?
0498	Donald Trump	I doubt it.
0499	Donald Trump	I don't think you could find the one.
0500	Donald Trump	So there are barriers so I said, "Come on, let's go."
0501	Donald Trump	And then he said, "No."
0502	Donald Trump	I said, "Listen."
0503	Donald Trump	And I said this to numerous countries, I mean, in all fairness, I don't want to single out anybody, but I said it.
0504	Donald Trump	Listen, here's what we're going to  it's all about the cars.
0505	Donald Trump	It's all about the cars, tremendously big industry.
0506	Donald Trump	We're going to put a 25% tax on every car that comes from the European Union into the United States and that'll take our loss and trade deficit of $151 billion and it'll give us a surplus of $151 billion.
0507	Donald Trump	That's a fairly dramatic swing and that'll take one little signature, Donald J.
0508	Donald Trump	Trump.
0509	Donald Trump	And I got a call, "Mr. President, when can we meet?
0510	Donald Trump	We'd like to see you."
0511	Donald Trump	And they came, and very respectfully, we're working on a deal.
0512	Donald Trump	But this is happening all over.
0513	Donald Trump	Wth China, I have great respect for President Xi, great respect, tremendous respect for China.
0514	Donald Trump	But they have taken advantage of our country for decades.
0515	Donald Trump	We have rebuilt China.
0516	Donald Trump	We have rebuilt China.
0517	Donald Trump	I used to talk about this.
0518	Donald Trump	I didn't press it initially because I wanted them to help us with North Korea and they have, and they have, and we're doing well with North Korea.
0519	Donald Trump	These guys, it's been what three months since I left?
0520	Donald Trump	These guys say, "What's happening with North Korea?"
0521	Donald Trump	Hey folks, they've been doing this stuff for 75 years.
0522	Donald Trump	Three months.
0523	Donald Trump	What happened?
0524	Donald Trump	I can tell you and I got along very well with Kim Jongun.
0525	Donald Trump	Really well.
0526	Donald Trump	Good chemistry.
0527	Donald Trump	Obama was unable to do anything with North Korea and he considered it like  just read the papers.
0528	Donald Trump	You'll see what he considered it.
0529	Donald Trump	So I've been three months.
0530	Donald Trump	I have a very good relationship with Chairman Kim.
0531	Donald Trump	We'll see what happens.
0532	Donald Trump	Who knows?
0533	Donald Trump	Can I be honest?
0534	Donald Trump	Who knows?
0535	Donald Trump	But I haven't taken off the sanctions.
0536	Donald Trump	We have massive sanctions, but I want to take them off quickly.
0537	Donald Trump	But they've gotta get rid of the nukes.
0538	Donald Trump	They've gotta get rid of the nukes.
0539	Donald Trump	Gotta get rid of them.
0540	Donald Trump	But who knows what's going to happen?
0541	Donald Trump	I mean, maybe it'll work out, but I think we've done a good job in a short period of time.
0542	Donald Trump	You remember it started off extremely hostile.
0543	Donald Trump	Remember they said, "He's going to get us into a war."
0544	Donald Trump	They thought my rhetoric was too strong.
0545	Donald Trump	You remember.
0546	Donald Trump	I won't say it because I don't want to insult Chairman Kim, but you remember, you remember.
0547	Donald Trump	Elton John, I don't want to insult so I'm not going to mention it.
0548	Donald Trump	But the fake news back there said, "He is going to get us into a war.
0549	Donald Trump	He's crazy.
0550	Donald Trump	This guy is crazy.
0551	Donald Trump	Our president is crazy." And then I went to meet the leaders
0552	SYSTEM	[ph]
0553	Donald Trump	and the folks that run NATO, all the leaders of NATO and they weren't paying their bills.
0554	Donald Trump	They were delinquent.
0555	Donald Trump	In real estate  I love real estate  when somebody doesn't pay their rent, you say  Shelley, you say their delinquent.
0556	Donald Trump	You gotta pay your rent.
0557	Donald Trump	And I met him last year and Stoltenberg, secretary general, great guy of NATO.
0558	Donald Trump	He's my single biggest fan, bigger than any fan I have in the room.
0559	Donald Trump	You know why?
0560	Donald Trump	Because nobody was paying their bills.
0561	Donald Trump	He was in charge of NATO.
0562	Donald Trump	He couldn't get any money.
0563	Donald Trump	But last year, I went a year ago, I said you're not paying your bills.
0564	Donald Trump	You gotta pay your bills.
0565	Donald Trump	He picked up $44 billion.
0566	Donald Trump	He told that to the press, they didn't report it.
0567	Donald Trump	Fortyfour billion.
0568	Donald Trump	And then I just left recently and we're going to pick up at least another close to $100 billion extra.
0569	Donald Trump	I said to him, "You gotta pay your bills."
0570	Donald Trump	The United States is paying close to 90% of the cost of protecting Europe, and I think that's wonderful.
0571	Donald Trump	I said to Europe  I said, "Folks, NATO's better for you than it is for us.
0572	Donald Trump	Believe me."
0573	Donald Trump	And what happened is they asked a question.
0574	Donald Trump	They have small countries, big countries, all of these countries were  we're supposed to protect them?
0575	Donald Trump	I said, "Look, it's very simple.
0576	Donald Trump	You gotta pay up.
0577	Donald Trump	You gotta pay your bill."
0578	Donald Trump	And somebody said, "Sir," there's the president of a country calling me sir.
0579	Donald Trump	That shows respect.
0580	Donald Trump	I say, "Yes, Mr.
0581	Donald Trump	President?"
0582	Donald Trump	He said, "Would you leave us if we don't pay our bills?"
0583	Donald Trump	Now they hated my answer I said, "Yes, I would have to consider it.
0584	Donald Trump	You gotta pay your bill."
0585	Donald Trump	They hated the answer.
0586	Donald Trump	But if I said, "No, I won't leave you.
0587	Donald Trump	You don't have to pay your bills.
0588	Donald Trump	I won't leave.
0589	Donald Trump	I promise, will always protect you.
0590	Donald Trump	You will always be protected.
0591	Donald Trump	Don't pay your bills."
0592	Donald Trump	Then they're never going to pay their bills.
0593	Donald Trump	So I said, "Yes, I will leave you if you don't pay your bills" and you could see those checkbooks coming out for billions of dollars.
0594	Donald Trump	They pay their bills.
0595	Donald Trump	And I think we'll pick up over the next short while over $100 billion.
0596	Donald Trump	And then they said the fake news, they said, "President Trump treated the NATO nation leaders"  in brackets, I put brackets, who have been ripping us off  treated the NATO leaders with tremendous contempt and disrespect.
0597	Donald Trump	And I said, "No no, no.
0598	Donald Trump	They disrespected our country because they weren't paying."
0599	Donald Trump	Now they're paying.
0600	Donald Trump	How about if we got into a conflict because a country was attacked and now we're in World War 3 and we're protecting a country that was attacked and didn't pay its bills?
0601	Donald Trump	I'd feel so stupid.
0602	Donald Trump	We're protecting a country that wasn't paying its bills.
0603	Donald Trump	So I got them to pay $100 billion.
0604	Donald Trump	It's gonna be much more than that, but tremendous amounts of money, tremendous.
0605	Donald Trump	They gotta pay up, they're paying up.
0606	Donald Trump	And then they made the statement that I showed great disrespect.
0607	Donald Trump	But actually, I have a great relationship with all of those people, 28 people, all of them.
0608	Donald Trump	We have a great relationship because now they respect us.
0609	Donald Trump	They respect our country again.
0610	Donald Trump	They didn't respect our country.
0611	Donald Trump	They didn't respect our country.
0612	Donald Trump	They respect us again, and you see it with China.
0613	Donald Trump	China was walking its way down.
0614	Donald Trump	I don't want them to go down, but they're down close to 30% in three months.
0615	Donald Trump	I don't want that.
0616	Donald Trump	I want them to do well.
0617	Donald Trump	I want to be their friend.
0618	Donald Trump	But we had to do things that we had to do.
0619	Donald Trump	When I came, we were heading in a certain direction that was going to allow China to be bigger than us in a very short period of time.
0620	Donald Trump	That's not going to happen anymore.
0621	Donald Trump	Not going to happen anymore.
0622	Donald Trump	Good luck to them.
0623	Donald Trump	The long winding road, you know, the long winding road, and I have tremendous respect for China.
0624	Donald Trump	I mean, the energy, the genius, it's incredible what they've done.
0625	Donald Trump	And hopefully we're going to have a great relationship, but we can't do it.
0626	Donald Trump	It's got to be a twoway street.
0627	Donald Trump	We have only oneway streets, not only China, with everybody.
0628	Donald Trump	It's a oneway street, our enemies, our friends, our allies.
0629	Donald Trump	I mean, our allies treat us worse than our enemies.
0630	Donald Trump	Believe it.
0631	Donald Trump	So it's all changing.
0632	Donald Trump	And when we get those trade deals done properly  and you know what bothers me?
0633	Donald Trump	I have people coming to me some people in Congress, "Sir, can you get this deal done immediately?"
0634	Donald Trump	I say, "It doesn't work that way.
0635	Donald Trump	I don't want to go too fast.
0636	Donald Trump	The deal is not going to be any good if we do that.
0637	Donald Trump	We gotta take time, it's got to gestate, right?"
0638	Donald Trump	The word gestate, it's like when you're cooking the chicken, time, time, turkey for Thanksgiving.
0639	Donald Trump	My mother would say, oh eight hours.
0640	Donald Trump	I said, "Eight hours?"
0641	Donald Trump	She made the greatest turkey I've ever had, takes time, takes time.
0642	Donald Trump	So when they run and they say, "Oh, can you do NATO right now?
0643	Donald Trump	Could we sign it next week?"
0644	Donald Trump	I said, "Wait a minute.
0645	Donald Trump	Look, I like Mexico.
0646	Donald Trump	I like the new leader.
0647	Donald Trump	I think he's going to be terrific, little different than us."
0648	Donald Trump	I think I'm doing better with him than with the capitalist.
0649	Donald Trump	But he knows that Mexico needs the United States.
0650	Donald Trump	They need the United States.
0651	Donald Trump	Canada charges us close to 300% tariffs for dairy products going into Canada, which is essentially saying we don't want your dairy products  this is a wall.
0652	Donald Trump	They have a wall in a different way.
0653	Donald Trump	It's called an economic wall.
0654	Donald Trump	I don't want that.
0655	Donald Trump	I'd said, "Justin, I mean, I don't want to have too much fun with you, Justin.
0656	Donald Trump	You can't do that."
0657	Donald Trump	Justin Trudeau, nice guy, but they've taken advantage of us for so many years that we have to take our time.
0658	Donald Trump	But with that being said, we're doing very well.
0659	Donald Trump	We're on our way with a good deal, a fair deal.
0660	Donald Trump	I don't want a good deal, I want a fair deal for both of us, fair with Mexico.
0661	Donald Trump	And you've heard me say it.
0662	Donald Trump	As an example, when China makes a car, they sell it into the United States.
0663	Donald Trump	There's 2 12 percent tariff, of which they don't pay.
0664	Donald Trump	So they paid nothing.
0665	Donald Trump	Other than that, it's a wonderful deal.
0666	Donald Trump	When we make a car, we sell it into China, and there's a 25% tariff.
0667	Donald Trump	And that's just the beginning, here's others.
0668	Donald Trump	A man was driving down a street in China and he looked over and it was a Chevrolet, like Camaro, does that make sense?
0669	Donald Trump	Is it a Camaro?
0670	Donald Trump	I think it costs $39,000 or $40,000.
0671	Donald Trump	He's in China.
0672	Donald Trump	He's in Beijing and he shouts across  they're stopped  he then shouts across, "Tell me, how much did that car cost in China?"
0673	Donald Trump	Guy looks, "$119,000."
0674	Donald Trump	Now you understand that, right?
0675	Donald Trump	It's all taxes and taxes and taxes.
0676	Donald Trump	We can't do that anymore.
0677	Donald Trump	Can't do it.
0678	Donald Trump	We are a country with unbelievable potential.
0679	Donald Trump	We are a country that has been ripped off by everybody, and we're not going to be ripped off anymore.
0680	Donald Trump	And if it takes me a little angst to tell senators and congressmen and all of the people that really do have your heart in the hands, in many cases  sometimes I wonder where they're coming from with these suggestions  but it's going to have to take that little period of time.
0681	Donald Trump	With that being said, we're moving so fast, nobody could even believe it.
0682	Donald Trump	And every country wants to make a deal because we're like the big fat piggybank that everybody wants to rob, and we're not going to let them rob us anymore.
0683	Donald Trump	Is that OK, West Virginia?
0684	Donald Trump	We're not going to let them rob us anymore.
0685	Donald Trump	Every day we're keeping our promises.
0686	Donald Trump	We're canceling Obama's illegal anticoal destroying regulations, the socalled Clean Power Plan.
0687	Donald Trump	Doesn't that sound nice?
0688	Donald Trump	Clean power.
0689	Donald Trump	You know, when I ended the Paris accord, what's a more beautiful name than the Paris accord?
0690	Donald Trump	Let's call it the West Virginia accord  maybe I would have signed it.
0691	Donald Trump	But when I entered it, that was going to cost us hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions.
0692	Donald Trump	And other countries, as an example, China didn't kick in until many years in the future.
0693	Donald Trump	We kicked in immediately.
0694	Donald Trump	Russia went back many years, which was not a clean time in terms of the environment because you know what?
0695	Donald Trump	We all agree, we want a clean environment.
0696	Donald Trump	We want a strong, beautiful, clean environment.
0697	Donald Trump	I want clean air.
0698	Donald Trump	I want crystal clean water, and we've got it.
0699	Donald Trump	We've got the cleanest country in the planet right now.
0700	Donald Trump	There's nobody cleaner than us and it's getting better and better.
0701	Donald Trump	But I'm getting rid of some of these ridiculous rules and regulations, which are killing our companies, our states, and our jobs.
0702	Donald Trump	Just today, we announced our new affordable clean energy proposal that will help our coalfired power plants and save consumers, you, me, everybody, billions and billions of dollars.
0703	Donald Trump	We've eliminated a record number of jobkilling regulations, and Republicans have passed the biggest tax cuts and reform.
0704	Donald Trump	The reform is very important.
0705	Donald Trump	But you know what I've said, I don't want to talk about reform because nobody knows what it means.
0706	Donald Trump	That could be a tax increase.
0707	Donald Trump	I said, "How come it's been Ronald Reagan since you got the last big tax cut?"
0708	Donald Trump	And they looked at me and said, "We don't know."
0709	Donald Trump	And a lot of the great senators and the congressmen came up to see me and they had the 2018 tax reform.
0710	Donald Trump	I said, "What the hell does that mean?
0711	Donald Trump	Are you going to raise taxes?"
0712	Donald Trump	Then I found out this is what they've done for 40 years, tax reform.
0713	Donald Trump	I said, "Nobody knows what it means."
0714	Donald Trump	And we do have reform in there, great reform.
0715	Donald Trump	But they said nobody knows  I said, "Nobody knows what it means.
0716	Donald Trump	Here it is.
0717	Donald Trump	I want to put it down, tax cuts."
0718	Donald Trump	They said, "What would be your favorite name Mr.
0719	Donald Trump	President?"
0720	Donald Trump	I said, "The tax cut, cut, cut, cut bill."
0721	Donald Trump	And we almost did it.
0722	Donald Trump	We almost did it but in all fairness in this case congressmen, a couple of them thought it was a little bit tacky.
0723	Donald Trump	So we call it the Tax Cut and Jobs Bill.
0724	Donald Trump	But you know what?
0725	Donald Trump	We have done great reform.
0726	Donald Trump	But it's the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and you people are benefiting by it.
0727	Donald Trump	You're benefiting.
0728	Donald Trump	And companies are benefiting, and those companies are the ones that are providing all of the jobs.
0729	Donald Trump	We're setting records on jobs.
0730	Donald Trump	We're protecting, also so important for West Virginia and a lot of states, we are protecting again religious liberty and we're also standing up to social media censorship.
0731	Donald Trump	That's the new thing.
0732	Donald Trump	That's the new thing.
0733	Donald Trump	I'd rather have fake news like CNN.
0734	Donald Trump	I would rather have fake news  it's true  than have anybody, including liberals, socialists, anything, than have anybody stopped and censored.
0735	Donald Trump	You gotta live  we gotta live with it.
0736	Donald Trump	We gotta get used to it.
0737	Donald Trump	We're going to live with fake news.
0738	Donald Trump	There's too many sources.Every one of us is sort of like a newspaper.
0739	Donald Trump	You have Twitter, you have whatever you have, Facebook, but everyone, you can't have censorship.
0740	Donald Trump	You can't pick one person and say, "Well, we don't like what he's been saying.
0741	Donald Trump	He's out."
0742	Donald Trump	So we'll live with fake news.
0743	Donald Trump	I mean, I hate to say it, but we have no choice because that's by far the better alternative.
0744	Donald Trump	We can't have people saying censorship because you know what?
0745	Donald Trump	It can turn it around.
0746	Donald Trump	It can be them next.
0747	Donald Trump	It can be them next.
0748	Donald Trump	We believe in the right of Americans to speak their minds.
0749	Donald Trump	We repeal the core of Obamacare.
0750	Donald Trump	I told you, individual mandate  because we want to give critically ill patients.
0751	Donald Trump	We have to give them access.
0752	Donald Trump	We have to give health care to people.
0753	Donald Trump	We want the right to try.
0754	Donald Trump	Do you know what the right to try is?
0755	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get this for 40 years.
0756	Donald Trump	They couldn't get it.
0757	Donald Trump	A person is terminally ill, they're terminally ill.
0758	Donald Trump	They're really sick.
0759	Donald Trump	And I know people, if they have money, they travel all over the world to try and find a cure.
0760	Donald Trump	If they don't have money, they die.
0761	Donald Trump	They die.
0762	Donald Trump	We have the greatest scientists in the world, that's why China and so many other people, they're trying to  countries they're trying to steal our technology.
0763	Donald Trump	We can't let them happen.
0764	Donald Trump	But we have so many people that want to be able to give  it's like hope, right to try.
0765	Donald Trump	I love the name.
0766	Donald Trump	It's a right to try.
0767	Donald Trump	They never had it before.
0768	Donald Trump	So a person is terminally ill and we have a great new drug, but it's going to take another two, three years to have it approved.
0769	Donald Trump	OK, maybe longer.
0770	Donald Trump	But the tests are really looking good.
0771	Donald Trump	And this person is very sick.
0772	Donald Trump	And this person is going to be dead in 90 days and we couldn't get that drug for that person no matter who you were.
0773	Donald Trump	And I said, "Wait a minute what's the story with this?"
0774	Donald Trump	Now, there were a lot of complications because the insurance companies had problems, the medical companies had  everybody.
0775	Donald Trump	A lot of people didn't want them in the stats, horrible things.
0776	Donald Trump	But I said, "Well, what's going on?
0777	Donald Trump	We're going to take the right to try and we went through with the help of Cory, with the help of your great, wonderful  you are a coal lover, aren't you, huh, Shelley?
0778	Donald Trump	But with the help of Shelley, soon to be with the help of Patrick Patrick, Patrick, oh, he's going to get a lot of things.He's going to get it.
0779	Donald Trump	We got it approved.
0780	Donald Trump	So now if we have a great drug that hasn't been approved and somebody has a certain illness they're going to be able to be  to try.
0781	Donald Trump	And you know what?
0782	Donald Trump	Some of the drugs we have in the pipeline are amazing.
0783	Donald Trump	It's going to work for a lot of people and it's going to give them hope.
0784	Donald Trump	It's going to give them hope, big deal.
0785	Donald Trump	We've just secured $6 billion to fight the opioid epidemic.
0786	Donald Trump	And I know in West Virginia, that's a big deal, right?
0787	Donald Trump	That's a big deal.We confirmed a record number of Circuit Court judges, it's a record and it's going bigger and bigger.
0788	Donald Trump	We have a lot of them in the line if Schumer would ever get them approved.
0789	Donald Trump	He's not exactly thrilled about approving them, that I can tell you.
0790	Donald Trump	We confirmed the great deal Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States.
0791	Donald Trump	And as I just said, Justice Kavanagh is doing great.
0792	Donald Trump	Looks like I had a very tough Central Casting.
0793	Donald Trump	How do you vote against him?
0794	Donald Trump	But the Democrats may find a way.
0795	Donald Trump	We've secured a record $700 billion for our military this year and $716 billion for next year, billion with a b.
0796	Donald Trump	Our military will be stronger and bigger and better and more sophisticated than it's ever been, ever.
0797	Donald Trump	And hopefully we'll never have to use it.
0798	Donald Trump	You don't get a lot of good fighters out here.
0799	Donald Trump	I see some of them.
0800	Donald Trump	I know some of them.
0801	Donald Trump	And the one thing about a fighter or a nation or whatever you want, the stronger your military, the better chance you have of never having to use it.
0802	Donald Trump	We don't want to use it.
0803	Donald Trump	We don't want to use it.
0804	Donald Trump	And all of that equipment is being built right here in the U.S.A. We make the greatest fighter jets in the world.We make the greatest ships in the world.
0805	Donald Trump	We make the greatest missiles and rockets.
0806	Donald Trump	Nobody does it like us.
0807	Donald Trump	And in my direction, The Pentagon is working hard to create the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces, the space force.That's very exciting.
0808	Donald Trump	We need it.
0809	Donald Trump	That's the new frontier, and I'm not just talking about sending rockets to the Moon.
0810	Donald Trump	I'm talking about militarily.That's where it's at.
0811	Donald Trump	Thanks to the leadership of U.N.
0812	Donald Trump	Ambassador Nikki Haley.
0813	Donald Trump	We've reduced the United Nations spending by $1.3 billion saving U.S. taxpayers $350 million.
0814	Donald Trump	Just came out, but nobody wants to ride it.
0815	Donald Trump	We just passed the landmark VA accountability law.That's where people that don't treat our vets properly, we look at them and we say, "You're fired.
0816	Donald Trump	Get the hell out."
0817	Donald Trump	45 years they have been trying to pass it.
0818	Donald Trump	45 years they've tried the pass it.
0819	Donald Trump	We also passed veterans choice so that if our veterans can't get the care they need, they have the right to see a private doctor.
0820	Donald Trump	They don't have to wait in line for three weeks, four weeks, eight weeks, two months.
0821	Donald Trump	I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal.
0822	Donald Trump	And this month, we reimposed tough sanctions on Iran's nuclear program and on Iran.
0823	Donald Trump	I also recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
0824	Donald Trump	And I understand now what happened because every president  many, many presidents.
0825	Donald Trump	They said, "We're going to do it.
0826	Donald Trump	We're going to move our embassy to Jerusalem.
0827	Donald Trump	It's going to be the capital of Israel, and we're going to do it."
0828	Donald Trump	We're going do it, and then they don't do it.
0829	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0830	Donald Trump	Politicians, they don't do it.
0831	Donald Trump	So I said, I'm going do it during the campaign.I said it right here in West Virginia.
0832	Donald Trump	And I now understand why many, many presidents before me said they were going to do it and didn't do it because I was inundated with calls from foreign leaders, every country.
0833	Donald Trump	Don't do it.
0834	Donald Trump	Don't do it.
0835	Donald Trump	Don't do it.
0836	Donald Trump	Please don't do it, don't do it.
0837	Donald Trump	And so actually, what I did, I was about five days off.I stopped taking calls.
0838	Donald Trump	I said, "I'll call you back next week," because I knew what they were going to ask me.
0839	Donald Trump	It's much easier if it was, oopsie, I didn't know you're always calling for that reason.
0840	Donald Trump	So I approved it, and it should have been done years ago.
0841	Donald Trump	And if there's ever going to be peace, remember I said it, with the Palestinians, it was a good thing to have done because we took it off the table.
0842	Donald Trump	Because every time they were peace talks, they never got past Jerusalem becoming the capital.
0843	Donald Trump	So I said, let's take it off the table.
0844	Donald Trump	And you know what, in the negotiation, Israel will have to pay a higher price because they want a very big thing, but I took it off the table.
0845	Donald Trump	They could never get by.You understand that Cory.
0846	Donald Trump	You both understand that.
0847	Donald Trump	Shelley?
0848	Donald Trump	They could never get past the fact of Jerusalem becoming the capital.
0849	Donald Trump	Now it's off the table.
0850	Donald Trump	There's nothing to negotiate.
0851	Donald Trump	But they'll get something very good because it's their turn next.
0852	Donald Trump	Let's see what happens.
0853	Donald Trump	It's very  I've always heard that's the toughest deal of all deals that's called peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
0854	Donald Trump	They say that's the toughest of all deals.
0855	Donald Trump	Let's see what happens.
0856	Donald Trump	Instead of apologize, that's  what we're doing is we're winning.
0857	Donald Trump	Instead of apologizing from that, we're standing up for America and we're standing up for the heroes who defend our country, but to continue this incredible success, we must elect more Republicans.We must elect Patrick Morrisey.
0858	Donald Trump	We need him.
0859	Donald Trump	We need Patrick.
0860	Donald Trump	So get your friends, your neighbors, your coworkers, your family members, get the people that love our country and get out to vote.
0861	Donald Trump	We need his vote so badly.
0862	Donald Trump	We need his energy.
0863	Donald Trump	You're going to see this guy has energy.
0864	Donald Trump	Loyal citizens like you helped to build this country.
0865	Donald Trump	Together we're taking back our country, returning power to where it belongs, to the American people.
0866	Donald Trump	From Morgantown to Madison to Charleston, this great state was settled by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women who tamed the wilderness to build a better life for themselves and for their incredible American families.
0867	Donald Trump	They didn't have a lot of money.
0868	Donald Trump	They didn't have a lot of luxury, but they had grit and they had faith and they loved each other.
0869	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you what, they were smart.
0870	Donald Trump	They are smart.
0871	Donald Trump	We're the smart ones, remember.
0872	Donald Trump	I say it all the time.You hear the elite.
0873	Donald Trump	They're not elite, we're elite.
0874	Donald Trump	You're smarter than they are, you have more money than they are, you have better jobs than they do, you'rethe elite.
0875	Donald Trump	So let them have the word elite.
0876	Donald Trump	You're the super elite.That's what it is.
0877	Donald Trump	I always hate  I always hate when they say, well the elite decided not to go to something I'm doing, right, the elite.
0878	Donald Trump	I said, "Well, I have a lot more money than they do.
0879	Donald Trump	I have a much better education than they have.I'm smarter than they are.
0880	Donald Trump	I have many much more beautiful homes than they do.
0881	Donald Trump	I have a better apartment at the top of Fifth Avenue.
0882	Donald Trump	Why the hell are they the elite?
0883	Donald Trump	Tell me.
0884	Donald Trump	Because you are the elite.
0885	Donald Trump	Just remember that.
0886	Donald Trump	You are the elite.
0887	Donald Trump	They're not the elite.
0888	Donald Trump	That's just a name.
0889	Donald Trump	Aren't you insulted when they say the elite?
0890	Donald Trump	To me, I'm insulted, always insulted.
0891	Donald Trump	They're the elite, they're not the elite.
0892	Donald Trump	Your people and the people that preceded you in West Virginia were the Carpenters and the coal miners, the ministers, the metal workers, the farmers, the factory workers, but they all had one thing in common.
0893	Donald Trump	They love their families, they love their country, and they love their God.
0894	Donald Trump	We stand on the shoulders of generations of American patriots who knew how to fight and they knew how to win.
0895	Donald Trump	We're winning again.
0896	Donald Trump	We're winning again.
0897	Donald Trump	Just like them we're going to keep on fighting and we're going to keep on winning and we're going to win for our nation, our children, our families and we're going to win for our continued freedom.
0898	Donald Trump	I joke that I'll have Patrick Morriseycoming to me soon.
0899	Donald Trump	He'll be your senator and he'll say, "Mr. President, the people of West Virginia can't stand winning so much.
0900	Donald Trump	They haven't won in decades and now you're winning with coal, you're winning with everything."
0901	Donald Trump	He's going say  Patrick, he's going to say, "Mr. President, please they don't want to win so much.
0902	Donald Trump	They can't stand it.
0903	Donald Trump	Please you're winning too much for West Virginia.
0904	Donald Trump	Please stop winning."
0905	Donald Trump	And I'm going to say, "Patrick.
0906	Donald Trump	I'm sorry.
0907	Donald Trump	I don't care what the hell the people of West Virginia want.
0908	Donald Trump	We're going to keep on winning anyway, because I believe that's what they want."
0909	Donald Trump	Right?
0910	Donald Trump	That's what they want because the people of West Virginia never give up.
0911	Donald Trump	They never given and they never back down because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue.
0912	Donald Trump	We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
0913	Donald Trump	And together we will make America wealthy again.
0914	Donald Trump	That's happening.
0915	Donald Trump	That's happening a lot faster than the fake news ever said it could happen.
0916	Donald Trump	We will make America strong again.
0917	Donald Trump	We will make America safe again and we will make America great again.
0918	Donald Trump	Thank you, West Virginia.
0919	Donald Trump	Thank you.
