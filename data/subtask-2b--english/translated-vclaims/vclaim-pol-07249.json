What do these two have to do with it? Cassidy said Landrio chose one fund, but he cut off the other. \"What are you gonna choose? To finance benefits for veterans or illegal immigrants? I'm not gonna put illegal immigrants before veterans. But Mary Landrio said in the ad \"Instead of fully funding the benefits of veterans, I voted to grant benefits to those who are here illegally. No wonder she supports Barack Obama and his amnesty plan.\" This is exactly the charge, but is it accurate? We decided to take a look. Cassidy refers to the budget agreement reached in December 2013 between the Republic, Paul Ryan, R-Wis, and Sin Patty Murray, D-Wash, each of their largest budget negotiators. The draft law had prevented the Government from closing again and had offered some exemption from detention. \u00b6 (I forgot about the Jumper?) The overall 10-year budget cuts were supposed to be so profound and disgusting from both sides that Congress was expected to reach a significant compromise in the budget to avoid them, but never to do so). Under this agreement, estimated budget expenditure ceilings were set at $1.012 trillion for fiscal year 2014 and $1.014 trillion for fiscal year 2015. For 2014, this figure is $45 billion more than would have been subject to pre-trial detention and $18 billion more for 2015. How did Congress pay for that? On the other hand, by reducing cost-of-living adjustments for the retirement pay of veterans under the age of 62. This provision provoked an immediate reaction from the veterans' groups and some members of Congress. However, the budget agreement was approved by the House of Representatives on 12 December 2013, by an overwhelming majority, 332-94. Cassidy voted for him. When the bill moved to the Senate, the majority leader Harry Reed, D-Nev., prevented any amendments so that the fragile agreement could get a vote up or down when the House of Representatives passed (and another government closure was on the horizon in January). But Sin Jeff Seals, R-Ala, tried to reopen the amendment process so that he could make an adjustment that would have reduced the pension cost of veterans. In order to pay for increased spending, the courses instead wanted to fill a gap that allowed some undocumented migrants with children to receive the additional tax exemption for children. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, the amendment to the session never came to the vote. However, the Senate had already held a procedural vote on whether the amendment process should be reopened so that the amendment of the session could be heard, and perhaps other amendments. However, on 17 December, that vote failed largely according to party lines, 54-46, with Landriu voting with its democratic colleagues. The following day, the bill was approved by the Senate by 64 votes to 36. Cassidy's spokesman, John Comens, said that Landrio in the Senate could have voted to open the budget agreement for the amendments and chose not to do so. Cassidy did not have that opportunity in the House of Representatives because it was driven by the Republican leadership under an organized rule, which means that no amendments were allowed. We didn't see any Cassidy's statements mourning this. Even if we agree with this logic - on which we do not agree - it does not exempt Cassidy from voting in favour of the same cuts that veterans benefit and defend. As noted by Factcheck.org and Washington Post Factor, on the same day that the Senate approved the budget agreement, Cassidy defended reductions in military pensions in the radio programme of the provincial commentator Laura Ingraham. Ingraham: \"You have supported this budget deal, and now the military who have sacrificed so much are again being asked to sacrifice - and this is in terms of their pensions - yet we cannot seem to close the gaps in welfare benefits going to illegal aliens, yet you have supported this. Why? Cassidy: \"There are no reductions in benefits for persons who retire, there is an adjustment in their cost of living, which begins not for all, but for those who retire before age 62.\" Cassidy went on to defend the reduction of military pensions as logical reforms without really addressing the second aspect of the Ingraham question about tax exemptions for undocumented migrants. Finally, the House of Representatives and the Senate voted to restore these reductions to veterans &apos; benefits the following February. Under the restructured agreement, no person joining military service until 2014 will see any change in its benefits. Cassidy and Landrio voted for this, and Obama signed it into law on February 15. Our rule said Cassidy, \"I will not put illegal immigrants before veterans. But Mary Landrio did.\" There are several problems with this statement. First, the false division that Landrio had had a choice between funding undocumented migrants and veterans in the budget agreement. This amendment never came to vote. But until he put that aside, Cassidy suggests that his position is very different from Landrio. In fact, both voted in favour of the same budget agreement to reduce future cost-of-living adjustments for veterans' benefits (both also voted to recover), with Cassidy going on the conservative radio to defend these reductions. Cassidy ignores his own record of inaccurate criticism of Landrio. This additional level of hypocrisy is bumping into his ridiculous claim, and we're setting him on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07249"}
