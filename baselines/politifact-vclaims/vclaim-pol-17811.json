It persists on social media despite bans from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and it was published by Breitbart, a conservative news site.\u00a0\nThe July 27 event was organized by Tea Party Patriots, a conservative group backed by Republican donors, and attended by U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C.\nIn the video, members of a new group called America\u2019s Frontline Doctors touch on several unproven conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic. One of the most inaccurate claims comes from Dr. Stella Immanuel, a Houston-based primary care physician and minister with a track record of making bizarre medical claims, such as believing in alien DNA.\n\"This virus has a cure. It is called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Zithromax,\" Immanuel said. \"I know you people want to talk about a mask. Hello? You don\u2019t need a mask. There is a cure.\"\nAs of July 27, nearly 150,000 Americans had died because of the coronavirus. Could those deaths have been prevented by a drug that\u2019s used to treat lupus and arthritis?\nNo.\u00a0Immanuel\u2019s statement is wrong on several points.\n\u2018This virus has a cure\u2019\nThere is no known cure for COVID-19.\u00a0\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is no specific antiviral treatment for the virus. Supportive care, such as rest, fluids and fever relievers, can assuage symptoms.\n\"There is currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19,\" according to the World Health Organization.\nThe cure is \u2018hydroxychloroquine, zinc and Zithromax\u2019\nIn spite of Immanuel\u2019s anecdotal evidence, hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other drugs is not a proven treatment (or cure) for COVID-19.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has not approved hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. In mid-June, the FDA revoked its emergency authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\"It is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of HCQ and CQ may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks,\" FDA Chief Scientist Denise M. Hinton wrote.\nThe WHO and the National Institutes of Health have also stopped their hydroxychloroquine studies. Among the safety issues associated with treating COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine include heart rhythm problems, kidney injuries, and liver problems.\u00a0\nWhile some studies have found that the drug could help alleviate symptoms associated with COVID-19, the research is not conclusive. Few studies have been accepted into peer-reviewed journals. And large, randomized trials \u2014\u00a0the gold standard for clinical trials \u2014\u00a0are still needed to confirm the findings of studies conducted since the pandemic began.\nIn the video, Immanuel cited a 2005 study that found chloroquine \u2014 not hydroxychloroquine \u2014 was \"effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV,\" the official name for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. But the drug was not tested on humans, the authors wrote that more research was needed to make any conclusions, and SARS is different from COVID-19.\n\u2018You don\u2019t need a mask\u2019\nHealth officials advise everyone to wear masks in public.\nThe reason why has to do with how the coronavirus spreads. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they expel respiratory droplets containing the virus. Those droplets can then land in the mouths or noses of people nearby.\nSince some people infected with the coronavirus may exhibit no symptoms, public health officials say everyone should cover their faces in public \u2014\u00a0even if they feel well.\n\"The spread of COVID-19 can be reduced when cloth face coverings are used along with other preventive measures, including social distancing, frequent handwashing, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces,\" according to the CDC.\nOur ruling\nIn a viral video, Immanuel said there is a cure for COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine can treat it and people don\u2019t need to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus.\nAll of those claims are inaccurate. There is no known cure for COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine is not a proven treatment, and public health officials advise everyone to wear face masks in public.\nImmanuel\u2019s statement is False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17811"}
