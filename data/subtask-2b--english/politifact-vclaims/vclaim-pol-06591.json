Patrick Murphy \"voted to allow members of Congress to receive taxpayer-funded health care for life.\"", "truth_label": "pants-fire", "date": "stated on March 23, 2015 in a statement on a website:", "title": "Patrick Murphy voted for free lifetime health care for Congress, GOP group says", "text": "The 2016 Senate race in Florida officially kicked into high gear March 23 when U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, became the first major candidate to announce he will run for Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s seat.\nMurphy, 31, has built a reputation as a middle-of-the-road Democrat, but he could face a challenge on the left from U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson of Orlando. If Rubio runs for president, Murphy is still certain to face a heavyweight on the GOP side -- potentially Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera or CFO Jeff Atwater. Murphy has said he will run whether Rubio runs or not.\nOn the day of Murphy\u2019s announcement, the National Republican Senatorial Committee unveiled a website attacking his positions on several topics, including the Affordable Care Act and health care for members of Congress:\n\"Murphy voted to keep Obamacare the law of the land but also voted to allow members of Congress to receive taxpayer-funded health care for life!\"\nDid Murphy vote for permanent health care for members of Congress, including himself? Actually, no. Members of Congress do not get health care for life, and Murphy has never voted to give them health care for life.\nInstead, the NRSC is twisting generic votes in favor of the health care law into an entirely new -- and false -- attack.\nMurphy and the Affordable Care Act\nMurphy won his first race for Congress against Allen West in 2012, so he wasn\u2019t in office when Congress approved the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\nOn the campaign trail in 2012, Murphy said he supported the health care law, but also thought it could be improved. He criticized some of the requirements on businesses, such as the requirement for filing complicated 1099 forms, which was later repealed.\nWhile in office, he has taken votes related to the health care law -- for example, he joined most Democrats in opposing a bill which would have prevented the IRS from enforcing any portion of Obamacare.\nThe NRSC pointed to a few votes by Murphy including on May 16, 2013, to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Murphy voted against it -- as did all but two Democrats while Republicans overwhelmingly supported it. The bill passed the House 229-195 but never passed the Senate.\nSo what would repeal have to do with members of Congress getting their own insurance?\nThe health care law requires members of Congress to obtain health insurance through an online marketplace, such as healthcare.gov. Previously, lawmakers bought insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, in which federal employees younger than 65 chose a plan and split premiums with the federal government. If Congress ever repealed Obamacare, members would go back to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem with the claim: Members of Congress don\u2019t get to use the federal health plan forever. Instead, it\u2019s similar to getting insurance through work. When they lose the election -- essentially losing their job -- they have to find a new way to get health insurance.\nThe NRSC also cited Murphy\u2019s vote 2014 against a congressional resolution that included repeal of the health care law. Democrats including Murphy unanimously voted against it.\nIncluded along with the resolution is a \"policy statement on responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars\" that states: \"Retirement benefits for Members of Congress should not include free, taxpayer-funded health care for life.\"\nBy voting against the resolution, \"Patrick Murphy voted to allow Members of Congress to receive taxpayer funded healthcare for life,\" NRSC spokesman Matt Connelly told PolitiFact Florida.\nBut unlike the earlier vote, this one has an added wrinkle in that it carried no power.\nBoth Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense and Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown\u2019s Government Affairs Institute, said that the House budget resolution doesn\u2019t have the weight of law and it doesn\u2019t go to the president for signature.\nMurphy\u2019s spokesman Richard Carbo told PolitiFact Florida that \"essentially, the so-called 'ban'\u00a0is nothing more than words on a page.\"\n\"It was a bogus and misleading claim then, and it is a bogus and misleading claim now,\" said Jonathan Oberlander, professor of social medicine and health policy and management at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. \"Obamacare actually gives all Americans the opportunity to obtain what members of Congress already have: access to decent, affordable health insurance.\"\nAs a side note, attacks about Congress voting for \"free health care for life\" are not exclusively made by Republicans. \u00a0Health care experts we interviewed in 2013 debunked a similar claim by Democrats that repeal of the health care law would lead to free insurance for life for Congress. And Democrats used that attack line again in 2014. We rated both those claims as Pants on Fire wrong.\nOur ruling\nThe NRSC said that Murphy \"voted to allow members of Congress to receive taxpayer-funded health care for life.\"\nThe NRSC cites votes Murphy took against repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Even if those votes led to actual repeal -- which they didn\u2019t -- members of Congress would not get free healthcare for life.\nThis was a misleading claim when Democrats tried their versions of it in the past -- and it\u2019s just as misleading now.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06591"}
