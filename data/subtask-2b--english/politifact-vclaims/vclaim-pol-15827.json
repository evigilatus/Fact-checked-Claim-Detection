Steve King of Iowa called it an earmark and \"a pet project\" while  pointing to a sign  he made that said \"Pelosi's Mouse slated for $30 Million.\"\nRep. John Boehner of Ohio opposed the bill and asked how money \"for some salt marsh mouse in San Francisco is going to help a struggling autoworker in Ohio?\"\nAnd Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana said on Fox News that there was \"$30 million in there to protect mice in San Francisco.\"\nThe tale of the mouse appears to have originated around Feb. 6, 2009, from Republican staff members of the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee.\n\"Appropriations Republicans, concerned with this irresponsible process and possible abuse of taxpayer funds, have asked various federal agencies how they intend to spend the windfall of cash that Congress may approve in the 'stimulus' bill,\" said a memo posted to the site. \"One peek behind the bureaucratic curtain has yielded the following examples of hidden program information that is  not included in the language of the bill or report  . These are programs which various federal agencies have privately indicated they will fund with 'stimulus' money.\"\nThe memo lists a number of projects, including up to $37.5 million for \"wetland restoration in the San Francisco Bay Area \u2014 including work to protect the Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse.\"\nThat became fodder for a Feb. 11 e-mail from Michael Steel, Boehner's spokesman. \"Thirty million dollars for wetland restoration in the San Francisco Bay Area \u2014 including work to protect the Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse,\" Steel wrote. \"This sounds like spending projects that have been supported by a certain powerful Democrat in the past. And it certainly doesn't sound like it will create or save American jobs.\"\nThat e-mail made it into a Feb. 12 story in the  Washington Times  headlined \"Pelosi's mouse slated for $30M slice of cheese.\" The story stated, incorrectly as it turns out, that the stimulus bill \"includes $30 million for wetlands restoration that the Obama administration intends to spend in the San Francisco Bay Area to protect, among other things, the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse.\"\nAnd that story was then picked up by the Drudge Report.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's when the mouse references exploded, morphing from a possible project of an unnamed agency to Pence's \"$30 million in there to protect mice in San Francisco.\"\nWe wanted to get to the bottom of this issue and find out what was up with the mouse.\nTurns out the salt marsh harvest mouse is a previously obscure beneficiary of a major environmental restoration project for the San Francisco Bay area.\n\"A friend e-mailed me and asked me if any of the $30 million for the mouse was for us, and I was like 'What are you talking about?'\" said Steve Ritchie, an engineer with the California State Coastal Conservancy, a state agency charged with preserving and restoring the coastline.\nWhen the stimulus bill was first proposed and a call went out for ready-to-go projects, Ritchie prepared a list of the agency's shovel-ready projects and submitted it to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, both of which received money in the final version of the stimulus bill.\nThree projects would turn abandoned industrial salt operations back into natural wetlands, about 26,000 acres in all. It turns out the mouse is an endangered species that likes tidal salt marshes, and it's  mentioned by name  as one of several species that will benefit.\nBut the projects themselves \u2014 the  South Bay Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project  , the  Napa Plant Site  , and the  Napa Salt Marsh restoration  \u2014 are intended to do more than just benefit wildlife. It's major construction work to create recreation areas and to restore marshland that will resist flooding and storm surge.\n\"This is bulldozers, front-end loaders, backhoes. These are major earth-moving projects to break down levees, to resculpt the landscape and to make sure nature can do its thing,\" Ritchie said. \"Right now, we just have these lousy little salt pond levees and they break.\"\n\"These are real jobs, and these are truly ready to go,\"\u00a0 he added. \"We can definitely spend this money for construction by Nov. 30, 2010.\"\nGiven this description of the projects, which were first reported in the  San Jose Mercury News  , it's a serious distortion to say there's money in the bill to protect San Francisco mice. The bill doesn't even list the San Francisco projects by name. And the funding agencies \u2014 the Corps of Engineers or NOAA \u2014 could still decide to fund the projects or not. The bill passed a final vote in the House on Feb. 13, with no Republicans supporting it.\nSo Pelosi did not put an earmark in the bill to save the mice. In fact, there's no money in the bill for mice. For this reason, we rate Pence's remark False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d236e0ab-d760-4d4e-9ade-11675260059b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15827"}
