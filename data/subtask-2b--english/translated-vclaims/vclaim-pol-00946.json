Bretzker. Bretzker said he wanted to replace the fixed income tax in Illinois with graduation rates that required the rich to pay more. Runner said that working families would get wet because all states with graduated tax systems - ultimately 32 - imposed higher tax rates on middle-income people than they currently paid in Illinois. While there are many examples of graduated tax states that impose higher rates on the middle class than in Illinois, there are also several states that charge lower fees. Now, Bretzker is the executive head of state - who designs tax policies with a very loose stroke. In his first budget speech late last month, Bretzker spoke, as expected, of graduated taxes - a politically difficult transition that will take time to implement because it requires constitutional amendment. At the same time, he rejected schemes to increase income faster in terms of delivery, such as extending sales tax to services; abolishing the income tax exemption for decades on retirement income; or lifting the current fixed income tax. Such acts, he said, would fall disproportionately on the working poor and the middle class. (b) How can we show that we are not in a position to do so? (b) What can we learn from the Bible? (b) How can we show that we are in a position to do so? Barely. The sales tax is inherently regressive because every person, rich or poor or in the middle, pays the same price when buying the retail. However, experts have told us that extending the tax to a range of services, such as landscapes, hairdressing and laundry, can not only bring more revenue, but can also help to make sales tax less regressive and benefit those with less-used income by providing less generally lower rates. \"As income rises, your share of spending on services generally rises,\" said David Mereman, the economist who heads the financial future project at the University of Illinois. Iowa is taxing much more on services than Illinois, yet the total government and local sales tax is 7 per cent in most of our neighbouring country and in the largest city, De Moyen, is 6 per cent. In Wisconsin, which tax services more than Illinois, the highest sales tax is at 5.6 percent in Milwaukee. In Chicago, the combined tax rate is currently 10.25 per cent. If Illinois imposes a tax on the same range of services as neighbouring Iowa, it can boost annual revenues by $1.2 billion, according to projections by the bi-party financial forecast in the Illinois Legislative Council. The forecaster said that a more modest model in Wisconsin would raise an additional $588 million. The tax income for retirement in most states is tax income, but Illinois is one of the few that exempts all forms of retirement income - including social security, pensions and withdrawal from 401 (k) and IRA pension savings schemes. The Controller &apos; s Office in Illinois estimated that the tax exemption cost the State $2.3 billion in revenue in 2014 when the income tax rate was close to the current 4.95 per cent. The retirement exemption dates back to 1972 amid fears of high poverty rates among older persons. Today, less than 10 percent of the elderly live in poverty. Britzker would be right about hurting the poor and middle class if Illinois simply got rid of the entire retirement break. But this is not how most States do it. According to the Tax Act 2017, \"persons earning less than $75,000 will raise their taxes in 2021 and every two years thereafter until 2027.\" This is the case in neighbouring Indiana and Michigan, which, like Illinois, enjoy fixed income taxes. Both states exempt social security income, and Michigan also allows thousands of dollars in pension and annual benefit deductions. Carol Portman, President of the Union of Non-Party Taxpayers in Illinois, said: \"You can do this in a way that is not at least a bit retrogressive.\" The Centre for Fiscal and Budgetary Accountability, an liberal financial observer in Chicago, has proposed taxes on retirement income but proposes to leave the exemption for taxpayers with total income adjusted to less than $50,000. This could still increase the State &apos; s additional annual revenue by more than $1 billion, as data from the Illinois Revenue Department indicate. In his budget speech, Breitzker considered his graduate tax payment as the only way to bring more justice to a tax system that is currently being imposed on everyone at the same constant rate. However, during last year's major campaign, Bretzker himself developed a revenue collection plan to make the single-rate system more progressive, which requires legislative approval but no constitutional change. In essence, the current tax of 4.95 per cent could have been lifted, but then reduced taxes on modest means with increased exemptions and new credits as an interim measure, while Bretzker paid for an official graduation tax. \"We can do what other countries have done with a fixed income tax, i.e. putting in place exemptions, to raise the overall rate but protect the middle class and those who seek to get there with those exemptions,\" said Bretzker at the Forum of Candidates in February 2018. It's less than obvious what looks like to Illinois. However, Mereman, an economist at the University of Illinois, believed that the State could explore that - especially since Illinois already offered tax relief to low-income taxpayers. Mereman said, \"This option is not fully discussed as a possibility, in my view.\" However, the Governor &apos; s Office retains the Bretzker Gradual Tax Plan as the only way forward. \"The Governor has proposed a realistic plan to serve as a bridge to the future, with the ultimate goal of a fair tax system that would transform state finances in a very important way without overloading the middle class,\" wrote speaker Jordan Abudaye in an e-mail. \"The alternative to this plan is to do more: raise taxes on the middle class.\" Our Governor, Bretzker, said that revenue collection for Elinois, who is in cash distress through taxes on more services, taxes on retirement income and an increase in the current State income tax on the basis of a constant rate would \"fall disproportionately on the working poor and middle class.\" These are indeed possibilities, but examples from some other States show that they must not be facts. There are mandates that impose broader and lower sales taxes. There are fixed tax jurisdictions that tax pension income without overburdening the poor and middle class. As Bretzker himself once pointed out, there may be ways to draw more revenue from a fixed tax system without harming taxpayers by more modest means. We assess his claim mostly wrong. In fact, this statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.
