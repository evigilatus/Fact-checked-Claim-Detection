It was New Hampshire state Rep. Fred Doucette, the chair of Trump\u2019s campaign in that state.\nThe Dec. 28 Facebook post, which was shared more than 1,600 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe post lifted almost word-for-word from Doucette, who published his defense of Trump on Sept. 30 as a letter to the Eagle-Tribune, a local news outlet covering parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Eastwood was never mentioned in Doucette\u2019s piece.\n\"I love it when people call President Donald Trump stupid,\" Doucette wrote. \"You mean the multi-billionaire who kicked every Democrat\u2019s butt, buried 16 career Republican politicians, and continues to make fools out of once reputable news organizations?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe confusion linking Eastwood to the letter likely came after the Massachusetts Republican Party reposted Doucette\u2019s writing to its Facebook page in November.\u00a0\nThat post included a meme that showed a photo of Eastwood and quoted him as saying, \"If Congress really gave a rat\u2019s ass about the American people, they would resign.\"\u00a0\nFor what it\u2019s worth, we checked Google and Nexis and could not verify that Eastwood ever made that statement about Congress, either.\u00a0\nIn 2013, he did criticize Washington, saying, \"It\u2019s almost like they don\u2019t give a damn.\" He also spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2012.\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17517"}
