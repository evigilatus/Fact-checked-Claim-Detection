In one tweet, Trump wrote, \"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a crushing collapse, I won the popular vote if I cut off millions of people who voted illegally.\" In addition to winning the Electoral College in crushing collapses, you won the popular vote if you cut off millions of people who voted illegally - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 27 November 2016 Serious bias - big problem!\" This tweet offers a plethora of assurances we have already made, including the idea that Trump won the Electoral College in Fallse, that he won the popular vote (Pants on Fire) and that 3 million votes were cast by illegal aliens. We found no evidence of Trump's charge that \"he got a popular vote if I cut off millions of people who voted illegally,\" and many reasons to conclude that it didn't happen. The current voting situation approximately three weeks after election day is calculated mostly - but not entirely. The most comprehensive sound tracking analysis is published by David Wasserman of Cook's non-partisan political report. On the afternoon of 28 November, according to Wasserman's calculations, Hillary Clinton Trump led about 2.24 million votes - namely, 64,654,483 votes for Clinton, 62,418,820 votes for Trump and 7,192,036 votes for the other candidates. The late ballot tables in some states are still tripping -- many states, like California, where Clinton performed very well. For this reason, in Nov 26, Wasserman quoted Clinton as on the right track to win the popular vote with 2.5 million votes against 2.7 million votes, or a margin of about two percentage points above Trump. So, to remove Trump's popular vote deficit, there must be approximately 3 million votes for Clinton that have been cast illegally. This assumes that every 3 million of these \"illegal votes\" went to Clinton and no one went to Trump. That's a really big number. In a sense of size, 3 million votes are greater than votes cast for any presidential candidate in 36 states in addition to the province of Colombia. Three million people are more than a quarter of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States - a group specifically mentioned by InfoWars as the source of 3 million illegal voices. As we have noted before, the websites thinking about the conspiracy - in particular the Alex Jones Information Network - published articles alleging that three million votes in the presidential election \"were broadcast by illegal aliens.\" We've assessed this as a mistake. As evidence of her claim, InfoWars referred to a report from VoiceFraud.org and tweet from Greg Phillips, whose Twitter file says that he is the founder of the Sounds Stand, an application for reporting voter fraud. However, there is no report from VoiceFraud.org, and Philips PolityFact said that he does not belong to that site. In November 11 and November 13, Phillips said: \"We have verified more than 3 million votes made by non-citizens\" and Phillips \"the analysis of the 180 million voter registrations database has been completed. The number of votes of non-citizens exceeds 3 million. Counseling the legal team.\" Philips did not respond to Poletti Fuckett &apos; s inquiries for additional information. He told us earlier that he had chosen not to publish more information because he was still working on analysing and verifying the accuracy of the data. Philips wouldn't say what the data were or where it came from, or what methodology he used. He said he'd make the information public as soon as it was done. In a meeting on 28 November with journalists, the spokesman for Tramp Jason Miller mentioned two guides that Trump had cited earlier in the campaign. One is the 2012 Pew State Study Centre, whose author denies having found any evidence of voter fraud. The other article was an article published in 2014 on the Monkey Cage blog hosted by the Washington Post; many articles were raised by other political scientists questioning their accuracy. In any case, no study provides an analysis of the 2016 electoral returns. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" \u2022 On January 19, 2012, a group that claimed that electoral fraud was widespread, gave Tramp his comments in written support but did not provide specific evidence. Support from elected Republicans has rarely been forthcoming. One of the senators, James Lanford of Oklahoma, said on the new CNN day, \"I don't know what Trump was talking about. He added that while there might be a violation \"on the edges,\" he \"did not see any irregularity for voters in millions.\" Other research indicates that voter fraud is not widespread. \u2022 News21, a national investigation reporting project funded by the Carnegie Foundation in New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found only 56 non-citizens who voted between 2000 and 2011. \u2022 A report of the Brennan Liberal Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law found that most non-citizens' votes were accidental. \"although there are a few recorded examples in which non-citizens appear to have registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they are unlikely to realize that doing so was improper,\" as reported in the 2007 report. \u2022 In 2012, the Government of Florida. Rick Scott's administration has begun an attempt to suppress non-citizens who vote by comparing driver's license data with voters' lists. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Florida has drawn up a list of 182,000 potential non-citizens who voted. This number was reduced to 2,700, and then to about 200 before the clearance was stopped in the midst of criticism that the data was flawed due to the number of wrong positives - including a veterinarian born in the Second World War in Brooklyn. In the end, only 85 persons were removed from the list. At the same time, ProPublica, an investigative journalist's project, tweeted that \"We had 1,100 people watching the vote on election day. We saw no evidence that the elections were \"proven\" and \"no evidence that undocumented migrants voted illegally.\" Unconvinced experts have rejected the content of Trump's tweet. \"This is a clear mistake,\" said Costas Panagopolis, a political scientist from Fordham University. \"It will be necessary to have a broad national conspiracy and coordination efforts to do so, and it will be necessary for illegal foreigners to be on the voters' lists in states throughout the country months ago to be eligible to vote. It is also very easy for discretionary fraudulent voting to be sufficient to give Trump the popular vote. It's probably not a coincidence.\" The politician at Emory Allan Abramowitz University added: \"If Mr. Trump seriously believes that there is a major vote fraud in any state, he must lodge a formal protest and request an investigation. It does not do so - it simply repeats unfounded allegations.\" And the politician at the University of Denver Seth Maskett said that the claim is short in basic logic. \"It's strange to claim that Clinton had the ability to generate millions of illegal voters but not to use them to help them win in the electoral college,\" said Maskett. Our Governor Trump tweeted that \"I get a popular vote if I cut off millions of people who voted illegally.\" Neither Tramp nor his allies provided any evidence of the spread of illegal voting. In fact, studies have consistently shown that voter fraud is not widespread enough to call into question millions and millions of votes. In fact, the ability to carry out such a far-reaching conspiracy - which is likely to involve millions of people over several months without being noticed by election administrators, many of whom are in Republican-controlled states - is ridiculously irrational. We appreciate Trump's statement of fire pants. The editor's note, November 28, 5:00 p.m.: This article was updated to include references to Miller's conference call. There was no change in the evaluation. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9c4a231c-afbc-4351-96ba-2379fc5a2f5a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03913"}
