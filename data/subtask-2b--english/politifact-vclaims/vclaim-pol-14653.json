But he nearly steers a legitimate concern off the rails with his 100,000 job-loss figure.\n\nThe \"energy tax\" would come from a proposed bill to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Though the so-called cap-and-trade bill would not specifically impose a tax, it\u2019s clear enough what Portman means. The bill would limit carbon emissions while creating a trading system so companies that cut their carbon output \u2013 by burning less coal, for instance \u2013 could sell their unneeded carbon credits. Companies that needed to exceed the caps could buy those credits.\n\nUnless there was generous help to companies in coal-reliant states like Ohio, a cap-and-trade bill could hurt, because there aren\u2019t enough alternatives right now to coal-fired electricity.\n\n\"The fact is that any carbon legislation is designed to make us not use coal,\" says Kevin Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington. \"So if you\u2019re a state that has a lot of coal, you\u2019re going to get hammered.\"\n\nTheoretically then, Portman\u2019s broad fear is not off the mark, although various studies and analyses make conflicting claims. But Portman strays by claiming the cost could be 100,000 Ohio jobs, and by saying the bill \"is coming our way.\"\n\nHis job-loss figure comes from an analysis of a bill that the House of Representatives passed last year. Two problems:\n\u00a0\n\nThe analysis, from a study sponsored by the business-backed National Association of Manufacturers and the American Council of Capital Formation, predicted two potential outcomes. Ohio\u2019s job losses by the year 2030 could range anywhere from 79,700 to 108,600, the study said. Yet Portman chose to go with a figure closest to the outside extreme.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe bill he relies on in order to make the claim has stalled for a long time in the Senate with objections not only from Republicans but also from industrial-state Democrats like \u00a0Ohio\u2019s Sherrod Brown. Few people in Washington believe a broad \u00a0cap-and-trade bill has a chance of passing, especially in an election year.\n\n\n\"I sure wouldn\u2019t want to bet the farm on it,\" says Stephen Hess, a senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institution, a centrist-liberal think tank. \"I don\u2019t think I\u2019d even want to bet a weekend at Atlantic City.\"\n\nThe House bill was sponsored by liberal members Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Henry Waxman of California. Senate Democrats don\u2019t have enough of a majority to just rubber-stamp the Waxman-Markey bill, and Democrats like Brown are insisting on better economic protections for coal-reliant states. The campaign of Lee Fisher, Portman\u2019s Democratic rival in the Senate race, says Fisher too believes the Waxman-Markey bill would harm Ohio unless it got better protections.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean a compromise cannot be fashioned, and several are on the table. One would require provisions to keep foreign manufacturers that don\u2019t have carbon restrictions from gaining advantage and taking jobs from the United States. Another would grant extra carbon credits to keep companies in Ohio and similar states from paying too much while they transitioned to greener energy sources. Yet another, being considered as a separate bill that has President Barack Obama\u2019s support, would create clean-energy manufacturing grants to help companies develop jobs in wind, solar and other alternative energy sources.\n\nDifferent interest groups, economists and lawmakers use different analyses to project the potential job losses or gains from these proposals. The Peterson Institute for International Economics said in May that a climate-change measure introduced by Sen. John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, would prompt enough clean-energy investment in its first decade to add 203,000 new jobs nationally. But higher energy and product prices in the second decade would offset those job gains, the Peterson economists said.\n\nEconomists at the University of California at Berkeley had a more optimistic take, saying that adoption of a House-style bill could add as many as 1.9 million jobs nationwide \u2013 with 35,000 to 61,000 of those in Ohio \u2013 by 2020. That is assuming that states have \"balanced policies\" that utilize not only a cap-and-trade system but also complementary policies for energy efficiency and clean technology, the authors said.\n\nFor an additional take, we looked at a Congressional Budget Office analysis, published in May. The CBO examined three independent economic studies by outside groups: Brookings, Resources for the Future, and CRA International, a consulting firm. The CBO\u2019s conclusion from these: Workers who rely on coal and other fossil fuels for their jobs would be affected, but eventually, most workers who lost jobs would find new ones.\n\nIn particular, the CBO said, a \"gradually increasing tax on greenhouse gas emissions,\" as envisioned in the Waxman-Markey bill, \"would probably only have a small effect on total employment during the next few decades.\"\n\nThe CBO did not quantify that, however. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and took out our calculator. If 100,000 jobs were lost due to cap-and-trade, as Portman claims, that would represent a loss of anywhere from 2 percent to 2.4 percent of Ohio jobs, depending on how you measure today\u2019s employment. That\u2019s not a small effect \u2013 which would seem to put Portman\u2019s claim at odds with the CBO\u2019s analysis.\n\nA loss of 100,000 jobs \"would be quite meaningful\" in terms of overall Ohio employment, says Ken Mayfield, an economist and president of ClearView Economics of Pepper Pike.\n\nIn his commercial, Portman couches his number by saying the state \"could\" lose that many jobs. And campaign spokeswoman Jessica Towhey says that Portman uses the 100,000 number because it comes from a legitimate study of the only cap-and-trade bill that has passed a chamber of Congress, making it more realistic than Senate proposals that are speculative for now. If Obama were to demand action, Towhey said, Senate Democrats could quickly line up in support and enact a final cap-and-trade bill.\n\nBut the political roadblocks to Waxman-Markey in the Senate make its passage equally speculative -- unless there are concessions for states like Ohio. And Portman chose to use the worst-case conclusion on Waxman-Markey.\n\nIn fact, last October another fact-checking outfit, Factcheck.org, affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, did its own full review of the National Association of Manufacturers\u2019 claim. It examined the national prediction rather than those for individual states, focusing on the claim that cap-and-trade could cost up to 2.4 million jobs.\n\nFactcheck.org turned to the same in-depth study by the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, that backers and detractors of Waxman-Markey were citing at the time. The EIA analyzed 11 different sets of assumptions, every one of which showed there would be fewer jobs in 2030 with the Waxman-Markey bill than without.\n\nBut \"only the most severely pessimistic set of assumptions\" produced job losses on the scale cited by the manufacturers, and now repeated by Portman. And remember, that was the worst case scenario from two groups that tend to support big business\u2019 side of the issue.\n\nThat\u2019s why we find Portman\u2019s claim to be Barely True.\nComment on this item.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
