And now it has been raised as an issue in the Donald Trump campaign, after 22-year-old Thomas DiMassimo jumped a barrier and rushed the stage March 12 at a Trump event in Dayton, Ohio. DiMassimo was promptly arrested.\nThe DiMassimo incident and its aftermath captured much of the weekend news cycle amid concerns over repeated confrontations between pro- and anti-Trump factions.\nOn NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd noted that after the Dayton rally, Trump tweeted a video that purportedly showed DiMassimo posing with a gun against the backdrop of an ISIS flag, with Arabic-language music playing in the background.\nTrump was referring to a video that, as it turns out, had been posted on YouTube in order to troll DiMassimo. PolitiFact previously looked at Trump\u2019s DiMassimo-ISIS claim and rated it False.\nBut Trump also made another point -- that DiMassimo had desecrated a U.S. flag. And, Trump said, there was a video to prove it.\n\"He was walking, dragging the American flag on the ground like it was a piece of garbage,\" Trump told Todd. \"I don\u2019t like that, and a lot of people don\u2019t like that.\"\nPolitiFact decided to check this claim as well.\nDiMassimo has numerous Atlanta connections. His mother works as manager of Atlanta\u2019s infrastructure bond program, and his father is a metro area teacher. Cartersville attorney Lester Tate is representing the family and helped Thomas DiMassimo, who was released from jail the same day he was charged, retain an attorney in Ohio.\nTate declined to comment when contacted for this fact-check. DiMassimo did not respond to an email request for comment.\nAccording to news reports, YouTube videos and his own Facebook page, DiMassimo has a history of using flag desecration as a form of protest. He ripped up a Confederate Flag at a Stone Mountain protest last year.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne video, titled \"Not My Flag\" and uploaded by YouTube user \"Tommy DiMassimo,\" shows DiMassimo taking part in a protest at Wright State University, where he was a student, in April 2015. The video shows him dragging a U.S. flag behind him and ultimately standing on it.\nThe video had been viewed more than 311,000 times as of this fact-check. It had 270 likes and more than 2,300 dislikes.\nMistreating the flag is an incendiary topic. There have been attempts to ban the practice throughout U.S. history, but it is not illegal, even to the point of damaging or destroying a flag. According to U.S. law, \"desecration\" of the flag applies to \"whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States.\"\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Texas vs. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), and reaffirmed in U.S. vs. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990), that it is unconstitutional for a government to prohibit the desecration of a flag, due to its status as symbolic speech.\nText accompanying the DiMassimo video states the demonstration was held to support Valdosta State University student Eric Sheppard, who was arrested for bringing a gun on campus during a protest at the Georgia school. Sheppard also desecrated a U.S. flag in that protest.\nIn the video of the Wright State University demonstration, a counter-protester confronts DiMassimo and the other protesters. The man is carrying a U.S. flag on a pole across his shoulder.\n\"You need to learn respect,\" yells the man, who then references U.S. deaths in the Vietnam War. \"I\u2019ve got 58,000 of my brothers who died for this flag.\"\nOne of the protesters yells, \"You know what this stands for?\" At that point, DiMassimo, who is standing on a U.S. flag, yells: \u00a0\"Racism, capitalism, imperialism.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said Thomas DiMassimo had desecrated a U.S. flag by \"dragging the American flag on the ground like it was a piece of garbage.\"\nHe is correct. A YouTube video posted by DiMassimo shows him dragging a flag on the ground and later standing on it. This is offensive to many, but legal under the First Amendment.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05260"}
