However, one political mimi continues to spread through social media and claims to have only said so. According to the story, Donald Trump said in an interview in 1998 with People Magazine that he was thinking of running for president and that he would do so as a Republican because they were \"the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything in Fox News. I could've lied and they still ate it. I bet my numbers are gonna be great.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Mimi shows a new picture of the younger Trump, quoted as a statement he made in an interview with the magazine. So did Donald Trump really say that or something? No, the quote is fake. There is no such interview. The fabricated quote appeared on social media in October 2015, when the Trump campaign began to excite. The memma has shown up continuously over the years, although it has been dismantled over and over again. We searched people's archives, dating back to the 1970s, and we didn't find any interviews with Trump in 1998 - or at any other time - that characterize this quote or anything like it. Most of the magazine articles at the time, including Trump, discussed his famous and high-quality divorce from Marla Maples. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he adhere to the proven book of democratic play.\" On January 11, 2021, people also issued a statement undermining the quote. \"People considered this issue comprehensively when the quote first appeared,\" said a spokesman for a magazine. We searched every Tramp story in our archives and found nothing like this quote -- nor did we interview Trump in 1998. Trump was talking about politics in the late 1980s and 1990s, but there was no record of him beating the Republican Party, or its voters. For example, in the 1988 episode of Oprah Winfrey's presentation, Trump said that he might never run for president, but he would not completely rule out that. The picture used in the MIM is from that interview: on September 30, 1999, Trump wrote an article about the Wall Street Journal and said that he was thinking about holding presidential elections, and it seemed like he was doing it as an independent. \"Like candidates from the two main parties, my candidacy would not represent an exercise in career advancement... The Republicans are captured from their right wing. Democrats are captured from their left wing. I don't hear anyone talking about men and women working at the center.\" Only a few days later, on 8 October 1999, Trump appeared on Larry King Live in CNN and said that he had formed a commission to explore the presidential election and that he was a registered Republican. Our judge, Amy, claims that Donald Trump, in an interview 20 years ago, said that if he ran for president, he would do so as a Republican because they were \"the dumbest group of voters in the country\" and \"believed in anything on Fox News.\" While Trump flirted with the idea of running for president in a few interviews in the late 1990s, there is no record of Trump saying this quote in people, or in any other publication. Despite repeated quotations, it has consistently appeared through social media over the years. We're assessing this allegation pants on fire!
