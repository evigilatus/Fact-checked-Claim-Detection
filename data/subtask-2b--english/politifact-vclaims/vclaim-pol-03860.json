One hour later, WikiLeaks starts dropping my emails,\" Podesta told Chuck Todd on Dec. 18, 2016. \"One could say that those things might not have been a coincidence.\"\nThe Access Hollywood tape Podesta referenced showed Donald Trump making lewd comments about women during a 2005 interview. \"I\u2019ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,\" Trump tells interviewer Billy Bush. \"You know I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful \u2014 I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. I just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\"\nThe tape was discovered and first published by the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold right around 4 p.m. ET on Oct. 7.
