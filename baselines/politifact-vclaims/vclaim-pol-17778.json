I talked about what we needed to do.\"\nOther news outlets have previously fact-checked similar assertions by Biden, but we\u2019ll take a crack at his newest remark on Reid\u2019s show.\nWe found that Biden did warn about a potential pandemic as long ago as January, and talked about some steps the administration should take. A fuller, detailed plan came weeks later.\nThe USA Today op-ed\nBiden\u2019s primary warning about the coronavirus came in a USA Today op-ed he published on Jan. 27, which was six days after the first coronavirus case in the United States was announced.\u00a0\nHere are the op-ed\u2019s key passages about the novel coronavirus:\n\"The possibility of a pandemic is a challenge Donald Trump is unqualified to handle as president. \u2026 The outbreak of a new coronavirus, which has already infected more than 2,700 people and killed over 80 in China, will get worse before it gets better. Cases have been confirmed in a dozen countries, with at least five in the United States. There will likely be more. \u2026 To be blunt, I am concerned that the Trump administration\u2019s shortsighted policies have left us unprepared for a dangerous epidemic that will come sooner or later.\"\nWhile Biden told Reid that he had \"warned\" Trump that \"this pandemic was coming,\" his January op-ed did not word it so definitively. In the op-ed, Biden referred to \"the possibility of a pandemic\" and he said one \"will come sooner or later.\"\nThe World Health Organization did not declare a pandemic until March 11. Trump was tweeting as late as Feb. 24 that the coronavirus \"is very much under control in the USA.\"\nStill, Biden\u2019s wording in the Reid interview suggested that his warnings were more definitive than they were.\nHis comment to Reid that he \"talked about what we needed to do\" as far back as January was more big picture than specific.\nMuch of the op-ed set forth the ways in which the Obama administration, which Biden served as vice president, handled the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak, including marshaling a cooperative international response and relying on sound science for decision-making. Biden contrasted the Obama playbook with the ways that Trump, then a private citizen, \"sought to stoke fear and stigma\" about Ebola.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational cooperation and a reliance on science are\u00a0big-picture elements of fighting a disease outbreak in its early stages. Biden also wrote in the op-ed that, as president, he would \"ask Congress to beef up the Public Health Emergency Fund and give me the power to use the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to declare a disaster if an infectious disease threat merits it. I will also renew funding \u2014 set to expire in May \u2014 for the nationwide network of hospitals that can isolate and treat people with infectious diseases, and fully fund the Global Health Security Agenda so the world is ready for the next outbreak.\"\nBeyond that, Biden did not offer much specificity for battling the coronavirus in January, when public-health officials around the world were just beginning to grasp the nature of the virus and the steps that would be required to contain it.\u00a0\nIn the U.S., public-health officials were beginning to contemplate the potential need for extensive social-distancing measures in February and early March. Biden held an in-person rally in Detroit as late as March 9 before canceling a rally for the first time on March 10. The following day, the NBA abruptly suspended its season, triggering a cascade of cancellations of events and gatherings around the country.\nOn March 12, Biden offered a more detailed plan. In remarks posted on Medium, Biden thanked those \"who are already making sacrifices to protect us \u2014 whether that\u2019s self-quarantining or cancelling events or closing campuses.\"\u00a0\nHe went on to say that fighting the coronavirus \"will mean making some radical changes to our personal behaviors: more frequent and more through handwashing and staying home from work if you are ill, but also altering some deeply ingrained habits, like handshakes and hugs, and avoiding large public gatherings.\"\nBiden also urged free testing for everyone who needs it; making sure communities have the hospital beds, staff, medical supplies and personal protective equipment needed to treat patients; efforts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Defense Department to provide temporary hospitals; and fast-tracking of vaccine clinical trials by the National Institutes of Health and approvals by the Food and Drug Administration.\nBiden\u2019s plan came four days before the White House issued recommendations that senior citizens and people with serious health concerns should stay home, initially for 15 days.\nThe White House formally declared a national emergency on March 13.\nBiden\u2019s campaign told PolitiFact that an op-ed was not the venue to flesh out a full plan; it was intended more as an outline.\nOur ruling\nBiden said, \"I, all the way back in January, warned (President Trump that) this pandemic was coming. I talked about what we needed to do.\"\nBiden expressed concern about the coronavirus weeks before Trump did, and he recommended the Obama approach on Ebola, including international cooperation and the use of sound science, in January. He warned of the possibility of a pandemic several weeks before the WHO declared one, and predicted that there would be more cases in the U.S.\u00a0\nBut while he spoke broadly in January about how the U.S. should approach the crisis, he did not offer a detailed plan until March 12, a day after the WHO declaration.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17778"}
