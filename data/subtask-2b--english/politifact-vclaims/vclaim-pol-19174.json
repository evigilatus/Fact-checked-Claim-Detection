Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., spent her first weeks in Congress arguing against the House impeachment vote against President Donald Trump, making false claims about the presidential election, objecting to new metal detectors in front of House chambers, and insisting that she could carry her handgun around the Capitol.\u00a0\nBut there are some false claims being spread about the freshman congresswoman, too.\nIn the days following the Capitol raid, viral captions have been shared alongside a photo featuring Boebert that claim it shows some of the rioters and was taken the day before the attack.\u00a0\n\"Congresswoman Lauren Boebert took this group on a guided tour of the Capitol one day before the insurrection. Three of the people participated and knew exactly where to go\u2026\" one post reads.\n\nBut the image wasn\u2019t taken on the steps of the U.S. Capitol in January 2021. It dates back to December 2019 and was captured outside of the Colorado State Capitol.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Scott Tipton in the Republican primary,\" the Times Recorder wrote.\u00a0\nIn the image, Boebert is standing with members of the \"Bikers for Trump\" group, as well as \"American Patriots II%,\" which is listed as an anti-government extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Some people in the photograph appear to be displaying a white supremacist symbol.\nOur ruling\nFacebook posts claim a photo of Boebert shows her standing with Capitol rioters before she gave them a tour of the building \"one day before the insurrection.\"\nThis isn\u2019t accurate. Boebert is seen with members of an extremist group in the image, but it wasn\u2019t taken recently, or on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. It\u2019s from a December 2019 rally at Colorado\u2019s Capitol.\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19174"}
