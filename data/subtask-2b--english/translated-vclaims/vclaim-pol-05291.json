Sanders said that it will delay implementation, and that makes absolutely no sense,\" said Clinton. \"What? \"Sanders said, laughing and shaking his head incredibly. \"Wait, what?\" It was our reaction, too. Given Sanders &apos; statements and actions, Clinton &apos; s statement is misleading. In short, the Clean Energy Plan aims to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants by 2030 by 32 per cent from 2005 levels and instead promote clean energy sources. This plan, which was welcomed and criticized by the United States Supreme Court as a historic environmental initiative, was discontinued on 9 February 2016. We searched Google, Lexis and CQ for Sanders' comments on the plan and found no evidence that Sanders said he wanted to delay implementation. The Clinton campaign referred us to an interview on 21 February with Gerrest, an online environmental magazine, in which he outlined what President Sanders was likely to do about climate change. Sanders said he'd change the clean energy plan to stimulate renewable sources of energy instead of gas and extend a two-year wind and solar credit program until 2030. And away from carbon, he's also going to regulate methane through the plan. The Clinton campaign also cited an environmental law expert blog Richard Reeves in The Hill critical of Sanders. The clean energy plan \"can't be changed when the pen hit,\" Reeves wrote a few days after Grest's interview, and Sanders' actions will \"stop the train and cause considerable delay.\" In one interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry said that Hurricane Harvey \"more water fell in Houston in five days than he went over Niagara Falls in one year.\" But Sanders himself did not say that he would delay implementation. Indeed, he wants a more ambitious plan (and has issued a plan) and has supported the Obama plan from the outset. The day before it was revealed, Sanders said in a press release, \"It seems to me that it is a step forward in ending our dependence on fossil fuels, and I support this effort.\" As he said on that day, \"The President of Obama knows that climate change is the great planetary crisis facing us and we must boldly move to transform our power system #CleanPowerPlan.\" In November, Sanders voted twice against legislation to prevent a clean energy plan. \"It is embarrassing that Republicans, with some exceptions, refuse to recognize the reality of climate change, and even less are willing to do anything about it,\" was written in a press release after the effort to cancel the plan. \"The sound of today's prevention of a clean energy plan is a stark reminder that, instead of worrying about the future of our planet, the Republicans are more interested in their contributions to the election campaign.\" Our referee, Clinton, said, \"The Clean Energy Plan is something Sin Sanders said that it will delay implementation.\" Sanders calls for more ambitious action on climate change, which, in the view of some experts, could delay the plan. But Saunders himself never said what Clinton suggested, and he supported the Clean Energy Act with words and deeds. We appreciate Clinton &apos; s claim that it is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05291"}
