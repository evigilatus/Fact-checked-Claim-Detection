Getting more dangerous. \u2018Caravans\u2019 coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!\"\nThe tweet folded in familiar terms. \"Catch and release\"\u00a0refers to the practice of releasing immigrants apprehended at or near the border, expecting them to appear later before a U.S. immigration judge. DACA stands for the Trump-rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program created on President Barack Obama's watch to shield hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation.\nWe focused this fact-check on Trump\u2019s fresh statement that \"caravans\" are coming our way, presumably\u00a0from south of the Texas-Mexico border.\nTo our inquiry, a White House spokesman, Steven Cheung, said by email that there have been such caravans in the past and estimates indicate there are\u00a01,000 individuals participating in the caravan Trump had in mind.\nA Fox News discussion\nCheung didn't provide more detail. But before the president tweeted, a Fox News program the same morning featured a discussion of a caravan headed toward the U.S. through Mexico.\nCNN reported April 1, 2018: \"Trump appears to be referring to a migrant caravan assembled by the group Pueblo Sin Fronteras (People without Borders), which was discussed on Fox News' \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 shortly before he published his tweet. It's not known if the President watched the specific segment, but he indirectly referenced claims mentioned in an on-air interview with a Border Patrol union representative.\"\nSimilarly, a news story in The Washington Post pointed to the described caravan as the likely basis of Trump\u2019s concern. The Post story took note that a leader of the National Border Patrol Council, which says it represents some 18,000 Border Patrol agents and support personnel, had been interviewed on the Fox News program. Afterward, the council asserted in a web post that Trump\u2019s tweet was referring to a large group of immigrants making their way to the U.S. border.\nIn the Fox News segment, the council\u2019s president, Brandon Judd, was asked how the Border Patrol would react to the group eventually arriving at the border. Judd responded that a Mexican government entity was helping the group proceed and Pueblos Sin Fronteras, a U.S. group, also was helping. Judd said that once the people made it across the border, each one could request political asylum before getting released by authorities and then not showing up later for an immigration hearing.\nNews stories confirm caravan entered Mexico\nFox News\u2019s report was accompanied by a photo tweeted by Adolfo Flores, national security correspondent for BuzzFeed News, who reported from Mexico March 30, 2018, that hundreds of men, women and children had crossed into Mexico from Central America and were moving north--1,200 as of the group\u2019s first night in Mexico, the story said.\nBuzzFeed\u2019s story said:\n\"For five days now hundreds of Central Americans \u2014 children, women, and men, most of them from Honduras \u2014 have boldly crossed immigration checkpoints, military bases, and police in a desperate, sometimes chaotic march toward the United States. Despite their being in Mexico without authorization, no one has made any effort to stop them.\n\"Organized by a group of volunteers called Pueblos Sin Fronteras, or People Without Borders, the caravan is intended to help migrants safely reach the United States, bypassing not only authorities who would seek to deport them, but gangs and cartels who are known to assault vulnerable migrants.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of March 30, the story said, the caravan had made it to the southern Mexico state of Oaxaca but it wasn\u2019t immediately successful getting participants onto a freight train heading north. Oaxaca, the state\u2019s capital, is more than 900 miles from Laredo, Texas on the border.\nBuzzfeed\u2019s story also said: \"While there are organizers from Pueblos Sin Fronteras leading the way, much of the effort to get to the U.S. border is in the hands of the migrants themselves.\" Also, the story says that according to organizers, about two-thirds of people are planning on crossing into the U.S. \"undetected or asking for some type of protection like asylum.\"\nCaravan spokesman: Not everyone will cross U.S. border\nThat's not what we heard from\u00a0Irineo Mujica Arzate, a Pueblos Sin Fronteras press contact who told us he was speaking to us from the caravan itself.\nArzate said in a phone interview April 2, 2018 that the group helped organize two caravans in 2017 but, he said, there\u2019s only the existing caravan planned for 2018.\nArzate said that he doesn\u2019t expect every member of the caravan to cross the U.S. border. Most will try to stay in Mexico, Arzate said, with about 200 to 300 individuals ultimately crossing the U.S. border to seek asylum--a forecast that we found to be far\u00a0short of\u00a0published forecasts. \"We\u2019re trying to do it in a sensible way,\" Arzate said.\nPueblos Sin Fronteras says on its website that for 15 years, \"members have been reaching out to the most vulnerable immigrants in the United States and to migrants and refugees on the move.\" Members, the group says, \"accompany migrants and refugees in their journey of hope.\"\nOn its site, Pueblo\u00a0Sin Fronteras calls the caravan\u00a0the \"Via Crucis,\" or Stations of the Cross, march. Our search of the Nexis news database yielded an April 2015 news story from the Malaysian national\u00a0news service, Bernama, of a march that year from Mexico's southern border to Mexico City. According to the story, the \"Via Crucis\"\u00a0name draws a parallel between the suffering Jesus endured and the ordeal experienced by migrants.\nNews stories indicate a planned 2018 stop in Central Mexico\nOur search of the Nexis database for other news stories about the caravan turned up another account of the 2018 arrivals into Mexico. Noticias Financieras said in a March 26, 2018, story that nearly 1,500 people fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala had entered Mexico--with the majority hoping to reach the U.S. border to be considered as refugees.\nAlso, a March 26, 2018, story posted on SplinterNews.com, which describes itself as news and opinions that get under your skin, specified that the 1,500 people who entered Mexico would seek asylum in the U.S. after a month-long journey. The story quoted Rodrigo Abeja, described as a Mexico-based organizer with Pueblo Sin Fronteras, expressing surprise at the turnout. Abeja said the group\u2019s caravans in 2017 drew about 450 migrants, the story said.\nThen again, several accounts mentioned plans for caravan members to seek legal advice at a gathering in Puebla, in central Mexico. According to a fact-check from the Associated Press, posted the day after Trump tweeted, the caravan was scheduled to end later in April in Puebla, which is some 650 miles from the U.S. border. \"After the formal caravans end,\" the AP story said, \"some migrants do try to reach the U.S. border, but often just to turn themselves in and request asylum.\"\nOur ruling\nPresident Trump tweeted that\u00a0caravans of immigrants are coming to the Mexico-U.S. border.\nWe confirmed that a\u00a0caravan of 1,200 to\u00a01,500 people from Central America--not caravans--was in southern Mexico, about 900 miles from the Rio Grande, when Trump tweeted. Also, accounts vary on whether all\u00a0participants are bound to enter the U.S. An organizer estimated\u00a0that\u00a0most of the people intend to remain in Mexico.\nOn balance, we rate this claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
