Because Commissioner Ron Davis is quick to identify projects that help make the East Side a desirable place to live.\"\n\nDavis, first elected in 1998, has three challengers in the May 29, 2012, Democratic primary: Del Valle school board member Richard Franklin III, Pflugerville City Council Member Victor Gonzales and former City of Austin employee Arthur Sampson.\n\nFor this article, we fact-checked whether Davis was right about the amount of bond money headed to his precinct \u2014 and whether the money was spent on his projects because he was quick to point them out.\n\nOn the first front, Davis\u2019 number stands up. The second aspect proved impossible to confirm.\n\nThe Travis County Commissioners Court consists of four commissioners and the county judge, who is elected countywide. Each commissioner represents a single precinct, and each precinct is drawn by the commissioners to represent about the same number of residents. That means that if bond money were to be distributed evenly among the population, each precinct would get about 25 percent of the funds. So, Davis\u2019 statement that more than 40 percent of the spending authorized in the recent bond vote will happen in a single precinct (his) \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 drew our attention.\n\nLet\u2019s look first at the bonds approved by voters.\n\nTravis County residents voted in November 2011 to give the county permission to borrow about $215 million over seven years for road, drainage and park improvements, as well as land purchases to preserve open space, according to a Nov. 8, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article.\n\nProposition 1, with $132.8 million in spending, authorized more than two dozen transportation projects to be built, including more than 20 miles of new or expanded roads, the article says. Proposition 2 allowed $82.1 million to be spent on eight park projects or land purchases.\n\nAn Oct. 23, 2011, pre-referendum Statesman news article about Proposition 1 notes that the proposed transportation projects were not evenly spread among the county\u2019s precincts. The bulk of the sought spending, the article says, would take place in the rapidly developing northeastern part of the county near the 5-year-old Texas 130 tollway. But the story did not speak to how much of the overall proposed bonds would support projects in Precinct 1.\n\nOn that front, Davis\u2019 campaign sent us a spreadsheet detailing the bond proceeds that will be spent in Precinct 1: $90.4 million, which the spreadsheet accurately says is 42 percent of the bond money approved by voters in 2011.\n\nSpecifically, Davis\u2019 spreadsheet has 19 entries. The first 13 are separate Precinct 1 road projects, including more than $12 million to widen part of Blake-Manor Road from two to four lanes and add bike lanes and sidewalks, as well as about $300,000 to add sidewalks to part of Hunters Bend Road. The 13 road projects account for more than $70 million of Davis\u2019 cited $90.4 million.\n\nThe next two entries in the Davis campaign\u2019s spreadsheet are estimates \u2014 done by Steven Manilla, head of the county\u2019s Transportation and Natural Resources Department \u2014 of how much Precinct 1 will get from about $5 million in bond money that was approved for road repairs and bike safety projects countywide. Manilla estimated that Precinct 1 will get about $3.4 million of that money.\n\nThe final four spreadsheet entries are estimates, also from Manilla, of Precinct 1\u2019s share of Proposition 2 bond money, including $10 million to buy land for parks along creeks and rivers and $1.3 million for improvements at East Metro and Webberville parks.\n\nWe spotted a couple of wrinkles in the campaign\u2019s breakdown.\n\nFirst, we noticed that the Davis campaign lowballed the cost of each of the 13 road projects by using figures not taking into account money included in the bond propositions to cover inflation costs and expenses associated with issuing bonds \u2014 meaning Davis\u2019 analysis undercounts the share of the total bond money going to Precinct 1. So, we adjusted the figures in the spreadsheet, which lifted the Precinct 1 share to about 45 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the biggest single expenditure on Davis\u2019 breakdown, more than $15 million to widen a section of Cameron Road and add bike lanes and sidewalks, reflects spending in neighboring Precinct 2 as well as Precinct 1. Manilla told us in an interview that\u2019s because that part of Cameron Road, on the western side of Texas 130, is the boundary between the two precincts.\n\nRemoving half of the funding for the Cameron Road project drops the Precinct 1 share a little, to 41 percent \u2014 still in line with the \"over 40 percent\" that Davis cites.\n\nPrecinct 1\u2019s share of the bond money is larger than that of the other precincts, Manilla told us. He said Precinct 3, which covers most of the western portion of the county, came in second, with 25 percent of the bond money.\n\nSo, Davis\u2019 cited percentage holds.\n\nHowever, we did not find independent indicators to support, or disprove, his contention that the share of bond money flowing to Precinct 1 reflects his quickness to identify desires.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Davis described himself as a strong advocate who begins thinking well in advance about what projects should be in an upcoming bond package and communicating with county staff members about problems such as traffic congestion and how they can be addressed. He identifies what his precinct needs, he said, by listening to residents and assessing what infrastructure projects are necessary to accommodate the development happening in that part of the county.\n\nDavis also said his quick work to ready projects for the bond package means that when a project in another part of the county falls through, he has something ready to go to fill the opening. \"If you snooze, you lose,\" he said.\n\nWe asked Davis whether there was a way to document his quick identification of projects for his district and how it has influenced which projects ended up in the 2011 bond package. He said the results of his work are reflected in \"what\u2019s on the ballot.\" He also said much of his cited work to ready projects came in responding to and meeting with constituents, which he said he didn\u2019t document.\n\nManilla, who similarly said Davis reacts quickly to constituent complaints, told us by phone that he did not have a way to document the commissioner\u2019s quickness to identify potential bond-election items.\n\nAccording to Manilla and county documents, items made it onto the 2011 bond election ballot through a process involving more than the commissioners and county judge.\n\nAfter the Commissioners Court signed off in December 2010 on preparing for the 2011 bond vote, county staff put together a list of 120 possible bond projects with a total price tag of $638 million. A citizens bond advisory committee then shortened the list, which commissioners tweaked before unanimously voting to put the propositions before voters.\n\nManilla noted a couple of ways that commissioners can influence the makeup of a bond package, pointing out that commissioners communicate with county staff members about what projects are needed in their precincts. He also said commissioners can influence the work of the citizens bond committee through their appointees; each commissioner and the county judge, who leads the Commissioners Court and is elected countywide, selects three people to serve on the committee.\n\nAnd, of course, commissioners ultimately vote to put the projects before voters and can make changes to the final list. At their Aug. 9, 2011, meeting, the commissioners made a few revisions, including adding a Precinct 1 road project \u2014 the widening of Taylor Lane. Davis was the commissioner who moved to have the project added.\n\nWe asked County Judge Sam Biscoe to address Davis\u2019 claim that his quick identification of projects caused Precinct 1 to land its share of bond-backed items. Biscoe declined. Broadly, Biscoe earlier told us that each commissioner merits some credit for the bond proposals affecting their districts, but not all of it. \"I have no reason to think (Davis) didn\u2019t do his part,\" Biscoe said. \"But I do know there were many other contributors.\" He pointed to the work done by the county staff, the other commissioners, himself and the citizens committee.\n\nBiscoe also agreed that the heavy amount of development taking place in the northeastern part of Travis County is a reason more bond money is being spent on infrastructure projects there. Historically, Biscoe said, there wasn\u2019t much development in the area so there was no need for the projects. Now, there\u2019s a lot of development, he said, \"so we are trying to catch up.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe numerical part of Davis\u2019 two-part claim \u2014 that more than 40 percent of the 2011 bond money will be spent in Precinct 1 \u2014 holds up. But the determining impact of Davis\u2019 quickness is unproved. It\u2019s our sense that several factors, perhaps including the commissioner\u2019s alacrity, affected which items landed on the ballot.\n\nWe rate his claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11056"}
