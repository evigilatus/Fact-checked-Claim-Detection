(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We've also seen plenty posts suggesting that boiling orange peels or lemon peels\u00a0with sea salt and inhaling that steam is a treatment.\nThe World Health Organization has a page on false COVID-19 \"cures,\" which lists lemon and turmeric as unproven cures for COVID-19. In that same vein, there is no evidence that oranges, another citrus, or cayenne, another spice, can cure COVID-19.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMucus is actually the body\u2019s first defense against virus microbes that could enter airways, and blowing it out may not be the best way to protect yourself against COVID-19. A study published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe found that the \"mucus layer... can prevent pathogen invasion and subsequent infection.\"\nCurrently, there is no specific treatment for people with COVID-19. Cough medicine, pain relievers, rest and fluids are all recommended because they alleviate the typical symptoms of COVID-19: cough, shortness of breath and fever.\nSo clearing out your sinuses will definitely not make you less likely to catch COVID-19 or cure you if you are sick, and there\u2019s no evidence that orange peels, lemon peels\u00a0or cayenne contain any healing properties, either.
