(Democrat government) J.P. Bretzker recently proposed a series of prices which he says will generate billions of new revenues while raising taxes only on the richest 3 per cent of Illinois, who report income of more than $250,000. However, before legislators can consider his proposal, they must first add a question to the 2020 ballot in which they ask voters to replace the language in the State Constitution, which imposes a fixed income tax. While Democrats control legislative power, the approval of any referendum to change the Constitution requires an exceptional majority of votes, and therefore the approval of the question of the Bretzker ballot is absolutely uncertain. At the same time, interest groups representing both sides in the debate are busy trying to influence public opinion. We recently assessed a false claim by a business-related group opposing the Bretzker Plan, which says it contains a \"permanent employment tax on middle-class families.\" Now, think Big Illinois, a group supported by Bretzker, with an announcement paid for a graduation tax that makes it a private puzzling assertion. \"In almost every state with income tax, the wealthy pay a higher rate of taxes than the middle class,\" says the novelist in the ad, and also highlights states with progressive income taxes under the banner \"Statistics with a fair-income system.\" In fact, only one of nine states currently imposes an income tax at a fixed rate, while another 32 impose taxes under a series of graduation rates, and a handful of states do not tax income. The Pritzker proposal, if approved as it is, will indeed impose higher rates on the rich only. However, this is not necessarily the case with graduating tax systems in other states. \"Fair tax versus progressive tax,\" just as Bretzker's graduated tax liabilities described it as a \"job tax,\" Britzker and his supporters described it as a \"fair tax,\" in the text of the Big Illinois Declaration and in the conversation. Through \"Adel,\" Bretzker camp means a tax system that imposes higher rates on higher income levels. \"I have said from the outset that it would not make sense to pay the same rate as the teacher or the first responder,\" said Britzker, a billionaire more than three times, in a recent press statement on the language proposed for his constitutional amendment. But simply because the State applies different rates to different amounts of income does not mean only the highest rates of rich wages. In the neighbouring State of Missouri, for example, the highest State rate of 5.4 per cent is imposed on all revenues in excess of $8,424, according to the tax institution, which collects government tax rates and square brackets annually. The first $3,000 paid by single broadcasters is the highest rate in Alabama. Eight other states have also begun to impose their highest rates on income below $25,000, as shown in the chart of the tax institution. This is far from what anyone would consider to be \"awesome.\" So we asked \"Think Big Illinois\" what their announcement means when he said \"almost every state\" with an income tax that applied higher rates to the rich, since nine states tax the same tax on everyone and a total of 10 other states that apply the highest rates to everyone except the poorest. Facebook was published on February 1, 2021 in Social Media in the Tax Act 2017, \"taxes on people receiving less than $75,000 will be raised in 2021 and every two years thereafter until 2027.\" Lara Sicilman, Director of Communications in the group, wrote: \"Almost every state with an income tax employs a graduated tax system such as a fair tax that imposes higher taxes on higher income earners.\" Illinois is only one of nine states with an income tax, but everyone is taxed at the same rate. The imposition of taxes on the \"medium class\" with almost half of the countries that tax income does not impose higher prices on the rich, clearly the demand for advertising is off-the-shelf. But that also made us wonder how to compare other countries that graduated from taxes when it comes to taxes on the middle class. There is no universally accepted definition of \"medium class,\" but a reasonable measure is provided by the United States Census, which sets out the average income of households, families and single-person homes per state. Compared to these federal extension centres and the tax institution chart, we found 14 states where it is clear that people who earn the average income of any kind of household will not pay the highest State price for any dollar they make. Even the fourth highest rate in California for single registrars applies only to income exceeding, for example, $286,492. In New York, only the second highest rate in the state is subject to income of more than $215,400 for single providers and $323,200 for married couples, while its highest rate is reserved for amounts exceeding $1 million. However, there are eight other states where the highest rate begins not far from average income or at the level of many academic definitions of the \"medium class\" that seem to still include. For example, the average income included in the census for the group of people who are close to the only filers in Arkansas is just over $25,000, while the highest tax rate in the state begins after the first $37,200 earned by the taxpayer. Then there is Louisiana, where the average family income is just over $60,000, while the higher tax rate on the spouses applies only after the first $100,000 they receive. However, it will be difficult to say that all taxpayers who pay the highest rates of income in those states are necessarily rich, especially depending on the size of the family. In our judgement, we believe that the Grand Illinois Declaration claims that \"in almost every state with income tax, the rich pay a higher tax rate than the middle class.\" A speaker on behalf of the Bretzker Support Group noted that Illinois was only one of nine states that taxed income at a constant rate. The images that accompany the advertising hint in this, but the narrative ignores any difference. Even with the most conservative definition, 19 states impose income taxes that do not apply higher rates to the income of the wealthy - nine fixed tax states and 10 states tax graduates at higher rates than the income of less than $25,000. Add in eight more states where the highest rates for married couples start somewhere between $31,000 and $104,000 and demand for big thinking becomes more suspicious. This means that far from \"all\" of the State's income tax, a higher percentage of the highest income holders, wins this claim. In fact, this statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.
