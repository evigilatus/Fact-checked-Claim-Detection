Let\u2019s see, the unemployment rate is up and credit is tight, but does the city have too much housing?\n\nTo the Truth-O-Meter!\n\nAdrean said the statement is based on conversations she\u2019s had with friends in the real estate\nbusiness and articles she\u2019s read in the local media, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nShe said she meant that the demand for office as well as residential properties was lower than the inventory.\n\n\"I would love to be wrong,\" Adrean told PolitiFact.\n\nBill Adams, president of Adams Realtors, said there are a few specific examples of an oversaturated market within the city. A few neighborhoods in the city, such as Vine City, have been\nhit hard by foreclosures and as a result have a glut of housing. Likewise, the Buckhead\ncondominium market is clearly overbuilt.\n\nBut he said that\u2019s not what\u2019s holding back the broader real estate market.\n\n\"We\u2019re not like a suburban county that had vast acres of housing built,\" Adams said. \"I think\nmostly it\u2019s a result of buyers sitting on the sidelines.\"\n\nPotential home buyers, many of whom are worried about job security, don\u2019t want to take on\nadditional debt and instead are waiting until the economy stabilizes, he said. Banks, in some cases, have made it tougher to borrow money. All of it creates a critical mass that spells trouble for the Atlanta housing market.\n\nHousing sales data collected by Adams show the average sale price for some neighborhoods, such as Inman Park, an upscale neighborhood of tree-lined sidewalks and expensive Victorian housing, are higher than last year. But prices continue to decline in other areas.\n\nAnd last year there was a greater incentive to buy because many people were trying to take advantage of the federal housing tax credit before it expired.\n\nSmartNumbers analyst Steve Palm said the city does have an overabundance of depressed\nhousing.\n\nThe city currently has 6,000 houses for sale under $50,000, Palm said. And in the last year and a half 24,760 houses sold for less than $50,000.\n\n\"We have a lot of vacant homes,\" he said.\n\nEven so, Palm said the city does not have too many houses on the market.\n\n\"Our inventory is way down,\" he said.\n\nSome economists speculate that a lot of people are keeping their properties off the market unless they absolutely have to sell them. That also lowers inventory.\n\nThe current housing inventory is about 40 percent lower than 2007 levels, Palm said.\n\nIf the number of closings for the metro area -- precise numbers for the city proper are hard to come by -- remained stable and there were no additional houses added to the market, it would take 8.7 months to sell off all the houses in the metro area, he said At the peak of the housing boom it would have taken about 14 months to sell off all available housing in the metro area.\n\nThis is partly the result of a slowdown in new housing construction, he said. New construction is down 90 percent from the peak years.\n\nBill Murray, the managing broker with Prudential Georgia Realty, agrees there is little new housing\nand points out that the population of Atlanta is growing, albeit slowly. Census numbers for the city are disputed, but it\u2019s generally agreed the city\u2019s population has increased over the past 10 years.\n\nThis would suggest the city\u2019s problem is not an oversupply of housing.\n\nBut Murray said an explosion of foreclosures has helped create an inventory larger than demand.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market, he said, so in that sense Adrean has a good point.\n\nThis was a tough one for the old Truth-O-Meter. Adrean\u2019s statement does not apply to some\npopular intown neighborhoods and new housing starts are few and far between even as the city\u2019s\npopulation continues to inch up, but demand is still low.\n\nThe councilwoman is not wrong, but she\u2019s not totally right either.\n\nHer statement is accurate but leaves out important details. That\u2019s our definition of Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarney Simms\n\n\nstated on June 29, 2010 in a letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Have the suburbs been inundated with former residents of Atlanta housing projects?
