Surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders.\n\n\nA cloth face covering \"is not intended to protect the wearer, but it may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important if someone is infected, but does not have symptoms.\"\n\n\nCloth face coverings should not be placed on children younger than 2 years of age, \"anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cover without assistance.\"\n\n\nThe homemade masks that are best\nThe most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and make a tight seal around the wearer\u2019s face.\n\"Given the current crisis, and lacking an alternative, many layers of densely woven fabric would be the most effective, because it allows for lots of voids in the layers where particles can be trapped,\" Richard Peltier, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, previously told PolitiFact. \"The mask needs to seal as tightly as possible to the face to avoid leaks, though this may not be possible with different designs, fabrics, or face shapes. Thin or porous fabrics are the least likely to be effective.\"\nCloth masks, he added, \"should be treated as contaminated materials that you bring in to your home \u2014 they need to be laundered in hot soapy water, and you\u2019d need to consider sanitizing in bleach or hydrogen peroxide regularly.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post reflects outdated information in claiming that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.\nThat was the CDC\u2019s advice \u2014 until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.\nWe rate the post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18231"}
