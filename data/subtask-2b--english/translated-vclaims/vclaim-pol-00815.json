The candidate, Russell Forth, wrote an op-ed article on a conservative website to defend Wheaton College, his Christian Alma Mayer, and Saunders haired some of his language that was Islamophobia. During the entire exchange, though, Sanders did not say, \"Christian is an insult to Muslims,\" as claimed by social media and conservative sites. A quote was recently published on Facebook and a picture of Saunders with a turban painted on his head and a text that says: \"Bernie Sanders says that Christianity is an insult to Muslims. \"I'm saying that Benny Sanders is from troubled America.\" This article, in which more than 5,700 people participated, was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The fake quote has been on the Internet since June 7, 2017, nomination hearing, when Sanders questioned his article on Resorgent, a website that describes himself on his Facebook page as \"The House of Returning online Conservatives Committed to Revival Freedom, Faith and Family.\" In January 2016, the Virth article focused on the decision of Wheaton College to expel a professor who, as he said, had expressed, \"disputing comments seeking solidarity with Muslims and her arguments that Christians \" associate with God himself.'\" She sought to defend the College's decision, and wrote: \"Muslims simply do not have an incomplete theology. They didn't know God, because they rejected Jesus Christ his son, and condemned him. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u25cf On January 16, 2012, Sanders objected to this during the hearing (about 30:44) and asked him whether he believed that the statement was hateful of Islam. \"Sure not,\" Forth answered. He was a Christian and believed in a set of Christian principles. The two went back and forth, and at one point Sanders said: \"In my view, the statement made by Mr. Voight is indefensible, obnoxious and hateful of Islam, an affront to more than a billion Muslims worldwide.\" The discussion ended in deadlock, and Sanders said he would vote no. (What he did, but with 49-49, Vice President Mike Pines pushed the vote to break the Vopet tie through.) Various media reported on this exchange, and some condemned Sanders &apos; comments as a religious test for public office, which is prohibited by the Constitution of the United States (art. VI). But eventually, Sanders' words became twisted to indicate that he was referring to Christianity as a whole, when he was speaking specifically about Fawitt's words. Although some might interpret Sanders' words as an attack on the entire religion, he did not say, \"Christianism is an insult to Muslims.\" We're assessing this statement wrong.
