And the reason why \u2014 lack of Internet access \u2014 is a point of a contention between President Barack Obama and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.\nObama on Wednesday, Dec. 17 announced sweeping changes to the United States\u2019 decades-old isolation policy against Cuba, promising renewed diplomatic relations and an easing of regulations on commerce. Obama said the drastic shift in approach to the Communist-controlled island would help bolster the Cuban people, who he said have suffered from America\u2019s cold shoulder.\n\"I believe in the free flow of information,\" Obama said. \"Unfortunately, our sanctions on Cuba have denied Cubans access to technology that has empowered individuals around the globe.\"\nRubio, a Florida Republican and a Cuban American, chastised Obama\u2019s comments in an animated rebuttal.\n\"The president said that the people of Cuba do not have access to advanced, 21st century modern technology for communications and telecommunications because of the U.S. embargo. That is false,\" Rubio said. \"The reason why they don't have access to 21st century telecommunications \u2014 like smart phones, like access to the Internet \u2014 is because it is illegal in Cuba.\"\nObama\u2019s statement wasn\u2019t as full-throated as Rubio made it sound. And some of what Obama suggested is true, experts told us.\nThat said, Rubio has the better part of the argument that Cuba\u2019s restrictive policies loom large over the debate.\nCuba\u2019s restrictions\nCuba has\u00a0less access to the Internet than most countries in the world. It is the only country in the Western Hemisphere with an Internet access rating of \"not free\" by Freedom House, a human rights advocacy group.\nCiting the National Statistics Office in Cuba, Freedom House said about 23 percent of Cubans have access to the Internet. But those numbers, while very low, are likely inflated: Many of those people have access only to a tightly controlled Cuban intranet that includes email and government-approved sites. Outside experts, Freedom House said, estimate only about 5 percent of people have access to the full World Wide Web.\nThe government of Cuba maintains almost complete control over telecommunications industries in the country, and it uses a mix of repressive policies and price gouging to keep Cubans offline. Regulations essentially prohibit private Internet use in homes and it is illegal\u00a0to access the Internet outside government-controlled methods. On top of that, the cost of even a basic computer is more than twice the average Cuban\u2019s annual salary.\nCubans who log on to the Internet do so via public, government-run access points. There, patrons deal with some of the slowest speeds in the world. And rates set by the government make it difficult for the average worker on a $20 weekly salary to consistently log on. Checking email costs $1.50 an hour. Access to the national intranet is $0.60 per hour, and international websites are $4.50 per hour, Freedom House said.\nBloggers and dissenters are quickly shut down and, in many cases, imprisoned. Alan Gross, the imprisoned American contractor released by Cuba this week, was arrested for building telecommunications infrastructure on the island.\nAs for smartphones, most mobile phones can send messages, even internationally, but cannot access the Internet. GPS and satellite capabilities are prohibited. An iPhone, if procured, would be a pretty dumb phone in Cuba.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCuban officials have recently indicated a potential shift in policy that could open the Internet to personal and mobile usage, but it\u2019s also possible it will be limited to Cuba\u2019s intranet and email.\nSuch promises have been made before. Cuba installed a 1,600 kilometer fiber-optic cable between the island and Venezuela in 2011 with financial help from China (a project completed despite the U.S. embargo, it should be noted). It was supposed to increase speeds and access for Cubans. Actual advances have been modest.\nAnd it\u2019s not as though the United States is the only country capable of supplying Cuba with telecommunications technology in today\u2019s global economy. The regime has prioritized preventing political dissent over technological advancement. There\u2019s no guarantee that will change if U.S. policy does.\nThis is why Rubio is right in saying that the U.S. embargo is far from the only factor affecting access. Sure, Cuba is poor and has bad infrastructure, but there are poorer countries with better Internet access, said Larry Press, an information systems professor at California State University Dominguez Hills who writes a blog on Internet access in Cuba. When infrastructure improved in Cuba, access largely did not.\n\"I think Rubio is closer to the truth than Obama,\" Press said. \"Both have a degree of truth, but the Cuban government's fear of the Internet was a bigger hindrance than the embargo.\"\nThe embargo effect\nRubio was not quite right, however, when he said that Obama\u2019s comment was unequivocally false.\nObama said that U.S. sanctions on Cuba \"have denied Cubans access to technology.\" This is true to a certain extent. Part of Cubans\u2019 access problem has to do with the exorbitant cost of technology, relative to how poor the country is, and lifting those restrictions could help that problem.\nIn 2009, Obama cracked the door open marginally for American telecommunications companies to operate in Cuba by allowing them to establish connectivity between Cuba and the United States, and letting satellite radio and television companies serve Cuban customers. Additionally, people could donate (but not sell) telecommunication devices like computers and phones to Cubans.\nThe changes announced Dec. 17 further opened up the ability for U.S. companies to build telecommunications infrastructure in Cuba and it allows for the commercial sale of communication devices and software.\nMatt Borman, deputy assistant secretary of export administration, told PolitiFact that if American companies were able to compete with other foreign telecommunications suppliers in Cuba, there is an expectation that it would pressure the government to create more viable infrastructure. That could spur more Internet freedom. In a report published in 2010, the Brookings Institution\u00a0made a similar argument.\nA of couple experts told us that Obama\u2019s side carries weight because Castro has made an effort in recent years to ease some restrictions, such as lifting the ban on personal computers. (It may be hard to believe, but internet access in Cuba used to be even worse.) So the United States\u2019 sanctions prevent Cubans from acquiring technology that is now legal, said Julia Sweig, an expert on Cuba and Latin America at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nOur ruling\nRubio said that rather than the U.S. embargo, the reason why Cubans \"don't have access to 21st century telecommunications \u2014 like smart phones, like access to the Internet \u2014 is because it is illegal in Cuba.\"\n\"Illegal\" is probably the wrong word. There are some ways to legally access the Internet in Cuba, but not in one's home, or on mobile devices, and not by connecting to the full World Wide Web. Internet use is\u00a0primarily restricted to\u00a0government-run access points that are heavily monitored. The usage rates, set by the regime, are so expensive that it is cost prohibitive for most Cubans to log on. Political dissenters are barred from publishing online and are punished if they do.\u00a0The end result is similar to full prohibition:\u00a0Cuba has one of the lowest rates of Internet access in the world.\nThe U.S. sanctions have played a role in limited availability of technology. However, Rubio is right that the Cuban government has nearly complete control over the Internet. That isn\u2019t a result of sanctions on telecommunication business activity in Cuba.\u00a0Even if the United States fully repeals its embargo, government control over Internet access could continue.\nWe rate Rubio\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06898"}
