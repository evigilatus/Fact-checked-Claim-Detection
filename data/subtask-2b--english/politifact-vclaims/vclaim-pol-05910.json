And a lot of those people are not from Honduras and Mexico. They\u2019re from Iraq and Somalia and Russia. And many of them are hardened criminals. And it seems like our federal government is actually fighting against the sheriffs and the people who are down there.\"\nTwo days later, Martha Raddatz of ABC News asked Carson if he had evidence that many were hardened criminals from those countries.\nCarson, a GOP presidential candidate from West Palm Beach, Fla., replied: \"Well, I talked to a number of the sheriffs on the borders and they've told me what kind of people are coming over. So I'm not sure that I would trust, quite frankly, any figures coming from the government, given the fact that they are the ones who are problematic.\"\nWe decided to check whether \"a lot\" of illegal immigrants who are released are from Iraq, Somalia and Russia. We couldn\u2019t find comprehensive data on the citizenship of those who are released, but within the universe of those who are apprehended, only a tiny speck are from the countries cited by Carson.\nPinal County, Arizona\nCarson\u00a0campaign spokesman Doug Watts told us to call Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu in Arizona.\nCarson met with Babeu when he visited the Arizona-Mexico border in August. Babeu blasted the federal government for releasing three criminal illegal immigrants this summer who were from Iraq, Russia and Sudan (not Somalia, as Carson said).\nThat included Dennis Valerievitch Tsoukanov of Russia, who set a police informant on fire; Musa Salah Abdelaziz Abdalla of Sudan, who had been convicted of assault; and Nasser Hanna Hermez of Iraq, who had been convicted of negligent homicide in the death of his infant daughter. In all three cases, after they had finished any term of incarceration, they were turned over to ICE, which then later released the men.\nICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea told PolitiFact that \"ICE under current law can no longer legally hold the three individuals.\"\nHermez is a legal permanent resident whose conviction does not make him eligible for deportation. The other two were foreign nationals who were released based on the Supreme Court decision in Zadvydas vs. Davis. That ruling prevents ICE from indefinitely holding individuals if it\u2019s unlikely that ICE can actually deport them. These two men were ordered to report regularly to an ICE officer.\nTim Gaffney, director of administration for the Pinal County Sheriff's Office, told PolitiFact that law enforcement had seen an increase in a group referred to as \"special interest aliens\" who are from 35 countries with terrorist ties, including Iraq and Somalia.\nGaffney sent PolitiFact an excerpt from a report produced by the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center and other agencies which stated that during the first 10 months of fiscal year 2014, Border Patrol apprehended 402 \"special interest aliens\" with more than half of them from Bangladesh. The three countries cited by Carson, however, were not included in the excerpt. (Gaffney said he couldn\u2019t provide the whole report because it is \"law-enforcement sensitive.\")\nWe also found news articles that cited examples of illegal immigrants with ties to terrorist groups who had been caught along the border. But none of the articles we saw backed up Carson\u2019s argument that any significant number of illegal immigrants were from Iraq, Somalia and Russia.\nThe most we could find were articles like one from February, in which the Houston Chronicle posted a report from the Texas Department of Public Safety that stated that it had come in contact with special interest aliens including from Somalia with terrorist ties. There were additional news articles about two different Somali men with terrorist ties accused of smuggling Somalis into the United States.\nBut none of these reports suggest that there are \"a lot\" of people from those nations.\nIllegal immigrants apprehended or removed\nWe also looked at broader data from federal officials to gauge the frequency of aliens from the countries Carson cited.\nThe most comprehensive data comes from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics. That data shows that for 2013 there were 662,483 aliens apprehended, including 169 from Iraq, 320 from Russia and 214 from Somalia. So, combined, the illegal immigrants from these countries add up to less than 1 percent of the total.\nThe largest groups of illegal immigrants were from Mexico (424,978), Guatemala (73,208) and Honduras (64,157).\nWe obtained more current data from the U.S. Border Patrol which showed the number of apprehensions by citizenship for 1.2 million deportable aliens between fiscal year 2013 and August 2015.

The most common reason for the releases was due to a court order.\nHowever, data on country of origin for illegal immigrants who were released was not immediately available from ICE.\nWe did find some efforts to fill in the blanks. Jeremy Redmon of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution documented cases in which the person\u2019s country of origin refused to take them, which led to their release. The Journal-Constitution created a map to show 9,000 incidents of such illegal immigrants\u00a0in cases between January 2012 and June 2014. He obtained the data through the federal Freedom of Information Act.\nThe countries that had the highest numbers of those released because their country wouldn\u2019t take them were Cuba (2,348), Vietnam (779), Laos (465), Honduras (450), El Salvador (419), Mexico (346) and Guatemala (336).\nBy contrast, 47 detainees were released from Russia, 153 from Somalia and 136 from Iraq.\nOf course, this is only one subset of illegal immigrants who were released; however, it is one more piece of evidence that shows certain Latin American countries have higher numbers of illegal immigrants caught here than most other nations.\nJessica M. Vaughan, an expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said she has examined unpublished Border Patrol data on the citizenship of those apprehended and \"noted that there are some individuals from Middle Eastern countries apprehended each year at the land border, although not a large number.\"\nOur ruling\nCarson says that when ICE releases illegal immigrants \"a lot of those people are not from Honduras and Mexico. They\u2019re from Iraq and Somalia and Russia.\"\nCarson pointed to information from just one sheriff in Arizona, and even here he garbled the information -- the sheriff criticized the federal government for releasing three criminal illegal immigrants from Iraq, Russia and Sudan, not Somalia.\nWhen we looked at the broad sweep of data, we saw nothing to indicate that the three countries Carson cited account for a significant share of illegal immigrants.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05910"}
