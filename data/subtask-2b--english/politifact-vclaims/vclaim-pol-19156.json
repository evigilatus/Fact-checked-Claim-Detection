Roger Landry, attach\u00e9 for the Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See to the United Nations.\u00a0\nNo credible news organization has reported anything along these lines about the pope.\u00a0\nThe Conservative Beaver article was published Jan. 10, and said the pope had been arrested the night before.
