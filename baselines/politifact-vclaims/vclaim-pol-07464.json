David Cicilline, is concerned about the cost of education.\nDuring a debate with his GOP challenger, Stan Tran, on the WPRI Newsmakers program that aired Aug. 3, Lynch complained that college tuition and fees have gone through the roof over the past 36 years.\n\"College education has gone up 1,200 percent since 1978,\" he said. \"This isn't your parents' college education. Students -- young students -- are issuing outrageous amounts of debt to go to college and get a degree, and the only thing the schools are guaranteeing them after that is a bill.\"\nLynch said the injection of federal money is one of the reasons the costs have gone up so much. \"Education costs should not increase more than the rate of inflation.\" \u00a0Critics have long argued that escalating government loan problems have pushed college costs higher and higher.\nA 1,200 percent increase means the cost of education is 13 times higher than in 1978.\nThat sounded high to us, so we thought we'd check his statistic.\nLynch said he based the number on an April 23, 2013 article on the business website fastcoexist.com, where it says -- in a story and in a graphic -- that since 1979, public and private college costs have increased 1,120 percent. It's based on a report by Bloomberg and Business Week.\nLynch then added 33 percent a year for 2013 and 2014 and rounded it up to 1,200 percent.\nWe confirmed the trend -- and got more up-to-date numbers -- by going to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It shows a 1,172 percent increase from July 1978 to June 2014, which rounds up to the amount cited by Lynch.\nLynch's problem: His statement doesn\u2019t account for inflation, which increased the cost of things we buy -- from a dozen eggs to a college education -- by 265 percent from 1979 to 2012.\nWe confirmed the numbers by turning to data from National Center for Education Statistics, which looks at costs a bit differently using dollar amounts from the schools as far back as the 1963-64 school year. The latest statistics cover the 2012-13 school year and look at costs with and without inflation.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.

Then the average bill for the 2012-13 school year ($10,683) would be 194 percent higher, not 1,200 percent.\nThe inflation-adjusted increases were 147 percent for private or nonprofit four-year colleges and universities, 234 percent for public four-year institutions and 147 percent for public two-year colleges.\nPoint of interest: At URI, tuition and fees for in-state students totaled $924 for the 1977-78 school year. The total for 2012-13 was $12,450, an increase of 277 percent if you adjust for inflation and 1,247 percent if you don't.\nOur ruling\nCormick Lynch said the cost of \"college education has gone up 1,200 percent since 1978.\"\nHe should have made it clear that he wasn't adjusting for inflation.\nHis statement is only close to true if the median household income had remained at $15,000 per year (according to the U.S. Census Bureau) and a loaf of bread was still 54 cents (as it was in 1978, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics).\nIf you adjust those tuition numbers for the rising cost of living, Lynch's percentage is six times too high.\nThe statement is accurate in the sense that college cost have increased many times faster than the cost of other things we buy. But it fails to account for inflation -- an important omission -- that would put the comparison in context.\nWe rate it Half True.\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email\u00a0protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07464"}
