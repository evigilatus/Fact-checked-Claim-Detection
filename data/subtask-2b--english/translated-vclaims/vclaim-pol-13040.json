After five days of the initial ballot, which gave Tofu 46 per cent and Chad about 33 per cent, Chad told journalists \"the margin between me and my opponent on election day was just over 4,000 votes... Several? In a four-person \"place 3\" race, Chad tracked Tofu by 4,316 votes, After leaving a message with Camp Chad, we chased similar returnees over the 15 years referred to in the shadows of the shadows. In those years, according to the city &apos; s online database summarizing the results of the city &apos; s council elections, five of those who won second place in the general elections won their final pages: Beverly Griffith (1996); Bill Spellman and Willie Lewis (1997); Raoul Alvarez (2000); and Jennifer Kim (2005). However, only two filled a gap in the first round of over 4,000 votes. Splman beat Manuel Zuniga after 8,813 votes in their first race. Kim beat Margot Clarke after Clark got 7,771 votes in the general election. Other victors left about 1,100 to approximately 2,100 votes earlier. The Counsel for Austin Mark Littlefield, a Shadow Supporter, agreed that only the candidates recovered after having been delayed by more than 4,000 votes. He said that Spellman was the only Council that had been optimistic in the period when a deficit of more than 13.5 points was falling apart in this year &apos; s general election, even though Kim was behind 13 points in her first round. The spokesman for Chad Linda Reeve told us: \"The flesh part of the Chad Statement is a precedent for return.\" He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, Littlefield also noticed that three of the returning candidates received more votes in the second round than they faced the crowded fields in their general election -- despite low turnout. Kim &apos; s share of votes increased by 21 per cent, Splman &apos; s surface flow increased by 41 per cent and Griffith &apos; s improved by 71 per cent. Anything can happen in the Tofu Shad; we don't do predictions. However, according to recent history, Chad &apos; s claim has not been resolved. Two identical returns aren't equal to \"together.\" As a percentage of the votes cast, only one candidate in the past 15 years has compensated for a large deficit such as shadows. We evaluate her statement half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13040"}
