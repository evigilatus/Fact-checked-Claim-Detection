It\u2019s running in the battleground states of Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, and it hits both Hillary and Bill Clinton on their personal finances.\nThe ad, which PAC chairman and Florida Gov. Rick Scott unveiled on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, opens with a clip of Hillary Clinton saying that when she and Bill left the White House, they were dead broke (a claim we rated Mostly False). As the logo of the Clinton Foundation appears on the screen, the narration begins.\n\"A foundation was created, and money started to roll. Speeches, connections and donations. Misogynistic regimes, Wall Street insiders, corrupt dictators. They all had one thing in common: Their check cleared. The Clintons are now worth in excess of $100 million.\"\nAnyone watching the ad would get the sense that somehow through the Clinton Foundation, the Clintons amassed a net worth of over $100 million in about 15 years.\nThat\u2019s misleading, for a few reasons.\nLet\u2019s start with the $100 million-plus in net worth.\nWe reached out to the super PAC, through its website and with an email to one of the Republican strategists behind it, to get its sources and did not hear back. The ad itself points to something published in Fortune on Feb. 2, 2015. We couldn\u2019t find a matching article.\nWe did find a later article from September 2015 in Fortune that estimated Hillary Clinton\u2019s net worth at about $30 million.\nIn October 2015, Forbes wrote, \"After layering years of disclosures on top of annual tax returns, Forbes estimates their combined net worth at $45 million.\"\nThe most current estimate comes from Hillary Clinton\u2019s federal financial disclosure filing, something she had to provide as a presidential candidate. That form states explicitly that the assets of both the candidate and his or her spouse must be included.\nThe values are reported in ranges. On the low end, the Clintons reported assets of $11.3 million. On the high end, they might have as much as $52.7 million. The couple listed no liabilities.\nKathleen Clark, a specialist in government ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the only significant item those forms don\u2019t include is real estate.\n\"You don\u2019t need to report the value of the home you live in,\" Clark said. \"And that goes for a second home, too. So long as you don\u2019t rent it out for income.\"\nThe Clinton\u2019s own two homes, one in New York and one in Washington, D.C. Together they are worth about $9 million.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we add it up, the highest amount we could find is about $62 million.\nThe Clintons have done very well. Between multi-million dollar book contracts and speaking fees of $225,000 or more, they have earned an estimated $230 million in the 15 years since they left the White House.\nBut income is not wealth. As high as those earnings are, that still doesn\u2019t bring them close to the $100 million mark, much less take them beyond it.\nWe found several articles that said Bill Clinton has a net worth of $80 million, but none said how they got that number. By law, his assets must also be disclosed on his wife\u2019s federal filing.\nThe ad\u2019s claim about the role of the Clinton Foundation is suggestive but unclear. The foundation has grown rapidly, raising over $2 billion to fight AIDS, reduce hunger and poverty, and rein in climate change. It has received millions from several Middle Eastern kingdoms, mega-wealthy businessmen and major corporations.\nThe ad doesn\u2019t say how that money translates into cash for the Clintons.\nIn point of fact, according to the foundation\u2019s tax filings and its website, none of the Clintons are paid by the foundation.\nOur ruling\nThe super PAC Rebuilding America Now, a pro-Trump entity, said that the Clintons built a net worth of over $100 million after creating the Clinton Foundation.\nWhile some unsourced articles have used that number, official documents and the assessments of other, more rigorous reports show a net worth between $11 million and about $53 million.\u00a0Even after accounting for the value of their two homes, the highest figure we found was $62 million.\nThere is no evidence that money given to the Clinton Foundation has made its way into the Clintons\u2019 pockets.\u00a0The Clintons have become wealthy since its creation,\u00a0but the ad hints darkly at shady dealings without\u00a0proof.\nThe statement twists a grain of truth to paint a misleading picture.\u00a0We rate this statement Mostly False.\nEditor's note:\u00a0After we published, the Super PAC Rebuildng America Now sent us their supporting material on wealthy donors to the Clinton Foundation, speaking fees, and a corrected link to an article citing the Clintons' net worth. That article stated the amount as an estimate without any source provided.\nThe fact-check and rating remain unchanged.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9b3c130e-a1a9-4ec6-b341-3af704b071d7", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04516"}
