Rick Perry as beholden to special interests", "text": "U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, seeking the Republican nomination for governor, unleashed a TV commercial Feb. 4 casting Gov. Rick Perry as beholden to special interests and lobbyists, including two who served as his top gubernatorial assistants.\n\nThe ad flashes what look like seven ominous newspaper headlines about Perry before a narrator says: \"There are two ways to get things done in Austin. Hire a lobbyist and donate to this governor. Or elect a new one.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe wondered if Hutchison\u2019s \"New One\" ad accurately reflected original headlines and news stories. (For this Truth-O-Meter item, we are focusing on Hutchison's use of the headlines \u2014 a common campaign technique. We are not assessing the accuracy of those articles or her overall Perry critique.)\n\nHutchison spokesman Joe Pounder initially said every headline in the ad matched original published headlines. He later said the ad presents \"pull quotes,\" meaning excerpts from articles and not necessarily the original headlines.\n\nUsing Nexis, an electronic news retrieval service, we found that four of the quotations presented in Hutchison\u2019s ad were identical to published headlines on news stories. Hutchison\u2019s campaign showed that a fifth also was correct. The correctly quoted headlines are: \"Perry to Name Lobbyist As New Chief of Staff;\" \"Lobbyists Revolving In, Out of Perry Staff Positions;\" \"Perry Shakes Down Special Interests, Lobbyists;\" \"Companies That Gave to Perry Got Road Contract;\" and \"Perry\u2019s Top Donors Get Business.\"\n\nWe noticed, though, that the headline about Perry shaking down special interests topped an editorial\u2014not a news story\u2014published in The Houston Chronicle about Perry in July 2000. At the time, Perry was lieutenant governor. He succeeded George W. Bush as governor in late 2000.\n\nThe Chronicle editorial questioned a Perry letter asking lobbyists to buy $1,000 tickets to an upcoming political fund-raiser. Perry, the newspaper opined, \"has just made it abundantly clear that he knows no bounds when it comes to shaking down special interests with business before the Texas Legislature.\"\n\nAccording to the editorial, Perry's letter asked lobbyists to specify how much money each of their corporate and group clients would be sending the lieutenant governor's way\u2014potentially fostering illegal corporate donations or encouraging lobbyists to see links between donations and state business, the newspaper said. \"With his latest fund-raising letter holding legislative lobbyists responsible for money contributed by their clients, Perry explicitly links campaign money to business before the Legislature,\" the editorial states.\n\nTwo of the headline-like quotations in Hutchison\u2019s ad were not previously published headlines on news articles: \"Perry\u2019s Former Chief of Staff is A Lobbyist for Merck\" and \"A Shroud of Secrecy Has Descended on the Governor\u2019s Office.\" (The published headlines for those articles: \"Reluctant governor yields on HPV shots; Calling a veto useless, Perry chides legislators for reversing his vaccination order\" and \"Perry refusal to release memo nothing new, He cites attorney-client privilege, this time in the execution controversy.\")\n\nWe confirmed, though, that the two quotations presented to look like headlines accurately reflected portions of the related news articles.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for campaign ads to present excerpts from newspaper stories as a stream of headlines. It\u2019s also not rare for a candidate to quote an editorial as news reportage, even though editorials are opinion pieces.\n\nStill, a voter could conclude that Hutchison\u2019s ad consists entirely of genuine clear-cut news headlines. That\u2019s not so.\n\nWe give her use of the headlines a rating of Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15334"}
