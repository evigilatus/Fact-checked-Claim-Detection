Bill Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) pointed to that statistic during a Feb. 23 debate against U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman at Passaic County Community College in Paterson. The two Democrats will face off on June 5 for their party\u2019s nomination to represent the newly redrawn 9th Congressional District.\n\nThe Pascrell campaign on March 3 posted video clips of the debate on the campaign\u2019s YouTube channel, including one in which the congressman discussed his commitment to helping small businesses.\n\n\"And what I am saying to you is that I have an obligation and a responsibility as a congressman to find ways to help small business,\" Pascrell told the crowd. \"Ninety percent of the people who work in this country work for companies under 100 people, maybe even less than that.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Pascrell\u2019s claim is way off, because such companies employed about 35 percent of U.S. workers in 2009, according to business statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThis is the second time in less than two months that we\u2019ve debunked one of Pascrell\u2019s statistics on small businesses. In February, we gave him a False for claiming 62 percent of small businesses closed during the past five years because of health care bills.\n\nLet's explain his latest misstatement about workers at companies with fewer than 100 employees.\n\nIn 2009, businesses with fewer than 100 employees employed 40,128,249 workers, according to the census bureau. That\u2019s about 35 percent of the 114,509,626 workers included in the census data.\n\nThose statistics exclude certain industries and most government employees, but are considered the \"standard reference source for small business statistics,\" according to the census bureau.\n\nPascrell campaign spokesman Sean Darcy acknowledged that the congressman \"misspoke\" and said he meant to say \"businesses with fewer than 500 employees represent 99.7 percent of all employer firms.\"\n\nThat statistic is accurate. According to the census bureau, of the 5,767,306 employer firms in 2009, 5,749,797 had fewer than 500 employees.\n\nThose businesses with fewer than 500 employees employed about half of the nation\u2019s workforce included in the census data.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get to our ruling, it\u2019s worth noting that the Pascrell campaign later made the video private on its YouTube channel. So, if you go looking for it now, it\u2019s not there.\n\nDarcy told us the video was originally marked public by mistake. He provided this explanation in an e-mail:\n\n\"We have a number of videos on that youtube channel marked private. We use it as a vehicle for the campaign to all view content without having to be in the same location. It is a common practice.\n\n\"We have a huge amount of public content on-line on our pascrell for congress facebook page and our pascrell web pages and have been using these sites as a vehicle to get the campaign's message out. Not sure how you came across the one video that was on there in error but, essentially, you found a staff mistake.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a Feb. 23 debate with Congressman Steve Rothman, Pascrell claimed: \"Ninety percent of the people who work in this country work for companies under 100 people, maybe even less than that.\"\n\nBut according to the U.S. Census Bureau, businesses with fewer than 100 employees employed about 35 percent of American workers in 2009. A spokesman for Pascrell acknowledged that the congressman misspoke.\n\nWe rate the statement False.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11411"}
