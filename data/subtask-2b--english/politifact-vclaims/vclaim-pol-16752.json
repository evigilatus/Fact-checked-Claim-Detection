Do you believe this?\" Trump asked.\u00a0\nTrump, who has made multiple inaccurate statements about noncitizens voting, then pivoted to a broad attack on Democrats wanting to give immigrants in the country illegally free health care and even \"more advantages than our own military has.\" (See a related fact-check.)\nTrump\u2019s attack on Abrams does not reflect her position. Other iterations of the attack by Trump and Kemp were deemed \u00a0\"misleading,\" a \"distortion\" or \"wrong\" in fact-checks by journalists since last year.\nThe gist of the fact-check: Abrams mentioned undocumented immigrants in a long list of groups that made up the \"blue wave\" supporting her campaign, but she never asked anyone ineligible to vote to cast a ballot.\nNoncitizens cannot vote in federal elections, but\u00a0they can vote in some local elections in a few jurisdictions.\u00a0When asked by a reporter earlier this year during a discussion of municipal voting rights if she would support noncitizens voting in some cases, Abrams made a distinction between municipal elections and federal elections, and she said she wasn't arguing for it but \"wouldn\u2019t oppose it.\"\nWhat Abrams said about undocumented immigrants in 2018\nThe Trump campaign pointed to a comment Abrams made Oct. 9, 2018, in front of supporters at a campaign event. Abrams was speaking about the diversity of the \"blue wave,\" referring to a groundswell of Democratic voters.\nAbrams said: \"The blue wave is African American. It\u2019s white, it\u2019s Latino, it\u2019s Asian, Pacific Islander. It is disabled. It is differently abled. It is LGBTQ. It is law enforcement. It is veterans. It is made up of those who have been told they are not worthy of being here. It is comprised of those who are documented and undocumented. It is made up of those who have been told they\u2019re successful and those that have been told they are left behind. But the real wave is when we come together and we tell Georgia we are here and we are not going anywhere.\"\nAbrams didn\u2019t actually say she wanted undocumented immigrants to cast ballots for her, which would have been illegal.\u00a0\nA few days later, a clip of Abrams\u2019 comments was publicized by the Washington Free Beacon and then spread to other media.\nOver the next few weeks, Abrams and her campaign argued she wasn\u2019t calling for ineligible voters to cast ballots.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Abrams sounded open to the reasons for a noncitizen voting in a local election but said she was \"not arguing for it or against it.\"\u00a0\n\"I think there\u2019s a difference between municipal and state and federal,\" she said. \"Part of municipality \u2014 I\u2019m not arguing for it or against it, but I will say, having been deputy city attorney, there\u2019s a very \u2014 the granularity of what cities decide is so specific, as to, I think, allow for people to be participants in the process without it somehow undermining our larger democratic ethic that says that you should be a citizen to be a part of the conversation.\"\nThe reporter followed up: \"So, in some cases, you would be supportive of noncitizens voting?\"\n\"I wouldn\u2019t be \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t oppose it,\" Abrams said.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote.\"\nTrump\u2019s attack on Abrams is overly broad. In her unsuccessful bid for governor, Abrams spoke about the diversity of the \"blue wave\" in Georgia and mentioned a long list of groups including undocumented immigrants. She didn\u2019t say they should be given the right to vote, and that has not been her documented position.\u00a0\nLater, Abrams said she \"wouldn\u2019t oppose\" noncitizens voting in municipal elections, but she specified that it was different from state or federal races. It would be possible for listeners to wrongly assume from Trump\u2019s claim that Abrams wants noncitizens to vote in all elections.\u00a0\nThis statement rates Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16752"}
