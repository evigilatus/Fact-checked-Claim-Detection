Some questioned whether the term \"cash\" was confused with \"mutilation.\" Our readers referred to this allegation and asked us to verify the facts. We asked the First Amendment Counsel and the experts who said that the claim was too broad. In an article on the Internet, the Federation supported its website by saying that 24 states have laws that \"make it public to say things that concern people a crime.\" An interactive map is linked to criminal defamation provisions in the laws of the various states. \"These laws violate the First Amendment and are used disproportionately against people who criticize public officials or government officials,\" ACLU said. Abdullah Hassan, a communication officer of the European Freedom Union, Poletti Fakt, reported that Facebook was part of the social media campaign that began in December 2018, after the organization filed an action on behalf of Robert Freis to challenge the New Hampshire Criminal Defamation Act. \"Fries, a resident of Exeter, was arrested by Exeter Police Department for commenting on a news article that the sheriff found out about this dirty cop.\" The Federation &apos; s position was aimed at raising awareness of criminal defamation laws, which gave public officials the option to interpret defamation and arrest persons for criticism. The Group &apos; s position was that defamation cases should be dealt with only in civil courts and not be subject to criminal penalties. The anti-default provisions had existed since before the American Revolution, and were rooted in British common law and the suppression of sedition under colonial rule. In many states, defamation was perceived as a \"peace breach\" when criminal sentences were first introduced. What do the rules say? The 24 states highlighted by the Federation already have criminal laws relating to defamation, a constitution and book codes, although many have limitations on these provisions. The problem in this article is that the Federation calls these laws \"critic,\" while in most cases the data must be factual confirmation, defamatory and false, to subject them to prosecution. On January 13, 2021, General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, Jessica Goldman, a First Amendment lawyer and partner in the law team at the summit in Seattle, Washington, said that \"criminalizing criticism\" was a very broad way of expressing that. For example, in Illinois, a person can only be prosecuted for defamation if false and offensive statements about the financial situation of banks are published. North Carolina prohibits people (including journalists and editors) from making false statements in newspapers or patrols to discredit others and companies. In Kentucky, the Statute does not provide, however, that the court may initiate criminal proceedings for defamation or libel when it comes to the judges of the court. Pierrea, a First Amendment expert and partner at Adams and Reese, told Polyte Fact, \"Do not criminalize any criticism, under any circumstances, and each law usually requires proof of more than mere criticism. There is usually a level of forgery required, and there is usually an element of intent.\" In almost every state the Federation claims that it has a criminal libel or libel law, the truth is a defence of defamation. This provision grants immunity to the publisher of defamation if the statements are true. In addition, in many States, defamatory remarks are also justified when the communication is distinct, as in the case of legal proceedings. Finally, opinions that do not contain factual assurances are protected by the First Amendment. The remaining law is rarely used in books, yet some unconstitutional state laws still exist in books. For example, in the case of Garrison v. Louisiana, in 1964, the Supreme Court ruled that the Louisiana Criminal Defamation Act was unconstitutional because it did not establish a standard of de facto hatred. \u2219 (The criterion of actual hatred of civil defamation was established in the case of Sullivan v. The New York Times in the same year). Even after the judgement was handed down, Louisiana &apos; s Criminal Defamation Act is still on record and has been considered by the Federation as part of the graphs. However, trials are already taking place. Eugene Volok, a law professor at the University of California in Los Angeles, collected data on criminal prosecutions for defamation and wrote that such prosecutions occurred about 10 to 20 times a year and often led to conviction. However, this does not mean that these convictions are invalid. Volok Poletti Fuckett reported that the more recent laws are \"probably constitutional because they specifically prohibit false and knowingly false factual allegations that harm a person's reputation - defamation - and not just \"criticism.\" \"We ruled that \"half of the states in the United States have laws criminalizing cash.\" While nearly half of the states have criminal provisions relating to defamation, the statement that these laws criminalize criticism is exaggerated. It does not show that the purpose of these laws is to criminalize criticism only with actual hatred and lies in order to damage the reputation of others. Criticism or sincere opinions are not subject to prosecution. Even some false statements can be defended as long as they are not made in bad faith or recklessly ignored. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong.
