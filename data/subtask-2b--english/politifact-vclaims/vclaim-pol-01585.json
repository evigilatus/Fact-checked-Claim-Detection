None other than Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s mother, Martha G Kavanaugh. You literally cannot make this up.\"\nThe blog Pacific Pundit went even further. \"Martha G. Kavanaugh, the mother of Brett Kavanaugh was a Maryland district judge in 1996. In an amazing coincidence, Martha Kavanaugh was the judge in a foreclosure case in which Christine Blasey-Ford\u2019s parents were the defendants. Now it all becomes clear,\" the blog wrote. \"Blasey-Ford is going after Brett Kavanaugh, not because of what he did in high school. Instead, Christine Blasey-Ford is going after Brett Kavanaugh out of spite and revenge for a case rulled (sic) on by Brett Kavanaugh mother. \"\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nAccording to the case information archived online, Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s mother, Martha Kavanaugh, did preside over a foreclosure case in which Ford\u2019s parents were defendants. However, according to the same documents, Martha Kavanaugh dismissed the case at the plaintiff\u2019s request.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe America First Media Group blog post includes screenshots of that same case information, which says the voluntary motion to dismiss the case was \"granted with prejudice,\" meaning the plaintiff cannot sue over the same issue again.\nIn addition to court records, CBS News found the same information when reporters went to the Montgomery County Court to look into the case. They found that the Blaseys settled with their mortgage lender, and the bank requested Martha Kavanaugh dismiss the case. She did. They found no evidence that the Blaseys appeared in her courtroom.\nThe Gateway Pundit has since updated its story to include a tweet from a CBS reporter. The Gateway Pundit article now says, \"The case was settled amicably and the Blaseys kept their house.\"\nIn a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Ford\u2019s lawyers said she had \"been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats.\" They said as a result of those threats, her family relocated out of their home. The letter also said Ford\u2019s email had been hacked and she had been impersonated online.\nOur ruling\nBloggers speculated that the reason Christine Blasey Ford went public with sexual assault allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh was because Kavanaugh\u2019s mother presided over a foreclosure case against Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s parents.\nThis line of thinking has been debunked by the Washington Examiner, the New York Times, Snopes\u00a0and now, PolitiFact. The facts don\u2019t support the accusation. Kavanaugh\u2019s mother simply executed a settlement made by the plaintiff \u2014 a mortgage lender \u2014 and Ford\u2019s family.\u00a0\nPut simply, Kavanaugh\u2019s mother had no effect on the outcome of the case. A dismissed foreclosure case involving Ford\u2019s parents is an incredibly unlikely basis for a revenge-motivated sexual assault accusation 22 years later.\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-09-20 19:19:01 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s mother presided over foreclosure case against Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s parents, which fueled motivation for sexual assault accusation.
