Marco Rubio charged Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump with hypocrisy for hiring undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects instead of American citizens.\n\"He hired from Poland, and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment,\" Rubio said. \"That\u2019s a fact. People can look it up. I\u2019m sure people are Googling it right now, \u2018Trump Polish workers.\u2019 You\u2019ll see $1 million for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did.\"\n\"Wrong, wrong,\" Trump said.\nWe did some Googling and also reached out to the Rubio campaign, which referred us to media reports about a protracted class-action lawsuit involving his hiring of Polish aliens 36 years ago.\nRubio is right about the Polish workers, but it\u2019s unclear how much Trump ended up paying. (The Trump campaign did not get back to us.) Here\u2019s the story.\nSometime between 1979 and 1980, Trump hired a contractor to demolish an old building in midtown Manhattan to make way for Trump Tower. The contractor signed on workers from a local union and, to meet Trump\u2019s tight deadline, also brought on 200 undocumented laborers from Poland dubbed the \"Polish Brigade.\"\nThe Polish employees were off-the-books, working 12-hour shifts seven days a week for $4 to $5 an hour, with no overtime. Some workers were never paid what they were owed.\nIn 1983, union members sued a union boss, Trump and his contractor for cheating the union out of pension and welfare funds by hiring the Polish Brigade. Trump owed the union pension fund $1 million, the plaintiffs said.\nAppearing in court in 1990, Trump blamed the violations on the contractor and denied knowing that the Polish workers were undocumented.\n\"Nobody\u2019s proven to me that they were were illegal,\" Trump said, according to a Newsday report from the time.\nNonetheless, Manhattan Judge Charles Stewart ruled against Trump a year later, saying that his representative \"knew that the Polish workers were doing demolition work\" and that his company participated in a \"conspiracy\" to cheat the union.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump owed the workers a little more than $325,000 plus interest and attorney\u2019s fees and costs, Stewart ruled.\nThat wasn\u2019t the end of it. Trump appealed and it would drag on for another decade.\nIn 1998, several members of the Polish Brigade told the New York Times about their horrid working conditions. But Trump repeated that he didn\u2019t know about the legal status of the Polish Brigade and said he would not settle the case out of court \"on principle,\" according to the New York Times.\nIf the case was retried and Trump lost again, he would have had to pay about $4 million, the Times calculated.\nA year later, Trump quietly settled, according to the New York Daily News, but the agreement was placed under seal.\n\"It has been resolved on terms agreeable to both sides,\" labor lawyer Wendy Sloan, who represented the union members, told the New York Daily News.\nOur ruling\nRubio said Trump \"hired from Poland and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment.\"\nIt was Trump\u2019s contractor, not Trump himself, who hired 200 undocumented Polish workers to demolish a building to make room for Trump Tower in Manhattan. Trump said he didn\u2019t know. The lawsuit sought $1 million in damages, and a judge ruled that Trump had to pay $325,000 plus interest.\nBut the case was appealed and before it was retried, Trump settled the case out of court, so it\u2019s unclear how much he ended up doling out.\nRubio\u2019s statement is partially accurate but missing that context.
