Thousands of people were cheering.\" The next day, this week's host, George Stefanoplos, asked Trump if he misspoked, pointing out that \"police says it didn't happen.\" Trump -- who said he was in his apartment in Manhattan the morning of the attack -- doubled. \"It was on TV. I saw it, \"Trump said. \"It was well covered at the time, George. Now, I know they don't like to talk about it, but it was well covered at the time. There were people in New Jersey who were watching it, a large number of Arab residents, who were cheering with the fall of buildings. It's not good.\" We looked at the record to see what we could find about the American Islamic celebrations in New Jersey on September 11th. While we found a widely broadcast video of people in the Palestinian territories celebrating, we found no evidence to support Trump's description of events on American soil. We have conducted a comprehensive search of press and television texts on Lexie Nixes, in search of reports from September 2001 to December 2001 indicating any Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the attacks of 11 September. With regard to the city of Jersey, which was specifically mentioned by Tramp, we found two undocumented and non-exporting males. Neither began to approach the range described by Trump. On September 17, 2001, the Associated Press described \"the traumas of the surface celebrations of an attack by Muslims\" in Jersey City. But the same report said that those rumors were \"unfounded.\" On 18 September 2001, the Washington Post published an article alleging that \"law enforcement authorities have detained and questioned a number of persons allegedly seen celebrating attacks and holding parties on rooftops while watching destruction on the other side of the river.\" The mail story does not contain any source of this information, and we have found no evidence that any of these allegations are ever pending. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 there was a more widespread rumour of Muslims or Arabs cheering for attacks centred around Patterson, N.J. But it turns out that this was just a rumor, emanating from serial e-mails and sustained by Howard Stern's radio program. Star Ledger reported that, as rumors spread, \"Patterson police fled to the main south street, the center of Middle Eastern society in the city.\" \"When we got there, they were all in prayer,\" said Chief Patterson Lawrence Spagnola. Three percent of New Jersey residents are Muslim -- higher than any state -- according to the Pew Research Center. Suspected 9/11 terrorists have connections to Jersey City and Patterson. However, there is no conclusive evidence that any New Jersey residents celebrated the attacks, and there is no evidence of any demonstrations where \"thousands and thousands of people\" shouted. There is no evidence that Trump saw these events play in any way, either on television or in person. We contacted the Trump campaign, but we didn't hear anything about it. What we found were many stories of Muslims living in New Jersey speaking against attacks and preparing themselves for anti-Muslim responses. For example, the residents of Patterson put a sign on the city's main street saying, \"The Muslim community does not support terrorism.\" The Mayor of Jersey City, Stephen Volop, replied to the Trump statement on Twitter that Trump \"has memory problems or deliberately distorts the truth.\" Our governor Trump said, \"A witness in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering,\" as the World Trade Center collapsed. This challenges basic logic. If thousands and thousands of people are celebrating 9/11 attacks on American soil, many people outside Trump will remember that. In the twenty-first century, there will be video or visual evidence. Instead, all we found were some news articles that described the rumors of celebrations that were either dismantled or unproven. Trump mentions events in New Jersey in the hours following the events of September 11, 2001. We're assessing this pants statement on fire.
