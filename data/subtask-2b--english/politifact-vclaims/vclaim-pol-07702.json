Bill Nelson passed up the chance to run for governor against Rick Scott this year, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s done attacking the Republican incumbent.\nNelson went on the offensive against the governor, with a page on his website entitled \"The public has a right to know,\" asking for people to sign up to protest Scott\u2019s alleged lack of transparency. The message also went out via email.\n\"Last year, Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a bill giving Florida\u2019s public officials and candidates an easy way to avoid financial disclosure of their assets,\" Nelson said in an email sent June 13, 2014. \"Since then, Gov. Scott has been the only elected official to take advantage of this.\"\nDid Scott really sign a bill making it easier to hide assets from his financial disclosure statements? We\u2019ll take a look at Florida law so you won\u2019t be coming into this debate blind.\nTrusting disclosures\nWhile we didn\u2019t hear back from Nelson\u2019s office about clarifying this attack, it\u2019s pretty obvious he\u2019s referring to Senate Bill 2, a 2013 law unanimously passed by the Legislature that allowed state elected officials to establish a blind trust for their financial holdings and investments in order to prevent a conflict of interest.\nIn essence, a blind trust is when someone turns over their portfolio to a third-party trustee, who then buys and sells stocks, bonds and other assets without the owner\u2019s knowledge.\nNelson is right that Scott signed SB 2 into law in May 2013. And yes, Scott is the only elected official in the state to use this law to put assets into a blind trust. The question is whether the law makes it easier to hide assets from the public.\nBy definition, a blind trust makes it easier for a candidate to not disclose the investments that person owns. A blind trust allows Scott to declare a lump sum net worth without having to disclose the value of his vast portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investments, some of which are regulated by the state and whose value could be directly affected by Scott's policies.\nBut under SB 2, politicians must first disclose the assets they put into the blind trust. Scott did this in 2011, before the law was in place. It\u2019s only after those assets are in the trust that they are not available to the public -- or the official who put them there.\nOther officials have used a blind trust in the past. Alex Sink did it in December 2006 after she became the state\u2019s chief financial officer, an issue that became a somewhat contentious element of her failed gubernatorial run against Scott in 2010, because she voted for a new bond sale process that included her former employer, Bank of America. Sink created a blind trust on her own, without an ethics law addressing it.\nScott did the same thing after being elected as governor, disclosing all his investments in 2010, then forming his own blind trust in 2011 to avoid a conflict of interest, he said.\nFor years, the state ethics commission advised the Legislature to pass a law allowing blind trusts to deal with official conflicts of interest. In 2013, both the House and Senate unanimously passed SB 2. The bill regulated blind trusts and set the powers and duties of appointed trustees, including prohibiting them from telling their clients, such as Scott, what assets are bought or sold. These rules had not been in place prior to the bill\u2019s passage, leaving blind trusts unregulated by the state.\nJan Jacobowitz, director of the Professional Responsibility & Ethics Program at the University of Miami, says the problem in Scott\u2019s case is more who is managing the portfolio.\nIn this case, the custodian of Scott\u2019s $72 million portfolio is Alan Lee Bazaar, the chief executive of a New York investment advisory firm with ties to Scott\u2019s business dealings.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you sort of have an insider managing your blind trust, it doesn\u2019t inspire a lot of confidence in the people,\" Jacobowitz said.\nWhile the state law provides some safeguards against conflicts of interest drawn from similar federal regulations, there were more than a dozen federal guidelines the state\u2019s law didn\u2019t incorporate (a point reported by the website the BrowardBulldog.org). These included making trust agreements public, allowing the ethics commission to remove trustees for misconduct and requiring periodic trust performance reports to the commission.\nAnother problem with blind trusts is the while the owner may not manage the holdings, they still know what they own when they put those investments in the trust.\n\"If what you\u2019re putting in has a conflict of interest, then there\u2019s a problem. You still know what\u2019s in it,\" Jacobowitz said.\nIn May, former Democratic legislator and constitutional law expert Talbot (Sandy) D'Alemberte filed a lawsuit brought by Jim Apthorp, challenging the constitutionality of the law. Apthorp, a Democrat and former chief of staff to the late Gov. Reubin Askew, said the law violated state requirements for financial disclosure. As of June 20, the court is weighing that claim.\nOn June 16, Scott disclosed all of his financials in order to run for governor. In addition to his 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns (he and wife Ann Scott filed for an extension on their 2013 return), the governor ended his blind trust and revealed all the investments in his candidacy filing. That move wasn\u2019t required by the 2013 law, which only says he must disclose the value of the blind trust, not its contents.\nScott's net worth rose from $83.8 million in 2012 to $132.7 million last year, an increase of more than half, according to his financial disclosures. When he first ran in 2010, his net worth was a reported $218.6 million. He bankrolled his own campaign and has kept a campaign promise not to draw a salary from the state.\nOne of the notable things missing from Scott\u2019s investments was any interest in French oil services company Schlumberger Ltd., which is involved in Everglades drilling. Scott had a $135,000 investment in 2011 when he formed the trust, but the stake was gone in his June 16 disclosure. The former holding has since drawn an ethics complaint.\nAfter filing his paperwork, Scott put the investments into a new blind trust.\nOur ruling\nNelson said \"Scott signed into law a bill that gives Florida's public officials an easy way to avoid disclosing their personal finances.\"\nIn terms of historical context and content of the Senate Bill 2, that part is true. Blind trusts do let officials shield financial holdings from disclosure requirements, and Florida law now allows officials to use those trusts.\nThe broader implication of Nelson\u2019s statement is that Scott is being dishonest about what he owns, and that it affects his ability to govern without creating conflicts of interest. After Nelson made the statement, Scott ended the trust and disclosed all his holdings, but he was following a law both recommended by the state ethics commission and approved unanimously by the Legislature.\nThat law requires any official to disclose the assets being put into the trust before being turned over to a manager. There is debate over the law\u2019s rules regarding choosing that manager and whether assets in that portfolio may present a conflict of interest. What goes into the trust would be publicly disclosed, however, while how it is managed afterward would not.\nThat\u2019s not the same as hiding assets from voters. In this case, Scott ended the trust to disclose the portfolio\u2019s contents, anyway.\nNelson implied the blind trust law makes it easier to hide personal assets. They may be hidden, but only after they are listed and turned over to a trustee.\nWe rate the statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07702"}
