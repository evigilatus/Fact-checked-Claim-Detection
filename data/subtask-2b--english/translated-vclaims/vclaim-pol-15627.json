But in a recent interview, Sin Bernie Sanders, an independent in Vermont, gathers with the democratic majority, On August 19, 2009, Rachel Madhu offered MSNBC, responding to a question about the role of corporate interests in the discussion of health-care reform: \"We spend twice as much on health care as any other country spends on land. There is a reason why, year after year, insurance companies make huge profits and pay their executives tens and tens of millions of dollars as compensatory salaries. This is because these men exert a tremendous influence on the political process in Washington.\" With this item, we will address its international comparisons on health spending. We have looked at two sources of international comparison for health care, which are widely used - statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), the public health arm of the United Nations, and from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group representing 30 richer industrialized countries, mostly in Europe and North America. We have also confirmed with three international health-care experts that these are the best statistics available. According to the 2009 edition of the WHO World Health Statistics Report, using 2006 figures, spending on health care in the United States - both public and private - amounted to $6,719 per capita. The following arrangement was for Luxembourg and Monaco: $6,506 per person and $6,353 per person, respectively. Everyone was told that either 11 or 15 countries reported spending more than $3,360 per capita by the World Health Organization, at which point the United States no longer doubled its spending. :: Two possible figures are provided here because WHO provides preliminary figures and adjusted currency valuation statistics. Other States near the summit in the United States include Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as small Malta and San Marino. The OECD figures tell a similar story. In 2007, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that the United States spent $7,290 per capita on health care, which ranks first among the 30 countries studied. Five more countries spent more than $3,645 per capita, at which point the United States no longer doubled its spending. The highest proportion is the Netherlands, which is $4,417. The other four are Austria, Canada, Norway and Switzerland. If he had simply said, \"We spend one on health care more than any other country on the ground.\" But instead he said, \"Twice as much.\" That is why we value his statements as false. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15627"}
