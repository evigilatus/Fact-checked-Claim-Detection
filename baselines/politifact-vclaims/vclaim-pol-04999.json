After all, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory;\u00a03.5\u00a0million\u00a0of the island\u2019s residents are U.S. citizens.\nAnd now the word\u00a0bailout\u00a0is being thrown around.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Puerto Rico\u2019s debt problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwes $72 billion --\u00a0nearly\u00a0100%\u00a0of its annual economic output\n\n\n\n\nDefaulted on\u00a0most\u00a0of a\u00a0$422\u00a0million in debt payment in May 2016\n\n\n\n\nOwes a payment of\u00a0nearly\u00a0$2 billion\u00a0due in July 2016\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThat B word is stated repeatedly by a political action committee in a new attack ad\u00a0that claims House Speaker\u00a0Paul Ryan\u00a0and other U.S. leaders support a bailout.\n\u00a0\nRyan does back a bill for Puerto Rico that is sponsored by a fellow Wisconsin Republican, U.S. Rep.\u00a0Sean Duffy.\nBut the bill is not what is commonly understood to be a bailout. That is, unlike American\u00a0banks\u00a0and\u00a0automakers\u00a0that got bailed out, Puerto Rico would not get any U.S. tax dollars.\nAt the same time, the ad is careful to say the \"bailout\" would hurt \"savers and seniors,\" not taxpayers.\nAnd\u00a0Duffy\u2019s bill, experts tell us, almost certainly would mean lower returns for perhaps hundreds of thousands of Americans who invested in what long had been regarded as safe Puerto Rican bonds.\nThe ad\nThe sponsor of the\u00a0nationally televised\u00a0ad is the Center for Individual Freedom, a\u00a0conservative non-profit\u00a0based outside of Washington, D.C. that does not disclose its donors.

It grants Puerto Rico unprecedented bankruptcy protections. You pay for it.\n\n\n\n\nPictures of older men and women appear on the screen.\n\n\n\n\nRetirement accounts crushed. A bailout on the backs of savers and seniors. Washington politicians try to claim otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nThe photos of Pelosi, Obama and Ryan reappear.\n\n\n\n\nBut we know a bad bailout when we see one. Don't be fooled. No Super 9 bailout of Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nDuffy\u2019s bill\n\u00a0\nThe Center for Individual Freedom didn\u2019t respond to our call and emails asking for evidence to back its claim. But a\u00a0news release\u00a0from the group makes it clear the center is calling Duffy\u2019s bill a bailout.\nThe bill would establish a federal Oversight Board to assist Puerto Rico in managing its public finances. Ultimately,\u00a0a judge\u00a0would have the power to reduce the $72 billion in debt, according to the\u00a0Washington Post.\nThe experts we consulted agreed with Ryan, who has said the bill is not a taxpayer bailout of Puerto Rico, given that it would not commit any U.S. funds to the island.\nBut the experts also agreed with U.S. Rep. John Fleming, R-La., a critic who\u00a0has said\u00a0the bill would function like a bailout because Congress would be \"changing the rules\" to benefit Puerto Rico.\nThe rules would change under the bill in that Puerto Rico could restructure its debt, similar to what is done in a so-called Chapter 9 bankruptcy, and pay less to some creditors than the creditors are owed.\nIn terms of the impact on\u00a0American investors, many bond funds have already sold their Puerto Rican debt, and the debt is now mostly owned by hedge funds, according to the Associated Press. But Oppenheimer Funds and Franklin Templeton still own part of the debts.\nSo, a restructuring almost certainly would mean that Americans who, through brokers or choices they made in their retirement accounts, put some of their savings into Puerto Rican bonds almost certainly will get a lower return on their money, the experts told us.\nBut there is one more consideration, said\u00a0Simon Johnson, a professor of global economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management:\nAmericans who invested in Puerto Rican bonds thinking they were safe overestimated how safe they are, as the island\u2019s debt crisis shows.\nWith an Oversight Board managing a debt restructuring, savers likely will get a lower return than they expected. But without such a board, creditors would be fighting in court and the returns for individuals investors would likely be lower still.\nOur rating\nThe Center for Individual Freedom, a Super PAC, says in a TV ad that Ryan backs a proposal that would be a \"bailout\" of Puerto Rico.\nThe ad is misleading in its repeated use of the word bailout, in that legislation supported by Ryan -- unlike past bailout bills -- would not direct any U.S. tax dollars to the debt-ridden island.\nBut the ad was careful to say the \"bailout\" would hurt \"savers and seniors.\" And experts told us the bill almost certainly would result in lower returns for Americans who invested money in Puerto Rican bonds. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c527c9ab-63fa-4066-814e-9e36d1c87379\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04999"}
