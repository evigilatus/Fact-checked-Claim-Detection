Scott Walker during his sixth State of the State, given Jan. 19, 2016.\n\"In our state, fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores went up again in 2015,\" the governor said. \"And according to the most recent report, Wisconsin\u2019s high school graduation rates are also up again -- to the third-best in the country.\"\nGiven the nature of his speech, Walker clearly was taking some credit for the graduation rate apparently rising and the ranking being so high.\nLet\u2019s take a look.\nOld claim, new claim\nWalker made a similar statement in April 2014. He said the state\u2019s high school graduation rate and third-grade reading scores had improved on his watch.\nOur rating was Mostly True. Both numbers were up since 2010, the year before Walker took office. But some credit could have been to due prior elected officials, and the trend lines hadn\u2019t changed much going back to prior to 2010.\nThe graduation rate covers students in public high schools who earn a regular diploma within four years of starting high school.\nTo back Walker\u2019s new claim, his office cited an October 2015 news release from the state Department of Public Instruction about the latest graduation data.\nThe release said federal data released that month showed Wisconsin\u2019s graduation rate for the 2013-\u201914 school year was 88.6 percent.\nThat rate was up 0.6 percentage points from the previous year, ranking Wisconsin third in the country, according to the release.\nHere\u2019s how the federal data listed the top states:\nPublic high school graduation rate, 2013-\u201914 school year\n\n\n\n\nRank/State\n\n\nRate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

That\u2019s up sixth-tenths of a percentage point from the previous year. But Wisconsin\u2019s rank -- third -- did not change.\nWe rate Walker\u2019s statement Mostly True.\nMore on education\nWisconsin Democratic Party: Wisconsin dropped \"from second in the country to 41st\" among states where more than half the students took the ACT exam.
