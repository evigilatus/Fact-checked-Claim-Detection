But there have been new polls since then, so we decided to take a new look.\nAs we did previously, we looked at polls taken during the last six weeks that are listed on RealClearPolitics.com and that tested Trump\u2019s support against both Clinton and Sanders. (An additional five polls tested only Clinton against Trump, but we won\u2019t count those.)\nHere\u2019s a summary:\n\n\n\n\nPoll\n\n\nDate\n\n\nClinton vs. Trump\n\n\nSanders vs. Trump\n\n\nSanders advantage over Clinton\n\n\n\n\nNBC News-Wall Street Journal\n\n\n5/15-5/19\n\n\nClinton +3\n\n\nSanders +15\n\n\nSanders by 12\n\n\n\n\nCBS News-New York Times\n\n\n5/13-5/17\n\n\nClinton +6\n\n\nSanders +13\n\n\nSanders by 7\n\n\n\n\nFox News\n\n\n5/14-5/17\n\n\nTrump +3\n\n\nSanders +4\n\n\nSanders by 7\n\n\n\n\nPublic Policy Polling (D)\n\n\n5/6-5/9\n\n\nClinton +6\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Not quite, say polling experts.\nClinton has been scrutinized and attacked as a public figure for a quarter century, but Sanders -- even after running for president for a year -- is a relatively new figure to voters nationally. So while a lot of voters\u2019 minds are already made up about Clinton based on her long history in the public eye, it remains to be seen how open potential voters will be to supporting Sanders once Republicans start airing negative attacks, especially ones that note his identification as a democratic socialist. (We have previously reported that, according to polls, being a socialist is a less attractive quality for voters than being an atheist.)\nKerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University, told PolitiFact Georgia that Sanders shows up so strongly in head-to-head polls because Trump and Clinton have such high negatives.\n\"General election polls don\u2019t mean much until the conventions are over and you get to late summer or early fall,\" Swint said. \"A lot of voters don\u2019t look at Sanders as a legitimate threat. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s an imaginary candidate.\"\nIn addition, early polls do not weed out \"likely voters,\" as polls later in the campaign do, Steven S. Smith, a Washington University political scientist and a specialist in public opinion, told PolitiFact when we previously checked a similar statement by Sanders. This could matter, given Sanders\u2019 high rates of support among college students and younger voters, who have not yet demonstrated a long track record of voting.\n\"If Sanders draws disproportionately from people who are not likely to vote, which is a reasonable speculation at this point, then his support may be somewhat overstated in some comparisons,\" Smith said.\nAnd it\u2019s worth adding that, as Meet the Press host Chuck Todd noted, Clinton can be expected to poll better against Trump after she officially secures the nomination and many former Sanders supporters come to her side.\nOur ruling\nSanders said, \"Right now, in every major poll, national poll and statewide poll done in the last month, six weeks, we are defeating Trump often by big numbers, and always at a larger margin than Secretary Clinton is.\"\nOn the numbers, Sanders is correct: In the past six weeks\u2019 worth of polls, Sanders fares 6 points better against Trump than Clinton does, and he beats Trump by double digits on average. Still, polling experts caution that polls this far away from Election Day are not entirely reliable, and they add that Sanders hasn\u2019t been exposed to the same degree of negative attacks as Clinton has. We rate the claim Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cd7c011b-445f-4c81-9ca1-c35f63cefcf9", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04901"}
