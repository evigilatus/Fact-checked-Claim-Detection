We can help! We can take your competition off the streets for FREE. Report your competition to us.\"\nSnopes.com\u2019s Oct. 26, 2015 analysis said a person at the Lumberton Police Department, whom it did not identify, \u00a0confirmed that the ad ran, though didn\u2019t recall when. Snopes.com said it spotted the ad in an August 2015 Facebook post.\nDid police in the Southeast Texas town really place an ad encouraging drug dealers to nark each other out? We were curious enough to check it out on our own.\nBy phone, David Lisenby, editor of the weekly Lumberton Ledger, confirmed that the Lumberton Police Department placed the ad. Lisenby added that the department subsequently purchased another direct appeal about dealers.\nLisenby said he suggested the ads in hopes of encouraging community involvement.\nLisenby emailed us copies of the first ad, which appeared in the paper\u2019s Aug. 5, 2015, edition, and the follow-up ad, published Sept. 2, 2015.\nThe second ad showed a marijuana leaf over a message directed to \"drug users:\" \"Has your drug dealer ripped you off?\" the second ad says. \"Do you want justice?

Prosecutors otherwise have no way of knowing, Green said, if the ads fueled investigations.\nBut David Sheffield, Hardin County\u2019s district attorney, said he\u2019s heard the ads touched off calls to law enforcement. Sheffield said, though, it\u2019s too early to judge results; investigations take time. Such an ad, he said, \"gets your attention and it generates talk. Maybe it prompts somebody to do something they\u2019d just been thinking about doing.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post spotted by Snopes.com said Lumberton police placed an ad encouraging drug dealers to turn in other dealers.\nActually, the Lumberton Police Department this year purchased two such ads in the local weekly.
