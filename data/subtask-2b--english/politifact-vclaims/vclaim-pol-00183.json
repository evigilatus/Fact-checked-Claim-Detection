Pants on Fire!", "text": "In an ad released in the final weeks before a special election in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District, Republican Dan Bishop claimed his opponent Dan McCready is a socialist.\nThe ad opens with a mash-up of video clips in which President Donald Trump says, \"Dan McCready \u2026 is an ultra liberal. \u2026 He likes open borders, and he really admires socialism.\"\nThe footage comes from a rally in Greenville, N.C., in July when Trump endorsed Bishop and attacked his opponent. Even though the words come from Trump, the Bishop campaign chose to use the claim in its ad, so we are rating Bishop in this fact-check.\u00a0\nNext, the ad shows McCready alongside Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez while a voiceover drones, \"Dan McCready, a liberal backed by radicals who want open borders and socialized medicine.\"\nOther Republicans have made similar charges about McCready, the Democratic nominee, being a socialist, so we decided to check it out.\nWe\u2019re mindful that this is a familiar page from the Republican playbook. PolitiFact has explored many similar claims about Barack Obama, Sen. Bill Nelson and three members of the Ohio congressional delegation, among others. (In the case of the Ohio Democrats, not just socialists, but \"card-carrying socialists.\") Those claims were all rated Pants on Fire.\nAnd so it\u2019s no surprise that Bishop\u2019s claim is also ridiculously false. In fact, McCready is a business owner who proudly proclaims himself a capitalist.\nMcCready distances himself from left-wing national politicians\nUnder socialism, the government controls the means of production. But McCready hasn\u2019t called for the end of the private sector. To the contrary, he started his own clean energy investment firm, Double Time Capital.\u00a0\nWe contacted Bishop\u2019s campaign to find out what evidence it had of McCready\u2019s socialist leanings and got no reply.\u00a0\nSo we tried on our own. We searched McCready\u2019s website and his statements and found no evidence to back up the claim from Bishop\u2019s ad.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee suggested that McCready was a socialist in a May statement linking him with \"his party\u2019s radical ideas such as infanticide, a socialist takeover of the entire economy with the Green New Deal and government-run socialized health care.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a common tactic, said Dr. J. Michael Bitzer, history and politics professor at Catawba College. Republicans often try to group local Democratic candidates with more liberal national politicians to sway voters.\u00a0\n\"First, it was tying all Democratic candidates to Nancy Pelosi in 2018 to try to lower their favorability. Then, with the president going after AOC and the Squad, guilt by association has become a standard mantra for Republican campaigns,\" Bitzer said.\nIn fact, experts say McCready intentionally has distanced himself from left-wing Democrats in Congress. One Washington Post article tallies all of the ways he\u2019s done that: \"He pledged not to support Nancy Pelosi for House speaker. He opposed impeachment. He returned a donation from Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota after she suggested that Israel's advocates were buying off Congress.\"\nMcCready doesn\u2019t support open borders or socialized medicine\nA recent Trump tweet echoed that McCready \"wants Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities, and Socialism.\" (PolitiFact checked Trump\u2019s claim about McCready\u2019s immigration stances and rated it Mostly False.)\nMcCready\u2019s policy proposals are a far cry from socialist. They often don\u2019t even go as far as the mainstream Democratic platform.\n\"There\u2019s some distance between McCready and the national Democratic platform,\" said Dr. Susan Roberts, political science professor at Davidson College. \"He does not support Medicare for All. He does not support a ban on assault weapons.\"\nAlso, he\u2019s repeatedly dismissed the Green New Deal and other policies embraced by many Democratic presidential candidates.\nIn a CNN interview, McCready scoffed at Bishop\u2019s attacks. \"Unfortunately for him, he's not running against a socialist. He's running against a capitalist who's built a business from scratch.\"\nOur ruling\nBishop, Trump, and the NRCC are trying to portray the Democratic candidate McCready as a socialist, but there\u2019s simply no evidence to support their absurd charge.\u00a0\nMcCready is a businessman who has benefited from capitalism and even has distanced himself from liberal Democrats.\u00a0\nAs election day nears, we need to take a match to the Truth-O-Meter.
