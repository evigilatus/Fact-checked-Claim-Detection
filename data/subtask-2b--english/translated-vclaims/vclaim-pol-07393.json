However, according to Republican candidate Herman Cain, the minimum wage is not sufficient, since the real value of salary salaries has not budged for four decades. When Cain appeared in Fox News Business on August 11, former Labour Minister Bill Clinton criticized Robert Reich, who blamed high income inequality on the financial elite. Tell Cain the host, Stuart Farney, that the Fed is in charge. \"This is the reality, Stuart, over the past 40 years, of real wage growth established by federal reserve policies,\" Cain said. \"It had nothing to do with greedy CEOs, it had nothing to do with what companies wanted to do. It was all driven by the Federal Reserve in an attempt to control unemployment with faulty control of wage growth.\" We wanted to see whether real wages - that is, the worker &apos; s inflation-adjusted salary - did not actually see any growth for four decades, and whether this could be linked to the Federal Reserve &apos; s policies. We have referred to this video by Cain's research fellow, Rich Lowry, his former economic adviser and one of the creators of Cain's tax scheme from 9 to 9. The video takes its data from the World's Higher Income Database, a project of leading economists whose calculations are based on income tax records. As for the theory that the Federal Reserve's policies were responsible for a real stagnation in wages, this was the independent conclusion of Laurie and other researchers from Cain. \"We think it's obvious that there's a connection,\" said Laurie. For this fact-finding, we talked to Lowri, researchers in thinking with thanks to different political tendencies, and a number of independent economists. What we found was that this claim is about competing theories about business economics and monetary policy. Kane's point is weird. We will begin by assessing Cain's claim that real wage growth has been established over the past 40 years. We will talk later about the role of the Federal Reserve. Kane got the information after analyzing the data from a famous source, the world's highest income database. But Cain of bats made an error in describing his analysis as measuring wage growth. Indeed, the statistics considered measure income growth. (The wages refer to the salaries received by the worker within a certain period of time and form part of the income.) Income also includes investments, rental vouchers and other sources of cash received.) Between 1972 and 2012, real income rose by 0.52 per cent on average from year to year. Growth is weak, but growth. Laurie, the corporate financial advisor, said Ken was focusing on the Lowri group called the \"motivated majority,\" down 90% of American wage earners. The real income of that group has fallen annually on average by 0.16 per cent, according to the world &apos; s highest income database. As you can see, income growth has literally not been flattened -- it's slightly elevated. Real income growth was the most stagnant in the 1970s, but it saw some gains in the 1990s before declining in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Mark Beals, Professor of Macroeconomics, University of Rochester, said. \"Forty years is a long time.\" The average income, even adjusted for inflation, does not accommodate differences in working conditions between 1972 and today, according to Belize. The working hours are different and purchasing power has increased. What happens when we focus on wages? Josh Bevins, Director of Research and Policy at the Institute of Economic Policy of the Liberal Think tank, considered real wage growth from 1979 to 2013, using data from the Office of Labour Economics. The results show that Americans who earn less have seen very little growth in wages while those with the highest wages have achieved gains. For 70 percent workers (which make up more than 70 percent of all workers), hourly wages did not grow at all between 1979 and 1995. The years 1995 to 2000 were an exception, with an annual growth rate of 1.4 per cent. In sum, if you are a factor in inflation, the average American has brought home the same amount of bacon over the past four decades, while the economic elite earns more than one year to another. This does not necessarily tell the whole story. Economists have told us, noting that wages do not take into account such matters as health benefits, study assistance, vacation time and sick leave. But on Cain's scale, he's pretty much right. However, the federal reservation did not simply say that wage growth had been fixed. He blamed the Federal Reserve. This view is weird. According to Bevins, the claim is not \"highly well-founded.\" John McCain, a former economist at the Federal Reserve in Chicago and Atlanta, currently at the United States Institute of Enterprise, University of California, Labour Economist Berkeley Michael Reich, said that they had not seen any research linking Fed policies to real fixed wages. Both McCain and Reich (Robert Reich's colleague, but unrelated) indicated that neither Cain nor Laurie were economists. At best, the Fed \"has a marginal impact on the long-term trend of real wage growth,\" said Kenneth Rogoff, the author of this time's different and a professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University. Although economists do not give a great deal of credibility to public claims, they have assisted us in dissecting Cain's theories, which summarize how the Fed establishes the value of the dollar, how the Fed determines interest rates, and how the Fed determines and measures inflation. According to the Federal Reserve, according to the real wages of Cain and Laurie, which Rachel mentioned on January 16, 2021, in the tweeting of the minimum wage of $15 per hour, the price of taco bill burrito was raised to $38. \u2022 20 January 2021, it cannot have a direct impact on real wages, which are determined largely by non-monetary factors. The real wage factor is inflationary, thus deliberately maintaining its stability. \u2219 Inflation target to achieve 2% inflation rate to stabilize prices and maximize employment The price index largely uses the index of personal price expenditures, as well as many other indicators, to measure inflation. Use the CPI to measure inflation, but in fact replace the CPI with real wages. The value of the dollar does not target the value of the exchange, but takes into account the impact of the dollar on the United States economy. It is used to measure inflation, and to maintain stable value. Now the dollar is swollen, and the value is allowed to fluctuate. Sources: The Federal Reserve and interviews with Lowrie Dollar Lowrie are defined in 1971 as the year in which real income began stabilization, which is also the year in which the United States stopped linking its currency to gold. The theory is that when the dollar was supported by gold, real wages were growing increasingly; when the gold exchange standard was established, the dollar began to float - depending on the volatility of foreign exchange and currency markets - and fixed wages. With the stability of the currency, the physical costs of businesses have declined, and therefore wages have risen, as Lori said. This is the argument of a degenerate currency -- the floating dollar has less purchasing power, leading to inflation and thus lowering real wages -- and almost one of all economists complains about it. At best, the theory is \"hand clothes,\" according to Bevins. He said, \"You're really gonna need to see an increase in inflation to make sense of this, and this is definitely not the story of the past decades.\" Moreover, the value of the dollar falls largely under the authority of the United States Department of the Treasury, not the Federal Reserve. According to Laurie, the Fed will lower interest rates when the economy expands, making it easier for businesses to borrow money and promote wealth. When the economy begins to deflate, the Fed raises interest rates to reduce inflation, but instead leads to a decline in business investment and consequently to lower wages. Lowry's description of interest rate policies is good with economists. Bevens said that the Fed certainly \"rapid on the trigger\" when it comes to enacting policies that heat and cool the economy, which could immediately affect wages. Experts said that the idea that policies had a direct or even a significant impact on real wages was a long one. \"Productivity has grown steadily over the post-war period, but real wages have failed to grow with productivity growth only since 1980. The interest rate policy did not change during that period, \"the Reich said. While higher interest rates generally lead to higher unemployment and slower growth of nominal wages (not adjusted for inflation) in the period immediately following increases, they do not do much for real wages, according to Reich. \"For 40 years, it won't matter,\" said Bills. \"They may create some bankruptcy in assets in the short term, but this does not entail that wages will decline.\" The third point raised by Laurie indicates that the Fed treats real wages as inflation and tries to keep growth low to keep inflation low. Laurie said that the Fed used the delayed data, the consumer price index, to measure inflation, but because the data did not reflect the real-time market, the Fed failed to use real wages as agents. Since part of the Fed &apos; s objective is to stabilize prices, it instead stabilizes real wages. Economists object to describing how inflation is measured. The Federal Reserve focuses on general price increases, not wages, to assess inflation, but to predict inflation, other factors such as GDP growth and unemployment are also taken into account. Bevins compared it to baseball projections. He said, \"Looking at strikes and walking is better predicting wins than last win,\" he said. According to McKeen, the definition of inflation per se means that real wages cannot be his agent, because doing so would undervalue the other part of the equation - wages. \"Real wages are nominal wages adjusted for inflation.\" \"If the Fed causes prices to rise faster, then prices will rise faster than money, and real wages will fall faster. If prices rise slowly, then real wages will rise.\" In other words, for real wages to grow, nominal wages will have to grow faster than inflation. Since inflation was below the 2% target of the Fed, it was the lack of nominal wage growth that kept real wages low. In fact, if it wasn't the Fed, what was actually carrying real wages down? They are attributed by economists to many factors. An economist at the Fed himself wrote that labour market conditions are responsible. Belize listed changes in technology, risk and investment, and human capital. There has also been an increase in international trade, and there has been a volatility in demand for different levels of skills and income tax policy, as Stephen Moore, a former senior economist of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, now working for the Conservative Heritage Foundation. McCain and Bevin referred to a rise in labour productivity coupled with weak demand for employment. The Reich said all of the above: increased competition from low-wage countries, technological change that reduced the need for jobs in middle-wage scales, while encouraging growth in low-wage occupations, lowering trade unions and lowering the real minimum wage. \"while professional economists differ on the relative importance of each of these views, I have never seen a statement that the Federal Reserve's inflation policies are at all a factor,\" Reich said. The Governor, Cain, said, \"For the past 40 years, real wage growth has been stabilized because of federal reserve policies.\" Cain's research assistant was looking at real income growth, but the results are consistent if you measure income or wages. In short, wage growth has remained relatively stable. But Cain went too far in blaming federal reserve policies, both conservatives and liberal economics told us. Various non-monetary policy factors are likely to lead to a decrease in wage growth. Cain's claim contains an element of right, but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.
