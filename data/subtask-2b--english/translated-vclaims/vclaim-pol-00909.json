The Facebook article published on March 8 seems unbelievable that the Democrats could have elected it to Congress. \"Alexandra Occio-Cortez was expelled from 'Hot Dog on Stick' in 2008 - for incompetence,' reading the picture of a woman in a uniform. This article, which miswrote the first name of Congresswoman, has been cited as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A spokesman for Okasio-Cortez said that the claim was false. In 1946, Hot Dog did not respond to a stick, a hot dog company that started operating in Santa Monica, Califf, and did not reply immediately to Poletti Fruitte &apos; s e-mail address. There are now 70 stores in seven states, according to the company &apos; s website. But after looking online for the male Okasio Cortez and Hot Dog on a stick, we couldn't find any news that she worked there, or that she was fired from the company. Instead, Kathleen Schaffer, Senior Director of Innovation and Communications of the World Group of Concessions, Hot Doog on Polic Company Mother, Factcheck.org, said that no one had been hired in the name of Alexandria Okasio Cortez there, according to the group's records. After that, we looked at the same picture. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021, a reverse image search showed other articles with the same claim that Okasio Cortez was photographed, but also photos without any text, such as Imgflip.com. It is described as a \"hot dog on a stick model\" where users can \"cap this meme.\" The picture is included among many in the 2015 article on Newaugh's website, \"Is there anything hotter than a girl wearing a baseball hat?\" The picture also appears on Reddit, where one user noticed the same contradiction that we noticed: the picture does not look like Okasio Cortez. \"When you want to destroy someone but can't be bothered to know what they look like,\" books of account. That's because the photographer, as Gismodo states, is called Stephanie, not Alexandria. The mark of her name on her hat, invisible on Facebook, is visible on Flicker here. The photograph was taken by Michael Zambelli on 16 February 2008, according to the website. The title says, \"Hot dog on a stick\" and \"Steviny makes you a corn dog hit!\" The picture is also in L.A. and Angels. (Ocasio Cortez is from New York and went to college in Boston.) We contacted Zambelli to see if he knew if it was the congressman's photo. \"I have no idea,\" said in Facebook. I have her name Stephanie, so it's probably someone who's been looking for hot dogs on a stick. Our Facebook article claims that Okasio Cortez was expelled from Hot Dog on a stick of incompetence. We didn't find any evidence to support this claim. The parent company of the business has no record of a person whose name works there and we have found no reliable news reports or articles on the Internet to confirm the claim of the Facebook newspaper. The person in the picture doesn't look like Okasio Cortez, and her name tag says Stephanie. The photographer who took the photo confirmed that he identified her as a person named Stephanie when he photographed the picture. We're assessing this Facebook mail pants on fire!
