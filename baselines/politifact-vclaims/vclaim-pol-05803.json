Chris Christie drew chuckles at the Republican presidential debate in Boulder, Colo., when he described the Democratic field as consisting of \"a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist -- and for the sake of me, I can\u2019t figure out which one is which.\"\nHe went on to single out Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, one of those three Democratic candidates and a self-described democratic socialist.\n\"The socialist says they\u2019re going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don\u2019t tell you they\u2019re going to raise your taxes to 90 percent to do it,\" Christie said.\nThat echoed a claim made by Donald Trump at a rally in Richmond, Va., on Oct. 14, 2015.\nAt that rally, Trump called Sanders a \"communist\" and said that tax hikes would come for everyone, not just billionaires.\n\"This maniac that was standing on (Hillary Clinton\u2019s) right is giving everything away, so she\u2019s following,\" Trump said at the Richmond rally, referring to the Democratic debate the previous night. \"He\u2019s gonna tax you people at 90 percent. He\u2019s gonna take everything. And nobody's heard the term communist, but you know what? I\u2019d call him a socialist/communist, okay? \u2018Cause that's what he is.\"\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Sanders wants to raise taxes on the richest 1 percent:\n\"Yes, we are going to ask Trump and his billionaire friends to pay more in taxes. ...We'll come up with that rate. But it will be a damned lot higher than it is right now,\" Sanders said in an Oct. 18 interview with ABC\u2019s This Week.\nBut does Sanders want to tax the average Americans at 90 percent as well? Here, we\u2019ll recap the problems we found with Trump\u2019s claim and address why Christie\u2019s claim was equally problematic.\nWhat Sanders has said\nSanders hasn\u2019t released a tax plan yet -- the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has a summary of the candidates\u2019 tax plans here -- and we searched Lexis Nexis and CQ and found that Sanders has never explicitly proposed a 90 percent tax rate for billionaires, let alone applying that rate across the board.\nThe confusion may stem from comments Sanders made in May 2015 about the marginal tax rate for the very wealthy. In an interview with CNBC, Sanders he doesn\u2019t think a top marginal tax rate of 90 percent is too high.\nBefore we parse his comment, let\u2019s review what the marginal tax rate means. It\u2019s the tax rate that\u2019s applied to the last dollar you earn. The U.S. tax system is based on tax brackets. Let\u2019s say you were a single filer who earned $410,000 in adjusted gross income last year. The first $9,075 you earned was taxed at 10 percent, the amount from $9,076 to $36,900 was taxed at 15 percent, the amount from $36,901 to $89,350 was taxed at 25 percent, the amount from $89,351 to $186,350 was taxed at 28 percent, the amount from $186,351 to $405,100 was taxed at 33 percent, the amount from $405,101 to $406,750 was taxed at 35 percent, and the amount above $406,751 was taxed at 39.6 percent. (The dollar levels are different for other types of filers, such as couples filing jointly.)\nIn other words, the current top marginal tax rate is 39.6 percent, affecting individuals who make more than $400,000 a year. That\u2019s roughly the threshold to make it into the top 1 percent of incomes if you\u2019re filing as an individual. And even for this sample filer making $410,000, that 39.6 percent tax rate hits only a relatively small amount of their income. The average American never sees marginal federal income tax rates that high.\n\"If my memory is correct, when radical socialist Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, the highest marginal tax rate was something like 90 percent,\" Sanders said on May 26. (His memory is correct.) \"That's not 90 percent of your income, you know? That's the marginal.\"\nMany on the right and left interpreted Sanders\u2019 comments as advocating for increasing the top rate to 90 percent. The Sanders camp, however, told us the Vermont senator has made it very clear that that\u2019s not what he was saying.\nAnd beyond what his camp told us, a review of his past comments \u2014 one from 2008, and four more from this year \u2014 Sanders doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s committed to any figure:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Nov. 5, 2008 on Fox News\u2019 Your World with Neil Cavuto: Sanders said of the top tax rate, \"No, of course, it is not going to be 90 percent.\" Pressed by Cavuto for a figure, Sanders said, \"Neil, I\u2019m not going to develop tax policy in a three-minute segment on your show.\"\n\u2022 June 2, 2015 on Yahoo! News: In response to host Katie Couric\u2019s suggestion that he proposed taxing the wealthiest Americans at 90 percent, Sanders interjected, \"No, I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not true. That\u2019s one of these things that seems to be circulating. We haven\u2019t come up with a formal tax proposal. ...Will we raise the individual tax rate for the wealthy? Absolutely, but we haven\u2019t come up with a number yet.\"\n\u2022 June 11, 2015 on Charlie Rose: \"We are working right now on a comprehensive tax package which I suspect will for the top marginal rates go over 50 percent.\"\n\u2022 Sept. 18, 2015 on CBS This Morning: \"No, I don\u2019t think you have to go up to 90 percent. \u2026I don\u2019t know if you have to go there but we will come up with some very specific ideas.\"\n\u2022 Sept. 23, 2015 on CNN New Day: \"If you are extremely wealthy, yes, you are going to pay more in taxes. If you are a large corporation today, by the way, that's stashing your money in the Cayman Islands and not paying a nickel in federal taxes, yes, you are going to be paying taxes.\"\nIn short, the most specific figure we found from Sanders on the top marginal tax rate is not terribly specific \u2014 \"over 50 percent\" \u2014 and it would only affect a tiny fraction of Americans.\nNothing is certain but taxing corporations\nAnd that\u2019s the point that\u2019s even more problematic with this claim -- who Sanders\u2019 supposed 90 percent tax would affect.\nBoth Trump and now Christie have indicated that essentially everyone will be hit by a 90 percent tax hike. With Trump, this rate would supposedly be levied on \"you people\" in the audience at his rally. Christie, for his part, said Sanders would \"raise your taxes to 90 percent.\"\nBut whatever big hike a President Sanders would seek to implement -- and based on his comments it would be something south of 90 percent -- would be targeted mostly at the wealthiest Americans, including hikes to the tax on the largest estates and on trading transactions and an elimination of tax deferrals for U.S. corporations located abroad.\nThe one exception is his call for paid family and medical leave, based on legislation introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., that would require \"just a small increase in the payroll tax\" that would hit everyone, Sanders said on This Week.\nHow small? Employers and employees would chip in an additional 0.2 percent each, bringing the federal payroll tax from 12.4 percent to 12.8 percent. According to a report by Gillibrand\u2019s office, that\u2019s the equivalent of $72.04 per year for the average worker, and $227.40 for the highest wage earners.\nBeyond this, there\u2019s some doubt that Sanders could achieve his policy proposals without additional tax increases. Indeed, one tax expert cautioned against speculating because Sanders has been so vague about his proposals.\n\"There is not enough substance to (Sanders\u2019) proposals for anyone to have analyzed them,\" Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said when we checked Trump\u2019s original claim. \"Organizations typically wait until there is a fully formulated plan before they try to model them. Sanders is not anywhere near that point yet.\"\nOur ruling\nChristie said that Sanders\u2019s plan is \"to raise your taxes to 90 percent.\"\nSanders hasn\u2019t released an official tax plan, either for billionaires or for anyone else. But based on his previous comments and proposals, the tax policies Sanders is advocating are targeted at corporations and affluent Americans.\nSanders has dismissed the notion that he wants to set marginal tax rates for billionaires at 90 percent. And on the whole, his tax proposals so far do not envision raising \"your taxes\" -- that is, those of ordinary Americans -- to anything approaching 90 percent.\nThis is a grossly misleading characterization of the extent and scope of Sanders' plan, so we rate Christie\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/94917f97-e53e-4d00-8f83-c9f2de668891", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05803"}
