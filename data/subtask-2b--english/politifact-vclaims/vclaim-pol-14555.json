It was the first of at least four mail pieces that carried the teaser: \"Voter Fraud Alert.\" Property taxes are actually \"18 percent higher than when (Sharpe) first took office,\" said Burgin, who is seeking to unseat Sharpe in the at-large District 7 Republican primary.\n\nAwesome, we thought. Two politicians vying for the same seat making wildly opposing claims. This is why PolitiFact Florida exists!\n\nWe looked at Sharpe first, and ruled that his claim was Barely True.\n\nNow we turn to Burgin\u2019s claim, first calling him to ask him how he derived his figures. He sent us the numbers he used \u2013 the overall property tax revenue figures for each of the years Sharpe has been in office since 2004.\n\nWe confirmed the numbers were accurate using Hillsborough County budget documents. In 2004, Hillsborough County collected $553.4 million in property taxes. This year, the number is projected to be $659.8 million.\n\nThat\u2019s actually a 19.2 percent increase. So Burgin was being cautious, gentle even, right?\n\nThere\u2019s just one significant problem with his calculation. And there\u2019s another big asterisk.\n\nThe county prepares its budget books and calculates its revenues and expenditures by fiscal year. And the fiscal year doesn\u2019t mirror the calendar year.\n\nFiscal year 2004 covers the period from Oct. 1, 2003 to Sept. 30, 2004. Sharpe first took office in November 2004. To calculate changes in tax revenue or tax rates involving Sharpe, the proper base year would be fiscal year 2005. It was not until September 2005 that Sharpe cast his first budgetary votes, setting property tax rates for fiscal year 2006.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is indeed significant because, while this may be hard to remember with property values now plummeting, home and business values were soaring during Sharpe\u2019s first years in office. From fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005, property tax revenues jumped from $553.4 million to $610.8 million.\n\nWith fiscal year 2005 as the base year, that means overall county property tax revenue has increased by nearly 8 percent during Sharpe\u2019s tenure. Burgin claimed a tax increase of well more than double that \u2013 a gross exaggeration.\n\nThat one year could make such a difference is a reflection of how overheated the real estate market was in the middle part of the decade. We can illustrate the phenomenon in reverse now, with property values plummeting.\n\nSharpe has voted on next year\u2019s tentative budget. If the tax rate approved so far holds, county budget officials project another nearly $74 million drop in property tax revenue. By that time, tax receipts will have fallen 4 percent below what they were when Sharpe took office. That\u2019s right: Up by 8 percent this year, down by 4 percent next year.\n\nNow for the other asterisk to Burgin\u2019s calculation. Property tax revenues are not a perfect measure of how taxes increased or decreased. That\u2019s because the revenue includes property taxes collected from new construction. Owners of those properties may be paying more in taxes, but it\u2019s a reflection of, say, their home sitting on what a year or two earlier may have been an orange grove.\n\nTake new construction out of the mix, particularly during the heady building days of Sharpe\u2019s early tenure, and the alleged tax increase is something less than 8 percent, potentially much lower. Even during the anemic market of the current fiscal year, when property values are dropping across Hillsborough County, a projected $1.2 billion in new construction is expected.\n\nBurgin knows, or should know, his way around a budget book. He spent part of 2004 and 2005 as an aide to former County Commissioner Brian Blair, who tasked him with just these sorts of exercises.\n\nFraud is a serious charge to level at anyone, even though some politicians tends to toss the word at opponents rather casually. Burgin has done it at least four times so far this campaign.\n\nBut before accusing someone of an intentional perversion of the truth, it\u2019s probably good to double- and triple-check the basis of your claim. We have no way of knowing if Burgin\u2019s claim was an intentional distortion or an innocent miscalculation.\n\nEither way, we find this statement to be False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14555"}
