(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nFirst, Nike\u2019s market capitalization as of Sept. 8 is about $176 billion, not $76 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\nSearching online and in the Nexis news archive we found no evidence that Nike ever made such a statement. We reached out to Nike about the claim and didn\u2019t immediately hear back, but a spokesperson for the company told the Associated Press that the quote is fake.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis fabricated statement has been online since at least 2018, when Nike named former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick as the face of its new \"Just Do It\" campaign. The decision drew anger from some who disapproved of Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem before football games as a means of protest against police brutality and racial inequality.\u00a0\nSnopes reported at the time that the earliest reference to the statement that appears in the Facebook post may have been on Sept. 4, 2018, when someone tweeted that \"on NPR this morning, NIKE stated, \u2018We did all the math. We\u2019re a $76 billion dollar company that can afford to let go of all \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 customers. We would rather be on the right side of history.\"\u00a0\nDuring an interview with NPR that morning, Justin Tinsley, a writer for the publication The Undefeated, said that though some social media posts showed people burning their Nike shoes, Nike wants \"to be on the right side of history.\"\n\"They\u2019re not going to take a drastic hit from the bottom line,\" Tinsley said. \"And at the end of the day, Nike \u2014\u00a0again, this is an internationally known, multibillion-dollar company. They\u2019ve done the math. They\u2019ve done the bottom line probably hundreds of times over. And they know the benefit that can come from this.\"\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18882"}
