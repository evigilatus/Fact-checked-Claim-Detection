No wonder there are plans to help alleviate some of this traffic by adding corridors on the I-77, a interstate road around the western part of Charlotte. The North Carolina Department of Transport began in 2007 to seriously consider extending the extension between the states from Mursville to Charlotte. These corridors will use fees to pay for expansion, which will be opened towards the end of this year. Only two of these corridors will have fees. Many drivers are unhappy with the decision to pay fees, and some don't think it's gonna help get crowded. As the election season draws to a close soon, I-77 loss of life has become a popular theme for discussion between State X. Jeff Tarty and Democratic Challenger Natasha Marcus. They stand for representation in the North Carolina sheikhs area 41. Tarty wrote a newspaper article in the Charlotte newspaper in 2014 in which he says that he \"supports the payment of fees on I-77 because this option solves the problem sooner rather than later.\" However, in a recent article by the observer Charlotte highlighting the Marcus-Tart race, Tarty, a Republican from Cornelius, he said in an interview with the observer, \"I wasn't at any point in favour of this particular project.\" The Tarty project is the contract entered into by the State with Sintra, a Spanish company responsible for the construction of corridors. Tarty told the warden that the governor should cancel the contract. Sintra will also maintain the fee lines for 50 years. Tarty also said that he \"fully supports no fee\" for WSOC-TV on June 14, 2018. The North Carolina Democratic Party is different, and has a dedicated web page to say Tarty gave the project \"Green Light before it is against them.\" What did Tarty say about the drawings? The decision to use the fees to pay for the extension of I-77 in 2010 was in accordance with the project schedule established by the National Counter-Terrorism Committee. The mayor of Cornelius, Tarty, was a town north of Charlotte, at the time of the decision. He was elected a member of the State Senate in 2013. 29 April 2009, there were minutes of a meeting held in 2009 - when the mayor of Cornelius was Tarty - at the Metropolitan Planning Organization in Michelenburg-Union, which shows that Tarty expressed some support for the managed corridors, which means corridors operated using certain restrictions or paying fees. Mr. Fox asked Mayor Tarty about the construction of the I-77 corridors as orbital corridors. He replied that he had no concern about it, \"in accordance with minutes. Mr. Fox here is Anthony Fox. Represented Charlotte at the Michelenburg and Union District Planning Organization, and continued his work as United States Transport Secretary under the leadership of President Barack Obama. On May 24, 2013, during the first year of the state of Tarty as a member of the Senate, the drawings were called \"the least exhausting alternative\" to the expansion of I-77, according to Winston-Salem. In a 2018 telephone interview with Politi Fact, Tarty stated that he supported the fees before 2014 because the State said there were no other ways to fund the project. On June 14, 2014, in an e-mail exchange between Tarty and Anthony Tata, former Minister of Transport, Tata said to support the project. The e-mail, from Tarty on June 24, 2014, says: \"Jenna Wadsworth mentioned on January 26, 2021 in North Carolina's tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, won state-wide races more likely than anyone else alive. \u2022 1 February 2021: \"I request that the Auditor of our State, the elected officials of the National Assembly, selected by President Prue Tim as well as the President of the Council, be allowed to conduct a review of the contract between NCDOT and Cintra before authorizing the signing of this contract.\" Tarty got a reply from Tata, the same day he told a different story: \"At the close of the meeting, you indicated that you were satisfied that Project I-77 was a \"good deal for the state.\" These e-mails were noted in an audit issued by the Office of the State Auditor, Beth Wood, in June 2018. On July 1, 2014, Tarty wrote a newspaper article in Charlotte Over asking about Jove. Pat McCorrie to check the contract with Sintra correctly - a consistent message from Tarty. \"On the basis of information from NCDOT, I am still in favour of loss I-77 because this option solves the problem sooner rather than later and will generate additional dollars for local road projects,\" Tarty wrote in the article. \"Doing nothing is simply not an option.\" Tarty says in the article he's opposed to the contract with Sintra, but not with the fee. According to WFAE, a company affiliated with NPR, Tarty supported the idea of increasing the number of telephone lines assigned to the job. This article says again that Tarty has questions about the specific contract to be signed with Sintra. The high occupancy fee means that cars with a large number of passengers will be able to drive free of charge on the interstate highway. In the managed corridors built on I-77, the price of fees is free to fluctuate based on the number of cars. Any vehicle carrying three or more passengers will not have to pay the price. On 29 June 2015, Tarty told the Carolina newspaper that he intended to introduce a bill to stop the bill because most people opposed it, and there were new ways to finance the expansion of I-77 without using fees. In November 2015, Tarty was one of four legislators who wrote a letter to McCorry requesting the suspension of the project, according to the observer for Charlotte. They say the fees will be detrimental to the work in the area and the corridors have been built below the required level. December 11, 2015 My Tarty was described by Corrier Tribeon as someone who once supported the drawings. At this time, Tarty was asked by NCDOT to consider the entire state to see if there were other ways to finance the construction. 21 June 2016: An effort to stop the project in the General Assembly failed. Tarty expressed disappointment to Charlotte's observer. The article says that Tarty planned to introduce a bill in the next session to try to stop the bill again. 24 June 2018 During the session earlier this year, senators approved a bill giving the Government. Roy Cooper until October to change the contract with Sintra or cancel it completely. Tarti was the sponsor of this bill. \"I don't support any charges,\" said Tarty in a telephone interview with WSOC-TV. Our judgment: Tarty says that he originally supported the use of fees to pay for the expansion of I-77 because it did not offer her other options. On the basis of his public statements, he consistently opposed the contract with Sintra and requested an examination of the contract. However, this does not change the fact that he has moved from a fee subsidy to a total resistance. We evaluate this a full flop.
