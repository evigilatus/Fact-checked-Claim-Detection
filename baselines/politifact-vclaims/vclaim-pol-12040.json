Sherrod Brown.\n\nThe ad, broadcast statewide, made a series of claims about last year\u2019s health care law, including one that takes aim at the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which the law created to suggest ways to limit Medicare\u2019s spending growth.\n\nThe IPAB, it says, is \"a Medicare IRS with the power to cut Medicare to pay for new government programs.\"\n\nThe group behind the ad is so taken with the Medicare-IRS analogy that it has established a website devoted to that theme which claims IPAB is \u00a0\"in effect, a kind of Medicare IRS that will cut payment rates to doctors and nursing homes.\"\n\nPolitiFact has already ruled on some other claims in the ad. We thought this one was worth a look, too.\n\nFor starters, it\u2019s useful to touch on some of those earlier claims.\n\nPolitiFact has repeatedly examined the claim that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will cut $500 billion from Medicare and rated it Mostly False. A review of the claim from an earlier 60 Plus ad noted, \"the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, it attempts to slow the program\u2019s future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase - the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.\"\n\nPolitiFact has repeatedly rated past claims that IPAB has the power to ration care or deny specific treatments to patients False. A PolitiFact examination of a claim by presidential candidate Michele Bachmann noted IPAB is forbidden from submitting \"any recommendation to ration health care,\" as Section 3403 of the health care law states.\n\nThat\u2019s significant given the claim in the new 60 Plus ad that the IPAD has \"the power to cut Medicare.\"\n\nIf growth in Medicare spending is projected to exceed certain targets, IPAB must come up with plans to slow that increase, but it can only suggest changes to Medicare. \u00a0If Congress does not act on its recommendations within a set time frame, those recommendations are automatically implemented. But the decision is in the hands of Congress. The law permits Congress to come up with equal cost reductions of its own, or vote to disregard the recommendations outright by a three-fifths majority.\n\n\"The IPAB is specifically forbidden from making any recommendations that would ration care, reduce benefits, raise premiums or cost-sharing or alter eligibility for Medicare,\" HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told the House Energy and Commerce Committee this July. \"And all final decisions remain in the hands of Congress. If Medicare costs are rising at an unsustainable rate, it\u2019s Congress\u2019s choice whether to accept those recommendations or come up with recommendations of its own to put Medicare spending on a stable, sustainable path.\"\n\nPolitFact Ohio was puzzled by the ad\u2019s comparison of IPAB to the Internal Revenue Service. IPAB is a 15-member board that\u2019s supposed to suggest ways to reduce growth in Medicare spending. IRS is a mammoth government agency that collects taxes, enforces the tax laws set by Congress, and helps taxpayers understand and comply with those laws. So we asked 60 Plus spokesman Gerry Scimeca to explain the similarities.\n\nScimeca said that both groups are intimidating bureaucracies that operate in secret and make decisions that dramatically affect the lives of average Americans.\n\n\"IPAB will unilaterally render a sentence affecting all seniors on Medicare, impacting what remedies are available to seniors in need of health care, and giving bureaucrats immense power over available remedies and their costs,\" Scimeca said in an email. \"Like the IRS, IPAB will operate in secret, will have vast powers to reach into our lives, and will have the final, irrefutable say on Medicare policy.\"\n\nBut that description simply is not accurate.\n\nThe IPAB appointments will be done in public. Members will be chosen by the president, with confirmation from the Senate. It would not have the power to issue edicts. Rather, it can only make recommendations. That those findings can be overruled by Congress hardly makes its rulings \"unilateral\" or \"final,\" as Scimeca says.\n\nThe functions of IRS and IPAB are entirely unrelated. Some taxpayers may consider the IRS to be scary and 60 Plus may be scared by IPAB. But that does not make IPAB board a \"Medicare IRS.\"\n\nIn the late 1950s, Elvis Presley, whose repertoire included the hit \"Burning Love,\" eclipsed Boone in popularity. Boone\u2019s website proudly notes that Presley once opened at one of Boone\u2019s concerts.\n\n\"Thank God I had a couple of hit records then and I was the star that night. I never followed Elvis again!\" Boone says on the website.\n\nIf he were the speaker here, rather than just the spokesman, he\u2019d be following Elvis\u2019 \"Burning Love\" with his own fiery song, \"Burning Pants.\"\n\nThe claim by 60 Plus Association is not only inaccurate, it\u2019s ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12040"}
