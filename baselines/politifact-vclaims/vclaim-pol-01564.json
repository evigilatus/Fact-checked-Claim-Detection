The same drug that is killing Ohioans every day. Cordray\u2019s plan would create a safe haven for drug dealers.\"\nThe ad refers to Corday\u2019s support for Issue 1, a constitutional amendment that would reduce possession offenses to misdemeanors. DeWine, the attorney general, opposes the amendment. The question will appear on the November ballot when DeWine and Cordray face off for governor.\nWe found that DeWine miscasts what the amendment would do and omits what Cordray has said about drug dealers.\nKey takeaways:\n\u2022 This isn\u2019t \"Cordray\u2019s plan,\" although he supports the amendment.\n\u2022 Cordray has said drug dealers should serve long sentences.\n\u2022 The amendment reduces possession of drugs to a misdemeanor.\n\u2022 The amendment states that drug trafficking would remain a felony.\nIssue 1 on November ballot\nIf adopted, the amendment would reclassify drug possession -- including fentanyl -- as a misdemeanor and prohibit jail time until an individual's third offense within two years. Also, those already convicted of possession could ask a court to reduce their conviction to a misdemeanor. Felons, with some exceptions for certain offenses, could get a 25 percent reduction in prison time if they participate in rehabilitative, work or educational programs.\nMoney that is saved from imprisonment would go toward rehabilitation and crime victim funds.\nBut the amendment doesn\u2019t let drug traffickers, a.k.a. dealers, off the hook. It states that the misdemeanor provisions \"do not apply to convictions for the sale, distribution, or trafficking of drugs\" or for convictions based on volume or weight that were classified as a first-, second-, or third-degree felony offense.\nThat leaves fourth- and fifth-degree felony possessions to be reclassified misdemeanors, which the DeWine campaign says would include fentanyl, which is deadly in small amounts.\nDeWine\u2019s campaign points to an op-ed against the amendment by Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court Maureen O\u2019Connor who said an offender charged with possession of 19 grams of fentanyl would only receive a misdemeanor. Since the lethal dose of fentanyl is just 2 milligrams, 19 grams of fentanyl is enough to kill about 10,000 people, she wrote.\nBut the key here is the word \"possession.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefendants who deal drugs can still be charged with felony trafficking, said Ohio State University Law professor Doug Berman, executive director of the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center.\n\"This is not about giving drug dealers a break; this is about freeing up resources to provide treatment to reduce the demand for the drugs,\" Berman said.\nThe amendment will make prosecutors jobs harder -- they will no longer be able to only charge defendants with possession and send them to prison. Instead, they will have to prove trafficking, which involves additional elements beyond just merely possession -- and would mean that prosecutors would be putting their undercover officers on the stand.\nOhio Prosecuting Attorneys Association argues the amendment may prevent felony charges for traffickers \"who deliberately deal in small amounts so that they can assert simple possession as a defense.\"\nKenneth R. Bailey\u2028, president of the Ohio Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said someone caught with a small amount of fentanyl could be charged with misdemeanor possession. But DeWine still isn\u2019t telling the full story.\n\"In practice, trafficking is an often used companion charge to possession,\" Bailey said. \"If Issue 1 passes, there is nothing that prevents a prosecutor from bringing the misdemeanor possession count with a companion felony trafficking (charge).\"\nGenerally, trafficking is not defined by the amount of the drug, but the purpose for which the possessor is going to use the drug, he said. In one case, a defendant was charged with trafficking for 10 grams of heroin and aggravated trafficking for possessing a bag containing less than a gram of heroin and fentanyl.\nThe defense lawyers association is supporting Issue 1 with reservations, including the form of its implementation as an amendment and the removal of judicial discretion.\nCordray\u2019s comments about the amendment\nDeWine\u2019s ad says it is \"Cordray\u2019s plan\" to let the drug dealers go free.\nWhile Cordray has stated support for Issue 1, it isn\u2019t his plan. Advocates collected signatures to place it on the ballot.\nAlso, DeWine is ignoring that Cordray has distinguished between penalties he wants to see for users and drug dealers.\nCordray has said, \"As governor, I will work with law enforcement to make sure drug dealers are convicted and serve long prison sentences, while people who need substance abuse treatment can get it in our communities.\"\nAt least 11 states as of January 2018 have lowered some drug possession crimes from a felony to a misdemeanor, said Alison Lawrence, who tracks drug laws for the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nOur ruling\nDeWine\u2019s ad says Cordray\u2019s \"plan would allow drug dealers to remain on our streets.\"\nIssue 1 would lower possession to a misdemeanor and prohibit jail time until an individual's third offense within two years. That could apply to someone in possession of fentanyl, which is deadly in small amounts. Cordray supports the amendment, but it's a far stretch to call it his plan.\u00a0Most importantly,\u00a0the amendment still leaves drug trafficking as a felony, and that includes trafficking of fentanyl. Nothing about the proprosal allows drug dealers to remain on the streets if prosecutors prove the charge in a court of law.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim False.\n\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/42acfe10-9795-4cb6-a455-87bfe9d9f207", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01564"}
