Scott Walker and\u00a0\"so far in 2015 over 6,685 people have been laid off, already more than in all of 2014.\"", "truth_label": "false", "date": "stated on July 1, 2015 in a website posting:", "title": "American Bridge 21st Century says layoffs show economy has tanked under Scott Walker", "text": "Job creation was the No. 1 issue for Republican Scott Walker in his first term as Wisconsin governor, and the state\u2019s economic performance will be examined in depth as his presidential campaign gets underway.\nThe left-leaning American Bridge 21st Century tried to kick-start that conversation with a blog post July 1, 2015 that carried this headline: \u00a0\"Walker\u2019s economy gets worse.\"\nThe item said: \"Scott Walker\u2019s Wisconsin: So far in 2015 over 6,685 people have been laid off, already more than in all of 2014.\"\nIt continued: \"How much has Scott Walker tanked Wisconsin\u2019s economy? In addition to having the slowest job growth in the Midwest, Wisconsin layoff notices just passed the total layoffs in all of 2014 and are set to be the highest of Walker\u2019s tenure by 4,000.\"\nThat\u2019s a lot of baggage to unpack.\nWe have done numerous items about Scott Walker and jobs, this is the first about layoffs.\nIs the group right that layoffs for 2015 have surpassed those in 2014, and that the situation is evidence the economy has \"tanked\"?\nHow the system works\nIn Wisconsin, businesses are required to file warning notices with the state when they anticipate ending employment for more than 50 workers. Wisconsin\u2019s law is more strict than federal law, which requires notices for layoffs of more than 100 workers.\nAs part of its claim, American Bridge linked to a June 30, 2015 report by WKOW-TV in Madison, which compared the number of people covered by layoff warning notices received by the state so far in 2015 with those for all of 2014.\nWhen we looked at the state Department of Workforce Development web site, we could not find the same numbers, but did see the same trend. \u00a0As of July 8, 2015, the tally for 2015 was 8,627, compared with 7,239 in all of 2014.\nBut the warning notices are a lousy tool to assess the economy -- and especially employment.\nWhy? Some layoffs never trigger a notice, because they don\u2019t reach the 50 person threshold. Also, the notices don\u2019t always mean lost jobs. In cases when a company changes hands, the old firm is required to file a notice, even if all the workers will retain their jobs with the new firm.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it is wrong to equate the notices with bodies out the door, as American Bridge did.\nThe \"data is interesting, but not very useful,\" said Brian Jacobsen, an economist at Wells Fargo and a professor at Wisconsin Lutheran College. \"If you think about the number of employees affected, it's relatively small.\"\nJacobsen noted layoffs are sometimes announced and then phased in over a number of years.\n\"Thankfully, some of those notices change, resulting in fewer employees being affected,\" he said. \"Some employers may err on the side of giving a warning even if there is a chance the layoffs won't occur.\"\nAnother factor that the layoff notices don\u2019t reflect is the number of jobs that have been added to the economy.\nBased on the most solid numbers available, through the first four months of 2015, state private sector employers added 13,300 jobs. That compares with 10,600 jobs in the same time frame in 2014. (Numbers for May are preliminary)\nOther indicators also suggest more of an upswing rather than a tumble.\n-- The Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce economic trends report from July 1, 2015. \"Currently the metro area\u2019s economic environment is marked by a solid majority of indicators in aggregate pointing upward, led largely by an improving job situation,\" said Bret Mayborne, the MMAC\u2019s economic research director. \u00a0\"In addition, local housing and real estate indicators have been contributing to this growth trend over the past nine months.\"\n-- The most recent quarterly survey by ManpowerGroup Inc. Issued June 8, 2015, the report said employers in Wisconsin as well as the Milwaukee metro area expect \"bullish\" and \"prosperous\" hiring prospects in the coming quarter.\nOur rating\nAmerican Bridge 21st Century says that Wisconsin\u2019s economy tanked under Scott Walker and uses layoff notices filed with the state as evidence.\nBut the notices do not represent bodies out the door and, though higher than last year, they are not a reliable economic indicator. \u00a0Indeed, other reports say that employers overall added about 13,000 jobs in the first five months of the year, a pace higher than a year ago.\nWe rate the claim False.\n(Editor's note: The paragraph about 2015 job totals was edited for clarity, to reflect the figure is for the first four months of 2015 -- the ones for which final monthly numbers are available. Final numbers for May 2015 are not available.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06212"}
