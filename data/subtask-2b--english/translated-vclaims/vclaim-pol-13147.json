Indeed, as the President said, Bin Laden also declared war on Pakistan. He had ordered the killing of many innocent Pakistani men, women and children.\" In an interview by CNN on 3 May, Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough discussed Al-Qaida's terrorist acts against the Pakistani army and also referred to how \"we saw in 2007 when Al-Qaida declared war on Pakistan\" could Bin Laden have declared war on the same country he was living in? We went to the news archives for September 2007, when Bin Laden issued the video message supporting Obama &apos; s and Clinton &apos; s claim. However, the news is not about a public declaration of war against Pakistan, but rather that Bin Laden called for jihad, or holy war, against General Pervez Musharraf, who was then the President of Pakistan, and called him \"tyrant\" and \"rebellion.\" Bin Laden hated Musharraf because the Pakistani leader had an alliance with the West - especially the United States - and against Al-Qaida. After Pakistani forces broke into a mosque in Islamabad, the newspaper Daily Telegraph in London quoted Bin Laden as saying: \"Pervez, his ministers, his soldiers and his associates are all partners in spilling the blood of the Muslims who have been killed... He who knowingly and willingly helps him is as ungrateful as he is. According to a story in the Chicago Tribune on September 21, 2007, Bin Laden said that the military siege of the mosque \"prove the determination of Ashraf to continue loyalties and subjugate him and his aid to America against Muslims... and to make the armed rebellion against him and his removal mandatory.\" According to the Daily Telegraph, Al-Qaida issued a second statement in 2007 from Bin Laden &apos; s deputy, Ayman al-Zuhari, in which it stated that the break-in of the mosque \"discovered the vileness, betrayal and betrayal of an honorable Pakistani... Pakistan is Muslim territory, and the honorable forces hunt dogs under the Bush cross.\" Was the declaration of war against Musharraf and the Pakistani army, which he himself supported, the declaration of war against the entire nation? The analysts we met had a range of views on this point. \"This would constitute a declaration of war in my opinion,\" said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorist expert at Georgetown University. \"In fact, one is stronger than our secular conceptions of war as this would hold theology and religious responsibility.\" But Sadand Domi, a fellow resident of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said there was a \"very big difference\" between the proclamation of the Holy War against Musharraf and the declaration of the war against Pakistan as a whole. Dummy said that the statements made by President Obama and Minister Clinton were clearly aimed at easing tensions between the United States and Pakistan, as Pakistan remained a key ally in the region, particularly with the ongoing war in neighbouring Afghanistan. But, Dhume said, comments \"are inconsistent with the facts on the ground.\" \"Ben Laden has not declared war on Pakistan,\" said Dhume. \"He was opposed to an honorary.\" After the attacks of 11 September, he was considered a major ally of the United States in the fight against terrorism, in particular Al-Qaida. With the United States sending some $20 billion in foreign aid to Pakistan since 2001, Domie said that a supervisor cooperated with the United States \"to some extent\" against Al-Qaida elements in Pakistan. For example, the alleged mastermind of the 11 September attacks, Khaled Sheikh Muhammad, was arrested by the Pakistani Intelligence Agency in Pakistan in 2003 and handed over to the United States authorities. Dhami said that Bin Laden had always opposed the leaders of Islamic nations who had been perceived as sympathetic to the United States. \"There was no declaration of war against Pakistan,\" he said. \"Think about it rationally.\" Why does Al Qaeda declare war against Pakistan? They declared war against a leader who thought it was an American puppet. You have to look at it through their ideology. For them, it's about the biggest, sacred world war.\" He noted that many Al-Qaida supporters were Pakistanis. In 2007, Chicago Tribune's story of Bin Laden's registered message indicated that a survey of Pakistanis at that time found that Bin Laden had a higher degree of consent than Musharraf - 46 per cent to 38 per cent. \"I understand why Obama said what he said,\" said Dhomme. \"If Obama described things as they really are, the anger of the American public towards Pakistan would be greater.\" Technically, Bin Laden did not declare war against countries, but instead against governments and regimes, Laura Mansfield, the counter-terrorism analyst, said. \"But I'm not sure there's any discrimination there,\" she said, or if there is, it's discrimination without much difference, because the Bin Laden Declaration resulted in terrorist attacks against both the Pakistani army and Pakistani civilians. \"Ben Laden had an agenda to remove all secular leaders from Islamic countries and replace them with leaders of Islamic law,\" said Mansfield. bin Laden may have been more careful about statements of jihad against the leaders of Islamic countries than against the countries themselves, but this does not seem to have been translated into his data on the United States. For the United States, his anger was often directed more generally at Americans than at its leaders or Government. For example, on February 23, 1998, \"Fatwa\" signed by bin Laden and others on behalf of the World Islamic Front, called \"Jehad against Jews and Crusades,\" stated that \"the killing of Americans and their allies - civilians and military - is an individual duty of every Muslim who can do so in any country where it can do so.\" Once again, Obama and Clinton said \"bin Laden has declared war against Pakistan.\" In fact, Bin Laden declared a holy war against the then President of Pakistan, Musharraf, because of his cooperation with the United States in its war against Al-Qaida. It is clear that Bin Laden had some support in Pakistan (Exhibit A: this was his last hiding place). In the end, we believe that there are credible arguments to be made that there is little distinction between a declaration of holy war against the leader of the country and the army against the country itself. However, contrary to his declared holy war against America, Bin Laden was seeking to ignite a revolution in Pakistan against Musharraf, so that he could be replaced by an Islamic leader. And so we rule Obama's half-right statement. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13147"}
