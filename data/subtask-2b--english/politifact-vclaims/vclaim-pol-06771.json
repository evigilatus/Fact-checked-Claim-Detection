CNN ran a full-page ad in the New York Times on Jan. 29 to crow, \"CNN\u2019S New Day beat MSNBC\u2019S Morning Joe for the 4th month in a row in Total Viewers and 7th month in a row among Adults 25-54.\"\nTo rub more salt in the wound, the ad added,\u00a0\"HLN\u2019S Morning Express beat MSNBC\u2019S Morning Joe for the 9th month in a row among Adults 25-54.\"\nSoon after he got off the air, Scarborough, the co-host of Morning Joe, shot back in a tweet: \"Cute ad but CNN is firing people. Morning Joe is hiring. Oh yeah. And more people have watched Morning Joe than CNN & HLN 5 years in a row.\"\nA reader asked us if Scarborough was on solid ground. Has his show topped CNN and HLN in the morning time slot? And if Scarborough is right, does that mean CNN is wrong?\nNot necessarily.\nWhen you pick apart the details in each claim, you find that both have merit.\nNeel Khairzada, director of communications for CNN, basically said as much.\n\"The difference in the claims is that New Day is going by the coveted 25-54 demo, which is the metric advertisers care about, and Joe is tweeting about total viewers,\" Khairzada told PunditFact.\nPunditFact got the monthly Nielsen numbers for the three morning shows.

For adults 25-54, New Day did better in the past seven months, and Morning Express did better in the past nine. In terms of total viewers, the numbers jump around. Sometimes Morning Joe wins the time slot, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. \nHowever, you can also use the Nielsen data to tell a different story that paints a stronger picture for Morning Joe.\nPunditFact got the average daily viewers each year (not by month) for Morning Joe and the CNN programs.

Based on all viewers in the course of a year, including those as young as 2, his program comes out on top for the past five years. It\u2019s a mixed bag in the 25-54 demographic.\nThis sort of ratings battle is old hat to James Webster, a professor at Northwestern University\u2019s School of Communications. Webster told PunditFact that this sort of squabble over who is in the lead happens pretty regularly.\n\"They are both looking at numbers that work to their advantage,\" Webster said.\nAnother communications researcher, Bob Thompson at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, saw a certain vagueness in Scarborough\u2019s tweet. The reference to CNN is broad, Thompson said, and he was confident Scarborough was looking beyond a narrow demographic.\n\"The \u2018more people\u2019 gives no demographic qualification, so his claim here is for total viewers,\" Thompson said.\nWebster cautioned that small differences of a few thousand viewers might not be statistically significant.\n\"Technically, you can claim victory but these surveys only measure a tiny sample of the viewing audience and that means they are subject to large sampling errors,\" Webster said.\nFor example, for the 25-54 age group in September 2014, CNN was ahead by 2,000 viewers, but statistically, that was a tie with MSNBC.\nWebster said consistent trends provide the most reliable perspective. We took the yearly averages, the framework most favorable to MSNBC, and looked at the difference each year in total audience. Over the past three years, CNN and HLN have greatly narrowed the gap with MSNBC. There\u2019s a similar trend in the 25 to 54 age group, and by the most conservative interpretation of the numbers, the three programs tied in 2014.\nOur ruling\nScarborough tweeted that more people have watched Morning Joe than CNN and HLN 5 years in a row. In the most general sense, the average daily audience each year for anyone 2\u00a0years old and up, he is correct.\nBut there are many other ways to slice the apple that paint a more complicated ratings picture. Looking at the more valuable television demographic for advertisers, 25-to-54-year-olds, MSNBC has been in a dogfight with CNN and HLN. And more recent month-by-month data shows CNN clearly is gaining ground and has surpassed Morning Joe.\nScarborough\u2019s claim is literally accurate, but experts we consulted said it\u2019s a bit deceiving given the other data that exists.\nThat most closely fits our definition of Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06771"}
