In a further examination of the facts, we looked at the first half of this allegation, that Democrats voted to ban glowing lamps (and evaluated them with pants on fire). In this item. We will address safety issues with regard to curly fluorescent lamps and whether the small amount of mercury they contain represents an environmental hazard in the home. First, let us take a look at the arguments contained in AmeriPAC &apos; s letter and the arguments of the Centre for the Defence of the Free Employment Foundation. The letter states that people will be asked to \"send\" their glowing lamps when the new law enters into force (a claim that we evaluated the pants on fire) and replace them with \"environmentally safe\" integrated fluorescent lamps (a claim that we evaluated barely correctly). \"I'm saying \"presumably\" because the only thing that doesn't be CFLs is \"environmental integrity,\" Ron Arnold wrote from the Centre for the Defense of the Free Enterprise. The letter then conveys a tale that made the wife of Maine Brandy Bridge a poster child of the CFL movement. \"Just ask Ellsworth, the housewife of Maine, Brandy Bridge, who dropped and smashed a fluorescent flashlight on the tight ground in her daughter's bedroom,\" says CDFE. \"Knowing that the CFL is potentially dangerous, Bridges contacted the local house warehouse store for advice. Home Depot told her that the CFL contained mercury and advised her to contact the poison control hotline. Now remember, this is the replacement of the light bulb you've been using for the rest of your lives. You know... you drop one on the floor. It's breaking. What are you doing? Get a broom and dust fry and sweep it up. What happened when Brandy Bridges called the tox screen? \"The hotline had contact with the Department of Environmental Protection of Maine. The Department of Environmental Protection sent Andrew Smith, toxicologist, home. Close the room in plastic and tell Bridges it's gonna cost about $2,000 to clean up the mess. However, when I followed up on CNN's story on 3 September 2009, he concluded that the fear generated by the story was greatly exaggerated. Mine officials said they gave Bridges bad advice and eventually came to her house and cut off the carpet. \"When the bridge issue was contacted, Maine officials said advice to get a professional hazardous waste cleaner and remove the carpet was presented before a complete policy on fluorescent was developed,\" CNN tells the story. \"They no longer tell people to call the Hazmat crew or remove carpets unless the owner of the house is particularly interested.\" Environmental officials in Maine, who are still an enthusiastic supporter of sulphur fluoride use, have also studied the issue of mercury emissions from broken sulphur fluoride and published recommendations on how to clean them if they are broken. For example, it was recommended that index cards or play cards be used to pick up broken pieces of the lamp (not empty, because this could spread mercury dust). Then put the waste in a glass jar and take it to the recycling center. They also recommend that the room be ventilated for several hours by opening windows. \"Our advice, if you have one of them broken, just clean it up and get it out of the house,\" said Dr. Deborah Rice of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. \"mercury is no doubt toxic. But the amount of that in CFLs is too small.\" It also tells people not to put the CFLS in rooms where a little kid might knock on the lamp. The message of the Conference also quotes the story of San Jos\u00e9 Mercury, which began on 3 April 2011: the rapid transformation of the State from glowing lamps to a new generation of energy-efficient lighting is of environmental concern - the release of tons of mercury each year. The new, most popular light -- the rib lamp, the compressed fluorescent lamp, or CFL -- represents a quarter of the new lamp sales and each one contains up to 5 milligrams of mercury, The demand for these lamps is increasing with the entry into force of federal and energy-efficient lighting states, yet only about 2 per cent of resident consumers and one third of businesses are recycled, according to the LED. \"If the recycling rate remains as low as it is, there will certainly be more mercury released into the environment,\" said Paul Abernathy, Executive Director of the Napa-based Recycling Association. \"In order for the public to really have a comfortable way to bring them back, it will be a problem.\" However, the Conference on Disarmament does not include a subsequent passage in the article \"Mercury News\" that gives a balanced weight to the concerns raised about the small levels of mercury in sulphur fluoride: even with concern about mercury for sulphur fluoride, it continues to ultimately lead to lower mercury emissions than incandescent lamps, according to the California Energy Commission. Although old lamps do not contain any mercury, they are often operated by coal-fired power plants -- which release mercury as a pollutant. The end result is that mercury emissions per lamp are about 40 per cent lower when energy-efficient electromagnetic lamps are used, according to EPA figures. In fact, incandescent light bulbs lead to more mercury being introduced into the environment, because they require four times the amount of electricity to run, and much of that electricity comes from coal-fired power plants that release mercury into the air, as Noah Horowitz, a large scientist in the Council for the Defence of Natural Resources, said. Horowitz said, \"If you're really interested in mercury,\" \"You really have to buy CFLs even though they have small amounts of mercury in them.\" Allegations of safety concerns in the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) were \"absolutely exaggerated.\" \"They have very low levels of mercury, and that's true,\" said Horowitz. \"But it's still in the lamp when you use them. When you're done with them, you have to recycle them.\" And now there are many places to recycle consumer CFLs from there only two years ago, as he said. For example, Home depot and Loee both allow people to bring consumer CFLs there for free recycling, even non-customers. He said that CFCs generally had about half the amount of mercury they contained a few years earlier. Moreover, he said, there was nothing in the law that required people to buy the Armed Forces of Liberia. The halogen lamps companies have also developed incandescent lamps that meet new efficiency requirements; fluorescent lightbulb technology is another option. Neither of these types of lamps contains mercury. It is misleading to warn of the small amount of mercury in electromagnetic lamps without also noting that less efficient lamps require more electricity and lead to more mercury in the environment, as Stephen Waddle, Executive Director of the American Energy Efficiency Council, said. \"They say, do you say, part of the story,\" said a waiter. It is clear that the letter's tone is designed to increase concerns about the Armed Forces of Liberia in an attempt to support an argument about the overregulation of the Government. Mercury is in fact a toxic substance, and sulphur fluoride contains a small amount of mercury (part of the quantity in the mercury thermometer). However, government and environmental officials say that the risk they pose is very small, especially if the lamps are properly disposed of and cleaned properly if they are destroyed. Moreover, warnings do not recognize that there is a price to be paid to hold on to less efficient conventional light bulbs. These lamps need more electricity to power them, and if operated by coal-fired power plants, they lead to more mercury being released into the environment. We value the claim half right. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13048"}
