After watching\u00a0the video, which was from a website called SourceFed, Fox News\u2019 chief judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano accused Google of hiding Clinton\u2019s problems.\n\"The clip that we just ran is the result of a very extensive test, an examination, about whether or not attempts to find things like, \u2018crime,\u2019 \u2018criminal activity,\u2019 \u2018indictment,\u2019 have been filtered out by Google, and we know that it has,\" Napolitano said.\nWe wanted to find out for ourselves if Google manipulates search suggestions in favor of Clinton.\nNapolitano did not return emails seeking comment.\nThe SourceFed video, posted on YouTube June 9, shows how certain terms, when searched with Clinton\u2019s name, don\u2019t autocomplete as suggestions underneath the search bar.\nFor example, when users search \"Hillary Clinton cri,\" the suggested searches are \"Hillary Clinton crime reform,\" \"Hillary Clinton crisis,\" \"Hillary Clinton criticizes obama 2008\" and so on.\nNo suggestions for \"Hillary Clinton crime\" itself.\n\nHowever, Bing and Yahoo bring up \"crimes\" and related returns when you search \"Hillary Clinton cri.\"\n\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s going on?\nSearching for the truth\nSourceFed clarified its original video with another one June 10, which included comment from Google denying the accusation. CNN Money also put its two-cents in the mix, saying Google\u2019s algorithm was set up to filter-out offensive information.\nIn a statement, a Google spokesperson says the filter \"operates according to the same rules, no matter who the person is.\"\n\"The autocomplete algorithm is designed to avoid completing a search for a person\u2019s name with terms that are offensive or disparaging,\" the statement says. \"We made this change a while ago following feedback that Autocomplete too often predicted offensive, hurtful or inappropriate queries about people.\"\nThe statement linked to a Vox article that refutes the idea Google is manipulating autocomplete in favor of Hillary Clinton. The article says that most people who are accused of crimes\u00a0but were not convicted\u00a0will not show up in suggestions.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe wanted to test Vox\u2019s theory, so we searched \"Casey Anthony cri\" and \"George Zimmerman cri.\" Both were suspects in criminal murder investigations and were acquitted. The autocomplete yielded no suggestions.\n\u00a0\n\nWe wanted to try other presidential candidates and common allegations against them.\nWhen we searched \"Donald Trump fraud,\" no suggestions came up. When we searched \"Bernie Sanders communist,\" two suggestions appeared, but only when we spelled out \"communist.\" \"Bernie Sanders arrest\" didn\u2019t yield any results either.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA search of \u2018Donald Trump rac\u2019 does yield arguably offensive suggestions.\n\nExperts told PolitiFact that Google\u2019s autocomplete algorithm is not out-of-the ordinary for popular search engines.\n\"Google is the market leader among search engines by far, so its actions have a much larger impact than those of other search engines,\" said Susan Worst, a lecturer in computer science at Boston University said. \"That it would be leading the way in modifying its autocomplete algorithm is not unusual at all.\"\nWorst cited an instance last year when Google made corrections to its algorithms after its photo recognition project delivered racist results to users.\nFor many years, autocomplete algorithms were based on what others have typed in the past, but the possibility of Google changing its algorithm to detect offensive term suggestions isn\u2019t that surprising, said Marti Hearst, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. She said major search engines update algorithms frequently to assimilate to the \"changing online environment.\"\n\"Algorithms have to be clever to show the best few choices, according to very complex measures of \u2018best,' \" Hearst said. \"No doubt there are filters for curse words, and as time has gone by and the tenor of our times are getting more divisive, I would not be surprised if an algorithm has been developed to detect terms that feel offensive to a large segment of the population.\"\nOur ruling\nNapolitano accused America's most popular search engine, Google, of scrubbing search suggestions in favor of Clinton. Although it is clear Google\u2019s algorithm is different from Bing or Yahoo, it still isn\u2019t correct to describe the difference as evidence of Google\u2019s support of Clinton.\nGoogle\u2019s suggested searches, for the most part, avoid offensive suggestions for everyone, not just Clinton. \u00a0\nNapolitano\u2019s claim has a thread of truth, but it leaves out key details that would give the reader a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4b442b95-e20a-4768-babf-61ed5ba7062f", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04791"}
