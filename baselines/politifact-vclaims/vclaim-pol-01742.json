Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2018\n\n\nIs it true that \"most of that money goes to the players,\" as Trump said?\u00a0As it turns out, players do not make most of the money, although the players\u2019 percentage is not far below 50 percent. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)\nThe revenue split between the players and the owners is negotiated through a collective bargaining agreement. The current agreement was negotiated in 2011, and it will be in force through 2021.\nAccording to the NFL summary of the current agreement, the \"player share must average at least 47 percent for the 10-year term of the agreement.\"\nWhen we checked with the NFL Players Association, the players\u2019 union, they confirmed that the current players\u2019 share is 48.5 percent of all league revenue, including local revenue and media deals. Spokeswoman Erin Hayes added that the percentage \"fluctuates between 47 percent and 48.5 percent, but right now it\u2019s 48.5 percent.\" (The NFL did not respond to inquiries.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NFL doesn\u2019t release overall financial data, but media reports have estimated what the league\u2019s 32 teams make by using data released by the Green Bay Packers, a publicly owned team that is required to release financial information annually.\nIn 2017, the NFL ownership kept a little more than $8 billion in revenue for themselves, while the players took a little less than $8 billion, according to such accounts. The owners\u2019 share was up by 4.9 percent, a rise largely attributed to a new, more generous contract for Thursday Night Football broadcasts.\nThis is a substantial percentage, but it doesn\u2019t meet even the most generous definition of \"most,\" which would be anything higher than 50 percent.\nTrump\u2019s statement \"is wrong. Players do not receive most of the money,\" said David Berri, a Southern Utah University economist and a past president of the North American Association of Sports Economics.\nDaniel Kaplan, who covers the NFL for SportsBusiness Journal and SportsBusiness Daily, agreed that Trump\u2019s assertion is incorrect and even suggested that the 47 percent figure may be high.\nKaplan has previously written that the NFL\u2019s revenue figures \"are incomplete, as the league does not share every penny with the players, shielding hundreds of millions of dollars in areas such as stadium finance.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Most of that money (made by the NFL) goes to the players.\"\nAccording to the collective bargaining agreement now in force, the players are getting 48.5 percent of revenues, a number that can\u2019t average less than 47 percent in the 10-year life of the agreement.
