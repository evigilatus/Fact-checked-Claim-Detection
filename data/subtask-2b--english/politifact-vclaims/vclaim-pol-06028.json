Is he right?", "text": "Live from somewhere in Iowa, Gov. Scott Walker stepped off the campaign stump for a phone interview with Glenn Beck, a nationally syndicated conservative radio talk show host.\n\u00a0\nWhile rattling off a series of reforms since he became governor in 2010, Walker circled back to one of his favorite talking points: tax cuts.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"By the end of this budget I\u2019m in right now, taxes will have been cut $4.7 billion in my state,\" Walker said in the Aug. 17, 2015 interview.\n\u00a0\nLast year, we checked a claim from Walker that tax cuts for his first term tallied $2 billion. We rated that True, based on numbers from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which is considered the gold standard on state fiscal matters.\n\u00a0\nNow that some time has passed, and the boasted-about number is $2.7 billion larger, we thought we\u2019d do some updated bean counting.\n\u00a0\n$4.7 billion\n\u00a0\nWe recently dealt with the tax-cut picture under Walker in rating one of his 2014 campaign promises -- return any surplus to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts -- as In the Works.\n\u00a0\nThe item noted that a fiscal bureau estimate said that between 2015 and 2017, the impact of cuts by Walker and Republican lawmakers to sales, franchise, property and other taxes are expected to total $2.8 billion. That period represents the current two-year budget.\n\u00a0\nThe vast majority of that total comes from the continuing impact of cuts from Walker\u2019s first term, such as a 2011 manufacturing and industry tax cut, and a 2013 income and property tax cut.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNew cuts in the 2015-\u201917 budget are projected to reduce taxes by $213 million by 2017, according to the fiscal bureau. Of course, the numbers are projections. So the total once the current two-year budget ends June 30, 2017 may vary.\n\u00a0\nWhen Walker number-dropped the $4.7 billion, he was mentioning reforms that have taken place since he took office, such as defunding Planned Parenthood (which he did in his first budget) and passing Act 10 (which he did in 2011).\n\u00a0\nSo it\u2019s clear he wasn\u2019t talking just about the current budget.\n\u00a0\nAdding Walker\u2019s first term cuts to the ones in the current budget, tax cuts are projected at more than $4.7 billion. To be exact: $4,756,630,000.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat gives Walker about $56 million in wiggle room.\n\u00a0\nJon Peacock, the director of Wisconsin Budget Project and research director at the left-leaning \u00a0Wisconsin Council of Children and Families, said the numbers Walker was relying on were solid.\n\u00a0\nBut he noted the numbers did not include several changes that resulted in increases, such as a reduction in the earned income tax credit and the homestead credit. Peacock estimates between 2011 and 2016, those increases will exceed $250 million.\n\u00a0\nFactor that in, and total tax cuts would be projected at about $4.5 billion.\n\u00a0\nOn the other hand, Walker\u2019s numbers are not adjusted for inflation, so the $4.7 billion in tax cuts would be even more if it were adjusted.\n\u00a0\nA final note: To be sure, tax cuts are just one part of the picture. To attain them, Walker\u2019s budgets have also included numerous -- and controversial -- cuts to education and other areas. But the claim is on the size of the tax cuts, and that is what we are evaluating.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOur rating\n\u00a0\nIn an interview with Glenn Beck, Walker said \"by the end of this budget I'm in right now, taxes will have been cut $4.7 billion in my state.\"\n\u00a0\nThat figure holds up, based on numbers from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\n\u00a0\nWe rate his claim True", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06028"}
