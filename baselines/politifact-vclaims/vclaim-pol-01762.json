But Beto is.\" Imagery shows Pelosi and O\u2019Rourke and what looks like a July 2018 Tribune excerpt stating: \"...I\u2019m open to doing that\u2026\"\nBy email, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Emily Miller pointed us to a July 1, 2018, Cruz press release taking note of the Tribune reporting that O\u2019Rourke had said he was open to abolishing Immigration & Customs Enforcement, an idea embraced\u00a0by some Democrats upset by actions including the separation of children and parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.\nMiller also pointed out a Cruz release noting that O\u2019Rourke on July 18, 2018 voted against a resolution offering support to ICE officers. O\u2019Rourke was among 34 Democrats to vote against the House-advanced resolution, which was described by The Hill, a Capitol newspaper, as a move by\u00a0Republicans to divide Democrats by holding a vote on\u00a0ICE's vitality to\u00a0public safety. \"Republicans have pounced on those Democrats seeking to abolish ICE,\" the Hill reported, \"accusing them of defending immigrants with no legal status \u2014 including violent criminals \u2014 instead of protecting the American public.\"\nSo, is O\u2019Rourke open to offing ICE?\nHe said as much in July 2018, we confirmed, though he also declared that he wouldn\u2019t support abolition without a plan to shift its responsibilities elsewhere. More recently, O\u2019Rourke has said abolition by itself doesn\u2019t make sense.\nO\u2019Rourke says he\u2019s open to abolition if duties transfer\nOur search for relevant news accounts led us to a July 2, 2018, Tribune news story quoting O\u2019Rourke initially saying at a San Antonio stop that he\u2019s open to doing away with ICE or changing how it performs and giving its enforcement duties to another entity--and, in the same appearance, saying he opposes abolishing ICE.\nFrom the story:\n\"Asked about abolishing ICE Friday at a town hall in San Antonio, O'Rourke discussed the need to eliminate fear in immigrant communities under Trump and to find a better way to enforce immigration laws. \u2018And if that involves doing away with this agency, giving that responsibility to somebody else, changing how this agency performs, I\u2019m open to doing that,\u2019 O\u2019Rourke said.\n\"Yet he went on to flatly answer no when directly asked if he would abolish ICE, explaining that he does not currently know enough about how immigration law would be enforced without the agency.\n\"\u2018I understand the urgency of this,\u2019 O\u2019Rourke said in conclusion. \u2018I just want to make sure that we\u2019re constructive in how we talk about meeting this challenge and that I understand what abolishing ICE would mean in terms of enforcing our laws going forward.\u2019\"\nThe day before, Tribune reporter Patrick Svitek posted a tweet quoting O\u2019Rourke at greater length.\nAccording to Svitek, O\u2019Rourke agreed with the individual who asked him about ICE that there\u2019s got \"to be a better way of enforcing our laws, not using those tactics that instill fear, that do not reflect the best of us, not separating children from their parents at the border and keeping them in cages. And so if there\u2019s another, better way to enforce our immigration laws--and I hope we\u2019re all on the same page that we want to make sure that laws are enforced, we want to make sure that our laws reflect who we are and that we change those laws to make sure that we make the most out of all of us--then I\u2019m open to that.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s reply went on: \"And if that involves doing away with this agency, giving that responsibility to somebody else, changing how this agency performs, I\u2019m open to doing that.\"\nNext, Svitek reported, someone asked: \"So would you abolish ICE?\" O\u2019Rourke replied, per the tweet: \"No. So let me be really clear: I don\u2019t know enough about how we would perform those same enforcement functions, if through another part of the Department of Homeland Security. But if you\u2019re saying abolish the tactics that I just described, yes. I don\u2019t know if you have to abolish the agency to do that\u2026\" He added: \"I just want to make sure that we\u2019re constructive in how we talk about meeting this challenge and that I understand what abolishing ICE would mean in terms of enforcing our laws going forward.\"\nOther news accounts\nNext we, searched the Nexis news database for instances of O\u2019Rourke speaking about ICE, finding:\n--A July 5, 2018, Longview News-Journal news story quoting O\u2019Rourke saying in a phone interview that he would join discussions of ICE\u2019s future and how it fulfills its mandate.\n--A July 6, 2018, Houston Chronicle news story stating O\u2019Rourke had stopped short of calling for ICE\u2019s elimination but was willing to discuss the idea. According to the story, O\u2019Rourke expressed a willingness after a stop in Hillsboro to discuss eliminating ICE, but he said that alone would not solve the problem. O\u2019Rourke said it doesn\u2019t matter if agencies like ICE and Homeland Security are eliminated if such moves don\u2019t address practices including the separation of children from parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. \"I want to make sure we are ending the practices of taking kids from their families,\" O\u2019Rourke said. \"I want to focus on ending the practices.\"\n--Most recently, O\u2019Rourke was asked in an interview posted online July 25, 2018: \"Some of your Democratic colleagues are saying just abolish ICE altogether. A bridge too far for you?\" O\u2019Rourke replied on ABC Radio\u2019s Powerhouse Politics Podcast: \"I just don\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s not clear to me what that would accomplish.\" O\u2019Rourke elaborated that abolishing the agency wouldn\u2019t solve the separation of children from parents or the deaths of migrants near the border. \"Abolishing ICE does nothing to solve any of those issues,\" O\u2019Rourke said, in contrast to making changes in federal policy.\nAd also touches impeachment, narcotics\nCruz\u2019s ad also says O\u2019Rourke supports impeaching President Donald Trump and suggested legalizing all narcotics including heroin--topics we\u2019ve explored.\nO\u2019Rourke said in an interview for Showtime\u2019s \"The Circus\" in May 2018 that he was willing then to vote to impeach Trump, which constitutionally occurs in the House, though he\u2019s since stressed that he\u2019s not campaigned for\u00a0impeachment proceedings to commence and he voted against a December 2017 impeachment resolution. This summer, we rated False a Cruz claim that O\u2019Rourke was the nation\u2019s only Senate candidate to call for impeaching Trump.\nOn his campaign website, O\u2019Rourke calls for ending the war on drugs and leaving marijuana regulation to the states. As a member of the El Paso City Council, O\u2019Rourke in 2009 amended\u00a0a council resolution to include language supporting \"an honest, open national debate on ending the prohibition on narcotics.\" At the time, O\u2019Rourke was explicit about not yet personally favoring across-the-board legalization. The council-approved resolution, which didn\u2019t specify any drugs including heroin, was later vetoed. In May 2018, we rated False a claim by Cruz that O\u2019Rourke had a resolution to legalize all narcotics.\nOur ruling\nCruz said in his ad that O\u2019Rourke is \"open to abolishing ICE.\"\nIn June 2018, O\u2019Rourke said he\u2019s open to abolishing ICE. However, he also said he wasn\u2019t in favor of eliminating the agency without ensuring its enforcement duties were assigned elsewhere.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
