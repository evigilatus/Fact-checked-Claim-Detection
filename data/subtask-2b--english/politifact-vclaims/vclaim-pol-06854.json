Marco Rubio, R-Fla., offers an aggregation of many of the conservative ideas he\u2019s supported, including education policy.\nIn one passage, Rubio takes aim at the growth in college bureaucracies, which he suggests has gotten in the way of teaching and has led to steep increases in tuition. Rubio says universities should stop hiring bureaucrats. \u00a0\n\"One study,\" Rubio writes, \"found the number of administrative employees at colleges and universities (think deputy assistant to the associate vice provost and gender equity administrators) has more than doubled over the last 25 years, outpacing the growth of students by more than two to one.\"\nWe wondered whether Rubio\u2019s claim was correct. We didn\u2019t hear back from Rubio\u2019s staff, but we did find that his book footnoted an article by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, an organization affiliated with Boston University.\nThat article, written by Jon Marcus, was headlined, \"New Analysis Shows Problematic Boom In Higher Ed Administrators.\" It summarized calculations of federal data by the investigative-reporting group along with the American Institutes for Research, an independent social-science research group.\nThe article indicates that Rubio is pretty close to the mark. At one point, Marcus writes that between 1987 and the 2012, \"the number of administrators and professional staff has more than doubled. That\u2019s a rate of increase more than twice as fast as the growth in the number of students.\" That language is very close to what Rubio wrote.\nWe checked with Marcus, and he said Rubio\u2019s characterization is reasonable.\nDonna M. Desrochers, a researcher at American Institutes for Research, added that in her view, Rubio\u2019s statement is \"almost accurate.\" She said that data from a slightly different time period -- 1990 to 2012 -- showed that the number of professional staff at four-year and two-year institutions rose by 91 percent. That\u2019s almost double, and that came at a time when enrollment rose by 43 percent. So professional staff was growing roughly twice as fast as student enrollment, as Rubio indicated.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Rubio\u2019s specific examples -- \"deputy assistant to the associate vice provost and gender equity administrators\" -- don\u2019t bear out his larger point. Executive positions, such as ones with \"provost\" in the title, have been growing at a significantly slower pace than professional jobs overall. If executive staff growth had been included in the calculations along with professional staff, the rate of increase would have been 76 percent, instead of the 91 percent for professional staff alone, Desrochers said. Indeed, in the most recent period studied -- between 2000 and 2012 -- professional positions grew twice as fast as executive positions.\nAnother point worth noting: Students, rather than existing administrative employees, have been the biggest beneficiaries of staff growth in recent years. According to a report by Desrochers, wage and salary expenditures for student services were the fastest-growing salary expense in many types of institutions between 2002 and 2012.\n\"Many student-related activities (ranging from course and career guidance to disciplinary actions) that were previously under the purview of faculty have been centralized, to free up faculty time and standardize the types and quality of services provided,\" Desrochers wrote in the report. And that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, she says: \"Investments that directly support student success are wise if they lead to improved learning and degree outcomes.\"\nOur ruling\nRubio wrote that college administrators have \"more than doubled over the last 25 years, outpacing the growth of students by more than 2 to 1.\"\nRubio\u2019s right about the general trend, but one of the two examples he specifically mentions in the book belongs to a different employment category -- one that has been growing more slowly. In addition, there\u2019s evidence that this is not bureaucracy for bureaucracy\u2019s sake -- many of the positions increasing in recent years directly support students.\nThe statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.\n\n\nHelp fund PolitiFact\u2019s Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06854"}
