Luther Strange on the issue of Obamacare repeal.\nThere is a subtle but crucial difference between Armistead\u2019s and Jones\u2019 statements. Jones said Moore wants the federal government out of health care \u2014 Moore\u2019s spokesman said he wants the federal government out of the health care business.\nThe space between those statements is the crux of this fact-check.\nFor more than 50 years, the federal government has played a role in giving health insurance to the poor and elderly through Medicaid and Medicare. These public insurance programs are distinct from the kind of private insurance customers can buy from companies like Unitedhealth and Aetna.\nWhile Moore clearly supports shrinking the federal government, the key question is whether Moore wants the federal government out of private insurance only, or if he also wants the federal government to end its role in public programs such as Medicaid and Medicare, as Jones said.\nNo evidence Moore wants to end Medicaid, Medicare\nMoore\u2019s campaign declined to say if he wants to do away with Medicaid or Medicare. A description of his policy positions on his campaign website is silent as to these specific programs, and we were unable to find a single instance where Moore explicitly called to end the government\u2019s role in public insurance.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we did find were numerous examples of Moore calling for the repeal of Obamacare.\n\"We do not need socialized medicine which will ultimately lead to loss of quality and affordability of heath care, as well as a loss of access to the latest medical technology. Obamacare should be completely repealed as soon as possible,\" Moore\u2019s campaign website states.\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what Moore would like to see Obamacare replaced with. But the record seems to suggest he\u2019s amenable to the federal government playing some role in Medicaid and Medicare into the future.\nOne clue is Moore\u2019s support for the House-passed American Health Care Act. That bill would have curtailed, but not abolished, Medicaid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It would not have eliminated Medicare either.\n\"Obamacare has not been fully repealed, although steps have been made in the right direction, and I support the bill that has passed Congress,\" Moore said in a Sept. 21 Republican primary debate against\u00a0Strange.\nAn interview Moore gave to the Montgomery Advertiser suggests he recognized the federal government\u2019s fundamental role in public insurance as a given even before Obamacare took effect.\n\"It\u2019s not the role of the government to be involved in health insurance,\" Moore told the Montgomery Advertiser June 27. \"Before Obama came in, the federal government wasn\u2019t involved, except for Medicaid and Medicare, with health insurance.\"\nA Moore profile in the July 24 Montgomery Advertiser described him as \"noncommittal on cuts to Medicaid.\" With respect to Republican replacement efforts at the time, Moore said he \"would have to see what cuts they\u2019re talking about\" for Medicaid before he took a position. That\u2019s a far cry from calling to abolish the program.\nIt\u2019s possible Moore may take a harder line on public insurance programs in the future. But for now, we\u2019ve found no evidence he wants to abolish Medicaid or Medicare.\nOur ruling\nJones said Moore wants to end the federal government\u2019s role in Medicaid and Medicare.\nThe record clearly demonstrates Moore wants to repeal Obamacare. He may not have articulated what he wants the health insurance system to look like, but we found no evidence to suggest he wants to end the federal government\u2019s role in Medicaid and Medicare.\nWe rate Jones\u2019 statement False.\n Share the Facts 2017-10-26 21:17:38 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says Roy Moore \"has advocated getting the federal government out of health care altogether, which means doing away with Medicaid, which means doing away with Medicare.\"    Doug Jones Democratic nominee for Albama's U.S. Senate seat  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N319bNkuWo   in an interview Wednesday, September 27, 2017 2017-09-27    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02759"}
