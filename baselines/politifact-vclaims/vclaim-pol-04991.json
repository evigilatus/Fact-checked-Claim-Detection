Terry McAuliffe\u2019s blanket restoration of voting rights on April 22 to an estimated 206,000 Virginia felons who had served their prison sentences and completed their probationary periods.\nRepublicans say the action is a ruse to help Hillary Clinton - McAuliffe\u2019s close friend and fellow Democrat - carry Virginia in November\u2019s presidential election. GOP legislative leaders have hired a lawyer to guide an expected lawsuit challenging the governor\u2019s authority to order the sweeping restoration.\nMcAuliffe says it\u2019s only right to forgive people after they\u2019ve served their punishments and that Virginia\u2019s traditionally steep path toward restoration of rights can be traced to Jim Crow-era efforts to exclude black voters. The governor says that before his blanket action, he already had shattered the restoration-of-rights records by previous governors.\nHere\u2019s what he said during an April 22 speech on the Capitol steps, moments before announcing his blanket policy. He also republished it on Medium.com.\u00a0\"Today, I am proud to tell you that in a little more than two years that we have restored the rights of more than 18,000 individuals, which is more than the past seven governors combined in their four-year terms.\"\nWe wondered whether the McAuliffe\u2019s figures were correct. The governor\u2019s office sent us a data sheet with McAuliffe\u2019s restoration numbers just before his announcement and those of every governor dating to 1938. We were able to confirm the figures of past administrations through old newspaper stories and with the help of Roger Christman, senior state governors\u2019 archivist at the Library of Virginia.\nMcAuliffe reports restoring the rights of 18,009 felons at the time of his announcement. Here\u2019s how that compares with the previous seven governors, listed in descending order by their terms:\n\u2022Republican Bob McDonnell, 8,111;\n\u2022Democrat Tim Kaine, 4,402;\n\u2022Democrat Mark Warner, 3,486;\n\u2022Republican Jim Gilmore, 238;\n\u2022Republican George Allen, 460;\n\u2022Democrat Doug Wilder, 427; and\n\u2022Democrat Jerry Baliles, 853.\nThe seven governors restored rights to 17,977 felons - 32 fewer than McAuliffe\u2019s total before his April 22 announcement. The seven governors, all serving four years, go back to 1986.\nLet\u2019s keep going back, in descending order, to 1938:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Democrat Chuck Robb, 1,180;\n\u2022Republican John Dalton, 939;\n\u2022Republican Mills Godwin, 515;\n\u2022Republican Linwood Holton, 303;\n\u2022Democrat Mills Godwin, 260;\n\u2022Democrat Albertis Harrison, 158;\n\u2022Democrat Lindsay Almond, 136;\n\u2022Democrat Tom Stanley, 163;\n\u2022Democrat John Battle, 139;\n\u2022Democrat William Tuck, 167;\n\u2022Democrat Colgate Darden, 157; and\n\u2022Democrat James Price, 273.\nIf you\u2019re wondering, the 19 governors before McAuliffe restored the rights of 22,367 felons. If McAuliffe\u2019s action withstands legal challenge, he\u2019ll have restored voting rights to about 224,000 felons in less than 2 1/2 years - 10 times more than the last 19 governors combined during their entire terms.\nMcAuliffe says he\u2019s empowered to issue a blanket restoration of rights and points to language in the Virginia Constitution that grants governors the authority to \"remove political disabilities\" for felons.\nRepublicans say the governor must follow a more individualized process for restoring rights. The Richmond Times-Dispatch, in a May 3 article, said the GOP challenge could center on other language in the constitution that says no \"person\" convicted of a felony can vote unless \"his\" civil rights have been restored.\nOur ruling\nMcAuliffe said that before issuing a blanket restoration of rights on April 22 to felons who had served their time, he already had \"restored the rights of more than 18,000 individuals, which is more than the past seven governors combined in their four-year terms.\" Records prove his point. \u00a0\nWe rate his statement True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/11494026-9243-4851-ab1b-4d3ca1aded06", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04991"}
