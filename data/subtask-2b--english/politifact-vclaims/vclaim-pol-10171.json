Tommy Thompson won the bruising Republican primary for U.S. Senate. And the general election race against Democrat Tammy Baldwin has featured plenty of punches from both sides.\n\nThompson was asked about negative advertising during an Oct. 5, 2012, appearance at a Milwaukee Press Club Newsmaker Luncheon. He expressed disappointment, and said the tone didn\u2019t reflect his personality.\n\n\"I\u2019m very sad about the negative ads,\" Thompson said. \"I\u2019m a positive guy. I\u2019m optimistic.\"\n\nHe noted that when he successfully challenged Democrat Gov. Anthony Earl in 1986, the two \"ran a fantastic election, we ran an election all over the state and that always was positive.\"\n\nAnd then Thompson turned the blame on his opponent.\n\n\"Congresswoman Baldwin has had not one positive ad. Not one.... Not one positive ad. Why? Because she hasn\u2019t done anything.\"\n\nA few days after the statement, the Journal Sentinel\u2019s Craig Gilbert wrote about \na report by Kantar Media CMAG, a D.C. firm that tracks political ads, that found in the 30 days that ended Oct. 2, 2012, 92% of the ads aired in the race were \"negative.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the report showed that in the weeks after the primary, between Aug. 19 and Sept. 17, 2012, Baldwin and her allies outspent Thompson and his allies almost 3-to-1 on broadcast television.\n\nComplaining and finger-pointing about the tone of the race is nothing new in politics. But Thompson made a very specific claim about Baldwin, and suggested she is to blame for the negativity.\n\nIs he on the money?\n\nTo be sure, the battle for the U.S. Senate seat was bitter long before the general election, but only on the Republican side. Thompson topped three opponents in the August primary, while Baldwin faced no opponent, though she has been on television since early summer.\n\nThat split nature of the race creates a bit of a problem when it comes to evaluating Thompson\u2019s claim.\n\nWas Thompson talking about the entirety of the campaign or was he referring to the head-to-head battle with Baldwin?\n\nFrom the context of the specific question, about how negative ads had erased Thompson\u2019s lead in the polls, it\u2019s reasonable to believe Thompson was speaking about ads in the general election race. And he referred to the general election campaign that he waged against former Gov. Earl.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what he said -- Thompson said all of Baldwin\u2019s ads had been negative.\n\nWe asked his campaign to provide backup for his statement and was told they would get back to us but didn\u2019t.\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the primary season.\n\nThat\u2019s when Baldwin was able to play Rock-Paper-Engines. Those were the titles of her TV ads.\n\nA June 17, 2012, ad, \"Paper\", discussed Baldwin\u2019s efforts to sanction China for breaking trade rules and hurting the U.S. paper industry. The \"Rock,\"ad, which began running July 9, was biographical in nature. On July 30, 2012, \"Engines\"began, claiming Baldwin \"led the fight\" to force the Coast Guard to buy engines from American manufacturers.\n\nNone of those ads mentioned Thompson or the other Republican contenders.\n\nThat tone changed after the Aug. 14, 2012, primary, starting the following week with an ad called \"Choice.\"\n\nIn it, Baldwin talks about three tax-cut votes of her own, and then turns her sights on Thompson, calling him \"the guy who\u2019s gotten rich working for D.C. lobbyists\" and saying he \"wants to give a $265,000 tax cut to millionaires like himself while raising taxes on the middle class.\"\n\nShe followed up a few days later with another ad criticizing Thompson for refusing to release his tax returns.\n\nIn an early September ad, Baldwin attacked Thompson\u2019s record as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The ad said Thompson \"cut a sweetheart deal with drug companies making it illegal for them to negotiate lower prescription drug prices.\"\n\nSo, since the primary, the ads have been negative. The same can be said of Thompson\u2019s ads.\n\nBaldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus noted Thompson vowed numerous times that he would run a positive campaign. He argued Thompson was the first to go negative against Baldwin, even before the primary and cited a July ad, \"Repeal\"showing Thompson on a Harley.\n\nIn it, Thompson pledges to be the \"51st vote\" to repeal \"Obamacare.\" Baldwin\u2019s face appears briefly superimposed on the road, with the note she supports the federal health care law. (There is no question about that. She voted for it and has even suggested going further.)\n\nAs with the Baldwin side, the negative lines become much clearer after the primary.\n\nIn other ads, Thompson has said Baldwin supports a massive tax increase, describes her as \"too extreme for Wisconsin,\" and says she\u2019s more liberal than Nancy Pelosi and President Barack Obama.\n\nGroups on both sides of the race have also ran negative ads, contributing to the all-negative sense about the race.\n\nOur rating\n\nAt the Press Club event, Thompson said Baldwin had not aired \"one positive ad\" in the campaign.\n\nThat is certainly true for the general election, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that\u2019s what he was referring to. But a longer view of the campaign, extending before the primary, provides a very different picture.\n\nWe rate the claim Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10171"}
