Republicans have repeatedly tried and failed to achieve a repeal.\nWe found that the statements require more explanation about the impact of repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n'Could cost Ohio more than 81,000 jobs'\nThe left-leaning Economic Policy Institute published an analysis related to jobs and the Affordable Care Act in March 2017. At the time, the Republicans were pursuing the American Health Care Act, a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The bill never became law.\nThe first thing to know about economist Josh Bivens\u2019 analysis is that he didn\u2019t predict layoffs but instead came up with a rough estimate of the potential drag on job growth if the repeal occurred. For Ohio, that number was 81,385 jobs.\nThe For Our Future PAC\u2019s website doesn\u2019t take into account the caveats in the report which stated: \"Given all of this uncertainty, we present our findings as a drag on potential job growth, rather than as clear predictions of \u2018jobs lost.\u2019\"\nGeorge Washington University experts came up with a lower estimate for job losses in Ohio by 2026 based on the House bill and a higher one for the Senate bill.\nHowever, other experts have expressed doubts that repeal would lead to such a high number of job growth losses or that it\u2019s possible to put a precise prediction on job losses.\nJoe Antos, a health care expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said such analyses take \"an extreme view that everything is going to collapse.\"\nAntos said if the Affordable Care Act were repealed, he would expect some initial reduction in employment in the health care sector but some increase in other sectors.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On balance, what happened to employment, I don\u2019t know,\" he said.\nAntos said that the predictions about job losses by Democrats are similar to the predictions by Republicans in 2010 that the requirements for small firms to cover employees would create massive disruption, but that ultimately didn\u2019t happen. (We have fact-checked several claims that the Affordable Care Act is a \"jobs killer\" and repeatedly found the evidence fell short.)\nTwo experts on health care economics, Jean Abraham at the University of Minnesota and Anne Beeson Royalty at Indiana University, reviewed literature and concluded that the Affordable Care Act had minimal effect on employment, hours of work, and compensation.\nRepeal would 'jeopardize nearly 1 million Ohioans\u2019 health care coverage'\nFor Our Future pointed to analysis by the Urban Institute in 2017 that analyzed the implications of partial repeal through the budget reconciliation process, an approach considered by Congress at that time. The Urban Institute predicted that it would lead to an increase of the uninsured population in Ohio of 964,000.\nHowever, the Urban Institute has done a more recent analysis of full repeal and nationally found a smaller number for how many would be uninsured due to policy changes. It didn\u2019t publish new estimates for the states; however, Linda Blumberg, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute, said it would be lower than the 964,000 figure.\nThere are about 1 million people in Ohio who are insured through the Affordable Care Act, including about 230,000 people through the marketplace and almost 700,000 as a result of expanded Medicaid.\nRepeal would 'leave more than 220,000 Ohioans with mental illness or substance use disorders without insurance'\nThis part of the statement refers to research by Harvard health economics professor Richard Frank and New York University Dean Sherry Glied. They said in January 2017 that repealing the Affordable Care Act would have \"stark effects on those with behavioral health illnesses.\"\nNationwide, the researchers estimated that approximately 1.25 million people with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance coverage if the federal health care law was repealed.\nThey found that repealing the health care law would particularly harm states hit hard by opioid deaths, including Ohio where 220,512 people with addiction or mental health disorders have coverage through the law\u2019s marketplace or Medicaid expansion.\nSince there is no Obamacare replacement bill under serious consideration right now, it\u2019s unknown whether all of these people would end up uninsured.\nOur ruling\nFor Our Future Ohio PAC said \"repealing the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and with it, Ohio\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u2014 could cost Ohio more than 81,000 jobs, jeopardize nearly 1 million Ohioans\u2019 health care coverage, and leave more than 220,000 Ohioans with mental illness or substance use disorders without insurance.\"\nThe statement about jobs ignores the caveats in the study by the Economics Policy Institute. The study came up with a number about the potential drag on job growth under a scenario that was pushed by Republicans in 2017 but that never became law. It does not refer to job layoffs.\nAbout 1 million Ohioans are currently covered by the Affordable Care Act. An academic study found that about 220,000 Ohioans with addiction or mental health disorders have coverage through the law. However, since there isn\u2019t a repeal-and-replace bill under serious consideration right now, it\u2019s difficult to predict how many people in Ohio would be left without coverage.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a4ee584c-2357-4c23-95ac-7b41085c1b87", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01882"}
