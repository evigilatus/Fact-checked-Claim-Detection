Greenfield\u2019s article argues that a proposed tax bill, in which Republicans were trying to eliminate estate taxes entirely, would be a win for wealthy Americans and corporations, not farmers.\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee\u2019s claim gets made frequently by those who see the estate tax as being unfair, and we\u2019ve dealt with it several times from different perspectives in previous fact-checks. We zero in, here, on the claim made in the presumed competitive U.S. Senate race in Iowa that an estate tax would punish family farms and small businesses.\nThe estate tax \u2014 in place in various iterations since 1916 \u2014 is a federal tax on property and asset transfers after the death of the owner. Some states impose their own estate taxes on top of the federal tax but Iowa does not.\nThe tax only applies to estates valued above a specified amount, which has risen substantially in the past two decades. In 2000, estates worth more than $675,000 were subject to an estate tax, which would be worth a little more than $1 million in today\u2019s dollars. But, the exempt value has risen beyond inflation-adjusted levels \u2014 to $5.49 million by 2017, when Greenfield\u2019s op-ed was written.\u00a0\nIn 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the exemption on taxable estates and indexed it for inflation to $11.58 million. Tax cuts in the act will sunset after 2025 unless Congress decides to extend them or pass another tax bill.\u00a0\nThe exemption doubles if the estate is owned by a couple, so family farms and businesses owned jointly won\u2019t pay a tax on an inherited estate unless the estate is valued above $23.16 million.\u00a0\nDoes the estate tax put a strain on small businesses and family farms, forcing them to sell to pay off the tax? The data says no.\u00a0\nFamily farms and small businesses are largely exempt from the tax because they usually don\u2019t have enough assets to meet the minimum value for a tax.\nOf the 5,500 taxable estates in 2017, when the taxable value was $5.49 million, 80 were small farms and businesses, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based non-partisan think tank. The center defined a small business as one with farm and business assets totaling less than $5 million and making up at least half the estate.\u00a0\nSince 2018,\u00a0 the Tax Policy Center estimated 1,900 estates every year have been subject to the tax. None fell under the center\u2019s definition of a small business, but about 140 had business and farm assets making up at least half the estate, according to the estimates.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 0.6 percent of the 38,106 farm estates created nationally in 2018 were required to file an estate tax return when the exemption was $11.18 million, and only 0.35 percent \u2014 133 farms \u2014 ended up paying any taxes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked for comment, the National Republican Senatorial Committee referred to five sources, including an American Farm Bureau position statement arguing for repealing the tax. The statement says 91 percent of farm assets are tied up in land, equipment and buildings and not liquid, leaving farmers short of cash to pay an estate tax. The statement doesn\u2019t provide evidence that this is a common occurrence. But the committee points to Kevin Kester, the former president of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, who wrote a 2017 opinion piece in U.S. News, saying his family would have to sell parts of its 22,000-acre California ranch to pay a $2 million tax bill when he inherited his ranch.\u00a0\nThe Republican Senatorial Committee also pointed to an open letter from 2001 that was penned by economist Milton Friedman arguing for a repeal of the tax. The letter was reissued in 2017 and signed by 727 economists.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s true that there\u2019s a cost associated with complying with the tax when it is owed. Wealthy families need to hire estate planners who can navigate the intricate tax code, and there are ways to structure an estate to lower the tax burden.\nThomas Gelman, a lawyer at Phelan Tucker Law Firm who has been working in estate planning around Iowa City for 42 years, said multiple strategies exist for people \u2014 generally the wealthiest families with large estates \u2014 who are subject to the tax. They can transfer ownership of property during their lifetime, for example, or structure a family business to give up total ownership.\u00a0\n\"There\u2019s just multiple strategies about how you might accomplish that,\" Gelman said in an interview. \"And yes, they can become somewhat expensive and complicated to implement, but the federal estate tax is 40 percent. So, on every dollar you save tax on, you're saving 40 cents. And for people with enormous wealth, it usually justifies the effort.\"\u00a0\nHeirs of small businesses and farms can defer tax payments, excluding interest, for up to five years after filing a return, and can pay what\u2019s left in installments over 10 years. Small farms\u00a0 also can be valued at their farm use value rather than fair market value, which assesses land based on how much it produces versus how much it could be sold for on the open market. This allows for additional exemptions of more than $1 million when passed down.\nLeonard Burman, a Tax Policy Center economist, said in a Daily Iowan interview the likelihood the tax would force family farmers or small-business owners to sell their assets is essentially nonexistent. \"If you have a farm that, by itself, would be subject to the estate tax, it\u2019s a giant estate in California, it\u2019s not a corn farm in Iowa,\" he said.\nThe average size of a farm in Iowa was 351 acres in 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Combine that with the average value of Iowa farmland \u2014 $7,432 an acre, according to a 2019 Iowa State University survey \u2014 and you get an average farm value of about $2.6 million. Even when accounting for real estate, equipment, and other assets, this is a far cry from the $23 million that would make a couple-owned farm subject to the tax, the data shows.\nGelman said that in 42 years of practicing estate planning, he hasn\u2019t encountered a situation where a family had to sell a farm or business in order to pay the tax, though he has had clients who were subject to the tax take advantage of the provisions outlined above.\u00a0\n\"The current federal estate tax, with the exemptions that are now applicable, do not force small farmers, in my experience, to have to sell off their farm,\" he said.\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nThe NRSC advertisement said the tax would \"punish family farms and small businesses, forcing them to be sold off instead of passed on to the next generation.\"\u00a0\nEstate planning to prepare for the tax can be costly, and the few families that are subject to it do have an associated burden. With few liquid assets, very large farms like Kester\u2019s could run into trouble paying the tax, but the ad left out the crucial fact that only a tiny fraction of farms and businesses will ever see a tax on their estates.\nMost family farms in Iowa are below the threshold that triggers an estate tax. There are also several mechanisms, specifically for small businesses and farms, to reduce the amount owed and extend the payment window when a tax is owed.\u00a0\nWhile it\u2019s possible that a handful of Iowa family farms and small businesses may be subject to the estate tax, it\u2019s hard to find evidence that the tax is forcing average farmers and business owners to sell their estates.
