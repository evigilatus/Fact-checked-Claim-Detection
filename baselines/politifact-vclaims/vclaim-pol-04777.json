Tim Kaine, D-Va., for his take on Britain\u2019s exit (Brexit).\nKaine, believed to be on Hillary Clinton\u2019s shortlist for vice president, said the United States has to maintain its ties with Europe and the United Kingdom. He also noted the generational gap among those who voted to stay in the European Union and those who voted to leave.\n\"Young voters, those under 50, especially millennials, overwhelmingly voted to stay,\" Kaine said. \"And it was older voters who voted to leave.\"\nThe United Kingdom\u00a0voted to leave the union 52 percent to 48 percent, and it seems generally understood that older generations pushed the \"leave\" campaign over the threshold toward a win. But how do the numbers actually stack up?\nUsually, journalists and others rely on exit polling to learn about demographic breakdown of votes and also to call the results of an election before all ballots have been counted. However, there were no official exit polls from the Brexit vote, in part because of the difficulty of constructing a good poll on such a rare referendum.\nHowever, we did find an unofficial exit poll of more than 12,000 people, conducted by Michael Ashcroft, a British former politician and businessman who also conducts public polls. His Brexit findings support Kaine\u2019s claim.\nAccording to Ashcroft, who supports Brexit, a majority of voters 44 years old and younger voted to remain, while those 45 and older voted to leave. (Kaine specifically mentioned voters 50 and younger, and this is as close as Ashcroft\u2019s poll gets to that bracket.)\nKaine also said millennials were especially enthusiastic about remaining in the European Union, and he\u2019s correct. Those between 18-24 years old voted 73 percent against Brexit, and those between 25-34 years old voted 62 percent to stay, according to Ashcroft\u2019s poll.\nThat\u2019s in stark contrast to voters 65 and over who voted 60 percent in favor of leaving the European Union.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Dowd\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2011 in an interview on ABC's \"This Week with Christiane Amanpour\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoll results from the past 35 years show that State of the Union speeches \"do not move\" presidential approval numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 24, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAshcroft\u2019s polling is in line with the results of surveys conducted in advance of the vote. \"Call your nan!\" was a pitch in the last days of the \"stay\" campaign, pushing youngsters to try and flip their grandparents.\nThe Wall Street Journal analyzed and consolidated polling from several agencies and found that among those polled, people aged 18-24 opposed Brexit 60 percent, compared to 20 percent in favor, while the rest were undecided or were not planning to vote. Among those aged 24-49, 45 percent wanted to remain, while 39 percent favored leaving.\nThe balance flipped among older groups, with 48 percent of those aged 50-64 supporting Brexit, while 42 percent opposed. And 60 percent of those aged 65 or older supported Brexit, and just 34 percent wanted to remain in the European Union.\nIn further support of the generational gap, the Telegraph found that areas with a higher concentration of people over the age of 65 tended to have a higher percentage of people voting in favor of Brexit compared to areas with a lower concentration of older voters.\nIn light of this split, many young people in Britain are now expressing frustration that an older generation has made a monumental decision about the future, yet it\u2019s the younger people who will spend many more years of their lives living with that decision.\nBritish millennials have only ever known the United Kingdom as part of a larger European community, as it joined the the European Union\u2019s precursor more than 40 years ago, noted Cassie Werber, a Britain-based writer, in Quartz. They\u2019re used to the freedom to work and travel throughout Europe, as well as the presence of many different cultures in their own country, particularly in a post-Soviet world.\n\"By the time we were born, the U.K. already had become a country in which people with widely diverse heritages coexisted, for the most part in peace,\" Werber wrote.\nOur ruling\nKaine said of the Brexit referendum, \"Young voters, those under 50, especially millennials, overwhelmingly voted to stay. And it was older voters who voted to leave.\"\nBased on the best polling we have, all signs point to a significant generational divide on the question of whether the United Kingdom should have remained in the European Union. It\u2019s clear as day that millennials \u2014 those about 34 or younger \u2014 favored remaining. It seems that those between 35-50 slightly favored staying, too, while older generations heavily favored Brexit.\nThe only caveat is that we don\u2019t have official exit polls to support Kaine\u2019s claim. For that reason, we rate Kaine\u2019s claim Mostly True.\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1a7fc8df-7397-4369-b89d-6c9fa32dbe8a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04777"}
