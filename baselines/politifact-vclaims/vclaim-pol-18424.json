She says she was told she didn\u2019t need an ID because she was already registered to vote.\n\"Now here\u2019s my deal. I have two sisters that look a little like me, what\u2019s stopping me right now from throwing on a mask, changing my clothes and going back out there to vote two more times in my favor?\" said the woman in the video. \"So basically, anybody can go vote for anybody so long as they have their information. We are worried about voter mail-in fraud. They're not even checking IDs at the polling stations.\"\nPolitiFact reached out to the Massachusetts state office that oversees elections for data on instances of voter fraud as described in the TikTok. Debra O\u2019Malley, a spokesperson for Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin, told PolitiFact she was not aware of any in-person voter impersonation cases in Massachusetts.\nO\u2019Malley said there are certain circumstances in which voters may be asked for identification, but it is not required to be a photo ID. Acceptable types of ID include a recent utility bill or any other printed identification which contains the voter's name and address.\nThe secretary of state\u2019s website says people may be asked to show identification when they check in at a polling station for any of the following reasons:\n\n\nVoting for the first time in Massachusetts in a federal election;\n\n\nInactive voter;\n\n\nCasting a provisional or challenged ballot;\n\n\nThe poll worker has a reasonable suspicion that leads them to request identification.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a police officer in every polling place to help enforce the election laws, O\u2019Malley said.\nWhile Massachusetts doesn't have a photo ID requirement for voting, \"there's no evidence of widespread impersonation fraud in jurisdictions that lack photo ID requirements,\" said Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos, a professor at Harvard Law School whose expertise includes election law.\nA person would also be committing a crime if they assert someone else\u2019s identity to vote, Stephanopoulos said. An attempt to impersonate a voter could also be detected if that other person has already voted, or the crime could be caught once the actual voter goes to the polls, he said.\nMassachusetts law says that \"whoever votes or attempts to vote in any name other than his own, or knowingly casts or attempts to cast more than one ballot at one time of balloting; or whoever votes or attempts to vote otherwise illegally, shall be punished by a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than five years, or both.\"\nNews21, a student reporting project based at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, in 2012 analyzed 2,068 alleged election-fraud cases since 2000. The study found that in-person voter impersonation was \"virtually nonexistent.\"\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures says there are 36 states that have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls, 35 of which are in force in 2020.\nOur ruling\nA video posted on TikTok claimed that in Massachusetts, \"anybody can go vote for anybody so long as they have their information. \u2026 They're not even checking IDs at the polling stations.\"\nMassachusetts does not require that everyone show an ID in order to vote, but there are some instances when people will be asked to show an ID before voting.\nThe video ignores that voting or attempting to vote under someone else\u2019s name is not permissible, it is illegal. The video also implies that the absence of an ID requirement at polls is conducive to voter fraud. An election law expert said there's no evidence of widespread impersonation fraud in places that lack photo ID requirements.\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18424"}
