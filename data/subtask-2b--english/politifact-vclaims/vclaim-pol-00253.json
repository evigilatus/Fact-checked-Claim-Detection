Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election!\" Trump tweeted. \"This was put out by a Clinton supporter, not a Trump Supporter! Google should be sued. My victory was even bigger than thought!\"\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s claim appears to trace back to a research paper published online in June 2017. He may have become aware of the paper after the right-wing website Town Hall ran an article that heavily cited it. The Washington Post reported that the same research paper was mentioned in a segment on Fox Business Network.\u00a0\nThe paper, by psychologist Robert Epstein, seeks to build off earlier research Epstein did on how bias in search engine results can affect voting preferences. (For the record, Epstein\u2019s estimate was that between 2.6 million and 10.4 million votes may have been manipulated in 2016 \u2014 not up to 16 million votes, as Trump said.)\nBut a number of experts we reached out to said the latest paper\u2019s methodology is freighted with too many flaws and unexplained assumptions to assert the kind of claim Trump makes here.\u00a0\nA questionable approach\nWe reached out to Epstein to ask if he took issue with how Trump characterized his findings.\n\"I sure do,\" said Epstein, who supported Clinton in 2016. \"I have never said that Google deliberately manipulated the 2016 election.\"\nWhen we asked what formula and assumptions Epstein used to reach his bottom-line conclusion, we did not hear back. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nExperts cited several major flaws in Epstein\u2019s paper.\u00a0\nFirst, here\u2019s the study\u2019s basic setup: In the run-up to the 2016 election, researchers recruited 95 people, 21 of whom identified as \"undecided.\"\nOver a 25-day period \u2014 from Oct. 15 through Election Day, Nov. 8 \u2014 researchers analyzed between 50 and 483 of these subjects' daily web searches.\nThose search results were then farmed out to a crowdsourcing website, where raters voted on whether they found search results biased or not.\nTheir key finding: that \"election-related search terms were, on average, biased in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s favor.\"\nExperts we spoke to cited a slew of problems with this methodology.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne common complaint was a lack of definitions.\u00a0\n\"They can't even define what biased search results are \u2014 they simply piped them off to a crowd-sourcing site and asked random people, \u2018Is this search results page biased or not?\u2019 \" said Ryan Singel, a media and strategy fellow at Stanford Law School\u2019s Center for Internet and Society. \"What does that even mean?\"\nThe researchers also discarded search results from users who operated Gmail accounts, after finding these users\u2019 searches yielded less biased results. To the researchers, this raised concerns that \"perhaps Google identified our confidants through its gmail system and targeted them to receive unbiased results.\"\nBut others doubted that explanation.\n\"They eliminated anyone using a Gmail address because their search results weren't considered \u2018biased,\u2019 speculating that Google was intentionally poisoning their research,\" Singel said. \"That's both equally laughable and sad.\"\nSetting aside the methodological flaws, others took exception to the researchers assumption about how well an experiment of this kind would translate to the voting booth. To some, the holes in the definitions and unexplained formulas used to extrapolate created more questions than answers.\nWe reached out to Nicholas Diakopoulos, a professor in communication studies and computer science at Northwestern University, to ask how researchers could get from 25 days\u2019 worth of search results from 95 subjects to millions of manipulated votes.\n\"There's not enough information in the whitepaper about how the estimate was done,\" Diakopoulos said.\u00a0\nHe said the researchers likely developed a mathematical formula that seeks to translate examples of bias they collected into estimates of voter impact.\u00a0\n\"But again there is not enough information in the whitepaper to say definitively how their \u2018computational model\u2019 works,\" he said, \"and whether it is a valid estimate based on the assumptions built into the model.\"\u00a0\nGoogle refuted Trump\u2019s statement, noting it was an old claim.\n\"This researcher's inaccurate claim has been debunked since it was made in 2016,\" a Google spokesman said in a statement. \"As we stated then, we have never re-ranked or altered search results to manipulate political sentiment.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said a new report shows \"Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election.\" The general idea here is that Google gave people search results that in some way affected their vote in the lead-up to the election for president.\u00a0\nWhether such indirect interactions could cause people to change their votes is questionable, and the paper \u2014 which is not new \u2014 does nothing to establish how that might happen. The paper doesn\u2019t explain its methodology, and other academics questioned whether its findings were valid. Finally, Trump seems to have exaggerated the outer bound of the questionable findings.\nOverall, we rate his statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00253"}
