The post first appeared on or around April 24, 2017, on States-TV.com, HoustonChronicle-TV.com and Fox-News24.com.\nFacebook users flagged it as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to clear fake news from users\u2019 news feeds.\nThe post is keyed to a real event: Russia\u2019s Supreme Court banned the religious organization on April 20, labeling the group as a danger for \"extremist activities.\" The assets of the St. Petersburg headquarters and almost 400 chapters were designated state property. Its literature and website have also been banned.\nFrom there, the story devolved into fairytale, claiming Trump warned that the move \"is contrary to the constitution of the land of the Russian Federation.\"\n\"I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against you,\" Trump is quoted. He also is credited as saying Jehovah\u2019s Witness could find freedom in this country.\n\"As this is an infringement of your fundamental human right, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated,\" he said, according to the post.\nThe problem is, there is no record Trump said any of these things. Aside from a few examples of this same post being on multiple websites, we couldn\u2019t find any official record of him personally addressing the subject at all.\nWe reached out to a White House spokesman to confirm this but didn\u2019t receive a response.\nState Department spokesman Mark Toner did release a statement on April 20 saying that the United States was \"extremely concerned by the Russian government's actions targeting and repressing members of religious minorities, including Jehovah's Witnesses, under the pretense of combating extremism.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToner also noted that religious freedom was critical to society.\n\"All religious minorities should be able to enjoy freedom of religion and assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Russian Federation's constitution,\" he said.\nBut there\u2019s no mention of Trump making any statement, and we couldn\u2019t find one elsewhere. Reposts have circulated of the country\u2019s 175,000 Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses being harassed by Russian police since the ruling.\nFox-News24.com is a url that attempts to mimic Fox News, but has no connection to the cable news network. The same goes for HoustonChronicle-TV.com, which mimics the real newspaper\u2019s name but doesn\u2019t look to have affiliation.\nAll three of the sites are filled with the same kind of sponsored content ads endemic to fake news sites.\nBut even though this story appears to be bogus, it\u2019s difficult to fully determine the point of the websites, because they do contain some legitimate news articles.\nFox-News24.com, for example, features one article about Education Secretary Betsy DeVos saying she wouldn\u2019t mind shutting down the Education Department. It\u2019s copied practically word-for-word from a Feb. 17 story from U.S. News & World Report.\nFox-News24.com administrators have hidden the registration of the website, which\u00a0was only registered on March 20. There is no contact information available. The same goes for the other two websites we\u2019ve noted.\nThe story said that Trump warned Russia for banning Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and offered a safe haven for Russians who wanted to come to America. The State Department did decry Russia\u2019s ruling, but there\u2019s no evidence Trump weighed in.\nWe rate the statement Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-04-28 15:19:52 UTC   Politifact    6 1 7  Politifact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Trump warns Russia over Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the U.S.\"    Internet rumors Bloggers   in Internet posts Monday, April 24, 2017 2017-04-24    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03367"}
