In the final debate of the campaign, Director Bob Schaeffer asked Romney, \"Where are you gonna get the money?\" Romney said he'd take it from other parts of the budget -- by canceling the Obama program and by changing the Medicaid program to a mineral grant and handing it over to the United States. President Barack Obama said that the Romney plan to increase defence spending was a bad idea, because it was not necessary. Romney \"wanted to spend another $2 trillion on military spending not demanded by our army,\" said Obama. In this fact check, we're examining the allegation that Romney is promoting something that senior officers don't want. Romney outlined his national security policy on his website. There, he warned that the restoration of the army would not be a \"free operation,\" and said that \"it would begin to reverse the defence cuts of the Obama era... with a view to determining basic defence spending - that is, funds allocated to the core military components of personnel, operations and maintenance, procurement and research and development - at a minimum of 4 per cent of GDP.\" What's 4%? The Pentagon budget is expected to range from 3.2 to 3.5 per cent of GDP in the next fiscal year. According to the new American Security Center, a group with links to both the Republican and Democratic Departments, up to a gradual rise of up to 4 per cent would increase defence spending by $2.1 trillion over the next 10 years, as CNN reported. The responsible Federal Budget Committee, a group of two parties focusing on reducing the deficit, also uses this number, as do other budget think tanks. It seems that Romney accepts it, as far as the figure of $2 trillion goes, it seems reasonably accurate. In the past, when asked about increased defence spending in difficult economic times, the Romney campaign confirmed that the 4 per cent target would take some time to achieve. While the campaign website described the target as \"a floor,\" the campaign spokesman Andrea Sol called it \"a target\" in an e-mail to a Boston Globe journalist. == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man In the same article, a Romney consultant, MacKenzie Eagle, from the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, \"This is not a hard number and anyone would be crazy to suggest it. This must be a very slow escalation, and it will be difficult for them to achieve even a 4% core budget by the end of the first term. This suggests some flexibility on the part of Romney, although the candidate himself did not express that. What the Pentagon asks for in the debate, Romney said, \"Our Navy is smaller now than ever since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. We are now in less than 285.\" In fact, the plan for the 313 ships reflects a strategic review for 2005. In April, the Minister of the Navy, Ray Mapus, presented a new programme setting the target for 300 ships. The Mapus remarks came at a moment when Romney had expressed opposition to the new approach. \"Many of this criticism is based either on incomplete and/or inaccurate or outdated information, on the lack of vision beyond the short term or on the desire to protect the status quo despite the changing world and despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary,\" he said: The President &apos; s budget calls for $487 billion in defence between now and 2021. His Minister of Defence, Leon Banita, and the Chief of the Joint Staff, General Martin Dempsey, both spoke about the plan, as well as the heads of all five branches of the army. \"We are developing today the common force that the nation will need in 2020,\" told Dempsey the Senate Budget Committee. \"We will be able to do more than one thing at a time - to win any conflict, anywhere.\" Banita acknowledged that the budget was risky, but said that the Ministry &apos; s plan was based on a first consideration of the threats that the nation might face. \"The Section needs to make a strategic shift regardless of the nation's financial situation,\" said Banita Budget Committee. \"We are at that stage of history. This is the reality of the world we live in.\" Management critics say reality is the exact opposite. A report from the Conservative Heritage Foundation said, \"The Administration has set a target for reducing the defence budget, and has therefore developed a strategy to justify such drastic cuts.\" The President is the Commander-in-Chief. Bunita works for Obama and his military response. For analysts at the Heritage Foundation, the chain of command says everything. However, in the past, when military commanders differed with the Presidents, they found ways to bring their complaints to the public. This does not mean that all leaders are satisfied with the trade-offs they face. But Nora Bencell, Deputy Director of Studies at the new American Security Center, said that she believed that the President had put a lot of time in discussions with the army and, in general, the leaders supported the plan. \"It's hard to see daylight between the army and the White House on this,\" he said blade. In general, it is always possible for service chiefs to differ on the funding of individual programmes, but within the overall budget. The President said that Romney planned to increase defence spending by $2 trillion, which was the money the army did not ask for. The military commanders testified in support of the President &apos; s spending plan, and we found no evidence of a backstage dispute. We're evaluating the statement right. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10092"}
