Question is -- why are both of you ignoring this problem?\"\nTrump said the basis of the question was wrong because he will \"create tremendous jobs.\"\nClinton, meanwhile, said she pays for everything she proposes, primarily by increasing taxes for the wealthiest Americans.\n\"What I have put forward does not add a penny to the debt,\" Clinton said.\nIs that right?\nYes and no. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan policy group, says Clinton\u2019s plans would increase the debt by a relatively small amount, $200 billion over a decade \"above current law levels.\" The Clinton campaign says a new business tax plan would generate an additional $275 billion to cancel out that debt increase.\nHowever the numbers shake out, the debt would still grow by $9 trillion over 10 years because of interest payments related to the U.S. debt and projected spending on Social Security and Medicare.\n\"Interest on the debt will become the fastest growing part of federal spending. In 2017, the next president will inherit a government projected to spend over $300 billion on interest payments that year alone, an amount that grows to more than $800 billion by 2025 \u2014 more than the current combined federal spending on the Defense Department, education, transportation, and medical research,\" wrote Bob Bixby and Maya MacGuineas for the Brookings Institution.\nSo, as Wallace said, without further changes, debt would rise to above 86 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product under Clinton\u2019s plan.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the record, Wallace was also correct that the debt would grow faster if Trump is elected, according to independent researchers.\nHere\u2019s a chart spelling it out from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\n\"We are encouraged that Clinton continues to largely pay for her new spending and that Trump has made substantial improvements to his plan, including a less costly tax plan and new spending cuts,\" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote.\n\"Unfortunately, neither candidate has presented a proposal to address our growing national debt and put it on a more sustainable path, nor have they offered a proposal for shoring up the Social Security, Medicare, or Highway trust funds. As it currently stands, Donald Trump\u2019s proposals would still substantially worsen the debt.\"\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"What I have put forward does not add a penny to the debt.\"\nAn independent analysis found Clinton\u2019s proposals would add a relatively small amount to the debt, $200 billion over a decade. The Clinton campaign says a new business tax plan will address that, though the proposal hasn\u2019t been independently analyzed.\nRegardless, Clinton\u2019s explanation leaves out the fact that debt would still rise by about $9 trillion over 10 years because of current policies. Clinton\u2019s proposals don\u2019t stem that increase.\nClinton\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/30d13ea3-9259-4377-a2ff-ce6ecb7fb0c3\nUpdate (Oct. 24, 2016): This article has been updated to reflect that one of the reasons the debt will increase is because of\u00a0 projected spending on Social Security and Medicare.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04086"}
