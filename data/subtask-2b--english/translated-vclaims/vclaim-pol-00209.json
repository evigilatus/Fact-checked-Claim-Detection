The Republicans in Wisconsin set up a sales tax holiday in 2018, giving consumers a license for many categories of clothing, computers and school supplies. There was no such holiday in 2019. And since there's been a change, there's got to be blame. On Twitter and Facebook, the World Democratic Party in Wisconsin referred to the indictment of the new State Democratic Governor. \"Last year, the Republicans gave part of the Wisconsin budget surplus back to taxpayers by creating an exemption from the sales tax on certain school return items,\" said the article of August 27, 2019. \"You will not see that this year is under the rule of Governor Tony Evers, despite the constant surplus.\" A graph is attached to the text, sealing the word \"CENZLED\" through a description of the categories of tax exemption from sales. Many Republican legislators rewrite the Twitter version of the article, including Jim Steinke, the majority leader of the Assembly, and R-Kukauna. So, did Evers really cancel the sales tax? How did the 2018 holiday happen? Let's start with history. (Joff) Scott Walker offered a sales tax exemption in his 2017 budget, but legislators voted to kill him. In 2018, legislators passed various copies of sales tax clearance early in the year. The Assembly approved a bill in February that would have established a $50 million sales tax exemption for all goods with a value of less than $100. However, an amendment introduced in March by the majority leader of the Senate, Scott Fitzgerald, R-Jonao, limited the tax exemption to specific school-related categories. School clothing and supplies included less than $75 per item and computers less than $750. This version crossed both houses and Walker signed it as a law. The expected consumer savings (and consequently the State revenue was lost) were reduced to about $14 million, according to an estimate by the State Non-Party Legislative Tax Office. Wisconsin made one of 17 states with a sales tax holiday in 2018, according to the Tax Corporation, a business-friendly think tank. On January 10, 2021, in a television interview, \"It takes a long time on election day to download those cards, which is why we have 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. to throw the ballot papers at Milwaukee.\" \u2022 January 15, 2012, but the Republicans were clearly clear that this was a one-time deal. The legal language included the observation that \"this subsection does not apply in 2019 or in any year thereafter.\" The message of the veto by Walker (which has not changed the nature of the holiday) also indicated that the holiday \"will not be repeated in the years to come.\" This year, in an evaluation of the blame on Evers, the Republicans - still in control of the state legislature - never proposed a exemption from the sales tax, referring to the spokesman for Evers Brett Kodapak. \"The Republicans specifically prevented the 2018 holiday from returning to school from being displayed in 2019 and in any year thereafter,\" she said in e-mail. \"If the Republicans wanted to extend the 2018 sales tax leave to school, they would have to pass legislation this year to do so.\" In their demand to compare tuition fees to immigrants and veterans, the Republicans indicated in this connection: GOP blames Evers for the possible lifting of the property tax on Adam King, Director of Social Media of the Republican Assembly, for quoting Evers as evidence to support the claim of employment. \"Fathers will be there buying supplies for their children whether they have motive or not,\" said Evers at a press conference on July 29, 2019. \"I just don't think the incentive actually works.\" The King said: \"By making this statement, the Governor has effectively closed the door to any possibility of implementing a tax exemption this year.\" However, this timetable challenges logic. If the Republicans wanted an exemption from the sales tax, they would have introduced the procedure months before that suspension. Certainly, before the final budget was approved by the legislature in late June. For example, the Evers commentary seems to misunderstand the purpose of the exemption from sales tax - Republicans meant it as a tax relief in the wake of a surplus in the General Fund, and treated it as an economic incentive. A study conducted by the Tax Corporation in 2018 found that tax exemptions on sales did not promote economic growth, but rather changed the timing of purchases. The holidays have been called \"political tricks,\" which \"disperse policymakers and taxpayers from real and permanent tax relief.\" However, this does not affect the validity of this claim. The Republicans in our governing council said that Evers canceled the 2019 sales tax license. You can't cancel something that was explicitly created as a one-time event. The Republicans could have submitted a new bill providing for a further exemption from sales tax this year, but they did not. The comments of Evers showing a lack of support for such a measure did not come until months after the Republicans had to take up the subject.
