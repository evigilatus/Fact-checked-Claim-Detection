Pic.twitter.com/TixZMlzQF6 #RaisetheWage-Rep. Ilhan Omor (@Ilhan) 7 February 2019 showed a video of Omar at the hearing in February 7 where she said: \"McDonald's average wage was $7,000 in 2017. This is the difference in remuneration between the Executive Director, who earns $21.8 million ($ million) to $7,000 paid by the worker who puts 40 hours a day.\" If you've heard about Omar before, it's because she's been in the news lately apologizing for comments about campaign contributions and Israel, after her democratic colleagues said that the comments were anti-Semitic. Since the 2018 elections, most of Omar &apos; s general comments have focused on families and wages. Omar's employees told us that McDonald's numbers came from the same company. She meant to say 40 hours \"week,\" not \"day\" during her remarks. As part of the regulatory reforms between Dodd and Frank, public trading companies are required to report on the amount of compensation received by the Executive Director and the amount received by the intermediary. In the McDonalds Stock Exchange file, the company stated that Executive Director Steve Easterbrook had achieved $21.8 million in 2017. This amount was largely paid for by equity prices and other corporate performance incentives. KUFPEC also stated that its average factor was USD 7,017 as stated by Omar. But there are two important qualifications: it was for all McDonald workers around the world. It included \"all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary workers.\" The company file gave an example of a part-time restaurant crew in Poland and achieved the average amount. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 On January 20, 2012, Omar's statement was to raise the hourly wage in the United States to $15. McDonald &apos; s average wage worldwide makes no mention of wages in the United States, with its labour market significantly different and all the things affecting those markets, such as health insurance, labour laws, etc. If the real figure is $7,000 a year, what is the correct figure for the average American MacDonald? McDonalds could not provide the answer, although the press office told us that the average hourly wage exceeded $10 per hour for corporate-owned enterprises. This represents almost one in nine McDonalds, because most of them have a privilege. The economics company actually publishes McDonald's salary on its website. The average number of crew members, as in Poland, is $9.21 per hour in the United States. According to the United States Office of Labour Statistics, the average wage for a person doing that work in the fast food industry is $9.70 per hour. According to the Office of Labour Statistics, the average working hours per week at a limited-service restaurant are 24.2 hours. This was raised to an entire year, and using a slightly higher rate than BLS, the normal crew factor is about $12,200. We invited McDonald's to answer our accounts and the press office said that the company didn't have any other information to share. The Institute for Economic Policy, a think tank oriented to work, compares the remuneration of senior executives to ordinary workers. The Institute estimated that the model Executive Director in the United States was 312 times more than the average number of employees. Based on our analysis, the McDonald's ratio is about 1,786.1 to 1. Our Governor Omar said that while McDonald's CEO received $21.8 million, the average factor was $7,000. These figures reflect the company &apos; s official registration, but Omar did not notice that the worker &apos; s remuneration was a global estimate and included part-time workers. On the basis of available information, we have estimated that the regular McDonald crew member is working part-time and earns about $12,000 a year. This is about two thirds more than Omar said. The disparity between the Executive Director and the model factor remains wide. However, the details given by Omar give the wrong impression of the real numbers of American workers who will be affected by the rise in the minimum wage. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.
