He was instrumental in securing funding to get the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to do the job. It is also true that the construction of the first strong fence along the United States-Mexico border south of San Diego in the early 1990s, and its consolidation at the end of the decade, coincided with a sharp reduction in the arrest of illegal immigrants in the westernmost part of the United States-Mexico border. However, analysts argue about the extent to which these changes can be attributed to the border fence. Hunter's right that the smuggling along the San Diego and Tijuana Pass has dropped dramatically as the fence began to rise. The arrests of border patrols at Imperial Beach, the safest point along the fence, decreased from 321,560 in 1993 to 19,035 in 2004, a 94 per cent decrease over a 12-year period. On January 13, 2021, in a story written by General David Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, he rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman, on January 17, 2021, but concerns along the entire San Diego district of the border, which does not have a continuous security fence, also declined sharply - 79 per cent between 1996 and 2002. At the same time, fears in the neighbouring unfiltered province of El Centro were shot during the same period. The Congressional Research Service, a non-partisan arm of the federal government, notes that opponents of the fence say that there is no way to measure the number of smugglers crossing the area without being arrested. According to the Intelligence and Security Service, these critics themselves also refer to other factors, such as doubling the number of border patrol personnel in the same period that may have prevented illegal crossings. Hunter is also often right about his pivotal role in building the first 14-mile fence between San Diego and Tijuana (which began in 1990) and the subsequent strengthening of the fence. The first fence was torn apart in the early 1990s, and the law authorizing the financing of two additional applications was then written in 1996.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00316"}
