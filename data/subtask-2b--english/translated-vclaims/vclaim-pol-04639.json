Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Indeed, Iraq saw a significant reduction in violence. Iran was being strangled by sanctions. Syria was kind of under control. Four years after Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, the entire world.\" Trump made a similar allegation pointing at Clinton's finger to create ISIS in an interview broadcast in 60 minutes on Sunday, one day before the Conference began. While the name of ISIS (Islamic State, Daish, etc.) It is relatively new: leaders and founders have pre-Clinton origins as United States diplomatic head. \"There have been developments with some changes in name,\" David Gartenstein Ross, Senior Fellow of the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies, said Paulette Fact. He has testified before Congress several times and works for an institution focused on foreign policy and security. The Islamic and Levant State of Iraq has its roots since 2004, when the Sunni extremist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi long founded Al-Qaida in Iraq, according to the National Centre for Combating Terrorism. After an American air strike in 2006 killed Zarqawi, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, this group was referred to as the \"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant,\" and then only the \"Islamic State\" in 2014, and Brian Fishman, an anti-terrorist expert at the New American Foundation, told Polyte Fact. \"The mole only refers to the mole and reflects the group's growing focus on Syria,\" he said. \"It reflects a geographical shift rather than a change in political focus. It's the same group everywhere.\" Given the timing, Democrats tend to blame President George W. Bush for having organized ISIL, because al-Qa'idah flourished after Saddam Hussein was overthrown. Republicans take different moments. President Barack Obama &apos; s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to creating a security vacuum that gave ISIS the opportunity to put its roots there, as stated by Michael O &apos; Hanlon, a security expert at the Brookings Institution, a group of middle to liberals. (Ohanlon is one of hundreds of volunteer counsellors for the Clinton campaign but has a small role to play.) You can say that the blame touches both Bush, because he created a strong Al-Qaida space in the Mesopotamia, Obama, because he gave the group a chance to regroup. Trump points out that Clinton's actions have something to do with the birth of ISIS. The experts said his evidence was weak. In order to verify the facts earlier, the Trump campaign identified Clinton &apos; s vote as a senator to authorize the use of force in Iraq in 2002. She later regretted that vote. On January 22, 2021, Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen mentioned an article on Facebook in which the Paiden administration said that she was a liberal terrorist. \u2022 On 22 January 2021, the Republicans blamed Obama for not retaining 10,000 soldiers in Iraq, which they say could have prevented Fatah ISIL. However, Obama inherited a timetable for leaving Iraq from Bush, and there was no agreement to leave much power behind. The Trump campaign also highlighted Clinton's support for regime change in Syria (which did not succeed) and Libya. The overthrow of the Libyan dictator Muammar Qadhafi gave ISIS an opportunity, as said by Christopher Bribel, a defence expert at the Liberal Cato Institute. He said: \"The Hamas Clinton regime change in Libya in 2011, which Obama supported, led to the collapse of the regime there, which ISIL and others used.\" \"This is a fair criticism, in my opinion.\" However, experts said that Clinton was not individually responsible for the group, even though various factors had given ISIS room for power growth. As John Pike, a defence expert and Director of Global Security.org, said, ISIL sources are complex and interrelated, a site that provides information on defence. Pike said, \"You might share some blame, but there's more than enough to go around.\" \"She wasn't the only writer of this thing in any way.\" Our Governor Trump said, \"In 2009, before Hillary, ISIS wasn't even on the map.\" The terrorist group ISIL was actually on the map five years before Clinton became Secretary of State. He was working under a different name. There were many factors that allowed ISIS to gain power, including intervention in Libya, the Obama resolution that I supported, and the Iraqi invasion, to which I voted as a member of the United States Senate. But Trump gets lost only when ISIS's rise is stuck on Clinton. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6ed72ab5-5513-4a0-90d-d2e0fea088b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04639"}
