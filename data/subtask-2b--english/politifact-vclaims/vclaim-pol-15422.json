Bill Nelson. Nelson  raised  a little more than $18 million for his re-election campaign against Republican Katherine Harris.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Nelson\n\n\nstated on June 11, 2009 in during a U.S. Senate debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The truth is any oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, reducing our use of foreign oil not by one single drop.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 October 5, 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut his best quarter -- from January through March 2006 -- netted only $2.82 million, according to  FEC records  .\nCrist's number crushes that mark.\nOther than Nelson, former U.S. Sen.

Nelson raised $6.53 million for his entire 2000 race, compared\u00a0with $8.66 million for that year's GOP candidate, Bill McCollum. In the 1998 campaign between Crist and former Sen.
