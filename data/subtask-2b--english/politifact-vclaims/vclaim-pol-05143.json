Harry Reid and other party powerhouses who get to independently decide which candidate to support. (Four currently support Clinton, one supports Sanders and three are neutral so far.)\nOf the remaining 35 delegates, 23 are so-called \"district-level delegates\" who are allocated based on February caucus results in each of the state\u2019s four congressional districts. Clinton won 13 of those, while Sanders won 10.\nThe remaining 12 are doled out during the state party convention in May.\nOf that 12, there are five pledged \"party leader and elected official\" delegates and seven \"at-large\" delegates awarded proportionally, so whichever campaign has a majority of supporters at the state convention will win the odd-numbered delegate from those groups.\nIdeally, the process is supposed to look something like a Matryoshka doll \u2014 smaller amounts of delegates at each step of the process, but retaining the same proportions of the initial February caucus. Initial estimates from February had Clinton winning 20 delegates and Sanders taking 15.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that didn\u2019t happen at the Clark County (Las Vegas) convention in early April, as the Sanders campaign had 2,964 delegates show up compared to 2,386 for Clinton.\nIn February, Clinton won a total of 4,889 delegates in Clark County but less than half of those showed up for the county convention.\nAccusations flew from both campaigns about questionable practices before, during and after the county convention, with the Sanders campaign claiming party officials tried to \"depose a neutral official,\" and Clinton surrogates like Nevada state director Michelle White upset with a \"number of irregularities\" in the convention process.\nLeaving those accusations aside for the moment, the practical outcome is that Sanders now has a larger number of delegates (2,124) attending the state convention in May than Clinton (1,722).\nThat means they\u2019ll be in a position to pick off a few of those remaining 12 convention delegates.\nBased on the numbers, it\u2019s likely that Sanders will be able to flip delegates and go from a projected 20-15 deficit to a more narrow 18-17 delegate split. (This count doesn\u2019t factor in the superdelegates, who are also tilted toward Clinton.)\nFor Sanders, that\u2019s not \"winning\" Nevada.\nLongtime Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston and the Associated Press reported in the immediate aftermath of the county convention that the likely final result remains a Clinton victory.\n\"Clinton\u2019s widely expected to keep her Nevada win except in the unlikely event of a Sanders blowout at the state level or if Clinton-backing superdelegates defect to the Sanders camp,\" the AP reported.\nOur ruling\nSeveral reports claimed that Bernie Sanders retroactively won Nevada\u2019s presidential caucuses, based on higher-than-expected turnout at a major county convention.\nSanders likely swung two delegates his way after the county convention, but we won\u2019t know for sure until the state convention selects the delegates in May. Either way, Clinton still holds a narrow delegate lead, projections show. That lead is larger if you include the support of Nevada\u2019s so-called \"super-delegates.\"\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05143"}
