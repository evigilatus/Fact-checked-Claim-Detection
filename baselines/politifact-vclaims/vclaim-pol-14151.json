There aren\u2019t any serious political contenders in Oregon who fit the bill, anyway.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped the Oregon House Democrats from trying to tie one local candidate to Sarah Palin and her \"rogue\" ways.\n\nIn a recent Democratic mailer, Future PAC proudly proclaims that \"Oregon isn\u2019t grizzly country.\"\nOn the reverse it says that Julie Parrish, the Republican candidate for House District 37, is \"one of Sarah Palin\u2019s mama grizzlies.\"\n\n\"Recently,\" it goes on, \"Julie Parrish received national attention after she was singled out by Fox News as one of Sarah Palin\u2019s \u2018Mama Grizzlies.\u2019\n\n\"We don\u2019t really want one of Sarah Palin\u2019s Mama Grizzlies making decisions for us, do we?\n\n\"Don\u2019t think so. Support a Grizzly-Free West Linn and Tualatin.\"\n\nWell, PolitiFact Oregon decided we ought to vet all of the above charges, and set to work.\n\nFirst up: Is Oregon \"grizzly country\"?\n\nThat all depends. If House Democrats are talking about the actual bear (we imagine they might be, as there is a fancy, cut-out image of a bear on the mailer), then they\u2019re right. No grizzlies have been spotted in Oregon since the early 1900s.\n\nIf, however, they\u2019re talking about \"Grizzly Bear,\" the popular indie band, they\u2019re way off. The band played in Portland last October, and we have faith the group will return to serenade us yet again. (We recommend a quick listen to \"The Knife,\" our favorite song of theirs.)\n\nSeriously, we might have to leave the whole \"grizzly country\" designation alone and move on to the more substantive side of the mailer.\n\nIs Parrish really one of Palin\u2019s mama grizzlies?\n\nTo get to the bottom of this pressing political issue, we went to a video of Parrish on Fox News and gave it a quick look.\n\nThe anchor frames the TV spot as follows: \"Well, Sarah Palin says they're like mama grizzlies, a trend of fed-up, conservative moms getting involved in politics. Many for the very first time.\"\n\nThere\u2019s then some Sarah Palin voiceover and inspiring images. At one point, Palin says \"It's kind of a mom awakening in the last year and a half.\"\n\nThen we\u2019re back to the anchor, who says, \"And joining us are three first-time candidates and mama grizzlies.\"\n\nWe got in touch with Parrish, who said she was a bit surprised about the way the TV spot unfolded. \"The focus was supposed to be moms and politics,\" she said. \"I was surprised, quite frankly, in how they intro-ed that.\"\n\nStill, you can find the video on her website, and she didn\u2019t object on the air.\n\nBut is this video really enough to link her to Sarah Palin? We still, for all of our sleuthing, weren\u2019t sure. So we did a little more research and found that Parrish has not received any monetary help from Palin or the out-of-state tea party groups with which the ex-vice presidential candidate is sometimes linked. Neither has Palin come to town to stump for Parrish. Heck, she hasn\u2019t even endorsed her, as far we can tell.\n\nSo where does that leave us? The claim suggests that there is a formal connection to Palin or at the minimum some show of support. There\u2019s no evidence of that. So we are left with simply one Fox newscaster calling Parrish a \"mama grizzly\" in that she\u2019s a conservative mother in politics for the first time. But her connections to Sarah Palin appear to be non-existent. We rate this claim Bearly -- oops! -- Barely True.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on this item.\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
