Scott Walker, charged that millions of valuable job development funds went to his colleagues and campaign donors. The announcement starts with excerpts from television news reports that highlight Wisconsin's struggle for employment compared to its neighbors, and then the storyteller does the rest: \"What's Scott Walker doing wrong? Scott Walker gave Wisconsin money to create jobs for his friends... company friends who contributed $570 million of our job money to Scott Walker's friends. This is how it works in Wisconsin Scott Walker.\" The Declaration, launched on 20 August 2014, is from the Wisconsin Grand Commission, a group funded by trade unions and democratic ideological groups, in accordance with the campaign for democracy and Wisconsin. Is the group right to say $570 million went to Walker Crones? This figure comes from a document issued in May 2014 by the Liberal Group One Wisconsin now. It was entitled \"W is for WEC: Gov. Scott Walker Trade Section: Case study on corruption, nepotism and incompetence.\" Early in his term, Walker replaced the Ministry of Public Trade with the private and public economic development company in Wisconsin. Its stated logic was to narrow the focus on job creation. In 2013, government auditors found that the Agency had not followed up adequately on whether companies had created jobs that had been given incentives; did not clearly report the job numbers they had; and provided awards for unqualified businesses and projects. Following this, Wisconsin has now sought to link donors to the Walker election campaign with loans, grants, bonds, tax exemptions or other financial assistance granted or supervised by the Walker Agency, headed by Walker. The group stated that it had found $570 million in financial incentives for 192 companies whose employees had been the source of contributions for the Walker campaign. Between 2009 and 2013, Walker had received more than $1 million from people associated with companies and, in some cases, their spouses. (Incentives are paid in full over several years, unless the targets are met.) We did our own checks on $570 million and we talked to Wen Wisconsin now, the Wisconsin Grand Committee and Walker's campaign about advertising. In sum: There is a way to arrive at this figure, but it is a great extension of its description as the Greater Wisconsin Commission did in its declaration. There is no doubt that individuals associated with companies who received assistance from WEDC gave Walker campaigns. For example, in 2011 and 2013, WEDC Sargento provided food for $1.5 million in tax exemptions to support capital projects. From 2009 to 2013, company directors, their spouses and other company employees gave more than $81,000 to Walker campaigns. They gave nothing to Walker's opponents at that time. And all of that is not new -- the democratic predecessor of Walker, Jim Doyle, has received these donations, as every governor has undoubtedly received. This may not have been surprising in the case of Walker in particular, since the natural basis for supporting Republicans is business. But the TV ad is playing fast and fast in describing all these Cronz donors that you know as \"friends of companies.\" The use of the word \"crony\" itself, of course, carries a negative cycle. When the Declaration mentions two media sources to support the language it uses, it misleads both sources. WKOW-TV is included in Madison as a source of \"friends\" in terms of incentives. However, the online story cited in the announcement called them donors. The announcement quotes Busher, Madison &apos; s Free Weekly, for the term \"chrones.\" The publication used the phrase, but in a story from July 18, 2013 -- a year before the issue of $570 million. More importantly, the research on which the figure of $570 million is based involves many companies whose employees have also provided Democrats. In fact, key candidates from both parties usually receive business support - financial flows to the ruling party and its allies. The Wisconsin Grand Commission itself received funds from groups supported by wealthy business interests, according to data from the Democracy Campaign. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women have gained employment.\" On January 15, 2021, Nosiapa Mezan, our examination found that 35 companies that received over $295 million in assistance from the Walker Center for Environment and Environment had supported Doyle in the past through employee contributions. This includes donors in major companies such as Minards, Ashley Fates and Cole. If only those related companies hit Doyle, $570 million is already down to about $275 million. Similar links can be found with respect to contributions to the Mayor of Milwaukee Tom Barrett (who faced Walker in 2010 and 2012 in the summoning case) and other Democrats, including to a much lesser extent the Walker opponent in 2014, Mary Burke. Even more revealing is the case of Promega Biotechnology in Wichburg, which received $75 million from the bond authority overseen by WEDC. The one he put on the \"Crony\" ad list. But the founder of the company, William Linton, gave Walker nothing. On the contrary, he gave $6,000 to Doyle, $17,500 to Barrett for his two campaigns against Walker and $1,000 to Burke, late last year. Bromega employees have given the vast majority of Democrats and liberals for years, over $30,000. Only two staff members provided a total of $600 to Walker, based on our examination of the searchable Democratic Campaign Financing Database. However, the company makes the list. There is no doubt that the contributions made by workers in some companies have been substantial. Total contributions to Walker were made by staff in 45 companies that won $172 million in assistance of $5,000 or more. However, the analysis used in the declaration did not distinguish between senior executives who make the most voluntary contributions and rank and number workers whose small contributions may have nothing to do with any willingness on the part of the company to remain in the good looks of Walker. Nor does it matter if donors present the right to a prize soon, or a small gift three years ago. Eleven companies received $14 million in assistance, although their employees provided $100 or less in total. Was Walker rewarding \"friends\" when Wick gave the giant Amazon company $7 million as tax exemptions in October 2013? The Amazon programme engineer in Ohio gave the Walker campaign a total of $160 that year in grants, the only donations identified as Amazon staff to Walker. That's the only one who put Amazon on the list. A contribution of this magnitude is a decrease in the ocean when it comes to raising funds from Walker of $56 million, or $50 million, since mid-2009. We've tried an exercise, we've selected a thousand dollars as a minimum Grune threshold -- surely your close friends in one company will be giving this amount over five years. Companies that pay their owners and employees together less than $1,000 - and did not give Doyle - represent $160 million in aid out of $570 million. If you take out $160 million, the floor will be reduced to about $115 million. In addition, we found that $7.5 million in transactions were wrongly attributed to the Walker era when they were carried out under Doyle. Recent observation: Of the $570 million in aid from the Council for Environment and Development, mentioned in the Declaration, more than $295 million came from flood-relief loans to developers as part of the federal flood relief programme known as the Mid-West Disaster Zone Bonds. The Walker campaign argues that it is misleading to include them in total Economic and Social Council aid because local communities, rather than the Economic and Social Council, issue bond funds. However, in some cases, the Agency assists developers, allocates the power of association and reviews transactions, so that it boasts that the programme is helping to achieve Walker's goal of 250,000 new jobs in the private sector. \"Scott Walker made money to create jobs in Wisconsin for his friends: friends of companies who contributed to his campaigns\" claimed and received $570 million in incentives. The list of companies that won $570 million and gave it to Walker is the starting point for trying to figure out where a real Walker guy got a great deal. But that's it. Much of this money went to companies that had introduced their employees to Democrats in the past. Many donations were small, and the Walker Employment Agency has a limited role in dealing with companies associated with a large share of $570 million. The declaration makes a very hot charge of corruption, even placing a dollar on it, but it cannot deliver the goods. We're assessing the allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07355"}
