The attack ads are getting more direct, as the delegates in contention dwindle.\nThis ad presents a series of facts to suggest that Kasich, as governor of Ohio, orchestrated shady deals to benefit his friends and campaign funders.\n\"Right before John Kasich was governor, he collected $611,000 from a Fortune 500 corporation,\" the ad says. \"After Kasich became governor, that same company received $619 grand in state tax breaks for job creation. But last year, the company laid off 100 Ohioans, even as its CEO cut a half-million-dollar check to Kasich\u2019s super PAC. John Kasich, not for us.\"\nTo find out whether it\u2019s fact or fiction, let\u2019s take each allegation one at a time.\nKasich took money from a Fortune 500 company\nAccording to news reports, in 2001 after leaving Congress, Kasich joined the board of directors of Worthington Industries, an Ohio steel processor and Fortune 500 company. Security and Exchange Commission filings show that Worthington board members were paid $45,000 per year as a retainer, and $1,500 per meeting attended. Worthington also reimbursed board members for travel expenses and other out-of-pocket costs.\nThe Canton Repository reported that Kasich quit the Worthington board upon winning the governor\u2019s race in 2010, but was still owed deferred compensation from the board. Kasich received $611,000 total in deferred compensation from Worthington, and at least $103,000 of the total came after he had been sworn in as governor.\nThat same company received $619,000 in tax breaks after Kasich took office\nIn the first bill he signed as governor, Kasich made good on a campaign promise to attract investment to Ohio. He nixed the Ohio Department of Development and created a private, nonprofit corporation called JobsOhio, explaining that in order to lure companies to the state, government needed to \"move at the speed of business.\" \u00a0\nKasich designed JobsOhio to be funded by a lease on state liquor profits. He declared it exempt from public records requirements and state audits. And he made board appointments for JobsOhio a responsibility of the governor. \u00a0\nTo drum up job creation, JobsOhio reviews potential opportunities to offer incentives such as tax breaks, and sends its recommendations to the Ohio Tax Credit Authority for final determination. The tax credit authority has a five-member board, and three of its appointees, including the chair, are Kasich\u2019s.\nAn Associated Press investigation found that, less than a year after JobsOhio was created, it recommended a series of tax incentives totalling $619,000 for Worthington Industries\u2019 subsidiaries, which the state tax credit board awarded.\nLast year, the company laid off 100 Ohioans\nIn March 2015, Worthington announced it was cutting 555 jobs nationwide, which included 115 in Ohio. The company blamed the loss of these jobs --manufacturing cabs for large agricultural and mining equipment -- on industry-wide downturns.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorthington spokeswoman Cathy Lyttle told the Canton Repository that any incentives the company receives are only paid when the company delivers the jobs it promised. She said that pursuing tax incentives is standard business practice, and Worthington received $400,000 in tax breaks under the previous, Democratic regime of governor Ted Strickland.\nCompany\u2019s CEO donates half-million to Kasich\u2019s presidential bid\nThe Center for Responsive Politics confirms a $500,000 contribution from Worthington CEO John P. McConnell to the New Day 2016 PAC, via Internal Revenue Service records released November 30, 2015.\nSeveral of Kasich's board appointees\u00a0stepped up with campaign donations as well. OpenSecrets.org shows that the wife of ethics committee chairman Merom Brachman, Judith, gave the maximum donation to Kasich\u2019s campaign, $2,700, in August 2015. John C. Boland, the chair of JobsOhio, donated the $2,700 max to Kasich in July 2015. JobsOhio board member Gary R. Heminger and his wife, Jane, each donated $2,700 to Kasich on the same day in October 2015. JobsOhio board member Lawrence J. Kidd and his wife, Cindy, each donated $2,700 to Kasich on the same day in August 2015.\nAll together now\nCruz\u2019s attack ad parrots a complaint filed with the Ohio Ethics Commission by Kasich\u2019s Democratic challenger in the 2014 election, Ed FitzGerald.\nThe ethics commission passed on investigating FitzGerald\u2019s complaint. Chairman Brachman, who, like the other commissioners, was appointed by the governor, said that Kasich had provided enough information to conclusively rule out any conflict of interest. He added that actions by JobsOhio are not subject to the authority of the ethics commission.\nRob Nichols, Kasich\u2019s spokesman, dismissed this Cruz ad as a \"one-hit wonder\" that only ran briefly in Wisconsin and is no longer airing.\nThe ad\u2019s \"four accurate, provable data points,\" aren\u2019t in dispute, Nichols said. But he has a beef with the insinuation that any of the described actions were wrong, or even out of the ordinary.\n\"They didn\u2019t say, \u2018The governor\u2019s corrupt,\u2019 because that you could fact-check,\" Nichols said. \"Everything there is 100 percent, entirely above-board, but when you say it with a snarly voice over scary music, people think it\u2019s inappropriate.\"\nOur ruling\nCruz\u2019s attack ad links a series of headlines to suggest that as governor, Kasich rewarded his former business ties in exchange for political contributions.\nThe ad\u2019s tone is ominous, but the text is factual. What isn\u2019t explained is that everything in the ad has been the subject of prior complaints that did not provoke any regulatory action.\nIt\u2019s been suggested that an overhaul of state rules might prevent similar situations from arising, and similar allegations from dogging Ohio leaders. But that\u2019s a different ad, for another day.\nWe rate these claims Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5c230c3d-e90e-48ec-854d-8dc94efa2c1a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05118"}
