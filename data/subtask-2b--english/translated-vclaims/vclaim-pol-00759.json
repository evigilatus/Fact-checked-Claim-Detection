Recently asked about the MSNBC \"Morning of Joe\" on defence cases. The host participant, Willie Geist, wanted to know about Williamson's ability to be the commander-in-chief and how it would change the direction of the two-decade-long American war in Afghanistan. In response, 66-year-old California made an allegation that we wanted to verify the facts. \"For every dollar we spend on creating real peace,\" she said, \"We spend more than $1,000 on ways to prepare for war.\" Williamson also filed a campaign claim in New Hampshire and on Twitter. American military spending, of course, is quantifiable - although people can argue about their willingness to war, as Williamson said. Perhaps more difficult: how do you calculate what the nation spends on \"peaceful creation\"? \"The logic is that it is a perfectly valid and indefensible statement,\" said David Hooker, a professor at the Croak Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame. \"It will be easy to gather facts according to the types of expenses we identify as preparation for peace or preparation for war... The facts and the truth, in this case, are not the same category of material.\" Other experts agree that the proportion of expenditure can vary sharply, depending on what they consider to be part of peace or part of war. At the same time, it is clear that the State spends much less on peacebuilding. The global spending that the Williamson campaign sent us to support the candidate's statement is basically just another claim - and it applies to global spending, not American spending. That claim, made in 2011 by the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a war-fighting lobby in Washington, D.C., is that the world spends $1 on conflict prevention for every $1,885 spent on military budgets. Theo Sitter, an employee of the Commission, told us that he did not know how the two numbers were calculated. However, he said that the Williamson general point was \"right,\" given the studies that he said indicated that every dollar spent on conflict resolution saved the world $16 on the costs of conflict. We found several other different ways to look at the numbers. Everyone has boundaries. We'll start by admitting that US spending on its army is, in fact, huge. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines to provide security, and said, \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, in his latest annual report on global military spending, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said that US military spending was $610 billion in 2017. This was the same amount as in 2016 - but more than the next seven countries that spent together. However, the Institute does not track expenditure on peace. Charles Kenny, a senior colleague at the Centre for Global Development in Washington, D.C., noted that the $610 billion more than 2,000 times the $299 million spent by the United States in 2016 on civil peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution, according to a 2018 report. That report was prepared by the European Centre for Development Policy Management, which describes itself as \"a think tank that wants policies in Europe and Africa to work for inclusive and sustainable development.\" But Kenny agreed that the devil is in detail. \"In view of the link between poverty and civil conflict, one may argue that any expenditure that promotes development helps to build peace. Similarly, the expenditures of the United States Department of Defense on logistics capacity, in particular, are indeed important to support a range of peacekeeping operations.\" \"On the other hand, the active support for munitions that help Saudi Arabia blow up Yemen and the assistance of the United States Air Force in refuelling Saudi bombers are not good for peace, and I do not claim that spending on \"preparation for war\" is as much as feeding the war. Caroline Hughes, Head of Peace Studies in Notre Dame, said that another comparison begins with US military spending, which amounts to $989 billion for fiscal year 2019-20 -- if the core budget of the Ministry of Defence is calculated, emergency operations abroad to fight the Islamic State and other funding, including some funds for state ministries, veterans' affairs and internal security. This amount is approximately 1,000 times higher than the US contributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations in the period 2017-18, which amounted to $1.8 billion. But Hughes -- who said, \"You can discuss endlessly the exact list of activities that you wanted to list in either list\" -- admitted: \"You can, of course, challenge this as a fairly raw measure.\" When Todd Harrison, Director of Defence Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, responded to our query about Williamson's claim, he found a much lower proportion. According to figures from the White House Bureau of Management and Budget, the United States spent $726 billion in 2019 on national defence (including estimated and mandatory expenditure) - just under 10 times the $75 billion spent on diplomacy and international relations. However, he acknowledged that \"peaceful creation\" could be defined more narrowly, making the ratio higher. At the same time, taxpayers told General Vice President Steve Ellis, an expert in the federal budget in Washington, that there was simply an excessive ambiguity in the Williamson statement. \"What is \"peaceful creation\" in the budget? Is she a diplomat? \"A foreign aid?\" He asked. \"Some say that nuclear deterrence is \"the creation of peace\" - and what is \"the preparation for war\" in the budget? Is this the entire Pentagon budget?\" Ellis added: \"The army spends more than it spends on diplomacy and aid,\" but \"I don't see how it can reach $1,000.\" Our Governor Williamson said: \"Every dollar we spend on creating real peace, we spend more than $1,000 on ways to prepare for war.\" The experts told us that - depending on how you define mysterious terms to create peace and prepare for war - it is possible to show a large proportion of federal spending. But other calculations put the ratio well below 1000 to 1. The Williamson commentary refers to a precision that does not exist. We evaluate the statement half right.
