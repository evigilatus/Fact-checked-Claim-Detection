Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\nIt isn't really Sanders.\n\"Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and a young Bernie Sanders marching in Cuba,\" states the cutline underneath a black and white photo of a group of men marching together with their arms linked.\nThe post, published on Facebook on Feb. 28, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe photo has a red arrow pointing to a man the Facebook post identifies as Sanders. But we found no evidence that it is Sanders.\nSanders\u2019 campaign spokesman Josh Orton told PolitiFact that Sanders never met with Castro or Guevara.\nWe found the same photo with a different caption using a reverse image search. The caption said, \"Fidel Castro Left next to Osvaldo Dortic\u00f3s (President of Cuba from 1959 until 1976) with Che Guevara at a 1959 parade in Havana.\" The photo is credited to the World History Archive/Alamy Stock archive.\nCastro ruled Cuba for decades until 2008. Guevara was a major figure in the Cuban revolution led by Castro in the late 1950s.\nWhere was Sanders in 1959? That\u2019s the year he graduated from high school in Brooklyn.\nHis spokesman said Sanders did not get\u00a0on an airplane until 1961, when he attended the University of Chicago.\nThe same photo of the men marching with a claim that one is Sanders\u00a0appeared on an undated article by Gishop Gallop,\u00a0which identifies itself as an entertainment website and has this warning in jest:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Please do not let your children use this site. If something in one of the stories you see here is not true, that would mean it\u2019s fiction. You can still do that without censorship \u2013 create fiction. You may see satire and that\u2019s okay, too. If this offends you, you may want to look at a better use of your time than run-of-the-mill indignation. Your Chi will improve. This sentence legally follows the one preceding it.\"\nAnother sign that the Gishop Gallop story isn\u2019t authentic\u00a0is the bio for the author, \"Cleveland Sam,\" which is filled with silly anecdotes about his alleged heroism, such as rescuing a girl from the \"clutches of a herd of llamas\" and saving children from near deaths from \"freak ice cream truck accidents.\"\nThe undated story about Sanders in the photo also contains a number of other ridiculous statements about Sanders, including that he was born in Cuba but later fled on a trunk lid of a 1960 Chevrolet converted into a boat.\nUpdate: So who is the man?\nAfter we posted this fact-check, we received an email from American University professor William LeoGrande, an expert on Latin American politics, about the identity of the man in the photo that the Facebook post falsely identified as Sanders.\nLeoGrande told us that the man in the photo was Regino Boti Le\u00f3n, minister of the National Economic Council in the first Cuban council of ministers after 1959. The photo was taken March 5, 1960, during a march in memory of the victims of the explosion of the munitions ship La Coubre that Castro believed was sabotaged by the CIA, he said.\nHe pointed to a more famous photo from the same march found on Wikimedia. It doesn\u2019t show Boti Le\u00f3n\u2019s name in the description but he is listed in the categories at the bottom of the page. Another article about him also shows a photo of him in the march.\nBoti Le\u00f3n came to the U.S. with Castro in April 1959 with the expectation of negotiating an economic aid agreement, LeoGrande said.\n\"But Castro forbid his advisers to ask for help and the State Department refused to offer it, so Castro went away empty handed. As the revolution radicalized, Boti was moved off center stage, but he remained loyal to the revolution, serving in a variety of positions until his death,\" he said.\nProfessor Ted Henken, a Latino studies professor at Baruch College City College of New York, also confirmed that the photo is of Boti Le\u00f3n.\nOur ruling\nA cutline under a photo said that Bernie Sanders marched with Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in Cuba.\nThe same photo appeared on an entertainment website. A reverse image search showed that the historical photo includes Castro and Guevara at a 1959 parade in Havana, but we found no no evidence that Sanders is one of the men in the photo.\nExperts told us the man is Regino Boti Le\u00f3n at a parade in 1960.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3563f564-cbdc-47d8-99f3-341a51990ea1", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00935"}
