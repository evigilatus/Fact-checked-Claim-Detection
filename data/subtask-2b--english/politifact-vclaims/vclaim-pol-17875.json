James Mattis, published criticism of Trump, writing that Trump \"is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people\u2014does not even pretend to try.\"\nIn a tweet, Trump wrote, \"Probably the only thing Barack Obama & I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world\u2019s most overrated General.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2020 \nIt\u2019s not the first time Trump claimed to have given Mattis the nickname \"Mad Dog.\" In a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2019, Trump said he told Mattis \"we\u2019re going to give you a new nickname, because \u2018Chaos\u2019 is not a good nickname. So we changed it to \u2018Mad Dog.\u2019\"\nIn reality, though, Mattis\u2019 \"Mad Dog\" nickname was in common circulation long before Trump tapped him for his cabinet. It dates back at least as far as 2004, and probably well before that. (The White House and the Trump campaign did not respond to inquiries for this article.)\nOn April 16, 2004, the Los Angeles Times published an article filed from Iraq headlined, \"Marines\u2019 \u2018Mad Dog Mattis\u2019 Battles for Iraqis\u2019 Support.\" The article said, \"Behind his back, troops call him \u2018Mad Dog Mattis,\u2019 high praise in Marine culture. \u2018He can swear as much as any enlisted man,\u2019 a corporal said.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

A true General's General!\"\nGeneral James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 \nDuring the confirmation hearing for his nomination as Defense secretary in January 2017, Mattis told senators that the nickname \"was given to me by the press, and some of you may have experienced similar occasions with the press where perhaps they didn't get it quite right.\"\nNews reports have suggested that Mattis has not been a big fan of his nickname. Meanwhile, the nickname \"Chaos\" that Trump referenced comes from the acronym for \"the colonel has an outstanding solution,\" something his troops said as a gentle dig behind his back in the 1990s, according to the Marine Corps Times.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that Mattis\u2019 \"nickname was \u2018Chaos,\u2019 which I didn\u2019t like, & changed to \u2018Mad Dog.\u2019\"\nThis is the second time that Trump has said he gave Mattis his \"Mad Dog\" nickname, but it\u2019s flat wrong. The nickname dates back at least as far as 2004, when it was used in the headline of a Los Angeles Times article \u2014 12 years before Trump first used the nickname publicly as he was considering Mattis as his Defense Secretary.\nWe rate the statement Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17875"}
