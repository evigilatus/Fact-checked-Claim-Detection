Now comes a new one: that taxpayers may soon be footing the bill for free sex-change operations.\n\n\nOn Aug. 4, a news release to that effect went out under the name of Matt Barber, who is director of cultural affairs with Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal group, and the associate dean of Liberty University School of Law, which was founded by the late televangelist Jerry Falwell. It was quickly spread by blogs on the left and the right.\n\n\nTitled, \u201cObamaCare Likely to Mandate Free \u2018Sex Change\u2019 Surgeries,\u201d the release asserted that \u201cthe weight of the evidence indicates that cosmetic \u2018gender reassignment\u2019 surgeries for both U.S. citizens and illegal immigrants who suffer from [the American Psychiatric Association-] recognized \u2018Gender Identity Disorder\u2019 (GID) may also be provided \u2013 free of charge \u2013 courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer. The current price tag for such a procedure can exceed $50,000.\u201d\n\n\nTo confirm Barber\u2019s authorship and learn more about his reasoning, we tried to reach him through the phone number and e-mail address listed on the release, as well as through a call to a different number at Liberty Counsel. But he did not respond. Because we couldn't confirm his authorship, we're attributing this item to our generic category \"bloggers,\" since they have spread it so widely.\n\n\nBefore we delve into our findings in detail, here's an overview of why we found the claim was False: The news release tries to stitch together a patchwork of unrelated items to back up the sex-change claim, but the health care bills as they appear today simply don't do what the release alleges. There is no mandate for sex-change coverage.\n\n\nThe news release offers three pieces of evidence:\n\n\n\u2022 An exchange between Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., about the legislation covering treatments that would be \"medically necessary.\"\n\n\n\u2022 Language in the House version of the health care bill that provides for \"standards, as appropriate, for the collection of accurate data on health and health care\" based on \"sex, sexual orientation [and] gender identity.\"\n\n\n\u2022 And language in a draft Senate bill that requires the Department of Health and Human Services to \u201c\u2018develop standards for the measurement of gender\u2019 (i.e., officially recognize subjectively self-determined \"transgender\" or \"transsexual\" gender identities). It further mandates \u2018participation in the institutions\u2019 programs of individuals and groups from ... different genders and sexual orientations.\u201d\n\n\nLet\u2019s take these assertions one by one.\n\n\n\nThe Hatch-Mikulski exchange\n\n\n\nIt came during a session held by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to revise a Senate version of the health care bill.\n\n\nThe committee was discussing an amendment by Mikulski that would require health insurance plans to include preventive women's health services. Hatch asked his colleague whether that meant that coverage of abortions would be required. She replied that the measure would not \u201cmandate\u201d abortion coverage but would \u201cprovide for any service deemed medically necessary or medically appropriate.\u201d The amendment narrowly passed the committee and was appended to the bill.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's worth noting that Mikulski's amendment may not survive to enactment. And her comments quoted in the news release aren\u2019t, in and of themselves, binding.\n\n\nStill, the news release used Mikulski\u2019s explanation on abortion to assert that sex-change treatments would also be covered under the same doctrine. Before we get to the substance of that claim, let\u2019s look at the significance of Mikulski's phrase \"medically necessary.\"\n\n\nSeth Chandler, the co-director of the Health Law and Policy Institute at the University of Houston, said that the phrase does carry weight. \u201cThat is kind of a magic word in health insurance, in that virtually every private insurance plan I know of contains an exclusion for procedures that are not medically necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to preclude fraudulent or highly experimental procedures.\u201d\n\n\nThe American Medical Association, the nation\u2019s leading doctors\u2019 group, has already gone on record saying that gender-reassignment surgery can be medically necessary. In 2008, the AMA passed a resolution on gender identity disorder that opposes coverage limitations \u201cwhen such care is based upon sound scientific evidence and sound medical opinion.\u201d\n\n\nEven so, insurers have not made such coverage universal today. The Web site of the National Center for Lesbian Rights posts a fact sheet that says that such surgeries have long been banned by Medicare and CHAMPUS, the federally run military health plan. Medicaid does not specifically bar those surgeries, the fact sheet added, but some states have statutes barring them.\n\n\nAs for the private sector, neither America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the trade group for private insurers, nor the Transgender Law Center could provide us with figures on how common it is for transgender surgeries to be covered by insurance. But AHIP\u2019s vice president of communications, Susan Pisano, said that, anecdotally, \u201cmy understanding is that there is less coverage for those procedures and treatments. \u2026 Some employers do provide it, but I don\u2019t think most people have coverage for those services.\u201d\n\n\nIndeed, the AMA resolution noted that \u201cmany health insurance plans categorically exclude coverage of mental health, medical, and surgical treatments for GID, even though many of these same treatments, such as psychotherapy, hormone therapy, breast augmentation and removal, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, orchiectomy, and salpingectomy, are often covered for other medical conditions.\u201d\n\n\nStill, there is at least a nugget of plausibility in the news release citing Mikulski\u2019s language. It may indeed make it into the final version of health reform, and if so, it could provide justification for expanding (though not necessarily mandating) coverage of procedures that are controversial but deemed medically necessary.\n\n\n\nThe House and Senate language\n\n\n\nBut in its other points, relating to language in the House and Senate bills, the news release offers little evidence to back up its claim.\n\n\nThe release's discussion of the House bill's language focuses on one mention of collecting health care data based on \u201csex, sexual orientation [and] gender identity.\u201d We looked up the passage, and it comes in a section that lays out the job description for a new assistant secretary of Health and Human Services for health information. That official is charged with setting standards for data collection on a number of factors, including such commonplace categories as race, sex, ethnicity, primary language and geographic setting in addition to \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity.\u201d\n\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the section mentions gender identity, it merely addresses how health care data on a wide variety of subgroups should be collected. It is not a green light to cover sex-change surgeries.\n\n\nThe evidence is even flimsier in the release's claim about the Senate bill\u2019s language. The first phrase the news release cites \u2013 that a Senate draft bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to \u201cdevelop standards for the measurement of gender\u201d \u2013 would, according the release, \u201cofficially recognize subjectively self-determined\u00a0 \u2018transgender\u2019 or \u2018transsexual\u2019 gender identities.\u201d\n\n\nWe find that's a ridiculous leap of logic. The passage in question is the equivalent of the House bill\u2019s language on data collection, not mandated coverage. The full passage cites the development of statistical standards to measure not just for gender but also for \u201cgeographic location, socioeconomic status, primary language and disability measures.\u201d\n\n\nThe second passage cited from the Senate bill addresses mental and behavioral health grants that may be awarded by the federal government to students. Its reference to \u201cparticipation in the institutions\u2019 programs of individuals and groups from ... different genders and sexual orientations\u201d merely constitutes a requirement that schools receiving support under the grant program adhere to principles of nondiscrimination and diversity in \u201cracial, ethnic, cultural, geographic, religious, linguistic, and class backgrounds\u201d as well as for \u201cdifferent genders and sexual orientations.\u201d\n\n\nThat's simply a requirement that the participating educational institutions not discriminate \u2014 not a mandate for covering sex-change surgeries.\n\n\nThe bottom line is that neither bill talks specifically about gender-reassignment surgery. The news release has attempted \u2014 poorly, in most cases \u2014 to piece together a patchwork case. But the health reform plans as they stand now don't do what the release claims.\n\n\nIn theory, the House bill does offer one path by which coverage of sex-change surgeries could be made mandatory.\u00a0 If that part of the bill survives to enactment, a new panel called the Health Benefits Advisory Council could eventually recommend that sex-change surgeries be covered.\n\n\nThe council, chaired by the surgeon general, would be tasked with recommending to the HHS secretary what \u201ctreatments, items and services\u201d constitute \u201cessential benefits.\u201d If the HHS secretary agreed with the recommendations, they would initially take effect for public-option plans if such plans were part of the final legislation. After a five-year transitional period, private plans would have to adhere to this basic package of services.\n\n\nSo in theory, it would be in the Health Benefits Advisory Council\u2019s power to decide to include gender-reassignment surgery in the package of essential benefits.\n\n\nBut that's a far cry \u2014 and many political hurdles away \u2014 from \"mandating\" sex-change coverage. Given the public\u2019s squeamishness about the topic, it doesn't seem to us that it's \u201clikely,\u201d as the news release suggested.\n\n\nSo let\u2019s recap. The release may have a point that Mikulski\u2019s comment could open the door to \"medically necessary\" coverage which conceivably may include sex-change operations. But it's unclear whether her amendment will remain in the legislation, and there's nothing specific in the legislation on sex-change procedures and nothing else solid that indicates such coverage will be provided. The news release cherry-picked a few fleeting references to \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csexual orientation\u201d in completely unrelated contexts to argue that proposed health care legislation would mandate free sex-change surgeries (and allow them for illegal aliens, no less). To us, these bits of evidence are wholly unpersuasive. We find the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15649"}
