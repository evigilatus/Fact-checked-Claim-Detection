Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights.\n\nVan Zant is sponsoring a bill (HB 845) that would criminalize abortions performed because of the race or sex of the fetus, and during debate, he suggested that abortion groups such as Planned Parenthood are targeting African-Americans.\n\nDo statistics about the African-American population in the United States support his claim?\n\nWhat we found in this case is that Van Zant makes a complicated, and largely unsubstantiated leap of logic. Taken at its most literal meaning, his statement is preposterous. The black population grew by 67 percent, not decreased by 25 percent, from 1973 to 2010, according to U.S. Census figures.\n\nInterpreting his statement the way Van Zant and other anti-abortion groups intend -- that the U.S. black population would be at least 25 percent higher were it not for Roe v. Wade -- is also fraught with problems.\n\nTo start, federal data for abortions is imprecise, and that\u2019s not even factoring in the additional layer of abortions by race. Van Zant\u2019s claim is largely based on guesstimates. Then there\u2019s the bigger issue of arguing that every fetus would be alive today had the pregnancy not have been aborted, a premise social scientists called over-simplified and inaccurate.\n\nWe\u2019ll take you through it.\n\nHow does Van Zant get there?\n\nVan Zant\u2019s legislative aide gave us a packet of information relating to his remarks, including print-outs from Abort73.com, an antiabortion advocacy group, on abortion and race. Here, we found a similarly worded version of Van Zant\u2019s claim.\n\n\"From 1973 to 2012, abortion reduced the black population by 30 percent, and that doesn\u2019t even factor in all the children that would have been born to those aborted a generation ago,\" Abort73.com states.\n\nThe website explains how it gets to 30 percent (we\u2019re not vouching for the methodology, mind you): 17 million black babies were aborted since Roe v. Wade (55 million total abortions, as reported by National Right to Life, multiplied by 31 percent, which is what they say is the average rate of abortions by black women since 1973). The black population (people who identified as only black, not a combination of races, to the Census) was around 39 million people in 2010.\n\nSo the black population, once you include 17 million would-be babies, should be 56 million people.\n\nThat\u2019s how they get the talking point. So is it reasonable or accurate?\n\nData limitations and manipulations\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau, not surprisingly, does not come up with projections for what a population would have been without abortions. (We checked.)\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not have a complete record of the number of abortions on black mothers since Roe v. Wade. We knew from the start the agency\u2019s abortion data is incomplete, as not every state reports abortion data to the feds. Florida, for example, reports its abortions but does not break down the mother\u2019s race or age.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRick Scott\n\n\nstated on June 8, 2010 in a campaign mail piece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bill McCollum holds the same position on (embryonic stem cell research) as Barack Obama.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 June 11, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center, which only started collecting racial/ethnic abortion data from state health departments in 1990, compiled this spreadsheet for us, emphasizing it has many caveats. By the CDC\u2019s count, there have been 39.3 million abortions since 1973. Between 1990 and 2009, 4 million of those were by black women.\n\nWe checked with the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports access to abortion and uses a different method to count abortions. Instead of collecting data from state health departments, the Guttmacher Institute surveys a sample of abortion providers every few years. From 1973 to 2008, the most recent year for which their data is available, nearly 50 million legal abortions occurred in the United States.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute also does not have a total for abortions by race and ethnicity since 1973, as the group started collecting demographic data of women obtaining abortions in 1994. Their findings do not offer totals, just a proportion of abortions to each racial group.\n\nIn 2008, white women accounted for 36 percent of abortions, black women for 30 percent, Hispanic women for 25 percent and non-Hispanic women of other races for 9 percent, according to Guttmacher\u2019s tally.\n\nNot so simple\n\nThere is one thing not up for debate: If all of the black women who had abortions had decided to carry their pregnancies to term, there would be more black people alive today.\n\nBut Van Zant\u2019s number is considerably inflated, social scientists told us.\n\n\"The claim that all terminated pregnancies would be alive today is false,\" said Elwood Carlson, a Florida State University sociology professor who specializes in demography for reproductive health, adult mortality and family.\n\nSome of the pregnancies would have ended by stillbirths and spontaneous abortions, which end an estimated 15 to 20 percent of pregnancies, said Karin Brewster, director of FSU\u2019s Center for Demography and Population Health.\n\nPlus, black Floridians are twice as likely as white Floridians to have spontaneous pregnancy losses, Carlson said.\n\nAnd even among the pregnancies ending with birth, some of those babies would have died as infants. The rate of infant death after live birth is also twice as high for black Floridians as for white Floridians, he said. Further, he said, the risk of involuntary death for black Floridians is twice as high as the risk to white Floridians from conception through adulthood.\n\n\"Induced abortions are only the tip of an iceberg of unequal life chances faced by black citizens of Florida, an iceberg that has been part of life in the state for at least the last half-century and which is showing no signs of drifting away,\" he said.\n\nElwood criticized Van Zant for isolating black abortions and not also mentioning there would be more white, Hispanic and Asian citizens if not for abortion.\n\nOther criticisms from the sources we consulted said it is inappropriate to take correlational data and make causal inferences, and that we don\u2019t know what effect an abortion has on subsequent family planning. Some of the people counted in 2010 may not have been conceived had their mothers elected to carry their first pregnancy.\n\nBefore we close, we\u2019ll point out that Van Zant\u2019s claim does not bolster his case that minority abortions happen because of race, as most abortions are performed because the mother cannot afford a child or having a child would interfere with other responsibilities at work, school or to other children.\n\nOur ruling\n\nVan Zant made a fiery case for his bill preventing gender- and race-based abortions, saying abortion providers like Parent Parenthood -- without the Nazis or the KKK -- \u00a0\"have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973.\"\n\nVan Zant\u2019s statement is wildly incorrect by the most literal measure -- the African-American population has increased since 1973. There\u2019s also problems with the claim if you buy into Van Zant\u2019s logic. Namely, abortion statistics are incomplete and/or difficult to interpret. And there\u2019s no one-to-one correlation between an abortion and the population today.\n\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09421"}
