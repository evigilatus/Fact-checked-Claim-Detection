No.", "text": "Update, 7 November 2019: The Attorney General of Lithuania James in New York announced on 7 November 2019 that the Supreme Court in New York had ordered President Donald J. Trump to pay $2 million in compensation \"for improper use of charitable assets to interfere with the 2016 presidential election and promote his own political interests.\" As part of the settlement, other conditions were settled in the lawsuit, including a provision concerning the participation of the Tramp family in charitable associations. The settlement required compulsory training for the three adult children of Tramp and imposed restrictions on Donald J. Trump if he joined another charitable association as director. Any charitable association whose director Trump acts must have a majority of independent directors (i.e. no one in his internal service). They must also engage a lawyer with experience in New York non-profit law. They must use the services of an accounting firm to monitor and review the Organization &apos; s grants and expenditures. If Trump starts a new charity, that charity must also comply with those requirements and report to the New York Attorney General for five years. The settlement includes \"a complete prohibition of self-treatment,\" as the lawsuit has repeatedly accused Tramp of using the funds of his institution for his personal, commercial and political interests. However, the settlement does not prevent the Trump family from operating a charity in New York, as claimed by this original Facebook publication. There has been no change in our decision on this statement. The original article reads as follows: The pending lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his three oldest children seeks to prevent them from temporarily participating in charities in New York. The Facebook article, however, takes it further, claiming that the family is already \"benefied.\" That didn't happen. The Trumps were forbidden to operate any charity in New York State because they were stolen from a child cancer charity. A charitable association for children with cancer On October 8, Facebook, a children's charity in cancer, said, participated more than 43,000 times. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In June 2018, the Attorney-General of New York (then Barbara Underwood) sued Trump and three of his adult children - Donald J. Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric V. Trump - and the Donald J. Trump Foundation. The lawsuit claimed that for more than a decade, the Foundation has been violating state and federal laws on charities in the state of New York. Trump founded the foundation and served as its president; his three oldest children were on the board of directors. \"This pattern of illegal behaviour on the part of the institution and its board of directors includes improper and widespread political activity, repeated and deliberate transactions, failure to follow basic credit obligations or even the preliminary formalities of companies required by the law,\" said the lawsuit. On January 22, 2021, Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen mentioned an article on Facebook in which the Paiden administration said that she was a liberal terrorist. \u2022 On 22 January 2021, the lawsuit sought to dissolve the institution and temporarily ban Tramps from future service in New York or non-profit charitable organizations. Specifically, the lawsuit seeks to prohibit Trump &apos; s involvement for 10 years and the three Trump &apos; s children for one year. The ban on Trump children will be suspended if they receive training in related fiduciary duties. The solution was approved by Donald Trump in December 2018. However, the legal issue is still ongoing. A spokesman for the New York State Prosecutor &apos; s Office said that the Office could not comment on the pending case. The Facebook publication contains a picture of Trump and his son Eric, demonstrating what appears to have happened to the Trump Foundation and St. Jude Child Research Hospital. St. Jude treats childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Eric Trump raised money for St. Jude. The Eric Trump Foundation has also been subjected to scrutiny, but the lawsuit seeking to prohibit Trump's participation in charities in New York is not linked to Eric Trump. Forbes stated that the Eric Trump Foundation gave donors the impression that all the funds raised at the annual golf event went to St. Jude, but over $500,000 went to other cases; at least four groups received contributions from Eric Trump subsequently paid for the golf tournaments owned by Trump. Eric Trump resigned in December 2016 from his own institution, restructuring itself and renaming itself as dominant. Our Facebook article said, \"The Trump family was prevented from operating any charity in New York State because they were stolen from a children's cancer charity.\" Any lawsuit that seeks to temporarily prohibit Donald Trump and his three older children from being part of charity in New York. However, this case is still pending. The case concerns Donald J. Trump, not a charity for children with cancer. The prosecution alleges that Trump used charitable assets to pay for the legal obligations of the entities he controlled, to encourage his hotels, to buy personal items, and to support his presidential campaign. He led Trump's son, Eric, an institution that raised money for children with cancer, and this institution was scrutinized for dealing with money. However, the lawsuit seeking to prevent Trump from participating in charities is not linked to Eric Trump &apos; s foundations. We evaluate the mail wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00028"}
