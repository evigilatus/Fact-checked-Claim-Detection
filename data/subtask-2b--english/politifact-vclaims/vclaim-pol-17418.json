Trump, among others, wrongly claimed it was illegal.\u00a0\nAnd while some people have signed a Change.org petition calling for her arrest after she ripped up her copy of the president\u2019s speech, no arrest has happened. We found no news coverage online about Pelosi being taken into custody. If she had been arrested, it would have drawn plenty of media attention.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17418"}
