A leading reason for this conclusion is that Russian actors tried to access accounts belonging to both Democrats and Republicans through cyber intrusion, but they only widely disseminated significant information stolen from the Democrats.\nAt his press conference, Trump said the Democrats could have done a better job protecting themselves, like the Republicans did.\nThe Russians \"tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through,\" Trump said.\nOver the past few weeks, there has been some confusion about whether the RNC had been infiltrated in a manner similar to the DNC. So we decided to put Trump\u2019s claim on the Truth-O-Meter.\nIn a Kremlin-directed campaign, online con artists stole, then leaked, emails from Clinton campaign Chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee. The emails ended up being posted on WikiLeaks and other online sources. The leaks caused many headaches for the Clinton campaign and led to DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019s resignation.\nIt\u2019s clear that Russian hackers did infiltrate some Republicans and affiliated groups. The website DC Leaks published about 200 emails related to Republican Party business, as well as the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on CNN that Russian actors compromised his campaign emails.\nBut the claim that the RNC specifically was not hacked is significant because the organization is the core of the national Republican Party structure.\nThe New York Times reported Dec. 9 that the Russians did hack the RNC\u2019s computer systems. But the Wall Street Journal reported Dec. 16 that the RNC hacking attempt was unsuccessful. Both reports were based on anonymous sources.\nTwo government reports about the Russian election interference \u2014 published Dec. 29 and Jan. 6 \u2014 don\u2019t provide any clarity. The more extensive Jan. 6 report says only: \"Russia collected on some Republican-affiliated targets but did not conduct a comparable disclosure campaign.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFBI Director James Comey offered the most definitive statements recently, in a Jan. 10 hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nHe explained that the Russian hackers had accessed state-level Republican organizations and candidates, as well as outdated email domains associated with the RNC, but not the active RNC or the Trump campaign.\n\"There was evidence that there was hacking directed at state level organizations, state level campaigns and the RNC, but old domains of the RNC,\" Comey said. \"That is, email domains that they were no longer using, and the information was harvested from there, but it was old stuff. None of that was released. We did not develop any evidence that the Trump campaign or the current RNC was successfully hacked.\"\nHe added that the methods used to attack the RNC and DNC systems were similar. The Russian actors used a technique called phishing, meaning the cyber intruders sent emails designed to trick the recipient into clicking a link and giving over his or her email password.\nBut Comey said the Russian attackers \"got far deeper and wider into\" the DNC, though he couldn\u2019t say why they didn\u2019t get into the current RNC system.\nTrump and other Republican leaders say that the hackers were unable to get into the RNC because of the organization\u2019s superior cyber defenses. While this is a plausible claim, we are unable to independently corroborate it.\nThe RNC pointed us to the December Wall Street Journal article mentioned previously, which reported that \"intruders failed to get past security defenses on the RNC\u2019s computer networks.\" Additionally, the cyber intruders were much less aggressive in their attempts to penetrate the RNC than they were in their attacks against the DNC. This article is based on unnamed sources said to be close to the RNC and the intelligence investigation.\nThe DNC, in contrast, did not have the most-advanced programs for detecting suspicious email traffic installed, and the organization was slow to respond to the FBI\u2019s warning that it had been hacked, reported the New York Times, in an article based on interviews with several on-the-record sources.\nOur ruling\nTrump said the Russians \"tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through.\"\nWhile Russians were able to get into the email accounts of some Republican individuals and state-level Republican organizations, they did not break into the Republican National Committee\u2019s current system, according to the director of the FBI.\nRussians did access email domains associated with the RNC that were no longer in use, but the information was outdated and wasn\u2019t released. Additionally, it\u2019s not completely clear why hackers were unable to get into the current RNC.\nThe gist of Trump\u2019s claim is correct, but it\u2019s important to keep in mind that Russian hackers did access some Republican data, including the outdated RNC account. So we rate his claim Mostly True.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    1 6  Politifact Rating:   The Russians \"tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through.\"     Donald Trump president-elect    in a press conference at Trump Tower Wednesday, January 11, 2017 -01/-11/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03801"}
