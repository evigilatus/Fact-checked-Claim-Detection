Back then, Trump made a statement we at\u00a0PolitiFact PA\u00a0quickly decided was false, saying, \"Here in Philadelphia the murder has been steady \u2014 I mean \u2014 just terribly increasing.\"\nSessions said, \"Preliminary data show murders are up 20 percent from last year. It will put the murder rate at the highest this decade in the city.\"\nFirst off, the murder rate is up 20 percent so far this year. The morning he was speaking, it was actually up 21 percent over the same day as last year and has hovered near 20 every day for at least the last several weeks.\nBut here we are fact-checking the latter part of the statement: whether the homicide rate this year will be the highest of this decade so far and whether it\u2019s reasonable to make such a projection.\nWhen Sessions spoke Friday morning, the homicide count for Philadelphia was 174, according to the Philadelphia Police Department. Given 201 days had so far lapsed this year at that point, Philadelphia had experienced about .87 homicides per day. That rate would lead to 315 or 316 homicides by the end of the year.\nThe total would not be enough to be considered the highest of the 2010s decade, or for the 10-year period of 2008 to 2017. In 2011, 326 homicides occurred here. In 2012, the number was 331. The projected total of 316 would be about 5 percent lower than either of those years, but higher than in any other year of this decade so far.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the other question is whether the number says anything meaningful at this point in the year.\n\"There is so much variability in a low-volume crime such as homicide,\" said Jerry Ratcliffe, a criminal justice professor at Temple, \u00a0\"that predicting months ahead isn\u2019t wise.\"\nIndeed, last year\u2019s homicide total\u00a0appeared to be rising compared to 2015 about midway through the year. As of September 2016, the rate\u00a0was 9 percent higher\u00a0than at the same time period the previous year. But by 2016\u2019s end, Philly had 278 homicides, two fewer than in 2015.\nRatcliffe\u00a0has written extensively\u00a0on this subject and found making early comparisons irrelevant because of fluctuations that are difficult to gauge. In January and February 2014, for instance, Philly saw about 37 percent more homicides than it did in January and February of 2013. But by the end of the year the city\u2019s homicide rate ended up 0.4 percent higher than in 2013.\nHad Sessions even made his comment just two days later, the homicide total of 174 would have been the same, per Philly Police statistics. But because it was two days later in the year, the year-over-year increase had changed to 17 percent and the projected year-end count to 312 or 313 because of a drop to about .85 homicides per day.\nOur Ruling\nSessions said of Philly, \"Preliminary data show that murders are up at a rate of 20 percent from last year, which will put the murder rate at the highest of this decade in the city.\" Homicides are up about 20 percent \u2014 and consistently have been for some time \u2014 but the latter half of his statement is wrong.\nWith 174 murders as of 11:59 p.m. Thursday, Philly was on pace to see about 316 by year\u2019s end. The total would be lower than in 2011 (326) and 2012 (331). That\u2019s not a sizable gap but still wouldn\u2019t put the homicide count at the highest of this decade. On top of that, the merits of making such projections are questionable, given the high variability of homicide.\nWe rule the claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-07-25 14:04:27 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Preliminary murder rates in Philadelphia \"will put the murder rate at the highest of this decade in the city.\"    Jeff Sessions Attorney General   In a speech Friday, July 21, 2017 2017-07-21    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03076"}
