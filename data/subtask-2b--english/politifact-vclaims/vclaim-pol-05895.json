Michael McCaul, R-Austin, chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security, delivered the Republican Party\u2019s Sept. 12, 2015, weekly address, speaking mostly about why he opposes the Iran nuclear agreement announced a couple months before.\nFourteen years after the 9/11 attacks, McCaul said, \"the struggle continues. \u2026 We cannot forget that the radical Shi'a regime in Iran remains the world's leading sponsor of terrorism. Iran's leaders have called for our defeat and the destruction of our close ally, Israel. The regime is responsible for more than 1,000 American casualties during the Iraq war; they have plotted a terrorist attack here in our nation's capital and launched destructive cyber attacks against American companies.\"\nIt\u2019s not a surprise, perhaps, that unfriendly governments including Iran try cyberattacks, nor is it news that Iran has called for Israel\u2019s fall. But we wondered if McCaul was right about Iran being responsible for the described casualties in Iraq and plotting an attack on our nation\u2019s capital.\nBy email, McCaul spokesman Walter Zaykowski answered our request for elaboration by saying the casualty count originated with the Pentagon. He said McCaul\u2019s mention of Iran plotting an attack in Washington, D.C., reflected the May 2013 conviction of an Iranian-American resident of San Antonio for plotting to kill Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\nLet\u2019s check casualties, then flashback to the described plot.\nIran\u2019s declared connection to casualties\nIn his email, Zaykowski pointed out September 2015 news stories about more than 1,000 Iran-linked American casualties in Iraq published by Defense One, which focuses on \"topics and trends that will define the future of U.S. defense and national security.\"\nA Sept. 8, 2015, Defense One story said that according to recently declassified Pentagon documents, 196 American soldiers were killed in Iraq from November 2005 to December 2011 by 1,526 \"explosively formed penetrators,\" which are particularly deadly roadside bombs, with another 861 American soldiers getting injured.\n\nSOURCE: News story, \"How Many US Troops Were Killed By Iranian IEDs in Iraq?\" Defense One, Sept. 8, 2015 (illustration reprinted with permission).\nThe Iran connection? The story said the Pentagon attributes the presence of the EFPs in Iraq \"to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani. Various EFP \u2018factories\u2019 were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.\"\nThis sentence in the story included a web link to a \u00a0Feb. 27, 2007, New York Times news story, datelined Baghdad, describing bomb parts uncovered by U.S. forces in Iraq as possible evidence of factories making EFPs, \"which explode and hurl out a high-speed blob of copper designed to cut through tough American armor.\"\nAccording to that story, though, an Iran connection wasn\u2019t firmed up. The story said that while the find gave \"experts much more information on the makings of the E.F.P.\u2019s, which the American military has repeatedly argued must originate in Iran, the cache also included items that appeared to cloud the issue. Among the confusing elements were cardboard boxes of the gray plastic PVC tubes used to make the canisters. The boxes appeared to contain shipments of tubes directly from factories in the Middle East, none of them in Iran. One box said in English that the tubes inside had been made in the United Arab Emirates and another said, in Arabic, \u2018plastic made in Haditha,\u2019 a restive Sunni town on the Euphrates River in Iran.\nThe Defense One story went on to say \"the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute.\" That sentence noted an April 10, 2007, story in the Columbia Journalism Review cautioning against news reporters accepting characterizations of the EFPs as coming from Iran.\nThe Defense One story noted that Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9, 2015, Senate confirmation hearing: \"We weren\u2019t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn\u2019t necessarily have the forensics to support that.\" At the hearing, the story said, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran \"has been recently quoted as about 500.\"\nThrough the Nexis database, we spotted the question that led to Dunford\u2019s assessment.\nAt the hearing, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., asked Dunford:\n\"When you served in Iraq and Afghanistan, do you know how many soldiers, Marines underneath your command were killed by Iranian activities?\"\nDUNFORD: \"Senator, I know the total number of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that were killed by Iranian activities, and the number has been recently quoted as about 500. We weren't always able to attribute the casualties that we had to -- to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that.\"\nDefense One\u2019s story said the U.S. Central Command, CENTCOM, \"later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons.\" The story quoted Maj. Genieve Davis, a CENTCOM spokeswoman saying in an email that it\u2019s \"important to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF.\" David further said data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, Defense One reported.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo our inquiry, CENTCOM spokesman Max Blumenfeld emailed a similar statement saying 196 \"U.S. service member deaths resulted from Iranian Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs) which are very deadly improvised explosive devices.\" He said too that those deaths were a subset of \"all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during\" Operation Iraqi Freedom, the U.S.-led operations in Iraq from March 2003 through August 2010. \"For example,\" Blumenfeld wrote, \"there were rocket attacks and IRAM (improvised rocket-assisted munitions) among other tactics that also contributed to American soldier deaths.\"\nAlong similar lines, a Sept. 11, 2015, Defense One news story said many of the additional deaths likely were caused by improvised rocket assisted munitions, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as \"a rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister \u2014 such as a propane gas tank \u2014 filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets.\" First seen in Iraq in 2007, the story said, the IRAM \u2014 \"essentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb \u2014 a flying IED\" is \"the signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group,\" the story described the undated document saying.\nWe asked Blumenfeld to specify casualties believed to have been caused by Iranian-connected explosives. He declined, emailing: \"We cannot provide more information than what has been already furnished.\"\nThe D.C. plot\nSo, when did Iran plot a terrorist attack in the U.S. capital?\nOn May 30, 2013, as reported by the Times that day, a U.S. district judge, John F. Keenan, \u00a0sentenced an Iranian-American living in Texas and accused of plotting to hire assassins to murder Saudi Arabia\u2019s U.S. ambassador to 25 years in prison.\nThe story said Mansour J. Arbabsiar, a naturalized American citizen living in Texas,had been arrested in September 2011 at New York\u2019s Kennedy International Airport, ultimately pleading guilty to his role in a scheme in which he evidently thought he was lining up a Mexican drug cartel to plant a bomb in a Washington restaurant where, the described plot went, the ambassador would be dining. The story said Arbabsiar lived in Corpus Christi though an Oct. 28, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story, citing court filings quoting Arbabsiar\u2019s comments to a psychiatrist, said that in 2010, Arbabsiar had moved from Corpus Christi to Round Rock, near Austiin.\nWhen Arbabsiar was arrested, the Times story said, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said the plot had been \"directed and approved by elements of the Iranian government and, specifically, senior members of the Quds force,\" which is part of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.\nHolder said in an Oct. 11, 2011, statement the \"deadly plot\" was \"directed by factions of the Iranian government.\" Arbabsiar, he said, was being \"accused of working with members of an arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to devise an international murder-for-hire scheme targeting the\" ambassador. Holder said the complaint would say Arbabsiar allegedly orchestrated the plot with Gholam Shakuri, an Iranian-based member of the Qods Force. According to the complaint, Arbabsiar--with Shakuri\u2019s approval--had facilitated the wiring of approximately $100,000 into a bank account in the United States as a down payment for the attempted assassination. Holder said the complaint also said that in the days since the defendant\u2019s arrest, he had confessed to his participation in the alleged plot.\nThe Times story on Arbabsiar\u2019s sentencing said the assassination plan, according to unnamed government officials, involved Arbabsiar paying a member of the Los Zetas drug cartel $1.5 million to plant a bomb at a Washington restaurant while the Saudi ambassador, Adel al-Jubeir, dined. But Arbabsiar, drawn into the plot by a cousin in Iran who was a high-ranking member of the Quds Force, turned to a man in Mexico he believed was an associate of a drug cartel to hire a team of assassins. And that man turned out to be a confidential informer for the Drug Enforcement Administration, the story said.\nKeenan noted before imposing the sentence that when Arbabsiar was told that there would probably be 100 to 150 people in the restaurant when it was bombed, he replied, \"No problem,\" or \"No big deal,\" according to a recording of the conversation made secretly by the drug agency\u2019s informer.\nThe story said Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, whose office had sought the maximum 25-year sentence, called Mr. Arbabsiar \"an enemy among us \u2014 the key conduit for, and facilitator of, a nefarious international plot concocted by members of the Iranian military to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States and as many innocent bystanders as necessary to get the job done.\"\nArbabsiar, addressing the judge before he was sentenced, said: \"Whatever I did wrong, I take responsibility for it. I can\u2019t change what I did. I have a good heart. I never hurt anyone.\" He added, \"My mind sometimes is not in a good place.\"\nArbabsiar\u2019s lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, a federal public defender, had sought a 10-year term, arguing that her client\u2019s crime had been the result of a longstanding, untreated bipolar disorder, the story said.\nIran denies involvement\nThe Times story also said the Iranian government had denied it had anything to do with the plot.\nAn Oct. 12, 2011, CNN news account said an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, had told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency: \"Iran strongly denies the untrue and baseless allegations over a plan to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington.\"\nThe CNN story also quoted members of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration saying the plot had involved Iran. The story said Vice President Joe Biden had told NBC News: \"Every nation in the world, when they learn the facts of this, will be outraged that (Iran) would violate such an international norm, in addition to obviously being a crime to assassinate anybody, and in the process probably have killed scores of Americans\" who may have been in the restaurant at the time of a detonation.\nAlso, CNN reported, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., then the chair of the Senate Armed Intelligence Committee, said after getting briefed that there was no doubt that Iran\u2019s Quds Force was involved in the reported plot, though she could not say if higher levels of Iran\u2019s government were too. \"I could surmise that the Quds Force would not have done this without the highest levels of approval from the Revolutionary Guard and, most likely, from some higher elements of the government,\" Feinstein said. But, she added, she could not specify who might have known. She also added that the alleged plot may have been just one in a series of such schemes. \"It's hard for me to believe that there is just one plot involving the United States,\" she said.\nOur ruling\nMcCaul said Iran\u2019s \"regime is responsible for more than 1,000 American casualties during the Iraq war\" and \"has plotted a terrorist attack here in our nation's capital.\"\nMcCaul has backing for this statement, although it needs clarification. To our query, a military spokesman stopped short of confirming the number of injuries the Pentagon associates with allegedly Iranian-connected explosives and Iran (perhaps unbelievably) has denied any connection to the Texas-tied plot to hire a hit man to plant a bomb in Washington, D.C.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05895"}
