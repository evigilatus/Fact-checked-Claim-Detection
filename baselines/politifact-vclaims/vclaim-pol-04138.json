The Feingold Foundation -- while plotting another run for U.S. Senate.\n\"After months of lawsuits related to Hillary\u2019s emails, the State Department is now withholding Senator Feingold\u2019s emails from public release until after the November election. Help end the Hillary-Feingold corruption by demanding Senator Feingold\u2019s emails be released immediately.\"\nSo, the claim is that \"just like Clinton,\" Feingold had a \"run-in with corruption and scandal by using a personal slush fund\" -- the \"Feingold Foundation\" -- while \"plotting\" to run for the Senate seat he lost to Johnson in 2010.\nThen there\u2019s the reference to State Department emails.\nLet\u2019s look at this in two parts.\n\u2018Personal slush fund\u2019\nThe \"personal slush fund\" allegation, refers to Progressives United -- a political action committee Feingold founded after he lost his try for a fourth term in the Senate.\nIn June 2015, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel watchdog columnist Daniel Bice revealed that the PAC had given a mere 5 percent of its income to federal candidates and political parties. Feingold and nine of his former campaign and U.S. Senate staffers drew salaries or consulting fees from the PAC. For instance, Feingold's longtime chief of staff\u00a0was paid $317,823 by the PAC and a related nonprofit from February 2011 until July 2013, when she left to take a job joining Feingold at the U.S. State Department. And\u00a0Feingold received $77,000 from the two groups.\nMoreover, $42,609 was spent\u00a0to buy\u00a0hundreds of copies of a book he authored (though Feingold did not receive royalties for those books).\nThe Wisconsin GOP acknowledged to us that it is referring to the PAC as the \"Feingold Foundation\" and that there isn\u2019t such a foundation.\nMeanwhile, the Clinton Foundation, an international health and development charity, has been controversial for very different reasons.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsinite Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, claimed that 80 percent of the foundation\u2019s money goes to overhead, PolitiFact National\u2019s rating was False. But the figure was only 10 to 20 percent.\nThe Clinton Foundation has been criticized more for potential conflicts of interest, not its spending. It has accepted millions in foreign donations, including from countries with business in front of the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.\nDonors were able to get access to Clinton. For example, Clinton had been reluctant to grant a meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain after he made requests through official channels. But a short-notice meeting was granted to the prince, whose government gave more than $50,000 to the Clintons\u2019 charity, after a longtime Clinton aide who helped create the foundation interceded.\n\u2018Plotting another run\u2019\nAs for the ad\u2019s allegation that Feingold was operating a personal slush fund while \"plotting\" his 2016 run for the Senate, the state GOP told us that Feingold is \"just like Hillary Clinton\" in that there are questions surrounding his time at the State Department.\nBut once again, the circumstances involving Feingold and Clinton are quite different.\nThe party alleges that Feingold violated federal law by engaging in political activities as a federal employee -- that is, planning his Senate run while he worked as a special envoy for the African Great Lakes Region and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nA conservative website says the State Department has agreed to its requests to provide emails Feingold exchanged with top Senate Democrats and two of his former aides, although it\u2019s not known whether the release will come before the Nov. 8, 2016 election.\nFeingold has denied any wrongdoing.\nIn contrast, Clinton has faced much more than partisan allegations over her State Department emails.\nIt has been well established that Clinton exclusively used a private email address while serving as secretary of state. Because she didn\u2019t use the government system, the department didn\u2019t have her emails on hand when the House Select Committee on Benghazi asked to see them.\nSo in 2014, Clinton\u2019s lawyers combed through the private server and turned over about 30,000 work-related emails to the State Department and deleted the rest, which Clinton said were about personal matters.\nClinton had repeatedly said she did not have any classified emails on her server, but the results of the FBI investigation show that claim incorrect. There was not enough evidence to charge her with a crime, but her email setup exposed her to hacking.\nOur rating\nThe Wisconsin GOP says that \"just like\" Clinton, Feingold had a \"run-in with corruption and scandal by using a personal slush fund -- a.k.a. the Feingold Foundation -- while plotting another run for U.S. Senate.\"\nThere is no Feingold Foundation. The \"personal slush fund\" reference is to a political action committee established by Feingold that spent significant sums that benefited Feingold -- for salaries and consulting fees to Feingold and his former aides, and to buy copies of a book he wrote.\nBut the Clinton Foundation got into controversy not over its spending, but for potential conflicts of interest, given that it accepted donations from foreign countries that had business before Clinton as secretary of state.\nAnd while Clinton clearly broke State Department rules by setting up a private email system, nothing has been established beyond allegations that Feingold did anything improper with emails during his employment by the State Department.\nFor a statement that has only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04138"}
