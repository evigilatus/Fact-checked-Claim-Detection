Bush-era tax cuts, which will expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn\u2019t act, they had to know that it would be the perfect fodder for Republican attacks.\n\nSo maybe Rep. Kurt Schrader, who represents Oregon\u2019s 5th District, wasn\u2019t surprised when he saw this recent e-mail jab from Republican challenger Scott Bruun: \"Schrader cast the deciding vote that failed to extend tax cuts for Oregon\u2019s middle-class families and small businesses.\"\n\nThe attack goes on to quote some bits from a Sept. 29, 2010, article in The Hill.\n\nBit No. 1: \"House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters Wednesday that the House would not vote on the expiring George W. Bush-era tax cuts before lawmakers break for the November midterm elections.\"\n\nBit No. 2: \"Members who voted to adjourn were \u2018putting their election above the needs of your constituents,\u2019 (House Minority Leader John) Boehner said in his speech. \u2018Vote no on this adjournment resolution. Give Congress the chance to vote on extending tax rates.\u2019\"\n\nPolitiFact Oregon decided to do a quick reality check on this claim, lest those \"middle-class families and small businesses\" Bruun references be misled by some political doublespeak.\n\nLet\u2019s start first with the vote\u2019s dynamics: On Sept. 29, 2010, the House voted to adjourn. The vote was a close one. So close, in fact, that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi actually had to cast a vote -- something she doesn\u2019t do all that often. (The Washington Post\u2019s Votes Database says she has cast 94 votes this Congress; other members have voted more than 1,500 times.) \u00a0In the end, 210 representatives voted to adjourn while 209 voted against adjourning.\n\nSchrader was in the majority. Did he cast the deciding vote?\n\nWe\u2019d say the deciding vote belongs to Pelosi, if only because she doesn\u2019t typically vote on procedural things like this. But we\u2019ll be ridiculously lenient here and say that because the difference between the two sides was just one vote, any of the members voting to adjourn could be said to have cast the deciding vote.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get into the politics of the thing. Normally, a procedural vote wouldn\u2019t be an issue, but it is this time around because Democrats and Republicans had been going back and forth for a couple of weeks -- at least -- about just what parts of the Bush-era tax cuts should be allowed to expire. As The New York Times put it, generally everybody agrees that the cuts will be extended \"for the roughly 98 percent of households in which couples have less than $250,000 in annual income or individuals earn less than $200,000.\"\n\nMost Republicans and some Democrats, however, also want to extend the tax cuts for the top 2 percent.\n\nUltimately, Democratic leadership decided to table the matter until after the November elections and adjourn without deciding one way or another. Bruun takes this to mean that the House (read: Democrats) failed to extend tax cuts for \"Oregon\u2019s middle-class families and small businesses.\"\n\nBut that\u2019s not right. Congress is expected to pick the issue up once it reconvenes. There\u2019s been no decision for or against the extension, but, generally, most everybody seems to agree that some piece of the tax cuts will be extended.\n\nBruun is clearly trying to equate a vote for adjournment with a vote not to extend tax cuts, and that\u2019s just not the case.
