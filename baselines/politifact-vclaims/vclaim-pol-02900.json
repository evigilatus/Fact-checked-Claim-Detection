President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have both come out for Moore\u2019s chief opponent, Luther Strange.\nIn the latest salvo, the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC run by McConnell\u2019s former chief of staff, aired an ad that essentially tells viewers that Moore opposes Trump\u2019s wall along the Mexican border.\u00a0Here\u2019s the full text:\nMale voice: \"Who will fight with President Trump to change Washington? Not career politician Roy Moore. He\u2019s on the wrong side of Trump\u2019s border wall.\"\nVideo clip of Moore: \"I\u2019ll tell you a little secret. Does it take a wall?\"\nVideo clip of Moore: \"I don\u2019t think it would take a wall.\"\nRepeats the same clip of Moore: \"I don\u2019t think it would take a wall.\"\nMale voice: \"Roy Moore. Dead wrong on President Trump\u2019s wall to protect our borders.\"\nAudio clip of Moore: \"You can\u2019t build a wall around our country.\"\nThis is a case where the individual elements of the ad hold up, but the package deal paints an incomplete picture.\nThe ad uses video selectively. A good example comes from the rest of Moore\u2019s words at the forum where he said, \"I don\u2019t think it would take a wall.\"\nHere\u2019s a more complete excerpt of his remarks:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think we need something to stop illegal aliens flowing across our borders, because they are a danger to our republic, a danger to our homes, our families, and we can do something,\" Moore said at the Wetumpka T.E.A. Party candidate forum on July 31. \"I support using federal troops (and the) National Guard to stop this.\"\nA moment later, he continued, \"If it takes a wall, we should build it. I don't think it would take a wall. I think we should use the United States military.\"\nIn an Aug. 15 radio interview, Moore expressed impatience with the pace of fortifying the border.\n\"Here we are, waiting since November and nothing\u2019s been done in stopping illegal aliens,\" Moore said. \"It can be stopped within days by the U.S. military ... We need to stop illegal aliens coming in and then, if a wall is necessary and we\u2019ve got the money, we can build it.\"\nMoore\u2019s campaign website says, \"We must allow willing states (like Arizona) to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens, and use our own military to protect our border. If a wall is our only option, then we should build it immediately.\"\nChris Pack, a spokesman for the Senate Leadership Fund, said Moore\u2019s stance is at variance with Trump\u2019s position.\n\"Roy Moore has repeatedly said he doesn\u2019t think we need a wall and that it should be \u2018the last recourse,\u2019 or as \u2018the last thing we need to do,\u2019 \"Pack said. \"President Trump, by contrast, has called the wall \u2018absolutely necessary,\u2019 \u2018so vital,\u2019 and \u2018very, very important.\u2019 \"\nPack went on to say, \"Our ad is simply pointing out that Roy Moore is not with Trump in pushing for the wall.\"\nAdvocates of the wall argue that, unlike a military deployment, it would be a barrier that would outlast any change in leadership or policy in Washington.\nOur ruling\nThe Senate Leadership Fund ad describes Moore as being on the \"wrong side of Trump\u2019s border wall.\" Based on that and the clips in the ad, most viewers might reasonably think that means Moore is against a wall. In fact, Moore doesn\u2019t want to wait and would rather deploy the American military immediately to secure the border with Mexico. If after that a wall is needed, he said the country should build it.\nWhat we have is more of a difference on tactics, not overall strategy or outcomes. The ad makes it sound like the gap is more than that.\nThe ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts the would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-09-18 13:39:27 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwiJbAWhwPe_TUN2MDZHcEMzYm8 Says Roy Moore is \"on the wrong side of Trump\u2019s border wall.\"     Senate Leadership Fund Super PAC aligned with Sen.
