According to the CDC\u2019s COVID-19 FAQ page, \"fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans.\" The CDC said that this \"hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem.\"\u00a0\nThe CDC\u2019s advice: \"Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads.\" The CDC also includes a breakdown of all the ways COVID-19 can be spread on their website.\nThis screenshot of \"breaking news\" is fake. It was originally from a satirical news site and has an obvious news generator watermark in the top right corner. It then got spun around the internet in a way that would fool people.
