Mitt Romney has a television ad in New Hampshire that attacks Sen. John McCain for his positions on taxes and illegal immigrants.\n\nSpecifically, he charges that McCain \"opposes repeal of the death tax,\" officially called the estate tax, a tax on the property passed forward and received at death.\n\n\nJust looking at the votes, Romney is right. The issue has come before the U.S. Senate at least three times, and each time McCain voted against permanently repealing the estate tax.\n\n\nBut in a closer look at McCain's record, we find he supports a plan that would render the tax moot for most people.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
