In one plane, the democracy of Tony Evers zero in school spending under Goff. (Scott Walker) \"Do you trust Scott Walker in education?\" The request for a television announcement was made on 25 September 2018. \"He is the politician who has cut $800 million from our schools.\" This is very similar to the claim of Evers that we verified in April -- that Walker \"takes over a billion dollars from public schools.\" We've often misjudged that. Does the reduced number change things? The Evers team said that the figure in the announcement referred to cuts in Walker's first budget in 2011-2013 of less than US$ 800 million. Although much of this funding has since been recovered, the spokesman for Evers Sam Lao has said that this does not make the claim less valid - nor does it diminish the impact of the reduction. \"Every year a student teaches charges,\" said Lou in the e-mail. Scott Walker's $800 million cuts to Wisconsin public schools were devastating and still felt today. The State's non-partisan legislative financial office has provided figures to verify the April facts on this subject, and we will rely on these figures again. The graph below has much to absorb, but we will focus on two numbers that we have identified with star marks. This looks at public-purpose income for schools, which includes aid per pupil, equality aid and other conclusive assistance. It begins with the 2010-2011 budget, the last within the Government. Jim Doyle. This is the baseline for comparison. Change to previous year changed to 2010-11 cumulative change to 2010-2011: $5.27 billion-2011-12 $4.85 billion - $426.5 million - $426.5 million - $426.5 million 2012 - $13.491 billion + $68.9 million - $357.6 million - $784.1 million* 2013-14 $5.03 billion + $119.8 million - $237.8 million - $1.021 billion \u2022 15 January, $201-15 billion + $160.5 million - $77.3 million - $1.1 billion 2015 - $16.2 billion + $3 million - $74.3 million - $1.17 billion 2016 - $17.4 billion + $197.3 million + $123 million - $1.05 billion - $18.558 billion + $176.9 million + $299.9 million - $750.6 million - $2018-19 5.84 billion + $267.1 million + $567.1 million - $183.6 million* The state had a school subsidy of $5.27 billion last year under Doyle. The \"cuts\" claiming to be Evers come from comparing actual funding in the following two years to what it would have been if it remained at $5.27 billion a year. School assistance provided by the World Rehabilitation Programme decreased by $426.5 million in 2011-12 and increased by $68.9 million in 2012-13. This has resulted in a reduction of school aid by $784.1 million in the combined biennial budget. But that misses a lot of information. It is important to note that the funding reduction for 2011-2012 did not take place in isolation. Act No. 10, enacted in 2011, requires public officials to pay more for their pensions and reduce their ability to bargain collectively. This has allowed schools to provide money that could have gone to employee pensions and to impose more costs on employees for health insurance. When all provinces were accounted for in 2012, they spent $451.5 million less on employee benefits than in 2011, according to a study conducted by the non-partisan taxpayers &apos; coalition in Wisconsin, now the policy forum in Wisconsin. In 2013, benefits were $433.6 million lower than in 2011. Thus, over the two years when State funding was reduced by approximately $800 million, school districts provided approximately $900 million in benefits. These savings would be higher if we assumed that the costs would have continued to rise from 2011 levels (perhaps about 4.3 per cent per annum, according to the study). There is another important factor: the Evers Declaration does not say that it refers to a change in funding that occurred more than five years ago in a single budget. Therefore, viewers may assume that spending on schools today is $800 million less than when Walker started. Indeed, after initial cuts, Walker increased school assistance in GPR every year, reaching a high level of $5.84 billion this year. This is beyond the last year of Doyle, although this does not explain inflation. These increases mean that most of the $784 million reductions have been returned to the budget. The right column of the chart shows the difference between actual funding and what would have been cumulative had the school budget remained $5.27 billion annually since 2011. That gap was over $1 billion at some point but has now decreased to $183.6 million. Our classification in the ad, Evers claimed that Walker cut $800 million from schools. Approximately $784 million was reduced, in crude dollars in one biennial budget. However, this ignores the changes made through Walker Act No. 10, which provided provincial funds. The announcement does not make it clear that it refers only to reductions from 2011-13, so viewers will not know that subsequent increases in funding accounted for most of the reduction. Our definition is often wrong: \"A statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.\" That fits me right here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01328"}
