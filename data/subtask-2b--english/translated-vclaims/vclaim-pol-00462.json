These allegations were attributed to a \"border medical specialist.\" The article has picked up at least two other sites and has been shared in Twitter and Facebook, resulting in the accumulation of thousands of fans and shareholders. These articles were referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is because they are not established by the facts. A political article for the Grand League, which examines the site of major stories on July 1, consists mostly of quotations from an unknown health professional. The main picture is a picture of shares frequently used by the CDC in its tweeting. Polyte Fact asked Hawley for further evidence to support his article, but he did not provide anything other than the unknown source. He referred to an old article alleging that a six-year-old girl had \"raped 30 men\" on the United States-Mexico border as a basis for claims. And we misevaluated that story in December. In the United States, Customs and Border Protection told Poletti Fact that it had no record of an unknown outbreak of disease that led to the quarantine of immigrants in El Paso. The Agency has previously looked into this allegation and found no evidence to support it. On 20 January 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated in its article: \"The test is highly exaggerated that the screening of individuals was positive for Coffid.\" The big league politics story shows a recent, legitimate news story. Last month, CNN reported that the United States immigration and customs enforcement authorities had quarantined 5,200 adult migrants after being exposed to mumps or smallpox. However, false allegations of immigrants with diseases on the United States border are common. In an examination of the facts in April, we dismantled a picture that was repeatedly taken out of context to raise concerns about immigrants. \"The Congolese migrants who are lagging behind in San Antonio,\" claimed the site of the daily Post in a headline last month - an allegation confirmed by a political story of the Grand League. We've assessed this as a mistake. The Association's grand policy on the page indicates that its \"only objective is to tell the truth\" and that its employees \"are not members of the Republican, Democratic, Liberal or Green Party, or even of the Paul Moss Party.\" There are more than 12,000 followers on his Facebook page and more than 90,000 followers on Twitter. However, the site has published false and misleading political content in the past. Our big league ruling policy claimed that immigrants were being quarantined at a private hospital in El Paso with an unknown disease. This article is based on quotes from an unknown source. Both U.S. Customs, Border Protection and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have told Poletti Fuckett that they do not have a quarantine record of an unknown disease affecting immigrants on the southern border of the United States. Without evidence, we assess the allegation is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00462"}
