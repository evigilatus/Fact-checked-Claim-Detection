Brice, representing the Fourth Congressional Chamber in North Carolina, which comprises Orange County and parts of Wick and Durham Provinces, is not the first to make this point. However, we wondered whether the number of arrests of border patrols - usually used by statisticians to measure illegal border crossings - had changed considerably since the last time we checked them, so we decided to give the Bryce statement a fresh look. Caitlin Fogg, Director of Communications of Price, referred to the January 2019 FAQ newspaper of the Congressional Research Service, an article from the United States of America today, and related fact checks of the New York Times and NPR as evidence to support the claim. \"Since its peak in 2000, there has been a clear downward trend in fears on the southern border,\" she said. \"while the figure fluctuates from year to year, including a slight rise in 2018, it is still at historically low levels.\" According to the report of the Intelligence and Security Service and data from the United States Border Patrol, arrests on the south-west border began to increase steadily in 1960 and peaked in 2000 at about 1.64 million people. It drowned to its lowest level in 2017 of 303,916 years. There were 263,991 arrests in 1971 and only 21,022 in 1960. However, as Vogt observed, those arrests were somewhat higher in 2018 to 396,579. Michel Metelstadt, Director of Communications at the Institute of Migration Policy, a research centre on migration in Washington, D.C., noted that concerns were in fact at their lowest levels during the 1960s, although they were \"in significant decline\" since 2006 - the last time there was more than a million a year. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" \u2022 1 February 2021, she said that the fall in 2017 had occurred largely because the Trump elections and his administration's harsh immigration stance had caused a \"temporary slowdown of fears\" for several months before \"these figures largely reverted to their normal seasonal patterns.\" However, if the scope of the time period is determined, the claim is more accurate. When I checked with Polly Fucking California, the truth was for Goof. In a State address delivered earlier this month by Gavin Newsome, Yves Meade, Director of the Institute of Border Crossing at the University of San Diego, stated that Newsome's claim that \"we are currently witnessing the lowest number of border crossings since 1971\" was \"essentially correct\" given the long-term trend. \"I've been up and down,\" said Meade. \"There was some variation. But the long downward trend continues.\" The Bryce statement was less accurate than the Newsome statement, and it was less accurate than a similar statement obtained by the former California government. Jerry Brown was right last year. While both governors set specific time frames as benchmarks for comparison, the price said that it \"maintains at historically low levels,\" which the average reader could assume to mean at or near the lowest levels ever. Our governor Bryce said, \"The border crossing is still at historically low levels.\" The number of arrests of border patrols in 2017 was the lowest in 45 years, and in 2018 the number was slightly higher but still low, especially compared with the peak in 2000. Illegal crossings have been declining since 2006, with some fluctuations from year to year. However, the total number of concerns was much lower in the 1960s, so a more accurate statement in 2017 could have said that the crossings were lower than they had been since 1971. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.
