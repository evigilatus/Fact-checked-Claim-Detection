He was talking about war, trust and politics. And he singled out the weapons industry.\n\"People, managers, businessmen who call themselves Christian and they manufacture weapons, that leads to a bit of distrust, doesn\u2019t it?\" he said, as reported by Reuters.\nNotice that he didn\u2019t mention gun owners. That was the invention of the web article.\nThe pope pulls no punches when he talks about war and arms makers.\nIn his 2015 address to Congress, he urged lawmakers to work to \"end the many armed conflicts throughout our world.\"\nAnd he added, \"Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money: money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood.\"\nThe New York Evening News article had the pope talking about gun owners when he wasn\u2019t, and gun makers specifically when he was talking about the arms trade in general. Plus, it made it sound as though he was speaking recently and in the context of the current debate over guns after the shootings in Parkland, Fla., when in reality, his speech was three years old.\nIt\u2019s just another example of fake news writers shooting from the hip.
