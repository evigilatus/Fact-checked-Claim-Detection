Tim Kaine - the Democratic incumbent - as an unflagging enemy of the president.\n\"He opposes everything President Trump does\" Stewart said during a July 21 debate with Kaine in Hot Springs, Va. \u00a0\"He\u2019s automatically going to vote against anything the president does.\"\nThree other times during the debate, Stewart repeated that Kaine never supports the president. We decided to test the claim. His campaign did not respond to our request for backup information.\nSo we turned to FiveThirtyEight, a much-quoted website that collects and analyzes statistics on politics, sports and other topics. The site keeps records of each congress member\u2019s presidential support - the percentage of times a congress member votes in support of the president when the White House has taken a clear position on legislation.\nThe website identifies 76 bills and resolutions on which Trump stated a position since Jan. 12, 2017 - eight days before his inauguration. Kaine cast 26 votes backing Trump and 50 votes against him. That comes to 34.2 percent support.\nBut there are some caveats to that figure. Let\u2019s take a deeper look.\nNominations\nKaine, during the debate, didn\u2019t put up a fight when Stewart said he \"opposes everything\" Trump does. His response: \"I have voted for many of President\u2019s nominees, \u00a0and I work with them everyday.\"\nFor sure, Kaine\u2019s agreement percentage has been buoyed by his votes for Trump nominees to certain cabinet and administrative posts. Fifteen of Kaine\u2019s 26 votes backing Trump have been to confirm nominations.\nBut it also should be noted that Kaine has voted against 15 Trump nominees, including U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. Kaine said Gorsuch was an \"activist\" for restricting women\u2019s health rights.\nKaine voted against confirming nine of the 15 current members of Trump\u2019s cabinet:\n\u2022Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos;\n\u2022Attorney General Jeff Sessions;\n\u2022Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar;\n\u2022Secretary of Treasury Tom Mnuchin;\n\u2022Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson;\n\u2022Secretary of Energy Rick Perry;\n\u2022Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen;\n\u2022Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta; and\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nPolicy\nIf we scratch confirmations from the list, we\u2019re left with 46 policy votes on which Trump took a stand. Kaine voted with the president on 11 occasions, or 24 percent of the time. But that doesn\u2019t mean Kaine agreed with Trump on 11 issues. Boiled down, they were only in sync on five matters:\n\u2022Avoiding or ending government shutdowns. Kaine backed the president six times on contested votes to keep the government funded;\n\u2022Disaster relief. \u00a0Kaine and Trump agreed on two measures that gave aid to victims of Hurricane Harvey, centered in Houston, and Hurricane Harvey, centered in Puerto Rico;\n\u2022Expanding veterans access to private-sector health care at government expense;\n\u2022Ending some regulations on small banks that were passed during the Great Recession; and\n\u2022Continuance of a spying program that allows intelligence analysts to search, without warrant, communications between Americans and people identified as foreign threats living overseas.\nConversely, Kaine has voted against the president\u2019s policies 35 times, or 76 percent of the time. He has opposed, often repeatedly, most of Trump\u2019s signature initiatives. For example, Kaine cast votes against Trump\u2019s:\n\u2022$1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years, saying it would mainly benefits businesses and wealthy;.\n\u2022Increased tariffs;\n\u2022Tough stand on immigration; and\n\u2022Efforts to end or dismantle Obamacare.\nKaine\u2019s response\nIan Sams, communications director for Kaine\u2019s campaign, says the presidential support rating presents an incomplete picture of Kaine\u2019s accordance with Trump. He acknowledged in an email that Kaine \"objects to a lot\" of Trump\u2019s initiatives, but added that the senator has been pleased by the president\u2019s signature on a number of less-publicized bills and resolutions that help Virginia. They include:\n\u2022Working towards a 355-ship Navy;\n\u2022Federal recognition of Virginia\u2019s native tribes; and\n\u2022Several measures that improve veteran service and benefits.\nOur ruling\nStewart says Kaine \"opposes everything President Trump does.\"\nIt\u2019s a greatly hyped statement. Kaine doesn\u2019t oppose every Trump action. When Trump has stated a position on legislation, records show Kaine has voted in support of him 34.2 percent of the time. Most of these votes have been on nominations. Not included in the calculation are a number of little-known bills and resolutions helping Virginia that Kaine backed and Trump quietly signed.\nBut Stewart\u2019s larger context - that Kaine fundamentally disagrees with Trump - is correct. Kaine has voted against confirming most of Trump\u2019s major nominees, including Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch and 9 of the 15 people now in the president\u2019s cabinet.\nKaine has also voted against Trump\u2019s defining initiatives on tax reform, immigration, health care and tariffs. He\u2019s clearly opposed Trump most of the time on major issues. So we rate Stewart\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01563"}
