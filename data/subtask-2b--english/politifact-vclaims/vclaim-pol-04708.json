That\u2019s a serious charge, and a quick look at the public record shows this isn\u2019t true.\nJohnson\u2019s comment came before Obama announced he would attend a July 12 memorial for the fallen police officers.\nWhat Obama has said\nWe\u2019ll start with what he said after the murders of the Dallas officers July 7.\nSpeaking from Warsaw, Poland, Obama condemned violence against police and praised police officers in seven hours after the Dallas attack.\n\"As I told Mayor (Mike) Rawlings, I believe that I speak for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events, and that we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas,\" Obama said.\nObama also spoke the day before the Dallas attacks in response to the shootings of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana by police officers. Most of the statement focused on the need for reform in policing, but Obama also addressed the idea that police were under attack in the debate about excessive force.\n\"And so, to all of law enforcement, I want to be very clear: We know you have a tough job. We mourn those in uniform who are protecting us who lose their lives,\" Obama said.\nThat\u2019s just what Obama has said on this topic in the past week.\nDuring the Baltimore riots sparked by the death of Freddie Gray in 2015, Obama spoke against the violence and expressed his sympathy for police officers in Baltimore.\n\"My heart goes out to the police officers who were injured in the past few days. They showed extraordinary restraint ... it shows how tough a job policing can be,\" Obama said.\nObama also issued a statement after two New York police officers were shot by a man who claimed to be acting in response to the death of Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police. He actually used the word \"condemn.\"\n\"I unconditionally condemn today's murder of two police officers in New York City,\" Obama said. \"Two brave men won't be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification. The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day.\"\nHere are several other examples:\nBefore a meeting of the International Association of Chiefs of Police in 2015, Obama said: \"I reject any narrative that seeks to divide police and communities that they serve. I reject a storyline that says when it comes to public safety there\u2019s an \u2018us\u2019 and a \u2018them\u2019 \u2013- a narrative that too often gets served up to us by news stations seeking ratings, or tweets seeking retweets, or political candidates seeking some attention.\"\nA May 8, 2015, White House proclamation on Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week read: \"As President, I am committed to making sure America's dedicated police officers receive the support and recognition they have earned, and to doing all I can to protect those who protect us.\"\nIn response to violence in the St. Louis-area after the shooting of Michael Brown, Obama said: \"There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more of Obama\u2019s comments about police in this 2014 fact-check.\nNAPO\u2019s complaints\nWe tried to reach out to Johnson and did not hear back. But on July 12, his organization posted a lengthy statement about a meeting it had with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden \"in direct response to NAPO\u2019s statement accusing the Administration of not fully supporting our nation\u2019s law enforcement officers,\" a statement published on NAPO\u2019s website said.\nThe NAPO account of the meeting has the president asking how he could have better responded to police shootings.\nJohnson said the administration had failed to address violence and threats against police that he linked to Black Lives Matter. In his account \u2014 much more measured than Johnson\u2019s critique on Fox \u2014 Johnson acknowledged that the administration had condemned violence against police officers, but he said it had only done so after officers had been killed.\n\"There has been no response, no condemnation when Black Lives Matter protests turn violent. There was no outrage when two St. Louis County police officers were shot by a Ferguson protester who was at a Black Lives Matter protest. There is no demand for accountability from the movement when members support violence towards police or even act on those calls for violence,\" NAPO\u2019s statement reads.\nThis speaks directly to Johnson\u2019s broader critique of Obama\u2019s response to violence against police, but it seems to get some details wrong. As noted above, Obama has spoken out against violent protests in Ferguson and Baltimore, though no officers died in either of those protests. After two officers were shot in Ferguson in March of 2015, Obama issued this response on Twitter: \"Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in MO. Path to justice is one all of us must travel together.\"\nIn response to a question after the Dallas attack about the tactics of Black Lives Matter protesters, Obama said he did not think it was fair to blame the entire movement for the statements of some of its members.\n\"Now, in a movement like Black Lives Matter, there\u2019s always going to be some folks who say things that are stupid, or imprudent, or overgeneralized, or harsh. \u00a0And I don't think that you can hold well-meaning activists who are doing the right thing and peacefully protesting responsible for everything that is uttered at a protest site,\" Obama said.\nJohnson also said that former Attorney General Eric Holder had undermined police officers in his response to the non-indictment of Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Brown in Ferguson. \u00a0Holder had said that he wanted lower standards of proof for civil rights crimes, like the one the Department of Justice had considered charging Wilson with.\nBut this is tangentially related to the question of how Obama responded to violence against police.\nLooking back in time\nJohnson mentioned presidents Richard Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson as models of presidents who had police officers\u2019 backs.\nNixon and Johnson both served at a time when violence against police was much more common than it is today. During the 1970s, an average of 127 police officers were shot and killed every year, higher than the average of 71 in the 1960s and much higher than 53 this decade.The overall crime rate was higher in the late 1960s and early 1970s than it is today, and the nation faced large-scale riots in many urban centers.\nIn this context, Nixon and Johnson both expressed support for police officers and laid out programs to support them. Nixon made support for the police a central part of his \"law and order\" message in his electoral campaigns. In 1970, Nixon issued a statement saying he was \"deeply concerned with the growing problem of assaults on police officers.\"\nJohnson, Nixon and Obama\u2019s shared support for police was typical of other presidents and politicians, according to Jeremy Mayer, a professor at George Mason University who has written on presidential politics in the last half of the 20th century.\n\"What differentiates American politicians, somewhat in the \u201860s and even more today, is the degree of sympathy which they express for the victims of police brutality,\" Mayer said. \"But even the politicians who are sympathetic to the victims of police brutality always or almost always simultaneously express support for the vast majority of police officers.\"\nObama has been more likely than either Nixon or Johnson, Mayer said, to combine his statements of support for the police with concerns about police brutality and discriminatory policing.\nOur ruling\nJohnson said Obama had failed to condemn violence against police.\nObama has repeatedly condemned violence against police.\nMost recently, he expressed his support for police the night before the Dallas attack happened, amid protests over two police shootings of black men, and again after the sniper attack on police officers.\nObama\u2019s consistent objections to violence against police is similar to rhetoric by Johnson, Nixon and the vast majority of American politicians and presidents.\nJohnson\u2019s statement is outrageously wrong.
