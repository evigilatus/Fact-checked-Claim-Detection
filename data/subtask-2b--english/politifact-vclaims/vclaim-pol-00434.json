(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nYou guessed it. There is no evidence to suggest that Washington ever said or wrote this.\u00a0\nWashington\u2019s Mount Vernon estate included the quotation in its list of \"spurious quotations\" and had this to say about it:\n\"The quote is frequently misattributed to Washington, particularly in regards to his farewell address of 1796. The origin of the misquote is, perhaps, a mention of a similar statement in a biography of Washington first published in 1835. However, the quote that appeared in the biography has never been proven to have come from Washington.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat biography, \"Paulding\u2019s Life of Washington\" by James Kirke Paulding, includes a variation of the quote on page 209: \"It is impossible to govern the universe without the aid of a Supreme Being.\" Even that unsubstantiated listing doesn\u2019t include the words \"a nation,\" \"God\" or \"the Bible.\"\nThe quote also does not appear in the \"Complete Works of George Washington\" collection or in databases of his archived speeches or writings.\u00a0\nDavid Sewell, manager of digital initiatives at University of Virginia Press for Founders Online, a database of documents from the U.S. Founding Fathers, told PolitiFact it\u2019s safe to say there is no evidence Washington said this quote.\u00a0\n\"George Washington almost never mentioned the Bible in his diary or correspondence with others,\" Sewell wrote in an email. \"A search in Founders Online returns only ten results, and many of those are in footnotes.\"\u00a0\nOur ruling\nPosts on social media attribute a questionable quote to Washington about the impossibility of governing \"a nation without God and the Bible.\"\nAfter searching several databases and archives of Washington\u2019s works, we find no evidence he ever said this. Additionally, the leading George Washington scholars say they don\u2019t believe he did, or even would, say it.\u00a0\nWe rate this quote False.\nCorrection, July 17, 2019: \"Paulding\u2019s Life of Washington\" by James Kirke Paulding\u00a0reads,\u00a0\"It is impossible to govern the universe without the aid of a Supreme Being.\" An earlier version of this post contained a typo in that passage; it has been updated.
