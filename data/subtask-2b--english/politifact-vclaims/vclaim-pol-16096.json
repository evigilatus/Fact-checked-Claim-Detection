Barack Obama intends to raise pretty much all your taxes, while Sen. John McCain will leave them alone. The problem is that most of the e-mail's detailed assertions are false.\n\nHere, we'll look at the e-mail's claims about Barack Obama and the estate tax, which it refers to as the inheritance tax. For an examination of the e-mail's other claims, read\n\nour full article here\n\n.\n\n\nThe e-mail claims that President George W. Bush \"repealed\" the estate tax, and it now stands at 0 percent. Though Bush reduced the tax, he did not repeal it. Rather, under his 2001 tax cut package, the estate tax reduces every year and then goes away for just a single year \u2014 2010 \u2014 before reverting back to higher rates.

Above those amounts, the tax rate tops out at 45 percent. Both Obama and McCain support renewing the current estate tax with a few changes. McCain proposes to increase the exemption to $5-million ($10-million for couples) and reduce the tax rate to 15 percent. Obama proposes to increase the exemption to $3.5-million ($7-million for couples) and leave the top rate at 45 percent.\n\n\nSo the e-mail is wrong when it says McCain wants a \"0 percent\" estate tax and that Obama wants to \"restore\" it. We rule this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16096"}
