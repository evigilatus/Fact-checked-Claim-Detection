But Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., suggests that dire image is exaggerated.\nDuring an interview on CNN on Oct. 2, 2013, Paul told anchor Erin Burnett that \"85 percent of government's running right now. Only 15 percent of government spending is shut down.\"\nIs he right? We took a closer look and found that there are different ways to measure government. Government spending is one way, but the picture changes when you look at the federal workforce.\nFirst, some background. A government shutdown happens when one particular kind of federal funding stops flowing -- money that\u2019s appropriated by Congress. Appropriations bills are supposed to be passed annually, though in recent years, acrimony between Congress and the president has made it happen more irregularly.\nHowever, other types of federal spending are unaffected by the shutdown because they aren\u2019t subject to annual appropriations. An important one is known as mandatory spending -- money paid out to anyone who meets a fixed definition, such as someone who qualifies for Social Security or Medicare. Much of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law is also unaffected by the shutdown since it is not dependent on regular appropriations, Also, interest payments on the debt are not affected by a shutdown.\nSo if you\u2019re trying to determine how much spending is \"on\" during a shutdown and how much is \"off,\" you have to compare the amounts that fit into these various categories.\nAccording to the fiscal year 2014 figures from the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress\u2019 nonpartisan number-crunching agency -- the federal budget includes $2.2 trillion for mandatory spending, plus $237 billion in interest payments. These two categories add up to $2.4 trillion, out of a total budget of $3.6 trillion -- or about 68 percent.\nThe percentage grows closer to Paul\u2019s estimate of 85 percent once you add in spending on military personnel. Such spending would ordinarily be subject to cutbacks, but it was exempted by enactment of the Pay Our Military Act, which Congress passed and the president signed shortly before the shutdown began.\nPaul\u2019s office, citing Senate Budget Committee calculations, said the Pay Our Military Act frees up $225 billion in payments to be paid. That brings the percentage up to 74 percent.\nAnd the percentage rises further once you count the costs of federal activities that are continuing during the shutdown because they safeguard the public\u2019s safety and property. The problem is that it\u2019s hard to nail down exactly how much money is being spent on such activities, since we\u2019re so early in the shutdown and because many of the decisions have been made on the fly.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to reach Paul\u2019s 85 percent threshold, the government would need to be spending $404 billion from its \"discretionary\" (or appropriated) budget beyond military personnel. That means the government would be spending 43 percent of the remaining discretionary spending on activities that continue through the shutdown.\nExperts we spoke to said that percentage is plausible. Even if you cut that $404 billion figure in half, Paul would still be pretty close -- the figure would be 79 percent rather than 85 percent. We\u2019ll only know the final number for certain after the shutdown is over.\nStill, spending isn\u2019t the only way to look at this issue. For instance, if you look at the number of federal employees furloughed, the percentage left unscathed by the shutdown is likely much lower than the 85 percent figure Paul cited for spending.\nEstimates published in the New York Times suggest that at least six agencies were expecting to keep 20 percent or less of their workforce laboring through the shutdown, with another three expecting to continue employing between 21 percent and 50 percent.\nUsing spending as the unit of measurement biases the perception of how far-reaching the shutdown is, because so much of the budget is spent on things like Social Security and Medicare -- programs that are dollar-heavy but personnel-light, said John M. Palguta, vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, an advocacy group for government service.\n\"Government spending does not equal government,\" said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. \"So while it hard to come up with an accurate figure as to how much government is still being done, the spending burn rate is not the best way.\"\nOur ruling\nPaul said that \"85 percent of government's running right now. Only 15 percent of government spending is shut down.\"\nGovernment shutdowns by nature are somewhat haphazard, so it\u2019s hard at this point to calculate these numbers with any precision. However, due to the big role of entitlement spending in the federal budget, Paul is likely in the ballpark when he measures \"government\" by the yardstick of spending.\nHowever, measuring government in other ways, such as the percentage of federal employees being furloughed in major departments, would make the impact appear bigger. And when he said that \"85 percent of government\" is operating right now, that\u2019s more of a stretch.\nPaul\u2019s comment is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08800"}
