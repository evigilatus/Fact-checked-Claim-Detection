On January 13, 2021, in a story written by General David Berger, commander of the United States Navy, he rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, and told her, \"We don't work for you.\" Samantha Butterman said on January 17, 2021 Obama: \"Two weeks ago, when the Republican House of Representatives presented a budget that could have huge consequences for the country, and when I gave a speech about my budget and how I felt we needed to invest in education and infrastructure and make sure that we had a strong safety net for older people even as we closed the deficit -- throughout that week the dominant news story about these huge choices that we would have to make as a nation. It was about my birth certificate. This was true in most of the news outlets that were represented here at this press conference. The readers suggested that we consider the President &apos; s claim that the stories of birth certificates dominate those of democratic and republican budget plans. This issue was also considered by other media organizations. The fact-checkers and auditors who examined it used statements from the Press Excellence Project, a non-partisan group producing weekly analysis by sampling news coverage on television, cable, newspapers, radio and the Internet. PEJ calculates its figures on the basis of a rigorous methodology and its ongoing study provides some of the most detailed statistics on available news coverage. For the week referred to by the President -- April 11-17 -- PEJ found that the biggest topic of news coverage was economics, with 39 per cent of news coverage. The coverage of birth certificates was just under 4 per cent, reported by the Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office. Therefore, based on PEJ figures, Obama is far away. But just to be sure, we took a second look using a more targeted approach. We have requested copies of cable and television coverage in the Nexis database and have looked at three topics of coverage: stories that include the terms \"Obama\" and \"birth certificate\" or \"birth\"; stories that include \"Paul Ryan,\" the GOP budget plan engineer, and \"Medicare\"; and stories that include \"Obama\" and \"budget speech.\" These are not perfect measurements -- the Nexis database, although large, is not quite comprehensive, and some simple or irrelevant signals may have infiltrated our data. In addition, we have just looked at television coverage, not radio, print or the Internet, as PEJ does. However, we believe that the results still illustrate trends with regard to media coverage: in the 11th week of April: stories referring to the issuance of the birth certificate: cable news 66, news broadcast 12, total 78. Paul Ryan and Medicare: Cable News 63, News 15, total 78. Obama &apos; s budget speech: 135 cable news, 24 news broadcast, total 159. So Obama is also wrong by going back to the Nyxians. The coverage of his speech was twice that of the birth certificate, while stories about the birth certificate and Ryan's plan revolved around the neck and neck -- barely the dominant party in issuing the birth certificate, as Obama pointed out at his press conference. However, we wondered whether the President was right if he simply said \"last week\" -- the week of April 18 -- instead of \"two weeks ago.\" It turns out that using those parameters, Obama would have been right. These are the figures for that week: stories of birth certificate issuance: cable news 80, news broadcast 12, total 92. Paul Ryan and Medicare: News 21, News 4, total 25. Obama &apos; s budget speech: Cable News 37, News 3, total 40. In other words, for the 18th week of April, the issuance of the birth certificate was almost four times more prominent than Ryan's plan and more than twice as much as Obama's budget speech. In fact, our statements show that the interest of television in the issue of birth certificates has increased steadily during March and April. The signals in the three cable news networks - CNN, Fox and MSNBC - increased from one week to 16 during the week of 14 March during the following week, and then 26, 43, 66 and finally 80 during the week of 18 April. For its part, the organization found birth certificate coverage that jumped across the media during the week of 18 April. In that week, the coverage of the 2012 campaign jumped largely -- especially on cable, accounting for 19 per cent of broadcast time. The organization found that this process covered Trump in particular and, as part of the Trump coverage, issues related to the birth certificate were a major subject. \"This is a classic case of selective perception,\" said S. Robert Leichter, Director of the Media and Public Affairs Centre at George Mason University. \"The issue of the birth certificate seemed irrelevant and disturbing to the President, so note when he saw it raised. The question of the budget seemed to him to be indispensable, and he therefore considered it to be a matter of order whenever he considered it to be covered. This is a disease that affects both politicians and journalists -- let alone humble political scientists.\" Obama said that during April 11, \"the dominant news story was not about these huge choices that we have to make as a nation. It was about my birth certificate.\" It would have been true if he had simply referred to the coverage in a week's time. But his accurate claim - and he was clear about the timing - is not accurate. According to the analysis of PEJ and our analysis, the large and fundamental issues of the economy and the democratic and republican budget plans were slightly more covered than the birth certificate story during the week to which Obama referred. We're assessing his statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13181"}
