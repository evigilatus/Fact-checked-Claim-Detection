Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!\"\nThe quote is fake.\nThe story goes on to describe a Change.org petition to stop such \"waste\" garnering 85,000 signatures, and a fictional bill to do the same getting the support of \"38 White House conservatives,\" all of whom are women.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe petition is also fake, although the story is popular on Facebook.
