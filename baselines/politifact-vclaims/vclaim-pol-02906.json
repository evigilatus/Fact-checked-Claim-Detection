However, some Americans do not have access to high quality broadband services.\n\n\nAt the Missouri State Fair, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt addressed an audience about the importance of broadband access for rural residents, saying that two-thirds of rural Missouri residents are lacking broadband access.\n\n\nNearly 2/3 of rural Missourians don\u2019t have access to broadband. That needs to change,\" Blunt posted on\u00a0Twitter Aug.8, 2017.\n\n\nThe tweet included a video clip from the address. Blunt went on to talk about why he believes broadband is necessary. He also went on to discuss how he is an advocate for broadband issues on the Senate floor.\n\n\nBlunt\u2019s remarks got us thinking: Are two-thirds of rural Missourians really lacking access to the service?\n\n\nA spokesperson for Sen. Blunt pointed us to a\u00a0Wall Street Journal piece, as well as some\u00a0past research by the PolitiFact team\u00a0as the sources backing the statement.\n\n\nWhat is broadband?\n\n\nBefore we delve deeper into the issue, let\u2019s establish what \"broadband\" means.\n\n\nThe FCC describes it in a 2016 report as the speed benchmark of\u00a025 Mbps\u00a0download speed and 3 Mbps upload speed for fixed (not mobile) services.\n\n\nThe FCC is required by a portion of the 1996 Telecommunications Act to report on whether Americans are able to access advanced telecommunications capabilities. They define this as,\u00a0\"\u2018high-quality\u2019 capability that allow users to \u2018originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video\u2019 services.\"\n\n\nBasically, high-speed internet.\n\n\nIn the same report, the FCC said 10 percent of Americans lack access to broadband \u2014 39 percent of rural Americans and 4 percent of Americans living in an urban area.\n\n\nCurrently, many rural Missourians use alternatives to broadband like DSL, or digital subscriber line, which uses the same two-wire copper telephone line used for landlines. Some people just use their phones for internet, but for Northeast and Northwest Missourians, it\u2019s tough to get service. Surprisingly, 8 percent of rural Missourians still use dial-up internet.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers\n\n\nWhile 39 percent of rural Americans live without access to broadband internet, that figure jumps to 61 in Missouri, according to the FCC.\n\n\nMissouri is lagging compared to surrounding states. Forty-nine percent of rural residents in Kansas are without broadband access, 56 percent in Illinois, 37 percent in Iowa and 48 percent in Arkansas.\n\n\nThe lack of access affects everything from telemedicine to searching for jobs. It even touches agriculture: Janie Dunning, Missouri Farm Bureau\u2019s consultant for broadband, said farmers utilize technology in order to do \"precision farming.\" By combining computers and farm equipment, production can increase, and business can be easier to manage.\n\n\nFurther, when looking at\u00a0a map provided by the FCC, we can see that in Missouri, even when rural areas have broadband access, most of those residents only have one provider option.\n\n\nIt gets worse.\n\n\n\"One caution on using broadband maps and data \u2014 you need to understand how \u2018access\u2019 is being counted,\" said University of Missouri Extension state specialist for community development Sharon Gulick. \"In many cases as long as one person or business in the zip code has access, that zip code is considered covered. Also, having it available and it being affordable are also two very different issues.\"\n\n\nIn most rankings, Missouri is around No. 40 to 47 when it comes to broadband access, Dunning said.\n\n\nMissouri has over 6 million people living it, 70 percent of whom are in urban areas and 30 percent in rural areas, Dunning said. So with almost a third of the population residing in rural areas, how are there so many without broadband?\n\n\nWhen looking at people per square mile, the state average is 87.1 people per square mile. In urban areas, that number skyrockets to 5,000 people per square mile; conversely, some rural areas have as few as one or two people per square mile.\n\n\n\"Even non-profit providers need a return on investment,\" Dunning said. \"Providers prioritize the urban areas since there\u2019s more people who will use their services. It\u2019s just more financially feasible.\"\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nBlunt said that nearly two-thirds of rural Missourians don\u2019t have access to broadband. FCC numbers back up his statement.\n\n\nExperts agree that Missouri has a broadband access issue, and all cite the same FCC report. The 2016 Broadband Progress Report from the FCC states that 61 percent of rural Missourians lack access to broadband. The report is the most recent and uses a benchmark of of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps for high-speed internet.\n\n\nWhile 61 percent isn\u2019t 2/3, it\u2019s nearly so, especially in the context of the statement.\n\n\nWe rate Blunt\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02906"}
