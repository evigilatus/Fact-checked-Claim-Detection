Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., has links to Siraj Wahhaj, a prominent but controversial New York Imam who has attracted the attention of authorities in the past.\nThe story\u2019s headline reads: \"Democrat Congresswoman linked to UNINDICTED Terrorist!\" It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nSo, let\u2019s just get this part out of the way: We checked this claim and found that while Tlaib and Wahhaj were both featured speakers at a November event in California, that appears to be the extent of any so-called \"link.\"\nIs that a \"link?\" In its weakest form, perhaps.\nRegarding Wahhaj: His name was included on a list of people with a possible connection to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, though he was never charged.\nWhile the headline acknowledges Wahhaj has never been indicted, it still makes him out\u00a0 to be a terrorist. The headline also inflates any Tlaib association.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look.\nMore about Siraj Wahhaj\nSiraj Wahhaj, 68, born Jeffrey Kearse, is an African-American imam of the Masjid At-Taqwa mosque in Brooklyn, NY, and the leader of the Muslim Alliance in North America.\nWahhaj does have a checkered past. As we mentioned earlier, his name was included on a list of people that prosecutors said \"may be alleged as co-conspirators\" in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. He was never charged and denies any involvement with the bombing.\nWahhaj also testified as a character witness for Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, the notorious \"blind sheikh\" who was convicted in 1995 of plotting terror attacks in the U.S.\nIn August 2018, Wahhaj\u2019s son (also named Siraj Wahhaj), along with his two daughters, a daughter-in-law and a son-in-law, was arrested on 11 felony counts of child abuse at a New Mexico compound.\nIt is also important to note that the elder Wahhaj was one of the people who led authorities to the compound after he received a plea from his daughter saying that they were starving, he has claimed.\nWhile incredibly controversial, Wahhaj is still a prominent cleric in the Muslim community who books speaking engagements around the country and has held executive roles in influential Islamic organizations over the years.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat of this so-called \u2018link\u2019?\nStarting with the Colombian Post story, we eventually tracked down an article on FMshooter.com, a conservative blog originally founded to focus on promoting \"free market economies and responsible gun ownership.\"\nThat story\u2019s headline takes it a bit further: \"Trump-Ranting Democrat Rashida Tlaib Linked To Imam Who Sees Homosexuality As A \u2018Disease,\u2019\" it reads, before spending the first four paragraphs of the story referencing Tlaib\u2019s use of an expletive while vowing at a reception following her swearing-in to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\"Delving deeper,\" the story goes on, \"we find that Tlaib \u2013 no more than two months ago \u2013 was a featured speaker at a CAIR event with Siraj Wahhaj.\"\nIt then displays a screenshot of a CAIR promotional flyer for the event.\nThat claim checks out.\nThe Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations, or CAIR, is a Muslim civil rights and advocacy group that often sponsors events like the one referenced in the article.\nOn Nov. 10, Tlaib and Wahhaj were both featured speakers at the organization\u2019s 16th Annual Banquet at California State University\u2019s Sacramento campus.\n\"My appearance at an event does not indicate that I support the views of another person who just so happened to speak there as well,\" Tlaib said in a statement to PolitiFact.\u00a0Tlaib is the first Palestinian-American woman elected to Congress and she is one of the first two Muslim women.\n\"I have always been and remain committed to fighting for the acceptance of every individual no matter who they are or who they love. Throughout my life, I have spoken up for LGBTQ rights and I will continue to do so,\" she added, in regards to the second story\u2019s headline.\nBesides that speaking engagement, we could find no other connection between the two and the congresswoman said she may have seen Wahhaj at other events, but doesn\u2019t recall any other link to him.\nOur ruling\nA story with the headline, \"Democrat Congresswoman linked to UNINDICTED Terrorist!\" is being spread online about new U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib.\nSiraj Wahhaj has certainly been a controversial figure and, according to documents, was considered by authorities to be someone who may have had a connection to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. But he was never charged and remains a significant figure in the Muslim community.\nThe only connection we could find between Wahhaj and Tlaib is that they were both featured speakers at a November 2018 CAIR banquet in California.\nWhile the Columbian Post story contains some truth regarding Wahhaj\u2019s past, the clickbait headlines -- especially regarding a supposed \u2018link\u2019 between Wahhaj and Tlaib -- are exaggerated and make it appear more sinister.\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.\n\nShare the Facts\n2019-01-15 13:13:19 UTC\n\n\nPolitiFact\n\n\n3\n1\n7\n PolitiFact Rating:\nMostly False\n\nSays new U.S. Democratic Rep.
