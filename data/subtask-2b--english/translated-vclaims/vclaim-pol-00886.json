However, investment in Naiki and the design of Jordan's air shoes were not among his endeavours. Shortly after the death of the heavy musician on April 21, 2016, rumors began to spread that the prince invested in Nike, recruited Michael Jordan to the company and designed Joey Jordan's first shoe. The only problem is, none of that is true. The social media bulletins, such as those recently published on Facebook, contain side pictures of Jordan and the Prince, and claim that: \"Return in 1971 the Prince invested in Naiki-Shu. Later in 1983, Michael Jordan was recruited, designed for Jordan &apos; s first show, and the Nikki Jordan 1 sales campaign was launched. The prince set Michael up to become a billion-dollar Mongols shoe and a few people know it.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, it is unlikely that the prince invested in Nike in 1971 - because he could have been only between 12 and 13 years old at the time. It was only after the release of his first album \"For You\" in 1978 that the Prince achieved considerable commercial success. The next one is to claim that Prince Michael Jordan was recruited to sign with Nikki in 1983. Now, Jordan joined the company in 1984, but there's no evidence the prince had anything to do with it. We were unable to find any media reports indicating that he was involved in the Jordanian Nike deal, details that would have been a big news story in the light of the prince's star in the mid-1980s. The account also contrasts with other accounts, including the then agent of Jordan, of how the deal is done. The Prince's name does not appear. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 On January 16, 2012, Prince did not design Jordan's first airline company (known as Air Jordan 1) or Peter Moore. *Moor, along with Bruce Kelgor, also established Jordan's second air. Joseph Vogel, author of Prince 2018, \"This thing is called life: Prince, race, sex, religion, music,\" told us that the claim is a strange myth. \"The Prince was about 13 years old in 1971, so the idea that he would have invested in Naik that year was not logical and supported by any reliable source I know,\" Vogel wrote in an e-mail to Polity Fuckett. \"The same applies to the recruitment of Michael Jordan in 1983. The history of Naiki and Air Jordans has been thoroughly documented and does not include the Prince. As far as I know, Prince and Michael Jordan didn't have any kind of relationship, even though Jordan was a fan of his music.\" Shortly after the early death of the Prince, Jordan issued a statement describing the music as a genius and saying that his songs inspired him throughout his career. \"Like a lot of people I'm shocked by the news that the prince is dead,\" said Jordan. \"In a world of creative artists, the prince was a genius. It can really be measured not only on music, but on culture. His songs inspired me my entire career and reminded me of many moments of my life.\" But this comment does not mean that the Prince has anything to do with Jordan's success with Naiki.
