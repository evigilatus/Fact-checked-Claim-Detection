0001	KELLY	Welcome to the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign, live from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.
0002	KELLY	I'm Megyn Kelly...
0003	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0004	KELLY	... along with my comoderators, Brett Baier and Chris Wallace.
0005	KELLY	Tonight...
0006	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0007	KELLY	Nice.
0008	KELLY	Tonight, thousands of people here in the Q, along with millions of voters at home will get their very first chance to see the candidates face off in a debate, answering the questions you want answered.
0009	BAIER	Less than a year from now, in this very arena, one of these 10 candidates or one of the seven on the previous debate tonight will accept the Republican party's nomination.
0010	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0011	BAIER	Tonight's candidates were selected based on an average of five national polls.
0012	BAIER	Just a few hours ago, you heard from the candidates ranked 11th through 17.
0013	BAIER	And now, the primetime event, the top 10.
0014	WALLACE	Also of note, Fox News is partnering for tonight's debate with Facebook.
0015	WALLACE	For the past several weeks, we've been asking you for questions for the candidates on Facebook.
0016	WALLACE	Nearly 6 million of you, 6 million, viewed the debate videos on our site, and more than 40,000 of you submitted questions some of which you will hear us asking the candidates tonight.
0017	KELLY	As for the candidates who will be answering those questions?
0018	KELLY	Here they are.
0019	KELLY	Positioned on the stage by how they stand in the polls, in the center of the stage tonight, businessman Donald Trump.
0020	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0021	KELLY	Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.
0022	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0023	KELLY	Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.
0024	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0025	KELLY	Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.

0036	WALLACE	[
0037	WALLACE	applause ] And your very own governor of Ohio...
0038	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0039	WALLACE	... John Kasich.
0040	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0041	WALLACE	Brett  Brett, I think you would call that a home field advantage.
0042	BAIER	It might be.
0043	BAIER	It might be.
0044	BAIER	We'll see.
0045	BAIER	Is this in the rules?
0046	BAIER	An objection's coming.
0047	BAIER	It might be.
0048	BAIER	The rules for tonight are simple.
0049	BAIER	One minute for answers, 30 seconds for followups.
0050	BAIER	And if a candidate runs over, you'll hear this.
0051	BAIER	Pleasant, no?
0052	BAIER	We also have a big crowd here with us tonight in the home of the Cavaliers, as I mentioned.
0053	BAIER	And while we expect them...
0054	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0055	BAIER	... we expect them to be enthusiastic, as you heard, we don't want to take anything away from the valuable time for the candidate.
0056	BAIER	So, we're looking for somewhere between a reaction to a LeBron James dunk and the Cleveland Public Library across the street.
0057	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0058	BAIER	Somewhere there, we'll find a balance tonight.
0059	BAIER	Without further ado, let's begin.
0060	BAIER	Gentlemen, we know how much you love handraising questions.
0061	BAIER	So we promise, this is the only one tonight the only one.
0062	BAIER	Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person.
0063	BAIER	Again, we're looking for you to raise your hand now  raise your hand now if you won't make that pledge tonight.
0064	BAIER	Mr. Trump.
0065	SYSTEM	[ booing ]
0066	BAIER	Mr. Trump to be clear, you're standing on a Republican primary debate stage.
0067	TRUMP	I fully understand.
0068	BAIER	The place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod.
0069	TRUMP	I fully understand.
0070	BAIER	And that experts say an independent run would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another Clinton.
0071	BAIER	You can't say tonight that you can make that pledge?
0072	TRUMP	I cannot say.
0073	TRUMP	I have to respect the person that, if it's not me, the person that wins, if I do win, and I'm leading by quite a bit, that's what I want to do.
0074	TRUMP	I can totally make that pledge.
0075	TRUMP	If I'm the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent.
0076	TRUMP	But  and I am discussing it with everybody, but I'm, you know, talking about a lot of leverage.
0077	TRUMP	We want to win, and we will win.
0078	TRUMP	But I want to win as the Republican.
0079	TRUMP	I want to run as the Republican nominee.
0080	BAIER	So tonight, you can't say if another one of these...
0081	PAUL	This is what's wrong!
0082	BAIER	OK.
0083	PAUL	I mean, this is what's wrong.
0084	PAUL	He buys and sells politicians of all stripes, he's already...
0085	BAIER	Dr. Paul.
0086	PAUL	Hey, look, look!
0087	PAUL	He's already hedging his bet on the Clintons, OK?
0088	PAUL	So if he doesn't run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton, or maybe he runs as an independent...
0089	BAIER	OK.
0090	PAUL	...but I'd say that he's already hedging his bets because he's used to buying politicians.
0091	TRUMP	Well, I've given him plenty of money.
0092	BAIER	Just to be clear, you can't make a  we're gonna  we're going to move on.
0093	BAIER	You're not gonna make the pledge tonight?
0094	TRUMP	I will not make the pledge at this time.
0095	BAIER	OK. Alright.
0096	SYSTEM	[ laughter and boing ]
0097	KELLY	Gentlemen, our first round of questions is on the subject of electability in the general election, and we start tonight with you, Dr. Carson.
0098	KELLY	You are a successful neurosurgeon, but you admit that you have had to study up on foreign policy, saying there's a lot to learn.
0099	KELLY	Your critics say that your inexperience shows.
0100	KELLY	You've suggested that the Baltic States are not a part of NATO, just months ago you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel, and domestically, you thought Alan Greenspan had been treasury secretary instead of federal reserve chair.
0101	KELLY	Aren't these basic mistakes, and don't they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be president?
0102	CARSON	Well, I could take issue with  with all of those things, but we don't have time.
0103	CARSON	But I will say, we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and I'm looking very much forward to demonstrating that, in fact, the thing that is probably most important is having a brain, and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly.
0104	CARSON	So, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas, and America became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians, but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, and that's what will get us on the right track now, as well.
0105	WALLACE	Senator Rubio, when Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for presidency, he said this "There's no passing off responsibility when you're a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd."
0106	WALLACE	Could you please address Governor Bush across the stage here, and explain to him why you, someone who has never held executive office, are better prepared to be president than he is, a man who you say did a great job running your state of Florida for eight years.
0107	RUBIO	Well, thank you for the question, Chris, and it's great to be here tonight.
0108	RUBIO	Let me begin by saying this I'm not new to the political process I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate.
0109	RUBIO	I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition.
0110	RUBIO	It's important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight.
0111	RUBIO	Here's what this election better be about This election better be about the future, not the past.
0112	RUBIO	It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced.
0113	RUBIO	This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed.
0114	RUBIO	You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn't even own a single store?
0115	RUBIO	And these changes have been disruptive.
0116	RUBIO	They have changed people's lives.
0117	RUBIO	The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don't pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee.
0118	RUBIO	If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck?
0119	RUBIO	I was raised paycheck to paycheck.
0120	RUBIO	How is she  how is she gonna lecture me  how is she gonna lecture me about student loans?
0121	RUBIO	I owed over $100,000 just four years ago.
0122	RUBIO	If I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future.
0123	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0124	BAIER	Governor Bush, you have insisted that you're your own man.
0125	BAIER	You say you have a life experience uniquely your own.
0126	BAIER	Not your father's, not your brother's.
0127	BAIER	But there are several opponents on this stage who get big applause lines in early voting states with this line quote, "the last thing the country needs is another Bush in the Oval Office."
0128	BAIER	So do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics?
0129	BUSH	Absolutely, I do, and I'm gonna run hard, run with heart, and run to win.
0130	BUSH	I'm gonna have to earn this.
0131	BUSH	Maybe the barrier  the bar's even higher for me.
0132	BUSH	That's fine.
0133	BUSH	I've got a record in Florida.
0134	BUSH	I'm proud of my dad, and I'm certainly proud of my brother.
0135	BUSH	In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it.
0136	BUSH	I cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion.
0137	BUSH	We were  we had  we balanced every budget.
0138	BUSH	We went from $1 billion of reserves to $9 billion of reserves.
0139	BUSH	We were one of two states that went to AAA bond rating.
0140	BUSH	They keep  they called me Veto Corleone.
0141	BUSH	Because I vetoed 2,500 separate lineitems in the budget.
0142	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0143	BUSH	I am my own man.
0144	BUSH	I governed as a conservative, and I govern effectively.
0145	BUSH	And the net effect was, during my eight years, 1.3 million jobs were created.
0146	BUSH	We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way, and people rose up.
0147	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0148	KELLY	Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter.
0149	KELLY	However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women.
0150	KELLY	You've called women you don't like "fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals."
0151	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0152	KELLY	Your Twitter account...
0153	TRUMP	Only Rosie O'Donnell.
0154	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0155	KELLY	No, it wasn't.
0156	KELLY	[
0157	KELLY	applause ] Your Twitter account...
0158	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0159	TRUMP	Thank you.
0160	KELLY	For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell.
0161	TRUMP	Yes, I'm sure it was.
0162	KELLY	Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks.
0163	KELLY	You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.
0164	KELLY	Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?
0165	TRUMP	I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct.
0166	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0167	TRUMP	I've been challenged by so many people, and I don't frankly have time for total political correctness.
0168	TRUMP	And to be honest with you, this country doesn't have time either.
0169	TRUMP	This country is in big trouble.
0170	TRUMP	We don't win anymore.
0171	TRUMP	We lose to China.
0172	TRUMP	We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border.
0173	TRUMP	We lose to everybody.
0174	TRUMP	And frankly, what I say, and oftentimes it's fun, it's kidding.
0175	TRUMP	We have a good time.
0176	TRUMP	What I say is what I say.
0177	TRUMP	And honestly Megyn, if you don't like it, I'm sorry.
0178	TRUMP	I've been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me.
0179	TRUMP	But I wouldn't do that.
0180	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0181	TRUMP	But you know what, we  we need strength, we need energy, we need quickness and we need brain in this country to turn it around.
0182	TRUMP	That, I can tell you right now.
0183	WALLACE	Senator Cruz, your colleague, Senator Paul, right there next to you, said a few months ago he agrees with you on a number of issues, but he says you do nothing to grow the party.
0184	WALLACE	He says you feed red meat to the base, but you don't reach out to minorities.
0185	WALLACE	You have a toxic relationship with GOP leaders in Congress.
0186	WALLACE	You even called the Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar recently.
0187	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0188	WALLACE	How can you win in 2016 when you're such a divisive figure?
0189	CRUZ	Chris, I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth.
0190	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0191	CRUZ	If you're looking for someone to go to Washington, to go along to get along, to get  to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I ain't your guy.
0192	CRUZ	There is a reason...
0193	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0194	CRUZ	.... that we have $18 trillion in debt.
0195	CRUZ	Because as conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections.
0196	CRUZ	We got a Republican House, we've got a Republican Senate, and we don't have leaders who honor their commitments.
0197	CRUZ	I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do.
0198	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0199	BAIER	Governor Christie, you're not exactly the darling of conservatives.
0200	BAIER	You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state.
0201	BAIER	On Facebook, the most people talking about you, not surprisingly, come from your state of New Jersey, and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy.
0202	BAIER	This  this may be why.
0203	BAIER	Under your watch, New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades.
0204	BAIER	The state's 44th in private sector growth.
0205	BAIER	You face an employee pension crisis and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country.
0206	BAIER	So why should voters believe that your management of the country's finances would be any different?
0207	CHRISTIE	If you think it's bad now, you should've seen it when I got there.
0208	SYSTEM	[ laught and applause ]
0209	CHRISTIE	The fact is  the fact is, in the eight years before I became governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times.
0210	CHRISTIE	In the eight years before I became governor, spending was increased 56 percent.
0211	CHRISTIE	And in the eight years before I become governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times.
0212	CHRISTIE	In the eight years before I became Governor, spending was increased 56 percent, and in the eight years before I became governor, there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey.
0213	CHRISTIE	Zero.
0214	CHRISTIE	For eight years.
0215	CHRISTIE	So, what did we do?
0216	CHRISTIE	We came in, we balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget.
0217	CHRISTIE	We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases.
0218	CHRISTIE	In fact, we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor.
0219	CHRISTIE	We cut business taxes $2.3 billion, and we cut regulation by onethird of what my predecessor put in place.
0220	CHRISTIE	And, what's happened since?
0221	CHRISTIE	A hundred ninetytwo thousand private sector jobs in the five and a half years I've been governor.
0222	CHRISTIE	We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey, but I am darn proud we've brought our state back.
0223	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0224	KELLY	Governor Walker, you've consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.
0225	KELLY	You recently signed an abortion law in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother's life, but you're on the record as having objected to it.
0226	KELLY	Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion, and with 83 percent of the American public in favor of a life exception, are you too out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election?
0227	WALKER	Well, I'm prolife, I've always been prolife, and I've got a position that I think is consistent with many Americans out there in that...
0228	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0229	WALKER	...in that I believe that that is an unborn child that's in need of protection out there, and I've said many a time that that unborn child can be protected, and there are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that mother.
0230	WALKER	That's been consistently proven.
0231	WALKER	Unlike Hillary Clinton, who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood, I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before any of these videos came out...
0232	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0233	WALKER	...I've got a position that's in line with everyday America.
0234	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0235	WALLACE	Governor Huckabee, like Governor Walker, you have staked out strong positions on social issues.
0236	WALLACE	You favor a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage.
0237	WALLACE	You favor a constitutional amendment banning abortions, except for the life of the mother.
0238	WALLACE	Millions of people in this country agree with you, but according to the polls, and again this an electability question, according to the polls, more people don't, so how do you persuade enough Independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016?
0239	HUCKABEE	Chris, I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment.
0240	HUCKABEE	That's a long and difficult process.
0241	HUCKABEE	I've actually taken the position that's bolder than that.
0242	HUCKABEE	A lot of people are talking about defunding planned parenthood, as if that's a huge game changer.
0243	HUCKABEE	I think it's time to do something even more bold.
0244	HUCKABEE	I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother's womb is a person at the moment of conception.
0245	HUCKABEE	The reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on.
0246	HUCKABEE	And, this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child's Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law.
0247	HUCKABEE	It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and we change the policy to be prolife and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they're parts to a Buick.
0248	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0249	BAIER	Senator Paul, you recently blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican hawks.
0250	BAIER	You later said that that statement, you could have said it better.
0251	BAIER	But, the statement went on, and you said, quote, "Everything they've talked about in foreign policy, they've been wrong for the last 20 years."
0252	BAIER	Why are you so quick to blame your own party?
0253	PAUL	First of all, only ISIS is responsible for the terrorism.
0254	PAUL	Only ISIS is responsible for the depravity.
0255	PAUL	But, we do have to examine, how are we going to defeat ISIS?
0256	PAUL	I've got a proposal.
0257	PAUL	I'm the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS.
0258	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0259	PAUL	I've been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton, as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS.
0260	PAUL	ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees.
0261	PAUL	It's a disgrace.
0262	PAUL	We've got to stop  we shouldn't fund our enemies, for goodness sakes.
0263	PAUL	So, we didn't create ISIS  ISIS created themselves, but we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them, and not arming them.
0264	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0265	KELLY	Governor Kasich, You chose to expand Medicaid in your state, unlike several other governors on this stage tonight, and it is already over budget by some estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months.
0266	KELLY	You defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying to skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, Saint Peter isn't going to ask them how small they've kept government, but what they have done for the poor.
0267	KELLY	Why should Republican voters, who generally want to shrink government, believe that you won't use your Saint Peter rationale to expand every government program?
0268	KASICH	Well, first of all...
0269	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0270	KASICH	...
0271	KASICH	first of all, Megyn, you should know that  that President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times.
0272	KASICH	Secondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what?
0273	KASICH	To treat the mentally ill.
0274	KASICH	Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons.
0275	KASICH	It costs $22,500 a year...
0276	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0277	KASICH	...
0278	KASICH	to keep them in prison.
0279	KASICH	I'd rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life.
0280	KASICH	Secondly, we are rehabbing the drugaddicted.
0281	KASICH	Eighty percent of the people in our prisons have addictions or problems.
0282	KASICH	We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community and the recidivism rate is 10 percent and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is  is threatening their very families.
0283	KASICH	So we're treating them and getting them on their feet.
0284	KASICH	And, finally, the working poor, instead of them having come into the emergency rooms where it costs more, where they're sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet.
0285	KASICH	And do you know what?
0286	KASICH	Everybody has a right to their Godgiven purpose.
0287	KASICH	And finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country.
0288	KASICH	And, finally, we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black.
0289	KASICH	We've cut $5 billion in taxes...
0290	SYSTEM	[ timer sounds ]
0291	KASICH	...and we've grown 350,000 jobs.
0292	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0293	WALLACE	Gentlemen, we're turning to a new subject that all of you have been talking about and some of you have been disagreeing about, and that is the issue of immigration.
0294	WALLACE	Governor Bush, you released a new plan this week on illegal immigration focusing on enforcement, which some suggest is your effort to show that you're not soft on that issue.
0295	WALLACE	I want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants.
0296	WALLACE	And here's what you said.
0297	WALLACE	They broke the law, but it's not a felony, it's an act of love.
0298	WALLACE	It's an act of commitment to your family.
0299	WALLACE	Do you stand by that statement and do you stand by your support for earned legal status?
0300	BUSH	I do.
0301	BUSH	I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option.
0302	BUSH	They want to provide for their family.
0303	BUSH	But we need to control our border.
0304	BUSH	It's not  it's our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in.
0305	BUSH	So I  I've written a book about this and yet this week, I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that  that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with EVerify, we need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay.
0306	BUSH	We need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security.
0307	BUSH	We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country.
0308	BUSH	It is ridiculous and tragic...
0309	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0310	BUSH	...that people are dying because of the fact that  that local governments are not following the federal law.
0311	BUSH	There's much to do.
0312	BUSH	And I think rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama has done now for six long years, the next president  and I hope to be that president  will fix this once and for all so that we can turn this into a driver for high sustained economic growth.
0313	BUSH	And there should be a path to earned legal status...
0314	SYSTEM	[ timer sounds ]
0315	BUSH	...
0316	BUSH	for those that are here.
0317	BUSH	Not  not amnesty, earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time.
0318	WALLACE	Thank you, sir.
0319	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0320	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, it has not escaped anybody's notice that you say that the Mexican government, the Mexican government is sending criminals  rapists, drug dealers, across the border.
0321	WALLACE	Governor Bush has called those remarks, quote, "extraordinarily ugly."
0322	WALLACE	I'd like you  you're right next to him  tell us  talk to him directly and say how you respond to that and  and you have repeatedly said that you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this, but you have evidence you have refused or declined to share.
0323	WALLACE	Why not use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people?
0324	TRUMP	So, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris.
0325	TRUMP	You wouldn't even be talking about it.
0326	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0327	TRUMP	This was not a subject that was on anybody's mind until I brought it up at my announcement.
0328	TRUMP	And I said, Mexico is sending.
0329	TRUMP	Except the reporters, because they're a very dishonest lot, generally speaking, in the world of politics, they didn't cover my statement the way I said it.
0330	TRUMP	The fact is, since then, many killings ,murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, are money going out and the drugs coming in.
0331	TRUMP	And I said we need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly.
0332	TRUMP	And I don't mind having a big beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally.
0333	TRUMP	But we need, Jeb, to build a wall, we need to keep illegals out.
0334	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0335	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, I'll give you 30 seconds  I'll give you 30 seconds to answer my question, which was, what evidence do you have, specific evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border?
0336	WALLACE	Thirty seconds.
0337	TRUMP	Border Patrol, I was at the border last week.
0338	TRUMP	Border Patrol, people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what's happening.
0339	TRUMP	Because our leaders are stupid.
0340	TRUMP	Our politicians are stupid.
0341	TRUMP	And the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning.
0342	TRUMP	And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them.
0343	TRUMP	They don't want to take care of them.
0344	TRUMP	Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them?
0345	TRUMP	And that's what is happening whether you like it or not.
0346	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0347	WALLACE	All right.
0348	WALLACE	Obviously there's a lot more to talk about this.
0349	WALLACE	We're going to have more questions for the candidates on illegal immigration, plus other key topics including your questions on Facebook.
0350	SYSTEM	[ video clip begins ]
0351	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	What will be your plan on making immigration easier for those that want to do it legally?
0352	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	What specific steps would you take to contain the growth of ISIS?

0356	WALLACE	Welcome back to FOX NewsFacebook Republican Debate Night.
0357	WALLACE	We're going to continue the questions now on illegal immigration.
0358	WALLACE	We kind of ended with a cliffhanger there.
0359	WALLACE	So let's continue the conversation.
0360	WALLACE	Governor Kasich, I know you don't like to talk about Donald Trump.
0361	WALLACE	But I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said.
0362	WALLACE	When you say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals, that we're being bamboozled, is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration?
0363	KASICH	Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris Christie, they say we're outspoken, we need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we're really going to learn it.
0364	KASICH	Here is the thing about Donald Trump.
0365	KASICH	Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country.
0366	KASICH	He is.
0367	KASICH	He's hitting a nerve.
0368	KASICH	People are frustrated.
0369	KASICH	They're fed up.
0370	KASICH	They don't think the government is working for them.
0371	KASICH	And for people who want to just tune him out, they're making a mistake.
0372	KASICH	Now, he's got his solutions.
0373	KASICH	Some of us have other solutions.
0374	KASICH	You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington.
0375	KASICH	Hasn't been done since.
0376	KASICH	I was a military reformer.
0377	KASICH	I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000 jobs.
0378	WALLACE	Respectfully, can we talk about illegal immigration?
0379	KASICH	But the point is that we all have solutions.
0380	KASICH	Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built.
0381	KASICH	They want to see an end to illegal immigration.
0382	KASICH	They want to see it, and we all do.
0383	KASICH	But we all have different ways of getting there.
0384	KASICH	And you're going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are.
0385	WALLACE	All right, well, Senator Rubio, let me see if I can do better with you.
0386	WALLACE	Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid, their leaders are smart, and all of these illegals coming over are criminals?
0387	RUBIO	Let me set the record straight on a couple of things.
0388	RUBIO	The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico.
0389	RUBIO	They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras.
0390	RUBIO	Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority.
0391	RUBIO	I also believe we need a fence.
0392	RUBIO	The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too.
0393	RUBIO	And that's why you need an everify system and you need an entryexit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration.
0394	RUBIO	But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said.
0395	RUBIO	People are frustrated.
0396	RUBIO	This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration.
0397	RUBIO	There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we're being taken advantage of.
0398	RUBIO	We feel like despite our generosity, we're being taken advantage of.
0399	RUBIO	And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates.
0400	RUBIO	The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States.
0401	RUBIO	And they've paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in.
0402	RUBIO	And they're wondering, maybe they should come illegally.
0403	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0404	RUBIO	And so these are important issues, and we should address it.
0405	RUBIO	It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise we're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last 30 years.
0406	WALLACE	Governor Walker.
0407	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0408	WALLACE	Governor Walker, from 2002 until as recently as 2013, just two years ago, you supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.
0409	WALLACE	Now you say that was a quick reaction to something you hadn't really thought about, and that you've changed your mind.
0410	WALLACE	Other than politics, could you explain why in the last two years you've changed your position on a path to citizenship, and are there other past positions that we shouldn't hold you to?
0411	WALKER	Chris, I actually said that on your show earlier this year.
0412	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0413	WALKER	I acknowledged that.
0414	WALKER	I said I actually listened to the American people.
0415	WALKER	And I think people across America want a leader who's actually going to listen to them.
0416	WALKER	I talked to border state governors and other elected officials.
0417	WALKER	I look at how this president, particularly through last November, messed up the immigration system in this country.
0418	WALKER	Most importantly, I listened to the people of America.
0419	WALKER	I believe we need to secure the border.
0420	WALKER	I've been to the border with Governor Abbott in Texas and others, seeing the problems that they have there.
0421	WALKER	There is international criminal organizations penetrating our southern based borders, and we need to do something about it.
0422	WALKER	Secure the border, enforce the law, no amnesty, and go forward with the legal immigration system that gives priority to American working families and wages.
0423	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0424	WALLACE	Senator Cruz, some 1,400 people submitted questions on this very hot topic of illegal immigration on Facebook, and a number of them were about the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, allegedly shot down by an illegal.
0425	WALLACE	Doug Bettencourt sent this question, "will you support Kate Steinle's Law," which would impose a mandatory fiveyear prison term for an illegal who is deported and then returns to this country?
0426	WALLACE	And will you defund sanctuary cities for violating federal law?
0427	CRUZ	Chris, absolutely yes.
0428	CRUZ	And not only will I support it...
0429	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0430	CRUZ	...I have authored Kate's law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation.
0431	CRUZ	I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kate's law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago, and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kate's law.
0432	CRUZ	You know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid.
0433	CRUZ	It's not a question of stupidity.
0434	CRUZ	It's that they don't want to enforce the immigration laws.
0435	CRUZ	That there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty.
0436	CRUZ	President Obama has talked about fundamentally transforming this country.
0437	CRUZ	There's 7 billion people across the face of the globe, many of whom want to come to this country.
0438	CRUZ	If they come legally, great.
0439	CRUZ	But if they come illegally and they get amnesty, that is how we fundamentally change this country, and it really is striking.
0440	CRUZ	A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty.
0441	CRUZ	I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer's gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate.
0442	KELLY	Alright, gentlemen, we're gonna switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security.
0443	KELLY	Governor Christie.
0444	KELLY	You've said that Senator Paul's opposition to the NSA's collection of phone records has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable, even going so far as to say that he should be called before Congress to answer for it if we should be hit by another terrorist attack.
0445	KELLY	Do you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing the bulk collection of people's phone records in the event of a terrorist attack?
0446	CHRISTIE	Yes, I do.
0447	CHRISTIE	And I'll tell you why because I'm the only person on this stage who's actually filed applications under the Patriot Act, who has gone before the federal  the Foreign Intelligence Service court, who has prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after September 11th.
0448	CHRISTIE	I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state.
0449	CHRISTIE	This is not theoretical to me.
0450	CHRISTIE	I went to the funerals.
0451	CHRISTIE	We lost friends of ours in the Trade Center that day.
0452	CHRISTIE	My own wife was two blocks from the Trade Center that day, at her office, having gone through it that morning.
0453	CHRISTIE	When you actually have to be responsible for doing this, you can do it, and we did it, for seven years in my office, respecting civil liberties and protecting the homeland.
0454	CHRISTIE	And I will make no apologies, ever, for protecting the lives and the safety of the American people.
0455	CHRISTIE	We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way.
0456	CHRISTIE	As president, that is exactly what I'll do.
0457	PAUL	Megyn, may I respond?
0458	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0459	PAUL	May I respond?
0460	KELLY	Go ahead, sir.
0461	PAUL	I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans.
0462	PAUL	The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over!
0463	PAUL	John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights.
0464	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0465	CHRISTIE	And  and, Megyn?
0466	CHRISTIE	Megyn, that's a  that, you know, that's a completely ridiculous answer.
0467	CHRISTIE	I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from other people.
0468	CHRISTIE	How are you supposed to know, Megyn?
0469	PAUL	Use the Fourth Amendment!
0470	CHRISTIE	What are you supposed to...
0471	PAUL	Use the Fourth Amendment!
0472	CHRISTIE	...how are you supposed to  no, I'll tell you how you, look...
0473	PAUL	Get a warrant!
0474	CHRISTIE	Let me tell you something, you go...
0475	PAUL	Get a judge to sign the warrant!
0476	CHRISTIE	When you  you know, senator...
0477	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0478	KELLY	Governor Christie, make your point.
0479	CHRISTIE	Listen, senator, you know, when you're sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that.
0480	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0481	CHRISTIE	When you're responsible for protecting the lives of the American people, then what you need to do is to make sure...
0482	PAUL	See, here's the problem.
0483	CHRISTIE	...is to make sure that you use the system the way it's supposed to work.
0484	PAUL	Here's the problem, governor.
0485	PAUL	Here's the problem, governor.
0486	PAUL	You fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights.
0487	PAUL	Every time you did a case, you got a warrant from a judge.
0488	PAUL	I'm talking about searches without warrants...
0489	CHRISTIE	There is no...
0490	PAUL	...indiscriminately, of all Americans' records, and that's what I fought to end.
0491	PAUL	I don't trust President Obama with our records.
0492	PAUL	I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead.
0493	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0494	KELLY	Go ahead, governor.
0495	CHRISTIE	And you know  you know, Senator Paul?
0496	CHRISTIE	Senator Paul, you know, the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11th.
0497	CHRISTIE	Those are the hugs I remember, and those had nothing to do  and those had nothing to do with politics, unlike what you're doing by cutting speeches on the floor of the Senate, then putting them on the Internet within half an hour to raise money for your campaign...
0498	KELLY	Alright.
0499	CHRISTIE	...and while still putting our country at risk.
0500	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0501	KELLY	Alright, we've gotta cut it off there.
0502	KELLY	We have plenty more we want to get to.
0503	KELLY	That was an interesting exchange, thank you for that.
0504	CHRISTIE	You know what, Megyn, can I...
0505	KELLY	Well, I want to move on, because I have  we're gonna get to you, governor, but I  I really wanna get to a Facebook questioner.
0506	KELLY	His name is Alex Chalgren, and he has the following question
0507	SYSTEM	[ video clip begins ]
0508	QUESTION	 My question is, how would the candidates stop the treacherous actions of ISIS  ISIL and its growing influence in the U.S., if they were to become president?
0509	SYSTEM	[ video clip ends ]
0510	KELLY	Senator Cruz, I wanna talk to you about this, because many of the Facebook users and  and  the  the folks on Facebook wanted the candidates to speak to ISIS tonight.
0511	KELLY	You asked the chairman of the joint chiefs a question "What would it take to destroy ISIS in 90 days?"
0512	KELLY	He told you "IISIS will only be truly destroyed once they are rejected by the populations in which they hide."
0513	KELLY	And then you accused him of pushing Medicaid for the Iraqis.
0514	KELLY	How would you destroy ISIS in 90 days?
0515	CRUZ	Megyn, we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth.
0516	CRUZ	We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words, "radical Islamic terrorism".
0517	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0518	CRUZ	When I asked General Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs, what would be required militarily to destroy ISIS, he said there is no military solution.
0519	CRUZ	We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization.
0520	CRUZ	That, with all due respect, is nonsense.
0521	CRUZ	It's the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs.
0522	CRUZ	What we need is a commander in chief who makes  clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant.
0523	KELLY	You don't see it as...
0524	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0525	KELLY	...an ideological problem  an ideological problem in addition to a military one?
0526	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0527	CRUZ	Megyn, of course it's an ideological problem, that's one of the reasons I introduce the Expatriate Terrorist Act in the Senate that said if any American travels to the Middle East and joining ISIS, that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don't use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans.
0528	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0529	CRUZ	Yes, it is ideological, and let me contrast President Obama, who at the prayer breakfast, essentially acted as an apologist.
0530	CRUZ	He said, "Well, gosh, the crusades, the inquisitions"
0531	SYSTEM	[ timer sounds ]
0532	CRUZ	We need a president that shows the courage that Egypt's President alSisi did, a Muslim, when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world.
0533	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0534	KELLY	Governor Bush, for days on end in this campaign, you struggled to answer a question about whether knowing what we know now...
0535	BUSH	...I remember...
0536	KELLY	...we would've invaded Iraq...
0537	BUSH	...I remember, Megyn.
0538	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0539	KELLY	I remember it too, and ISIS, of course, is now thriving there.
0540	KELLY	You finally said, "No."
0541	KELLY	To the families of those who died in that war who say they liberated a country and deposed a ruthless dictator, how do you look at them now and say that your brothers war was a mistake?
0542	BUSH	Knowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when  when we invaded, it was a mistake.
0543	BUSH	I wouldn't have gone in, however, for the people that did lose their lives, and the families that suffer because of it  I know this full well because as governor of the state of Florida, I called every one of them.
0544	BUSH	Every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them, and it was really hard to do.
0545	BUSH	And, every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their wife, of their husband did not die in vain.
0546	BUSH	So, why it was difficult for me to do it was based on that.
0547	BUSH	Here's the lesson that we should take from this, which relates to this whole subject.
0548	BUSH	Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq.
0549	BUSH	He left, and when he left Al Qaida was done for.
0550	BUSH	ISIS was created because
0551	SYSTEM	[ timer sounds ]
0552	BUSH	of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana.
0553	BUSH	To honor the people that died, we need to  we need to  stop the  Iran agreement, for sure, because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands, and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal.
0554	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0555	KELLY	Governor Walker, in February you said that we needed to gain partners in the Arab world.
0556	KELLY	Which Arab country not already in the U.S. led coalition has potential to be our greatest partner?
0557	WALKER	I don't know about additional ones.
0558	WALKER	We need to focus on the ones we have.
0559	WALKER	You look at Egypt, probably the best relationship we've had in Israel, at least in my lifetime, incredibly important.
0560	WALKER	You look at the Saudis  in fact, earlier this year, I met with Saudi leaders, and leaders from the United Arab Emirates, and I asked them what's the greatest challenge in the world today?
0561	WALKER	Set aside the Iran deal.
0562	WALKER	They said it's the disengagement of America.
0563	WALKER	We are leading from behind under the ObamaClinton doctrine  America's a great country.
0564	WALKER	We need to stand up and start leading again, and we need to have allies, not just in Israel, but throughout the Persian Gulf.
0565	KELLY	Dr. Carson, in one of his first acts as commander in chief, President Obama signed an executive order banning enhanced interrogation techniques in fighting terror.
0566	KELLY	As president, would you bring back water boarding?
0567	CARSON	Well, thank you, Megyn, I wasn't sure I was going to get to talk again.

0570	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
0571	KELLY	Fear not, you may rue that request.
0572	CARSON	Alright.
0573	CARSON	You know, what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business, and I wouldn't necessarily be broadcasting what we're going to do.
0574	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0575	CARSON	We. .
0576	CARSON	.uh. .
0577	CARSON	.we've gotten into this  this mindset of fighting politically correct wars.
0578	CARSON	There is no such thing as a politically correct war.
0579	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0580	CARSON	And, the left, of course, will say Carson doesn't believe in the Geneva Convention.
0581	CARSON	Carson doesn't believe in fighting stupid wars.
0582	CARSON	And  and what we have to remember is we want to utilize the tremendous intellect that we have in the military to win wars.
0583	CARSON	And I've talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advanced people.
0584	CARSON	And believe me, if we gave them the mission, which is what the commanderinchief does, they would be able to carry it out.
0585	CARSON	And if we don't tie their hands behind their back, they will do it...
0586	SYSTEM	[ timer sounds ]

0589	BAIER	Gentlemen, the next series of questions deals with ObamaCare and the role of the federal government.
0590	BAIER	Mr. Trump, ObamaCare is one of the things you call a disaster.
0591	TRUMP	A complete disaster, yes.
0592	BAIER	Saying it needs to be repealed and replaced.
0593	TRUMP	Correct.
0594	BAIER	Now, 15 years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care.
0595	BAIER	You were for a singlepayer system, a Canadianstyle system.
0596	BAIER	Why were you for that then and why aren't you for it now?
0597	TRUMP	First of all, I'd like to just go back to one.
0598	TRUMP	In July of 2004, I came out strongly against the war with Iraq, because it was going to destabilize the Middle East.
0599	TRUMP	And I'm the only one on this stage that knew that and had the vision to say it.
0600	TRUMP	And that's exactly what happened.
0601	BAIER	But on ObamaCare...
0602	TRUMP	And the Middle East became totally destabilized.
0603	TRUMP	So I just want to say.
0604	TRUMP	As far as single payer, it works in Canada.
0605	TRUMP	It works incredibly well in Scotland.
0606	TRUMP	It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you're talking about here.
0607	TRUMP	What I'd like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state.
0608	TRUMP	I have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees.
0609	TRUMP	And if I'm negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder.
0610	TRUMP	Nobody can bid.
0611	TRUMP	You know why?

0625	BAIER	OK.

0694	BAIER	Governor Huckabee, on Facebook, John Pietricone asked this, "Will you abolish or take away the powers and cut the size of the EPA, the IRS, the Department of Education?"
0695	BAIER	Now, broadly...
0696	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0697	BAIER	...broadly, the size of government is a big concern for Facebook users, Facebook persons, as well as, obviously, conservatives.
0698	BAIER	But year after year, decade after decade, there are promises from Republicans to shrink government.
0699	BAIER	But year after year, decade after decade, it doesn't happen.
0700	BAIER	In fact, it gets bigger, even under Republican politicians.
0701	BAIER	So the question is, at this point, is the government simply too big for any one person, even a Republican, to shrink?
0702	HUCKABEE	It's not too big to shrink.
0703	HUCKABEE	But the problem is we have a Wall StreettoWashington axis of power that has controlled the political climate.
0704	HUCKABEE	The donor class feeds the political class who does the dance that the donor class wants.
0705	HUCKABEE	And the result is federal government keeps getting bigger.
0706	HUCKABEE	Every person on this stage who has been a governor will tell that you the biggest fight they had was not the other party.
0707	HUCKABEE	Wasn't even the legislature.
0708	HUCKABEE	It was the federal government, who continually put mandates on the states that we had to suck up and pay for.
0709	HUCKABEE	And the fact is there are a lot of things happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution.
0710	HUCKABEE	This is power that should be shifted back to the states, whether it's the EPA, there is no role at the federal level for the Department of Education.
0711	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0712	HUCKABEE	And I'm still one who says that we can get rid of the Internal Revenue Service if we would pass the FairTax, which is a tax on consumption rather than a tax on people's income, and move power back where the founders believed it should have been all along.
0713	BAIER	Dr. Carson...
0714	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	Bret, Bret, Bret...
0715	BAIER	Dr. Carson, do you agree with that?
0716	CARSON	What I agree with is that we need a significantly changed taxation system.
0717	CARSON	And the one that I've advocated is based on tithing, because I think God is a pretty fair guy.
0718	CARSON	And he said, you know, if you give me a tithe, it doesn't matter how much you made.
0719	CARSON	If you've had a bumper crop, you don't owe me triple tithes.
0720	CARSON	And if you've had no crops at all, you don't owe me no tithes.
0721	CARSON	So there must be something inherently fair about that.
0722	CARSON	And that's why I've advocated a proportional tax system.
0723	CARSON	You make $10 billion, you pay a billion.
0724	CARSON	You make $10, you pay one.
0725	CARSON	And everybody gets treated the same way.

0728	BAIER	Governor Bush?
0729	CARSON	And I have a lot more to say about it.
0730	BAIER	We're going to come back to you, Dr. Carson.
0731	BAIER	Governor Bush, you are one of the few people on the stage who advocates for Common Core education standards, reading and math.
0732	BAIER	A lot of people on this stage vigorously oppose a federal involvement in education.
0733	BAIER	They say it should all be handled locally.
0734	BAIER	President Obama's secretary of education, Arnie Duncan, has said that most of the criticism of Common Core is due to a, quote, "fringe group of critics."
0735	BAIER	Do you think that's accurate?
0736	BUSH	No, I don't.
0737	BUSH	And I don't believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards directly or indirectly, the creation of curriculum or content.
0738	BUSH	It is clearly a state responsibility.
0739	BUSH	I'm for higher standards...
0740	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0741	BUSH	...measured in an intellectually honest way, with abundant school choice, ending social promotion.
0742	BUSH	And I know how to do this because as governor of the state of Florida I created the first statewide voucher program in the country, the second statewide voucher program, in the country and the third statewide voucher program in the country.
0743	BUSH	And we had rising student achievement across the board, because high standards, robust accountability, ending social promotion in third grade, real school choice across the board, challenging the teachers union and beating them is the way to go.
0744	BUSH	And Florida's low income kids had the greatest gains inside the country.
0745	BUSH	Our graduation rate improved by 50 percent.
0746	BUSH	That's what I'm for.
0747	BAIER	Senator Rubio, why is Governor Bush wrong on Common Core?
0748	RUBIO	Well, first off, I too believe in curriculum reform.
0749	RUBIO	It is critically important in the 21st Century.
0750	RUBIO	We do need curriculum reform.
0751	RUBIO	And it should happen at the state and local level.
0752	RUBIO	That's. . .
0753	RUBIO	that's. . .
0754	RUBIO	that is where educational policy belongs, because if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature, or their governor and get it changed.
0755	RUBIO	Here's the problem with Common Core.
0756	RUBIO	The Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied.
0757	RUBIO	They will not stop with it being a suggestion.
0758	RUBIO	They will turn it into a mandate.
0759	RUBIO	In fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it.
0760	RUBIO	And they will use Common Core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states.
0761	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0762	BAIER	And do you agree with your old friend?
0763	BUSH	He is definitely my friend.
0764	BUSH	And I think the states ought to create these standards.
0765	BUSH	And if states want to opt out of Common Core, fine.
0766	BUSH	Just make sure your standards are high.
0767	BUSH	Because today in America, a third of our kids, after we spend more per student than any country in the world other than a couple rounding errors, to be honest with you, 30 percent are college andor careerready.
0768	BUSH	If we are going to compete in this world we're in today, there is no possible way we can do it with lowering expectations and dumbing down everything.
0769	BUSH	Children are going to suffer and families' hearts are going to be broken that their kids won't be able to get a job in the 21st Century.

0795	WALLACE	This is the first of the many rounds, and it's about somebody whose name probably hasn't been mentioned enough so far tonight.
0796	WALLACE	Governor Kasich, let me start with you.
0797	WALLACE	Whoever the Republican nominee 
0798	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0799	WALLACE	Whoever the Republican nominee is, it looks at least for now like whoever that nominee is, he or she, will be facing off against Hillary Clinton.
0800	WALLACE	You know how she will come after whoever the Republican nominee is.
0801	WALLACE	She will say that you, whoever it is, support the rich while she supports the middle class.
0802	WALLACE	That you want to suppress the rights of women and minorities.
0803	WALLACE	She wants to move the country forward while you, the Republicans, want to take the country back to the past.
0804	WALLACE	How will you, if you're the nominee, how will you answer that and take Hillary Clinton on?
0805	KASICH	Let's start off with my father being a mailman.
0806	KASICH	So I understand the concerns of all the folks across this country, some of whom have trouble, you know, making ends meet.
0807	KASICH	But I think she will come in a narrow way.
0808	KASICH	The nominee of this party, if they're going to win, has got to come at it in a big way, which is progrowth.
0809	KASICH	Which is balancing budgets.
0810	KASICH	You know, we were talking about it.
0811	KASICH	People were saying, could we do it?
0812	KASICH	I was the chairman of the Budget Committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in Washington, and when we did it we had great economic growth, we cut taxes, and we had a big surplus.
0813	KASICH	Economic growth is the key.
0814	KASICH	Economic growth is the key to everything.
0815	KASICH	But once you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who don't seem to ever think that they get a fair deal.
0816	KASICH	And that includes people in our minority community that includes people who feel as though they don't have a chance to move up.
0817	KASICH	You know, America is a miracle country.
0818	KASICH	And we have to restore the sense that the "Amiracle" will apply to you.
0819	KASICH	Each and every one of the people in this country who's watching tonight, lift everybody,
0820	SYSTEM	[ timer sounds ]
0821	KASICH	unite everybody and build a stronger United States of America again.
0822	KASICH	It will be and can be done.
0823	WALLACE	I know that all of you would like to answer this question, but we're only going to ask one other candidate before we move on to a different subject, Dr. Carson.
0824	WALLACE	Basically, same question to you.
0825	WALLACE	If Hillary Clinton is the nominee and she comes at you with that kind of line of attack, how will you take Iraq?
0826	CARSON	If Hillary is the candidate, which I doubt, that would be a dream come true.
0827	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0828	CARSON	But you know, the fact of the matter is, she is the epitome of the progressive  the secular progressive movement.
0829	CARSON	And she counts on the fact that people are uninformed, the Alinsky Model, taking advantage of useful idiots.
0830	CARSON	Well, I just happen to believe that people are not stupid.
0831	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0832	CARSON	And the way I will come at it is to educate people, help people to actually understand that it is that progressive movement that is causing them the problems.
0833	CARSON	You know, you look at the  the national debt and how it's being driven up.
0834	CARSON	If I was trying to destroy this country, what I would do is find a way to drive wedges between all the people, drive the debt to an unsustainable level, and then step off the stage as a world leader and let our enemies increase while we decreased our capacity as a military person.
0835	CARSON	And that's what she's doing.

0837	WALLACE	Gentlemen, we're going to turn now to the subject of the economy, jobs and money and the government.
0838	WALLACE	And Governor Bush, I'm going to start with you.
0839	WALLACE	You have made a bold promise in your announcement.
0840	WALLACE	You have promised four percent economic growth and 19 million new jobs if you are fortunate enough to serve two terms as president.
0841	WALLACE	That many jobs, 19 million, would be triple what your father and your brother accomplished together.
0842	WALLACE	And four percent growth, the last president to average that was Lyndon Johnson during the height of the Vietnam War.
0843	WALLACE	So question, how on Earth specifically would you pull that off?
0844	BUSH	We've done it 27 times since World War II.
0845	BUSH	I think we need to lift our spirits and have high, lofty expectations for this great country of ours.
0846	BUSH	The new normal of two percent that the left is saying you can't do anything about is so dangerous for our country.
0847	BUSH	There's 6 million people living in poverty today, more than when Barack Obama got elected.
0848	BUSH	6.5 million people are working parttime, most of whom want to work fulltime.
0849	BUSH	We've created rules and taxes on top of every aspiration of people, and the net result is we're not growing fast, income's not growing.
0850	BUSH	A four percent growth strategy means you fix a convoluted tax code.
0851	BUSH	You get in and you change every aspect of regulations that are job killers.
0852	BUSH	You get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn't suppress wages and kill jobs.

0866	WALLACE	Governor Walker, when you ran for governor of Wisconsin back in 2010, you promised that you would create 250,000 jobs in your first term, first four years.
0867	WALLACE	In fact, Wisconsin added barely half that and ranked 35th in the country in job growth.
0868	WALLACE	Now you're running for president, and you're promising an economic plan in which everyone will earn a piece of the American dream.
0869	WALLACE	Given your record in Wisconsin, why should voters believe you?
0870	WALKER	Well, the voters in Wisconsin elected me last year for the third time because they wanted someone who aimed high, not aimed low.
0871	WALKER	Before I came in, the unemployment rate was over eight percent.
0872	WALKER	It's now down to 4.6 percent.
0873	WALKER	We've more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession.
0874	WALKER	And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally.
0875	WALKER	You know, people like Hillary Clinton think you grow the economy by growing Washington.
0876	WALKER	One report last year showed that six of the top 10 wealthiest counties in America were in or around Washington, D.C..
0877	WALKER	I think most of us in America understand that people, not the government creates jobs.
0878	WALKER	And one of the best things we can do is get the government out of the way, repeal Obamacare, put in  reign in all the out of control regulations, put in place an all of the above energy policy, give people the education, the skills that the need to succeed, and lower the tax rate and reform the tax code.

0881	WALLACE	Governor Christie, I want to engage you and Governor Huckabee in a subject that is a big issue in both of your campaigns, and that is entitlement reform.
0882	WALLACE	You say that you  to save the system that you want to raise the retirement age  have to raise the retirement age, and to cut benefits for Social Security and Medicare, and you say that some of the candidates here on the stage are lying.
0883	WALLACE	Governor Huckabee says he can save Social Security and Medicare without doing any of that.
0884	WALLACE	Is he lying?
0885	CHRISTIE	No, he's not lying, he's just wrong.
0886	CHRISTIE	I mean, so, there's a difference  I'm the only guy on this stage who's put out a detailed, 12 point plan on entitlement reform and here's why  because 71% of federal spending right now is on entitlements, and debt service, 71%.
0887	CHRISTIE	And we have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29%, and no time on the 71%, and that makes no sense.
0888	CHRISTIE	Now, let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security.
0889	CHRISTIE	Yes, we'd raise the retirement age two years, and phase it in over 25 years, that means we'd raise it one month a year for 25 years when we're all living longer, and living better lives.
0890	CHRISTIE	Secondly, we would means test Social Security for those who are making over $200,000 dollars a year in retirement income, and have $4 to $5 million dollars in liquid assets saved.
0891	CHRISTIE	They don't need that Social Security check.
0892	CHRISTIE	Social Security is meant to be  to make sure that no one who's worked hard, and played by the rules, and paid into the system grows old in poverty in America.
0893	CHRISTIE	If we don't deal with this problem, it will bankrupt our country, or lead to massive tax increases, neither one that we want in this country.
0894	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0895	WALLACE	Governor Huckabee?
0896	WALLACE	You say that changing entitlements, the kind of thing that Governor Christie is talking about, would be breaking a promise to the American people, and you say that you can keep those programs, save Social Security, save Medicare, without those kinds of reforms through a FairTax, which is a broad tax on consumption.
0897	WALLACE	Please explain to Governor Christie how that would work, and how you could save these programs without the kind of painful reforms he says we need?
0898	HUCKABEE	Well, let's all be reminded, 60 million Americans are on Social Security, 60 million.
0899	HUCKABEE	A third of those people depend on 90% of their income from Social Security.
0900	HUCKABEE	Nobody in this country is on Social Security because they made the decision when they were starting work at 14 that they wanted to trust some of their money with the government.
0901	HUCKABEE	The government took it out of their check whether they wanted them to or not.
0902	HUCKABEE	And, if person goes to 65, they're going to spend 51 years with the government reaching into their pocket at every paycheck.
0903	HUCKABEE	Now, here's the point, whose fault is it that the system is screwed up?
0904	HUCKABEE	Is it the recipients, or is it the government?
0905	HUCKABEE	And, if Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don't we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare.
0906	HUCKABEE	It's always that the government figures that they can do this off the backs of people, many of whom are poor, and depend on that money, and I just think it's fundamentally lying to the people and stealing from them, and we shouldn't be doing it.

0922	WALLACE	...Alright, this is it.
0923	WALLACE	Thirty Seconds, finally.
0924	HUCKABEE	Well, you ask about how we fund it.
0925	HUCKABEE	One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage.
0926	HUCKABEE	The people who get wages is declining dramatically.
0927	HUCKABEE	Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and  and capital gains.
0928	HUCKABEE	The FairTax transforms the process by which we fund Social Security and Medicare because the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody, including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people

0937	WALLACE	Mr. Trump.

0939	KELLY	Sounds like somebody's a little Rrated.
0940	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0941	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, you talk a lot about how you are the person on this stage to grow the economy, I want to ask you about your business records.
0942	WALLACE	From corporations, Trump corporations, casinos and hotels, have declared bankruptcy four times over the last quartercentury.
0943	UNKNOWN	...In 2011, you told Forbes Magazine this "I've used the laws of the country to my advantage."
0944	UNKNOWN	But at the same time, financial experts involved in those bankruptcies say that lenders to your companies lost billions of dollars.
0945	UNKNOWN	Question sir, with that record, why should we trust you to run the nation's business?
0946	TRUMP	Because I have used the laws of this country just like the greatest people that you read about every day in business have used the laws of this country, the chapter laws, to do a great job for my company, for myself, for my employees, for my family, et cetera.
0947	TRUMP	I have never gone bankrupt, by the way.
0948	TRUMP	I have never.
0949	TRUMP	But out of hundreds of deals...
0950	WALLACE	No, but the concept sir...
0951	TRUMP	Excuse me.
0952	TRUMP	Excuse me.
0953	WALLACE	... that's your line, but your companies have gone bankrupt.
0954	TRUMP	Excuse me, what am I saying?
0955	TRUMP	Out of hundreds of deals that I've done, hundreds, on four occasions I've taken advantage of the laws of this country, like other people.
0956	TRUMP	I'm not going to name their names because I'm not going to embarrass, but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they've used the law.
0957	TRUMP	The difference is, when somebody else uses those laws, nobody writes about it.
0958	TRUMP	When I use it, they say, "Trump, Trump, Trump."
0959	TRUMP	The fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion.
0960	TRUMP	I have a great, great company.
0961	TRUMP	I employ thousands of people.
0962	TRUMP	And I'm very proud of the job I did.
0963	TRUMP	Again Chris, hundreds and hundreds of deals.
0964	TRUMP	Four times, I've taken advantage of the laws.
0965	TRUMP	And frankly, so has everybody else in my position.
0966	WALLACE	Well sir, let's just talk about the latest example...
0967	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0968	WALLACE	...which is Trump Entertainment Resorts, which went bankrupt in 2009.
0969	WALLACE	In that case alone, lenders to your company lost over $1 billion and more than 1,100 people were laid off.
0970	TRUMP	Well, I...
0971	WALLACE	Is that the way that you'd run the country?
0972	TRUMP	Let me just tell you about the lenders.
0973	TRUMP	First of all, these lenders aren't babies.
0974	TRUMP	These are total killers.
0975	TRUMP	These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, OK?
0976	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
0977	TRUMP	You know, I mean you're living in a world of the makebelieve, Chris, you want to know the truth.

0979	TRUMP	And I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City, which by the way, Caesars just went bankrupt.
0980	TRUMP	Every company, Chris can tell you, every company virtually in Atlantic City went bankrupt.
0981	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0982	TRUMP	Every company.
0983	TRUMP	And let me just tell you.
0984	TRUMP	I had the good sense, and I've gotten a lot of credit in the financial pages, seven years ago I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered, and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City, and I'm very proud of it.
0985	TRUMP	I want to tell you that.
0986	TRUMP	Very, very proud of it.
0987	WALLACE	So...
0988	TRUMP	And by the way, this country right now owes $19 trillion.
0989	TRUMP	And they need somebody like me to straighten out that mess.

0991	WALLACE	Senator Rubio.
0992	WALLACE	Senator Rubio, more than 3,000 people sent us questions about the economy and jobs on Facebook.
0993	WALLACE	And here is a video question from Tania Cioloko from Philadelphia.
0994	WALLACE	Here she is.
0995	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
0996	QUESTION	Please describe one action you would do to make the economic environment more favorable for small businesses and entrepreneurs and anyone dreaming of opening their own business.
0997	SYSTEM	[ close video clip ]
0998	RUBIO	That's a great question.
0999	WALLACE	Senator, how do you answer Tania?
1000	RUBIO	That's a great question.
1001	RUBIO	First of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago.
1002	RUBIO	It's an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world.
1003	RUBIO	Now, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about, they're the ones that are struggling.
1004	RUBIO	The first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses.
1005	RUBIO	We need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy.
1006	RUBIO	We need to repeal and replace Obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs.
1007	RUBIO	And last but not least, we need to repeal DoddFrank.
1008	RUBIO	It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks.
1009	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1010	RUBIO	20  over 40 percent of small and midsize banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out over the  since DoddFrank has passed.
1011	RUBIO	We need to repeal and replace DoddFrank.
1012	RUBIO	We need to make America fair again for all businesses, but especially those being run by small business owners.
1013	WALLACE	Senator Rubio, thank you.
1014	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1015	BAIER	Gentlemen, another question for a few of you.
1016	BAIER	Yesterday, just yesterday, President Obama criticized Republican lawmakers trying to block the Iran deal, calling them kneejerk partisans, adding that hardliners in Iran who chant "death to America" were, quote, "making common cause with the Republican caucus."
1017	BAIER	Here's what two of your opponents on the 5 p.m. debate stage said about Iran.
1018	SYSTEM	[ video clip begins ]
1019	PERRY	I will tell you one thing I would whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.
1020	PERRY	Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.
1021	PERRY	But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but hell no, to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror...
1022	SYSTEM	[ video clip ends ]
1023	SYSTEM	[ video clip begins ]
1024	FIORINA	When America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.
1025	FIORINA	This is a bad deal.
1026	FIORINA	Obama broke every rule of negotiation.
1027	FIORINA	Yes, our allies are not perfect, but Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxy.
1028	SYSTEM	[ video clip ends ]
1029	BAIER	Now, I wanna ask a few of you this.
1030	BAIER	First, Governor Walker.
1031	BAIER	You've said that you would tear up the Iran deal on day one.
1032	BAIER	If this deal is undone, what then?
1033	WALKER	Well, first off, let's remember.
1034	WALKER	I still remember, as a kid, tying a yellow ribbon around a tree in front of my house during the 444 days that Iran held 52 Americans hostage.
1035	WALKER	Iran is not a place we should be doing business with.
1036	WALKER	To me, you terminate the deal on day one, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same.
1037	WALKER	This is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS.
1038	WALKER	It is tied together, and, once and for all, we need a leader who's gonna stand up and do something about it.
1039	WALKER	It's yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the ObamaClinton doctrine.
1040	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1041	BAIER	Senator Paul, would you tear up the deal on day one?
1042	PAUL	I oppose the Iranian deal, and will vote against it.
1043	PAUL	I don't think that the president negotiated from a position of strength, but I don't immediately discount negotiations.
1044	PAUL	I'm a Reagan conservative.
1045	PAUL	Reagan did negotiate with the Soviets.
1046	PAUL	But you have to negotiate from a position of strength, and I think President Obama gave away too much, too early.
1047	PAUL	If there's going to be a negotiation, you're going to have to believe somehow that the Iranians are going to comply.
1048	PAUL	And I asked this question to John Kerry, I said "do you believe they're trustworthy?"
1049	PAUL	and he said "No."
1050	PAUL	And I said, "well, how are we gonna get them to comply?"
1051	PAUL	I would have never released the sanctions before there was consistent evidence of compliance.
1052	BAIER	Governor Huckabee, what do you think about what Senator Paul just said?
1053	HUCKABEE	Ronald Reagan said "trust, but verify."
1054	HUCKABEE	President Obama is "trust, but vilify."
1055	HUCKABEE	He trusts our enemies and vilifies everyone who disagrees with him.
1056	HUCKABEE	And the reason we disagree with him has nothing to do with party.
1057	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1058	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1059	HUCKABEE	It has to do with the incredibly dangerous place that this world is gonna be as a result of a deal in which we got nothing.
1060	HUCKABEE	We didn't even get four hostages out.
1061	HUCKABEE	We got nothing, and Iran gets everything they want.
1062	HUCKABEE	We said we would have anywhere, anytime negotiations and inspections, we gave that up.
1063	HUCKABEE	We said that we would make sure that they didn't have any nuclear capacity, we gave that up.
1064	HUCKABEE	The president can't tell us what we got.
1065	HUCKABEE	I'll tell you what the world got.
1066	HUCKABEE	The world has a burgeoning nuclear power that didn't, as the Soviets, say "we might defend ourselves in a war."
1067	HUCKABEE	What the Iranians have said is, "we will wipe Israel off the face of the map, and we will bring death to America."
1068	HUCKABEE	When someone points a gun at your head

1077	KELLY	Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York just said yesterday those exceptions are preposterous.
1078	KELLY	He said they discriminate against an entire class of human beings.
1079	KELLY	If you believe that life begins at conception, as you say you do, how do you justify ending a life just because it begins violently, through no fault of the baby?
1080	RUBIO	Well, Megyn, first of all, I'm not sure that that's a correct assessment of my record.
1081	RUBIO	I would go on to add that I believe all
1082	KELLY	You don't favor a rape and incest exception?
1083	RUBIO	I have never said that.
1084	RUBIO	And I have never advocated that.
1085	RUBIO	What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection.
1086	RUBIO	In fact, I think that law already exists.
1087	RUBIO	It is called the Constitution of the United States.
1088	SYSTEM	[ applause ]

1106	TRUMP	And you know who else has?
1107	TRUMP	Is Ronald Reagan evolved on many issues.
1108	TRUMP	And I am prolife.
1109	TRUMP	And if you look at the question, I was in business.
1110	TRUMP	They asked me a question as to prolife or choice.
1111	TRUMP	And I said if you let it run, that I hate the concept of abortion.
1112	TRUMP	I hate the concept of abortion.
1113	TRUMP	And then since then, I've very much evolved.
1114	TRUMP	And what happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted.
1115	TRUMP	And it wasn't aborted.
1116	TRUMP	And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child.
1117	TRUMP	And I saw that.
1118	TRUMP	And I saw other instances.
1119	TRUMP	And I am very, very proud to say that I am prolife.
1120	TRUMP	As far as being a Republican is concerned, I come from a place, New York City, which is virtually, I mean, it is almost exclusively Democrat.
1121	TRUMP	And I have really started to see some of the negatives  as an example, and I have a lot of liking for this man, but the last number of months of

1127	KELLY	Governor Bush, I want to ask you, on the subject of name calling of your fellow candidates, a story appeared today quoting an anonymous GOP donor who said you called Mr. Trump a clown, a buffoon, something else that cannot be repeated on television.
1128	BUSH	None of which is true.
1129	KELLY	Is it true?
1130	BUSH	No.
1131	BUSH	It's not true.
1132	BUSH	But I have said that Mr. Trump's language is divisive.
1133	BUSH	I want to win.
1134	BUSH	I want one of these people here or the ones at 500, to be the next president of the United States.
1135	BUSH	We're not going on win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do each and every day.
1136	BUSH	Dividing the country.
1137	BUSH	Saying, creating a grievance kind of environment.
1138	BUSH	We're going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message.
1139	BUSH	I have that message because I was a governor of a state that saw people lifted up, because we had high sustained economic growth.
1140	BUSH	Our economy grew at double the rate of the nation.
1141	BUSH	We created 1.3 million jobs.
1142	BUSH	We led the nation seven out of those eight years.
1143	BUSH	We were only one of two states that went to AAA bond rating.
1144	BUSH	I cut taxes, $19 billion.
1145	BUSH	If you do that and apply conservative principles the right way, you create an environment where everybody rises up.
1146	BUSH	That's how we're going to win.
1147	BUSH	Campaigning in places to give people hope that their life is better because too many people are suffering today in America.

1161	KASICH	Well, look, I'm an oldfashioned person here, and I happen to believe in traditional marriage.

1165	KASICH	And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay.
1166	KASICH	Because somebody doesn't think the way I do, doesn't mean that I can't care about them or can't love them.
1167	KASICH	So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them.

1180	KELLY	Quote what will you do to ensure Christians are not prosecuted for speaking out against gay marriage and will Christians be forced to conduct business that conflicts with their religious beliefs?
1181	PAUL	Look, I don't want my marriage or my guns registered in Washington.
1182	PAUL	And if people have an opinion, it's a religious opinion that is heartly felt, obviously they should be allowed to practice that and no government should interfere with them.
1183	PAUL	One of the things, one of the things that really got to me was the thing in Houston where you had the government, the mayor actually, trying to get the sermons of ministers.
1184	PAUL	When the government tries to invade the church to enforce its own opinion on marriage, that's when it's time to resist.
1185	KELLY	Governor Walker, many in the Black Lives Matter movement, and beyond, believe that overlyaggressive police officers targeting young African Americans is the civil rights issue of our time.
1186	KELLY	Do you agree?
1187	KELLY	And if so, how do you plan to address it?
1188	KELLY	And if not, why not?
1189	WALKER	Well, I think the most important thing we can do when it comes to policing  it's something you've had a guest on who's a friend of mine Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clark, who's talked to me about this many times in the past  it's about training.
1190	WALKER	It's about making sure that law enforcement professionals, not only in the way in to their positions but all the way through their time, have the proper training, particularly when it comes to the use of force.
1191	WALKER	And that we protect and stand up and support those men and women who are doing their jobs in law enforcement.
1192	WALKER	And for the very few that don't, that there are consequences to show that we treat everyone the same here in America.
1193	KELLY	Thank you.

1198	BAIER	Our next topic is foreign policy.
1199	BAIER	Candidates, you may not have seen the late developing news today our Fox Pentagon team broke earlier this evening about a top Iranian general traveling to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
1200	BAIER	His name is General Qassem Soleimani, he's blamed for hundreds of U.S. troop's deaths in Iraq, and Afghanistan.
1201	BAIER	His trip to Russia appears to directly violate U.N. Security Council resolutions to confine him to Iran.
1202	BAIER	So, Mr. Trump, if you were president, how would you respond to this?
1203	TRUMP	I would be so different from what you have right now.
1204	TRUMP	Like, the polar opposite.
1205	TRUMP	We have a president who doesn't have a clue.
1206	TRUMP	I would say he's incompetent, but I don't want to do that because that's not nice.

1227	BAIER	Senator Cruz, in your view, have Russia and China committed acts of cyber war, and if you were president, what would you do about it?
1228	CRUZ	Well, Bret, of course they have, and over the last six and a half years we've seen the consequences of the ObamaClinton foreign policy.
1229	CRUZ	Leading from behind is a disaster.
1230	CRUZ	We have abandoned and alienated our friends and allies, and our enemies are stronger.
1231	CRUZ	Radical Islam is on the rise, Iran's on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon, China is waging cyber warfare against America, Russia  General Soleimani, you just mentioned, the Iranian general is the head of the al Quds forces.
1232	CRUZ	He's directly responsible for the murder of over 500 American servicemen in Iraq, and part of this Iranian deal was lifting the international sanctions on General Soleimani.
1233	CRUZ	The day General Soleimani flew back from Moscow to Iran was the day we believed that Russia used cyber warfare against the Joint Chiefs.
1234	CRUZ	We need a new commander in chief that will stand up to our enemies, and that will have credibility...
1235	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1236	CRUZ	It is worth emphasizing that Iran released our hostages in 1981 the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.

1238	BAIER	Dr. Carson, in August of 2012 President Obama famously declared Syrian President Bashar alAssad used chemical weapons, quote, "that's a redline for us," and that there would be enormous consequences.
1239	BAIER	One year later, with overwhelming evidence the Assad had, in fact, used chemical weapons and crossed that red line, President Obama declined to use military force against the Assad regime.
1240	BAIER	As president, would you have used military force there?
1241	CARSON	Well, what we have to stop and think about is that we have weakened ourselves militarily to such an extent that if affects all of our military policies.
1242	CARSON	Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1917 our Air Force, since 1940.
1243	CARSON	In recent testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps said half of the nondeployed units were not ready and you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel.
1244	CARSON	Our generals are retiring because they don't want to be part of this, and at the same time, our enemies are increasing.
1245	CARSON	Our  our friends can't trust us anymore.
1246	CARSON	You know, Ukraine was a nucleararmed state.
1247	CARSON	They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them.
1248	CARSON	We won't even give them offensive weapons.
1249	CARSON	You know, we turned our back on Israel, our ally.
1250	CARSON	You know, in a situation like that, of course Obama's not going to be able to do anything.
1251	CARSON	I would shore up our military first, because if you don't get the military right, nothing else is going to work.
1252	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1253	BAIER	Governor Walker, as president, what would you do if Russian President Vladimir Putin started a campaign to destabilize NATO allies Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, mirroring the actions Putin took at the early days of Ukraine?
1254	WALKER	Well first off, for the cyber attack with Russia the other day, it's sad to think right now, but probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clinton's email server than do the members of the United States Congress.
1255	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
1256	WALKER	And  and that has put our national security at risk.
1257	WALKER	If I am president, he won't think about that.
1258	WALKER	You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage you probe with bayonets.
1259	WALKER	When you find mush, you push.
1260	WALKER	When you find steel, you stop.
1261	WALKER	Under Obama and Clinton, we found a lot of mush over the last two years.
1262	WALKER	We need to have a national security that puts steel in front of our enemies.
1263	WALKER	I would send weapons to Ukraine.
1264	WALKER	I would work with NATO to put forces on the eastern border of Poland and the Baltic nations, and I would reinstate, put in place back in the missile defense system that we had in Poland and in the Czech Republic.
1265	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1266	WALKER	We find steel.
1267	BAIER	Governor  Governor Huckabee, the culture of the American military is definitely changing.
1268	BAIER	Women are moving into combat roles.
1269	BAIER	Don't Ask, Don't Tell has obviously been dropped.
1270	BAIER	And now Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently directed the military to prepare for a moment when it is welcoming transgender persons to serve openly.
1271	BAIER	As commander in chief, how would you handle that?
1272	HUCKABEE	The military is not a social experiment.
1273	HUCKABEE	The purpose of the military is kill people and break things.
1274	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1275	HUCKABEE	It's not to transform the culture by trying out some ideas that some people think would make us a different country and more diverse.
1276	HUCKABEE	The purpose is to protect America.
1277	HUCKABEE	I'm not sure how paying for transgender surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines makes our country safer.
1278	HUCKABEE	We've reduced the military by 25 percent...
1279	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1280	HUCKABEE	... under President Obama.
1281	HUCKABEE	The disaster is that we've forgotten why we have a military.
1282	HUCKABEE	The purpose of it is to make sure that we protect every American, wherever that American is, and if an American is calling out for help, whether it's in Benghazi or at the border, then we ought to be able to answer it.
1283	HUCKABEE	We've not done that because we've decimated our military.
1284	HUCKABEE	We're flying B52s.
1285	HUCKABEE	The most recent one that was put in service was November of 1962.
1286	HUCKABEE	A lot of the B52s we're flying, we've only got 44 that are in service combat ready, and the fact is, most of them are older than me.
1287	HUCKABEE	And that's pretty scary.
1288	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
1289	BAIER	Senator Paul, the first budget you proposed as senator cut all financial aid to Israel.
1290	BAIER	You have since changed your view on that issue.
1291	BAIER	What made you change your mind.
1292	PAUL	Well, let's be clear, I'm the only one on the stage who actually has a fiveyear budget that balances.
1293	PAUL	I've put pencil to paper...
1294	UNKNOWN	I do.
1295	PAUL	... and I've said  and I've said I would cut spending, and I've said exactly where.
1296	PAUL	Each one of my budgets has taken a meat axe to foreign aid, because I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that hate us.
1297	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1298	PAUL	I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that burn our flag.
1299	PAUL	Israel is not one of those.
1300	PAUL	But even Benjamin Netanyahu said that ultimately, they will be stronger when they're independent.
1301	PAUL	My position is exactly the same.
1302	PAUL	We shouldn't borrow money from China to send it anywhere, but why don't we start with eliminating aid to our enemies.
1303	BAIER	OK.
1304	BAIER	But you still say that Israel could be one of the countries that is cut from financial aid?
1305	PAUL	I still say exactly what my original opinion is.
1306	PAUL	Do you borrow money from China to send it to anyone?
1307	PAUL	Out of your surplus, you can help your allies, and Israel is a great ally.
1308	PAUL	And this is no particular animus of Israel, but what I will say, and I will say over and over again, we cannot give away money we don't have.
1309	PAUL	We do not project power from bankruptcy court.
1310	PAUL	We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
1311	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1312	PAUL	It's got to stop somewhere.
1313	BAIER	Governor Christie, what do you think of that answer?
1314	CHRISTIE	Well, listen.
1315	CHRISTIE	You know, if we want to deal with these issues, we have to deal with them in a way that makes sense.
1316	CHRISTIE	I agree with what Dr. Carson said earlier.
1317	CHRISTIE	The first thing we need to do to make America stronger is to strengthen our military, and I put out a really specific plan no less than 500,000 active duty soldiers in the Army.
1318	CHRISTIE	No less than 185,000 active duty marines in the Marine Corps.
1319	CHRISTIE	Bring us to a 350 ship Navy again, and modernize the Ohio class of submarines, and bring our Air Force back to 2,600 aircraft that are ready to go.
1320	CHRISTIE	Those are the kind of things that are going to send a clear message around the world.
1321	CHRISTIE	Those are the things that we need to start working on immediately to make our country stronger and make it better.
1322	CHRISTIE	Those are the things that we need to be able to be doing.
1323	CHRISTIE	And as we move towards dealing with foreign aid, I don't disagree with Senator Paul's position that we shouldn't be funding our enemies.
1324	CHRISTIE	But I absolutely believe that Israel is a priority to be able to fund and keep them strong and safe after eight years of this administration.

1329	KELLY	We have to stand you by, because after the break, we're going to let the candidates make their closing statements, their final thoughts, and . . .
1330	KELLY	God.
1331	KELLY	Stay tuned for that.
1332	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
1333	KELLY	Welcome back.
1334	KELLY	In our final moments here together, we're going to allow the candidates to offer their final thoughts.
1335	KELLY	But first, we want to ask them an interesting closing question from Chase Norton on Facebook, who wants to know this of the candidates "I want to know if any of them have received a word from God on what they should do and take care of first."
1336	KELLY	Senator Cruz, start from you.
1337	KELLY	Any word from God?
1338	CRUZ	Well, I am blessed to receive a word from God every day in receiving the scriptures and reading the scriptures.
1339	CRUZ	And God speaks through the Bible.
1340	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1341	CRUZ	I'm the son of a pastor and evangelist and I've described many times how my father, when I was a child, was an alcoholic.
1342	CRUZ	He wasn't a Christian.
1343	CRUZ	And my father left my mother and left me when I was just three years old.
1344	CRUZ	And someone invited him to Clay Road Baptist Church.
1345	CRUZ	And he gave his heart to Jesus and it turned him around.
1346	CRUZ	And he got on a plane and he flew back to my mother and me.
1347	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1348	CRUZ	I would also note that the scripture tells us, "you shall know them by their fruit."
1349	CRUZ	We see lots of "campaign conservatives."
1350	CRUZ	But if we're going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative, someone who has been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative.
1351	CRUZ	There are real differences among the candidates on issues like amnesty, like Obamacare, like religious liberty, like life and marriage.
1352	CRUZ	And I have been proud to fight and stand for religious liberty, to stand against Planned Parenthood, to defend life for my entire career.
1353	CRUZ	And I will be proud to continue to do so as president of the United States.
1354	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
1355	KELLY	Governor Kasich, same question.
1356	KASICH	Well, Megyn, my father was a mailman.
1357	KASICH	His father was a coal miner.
1358	KASICH	My mother's mother could barely speak English.
1359	KASICH	And their son today stands on this podium in the great state of Ohio not only as the governor, but a candidate for president of the United States.
1360	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
1361	KASICH	I do believe in miracles.
1362	KASICH	You know, I've had a lot of elections.
1363	KASICH	But my elections are really not about campaigns.
1364	KASICH	I tell my people that these are about a movement.
1365	KASICH	And a movement to do what?
1366	KASICH	To restore common sense.
1367	KASICH	A movement to do things like provide economic growth.
1368	KASICH	And a movement not to let anybody be behind.
1369	KASICH	You know, today the country is divided.
1370	KASICH	You asked a question about the police and the difficulty in communities.
1371	KASICH	We've got to unite our country again, because we're stronger when we are united and we are weaker when we are divided.
1372	KASICH	And we've got to listen to other people's voices, respect them, but keep in mind, and I believe in terms of the things that I've read in my lifetime, the Lord'is not picking us.
1373	KASICH	But because of how we respect human rights, because that we are a good force in the world, he wants America to be strong.
1374	KASICH	He wants America to succeed.
1375	KASICH	And he wants America to lead.
1376	KASICH	And nothing is more important to me than my family, my faith, and my friends.

1378	KELLY	Governor Walker, same question.
1379	WALKER	Well, thanks, Megyn.
1380	WALKER	I'm certainly an imperfect man.
1381	WALKER	And it's only by the blood of Jesus Christ that I've been redeemed from my sins.
1382	WALKER	So I know that God doesn't call me to do a specific thing, God hasn't given me a list, a Ten Commandments, if you will, of things to act on the first day.
1383	WALKER	What God calls us to do is follow his will.
1384	WALKER	And ultimately that's what I'm going to try to do.
1385	WALKER	And I hope people've seen it in my state, even in the big challenges I took on when I had over 100,000 protesters in and around our capital, trying to do what I thought was the right thing.
1386	WALKER	It wasn't just how I took on those political battles.
1387	WALKER	It was ultimately how I acted.
1388	WALKER	Not responding in kind.
1389	WALKER	Not lashing out.
1390	WALKER	But just being decent going forward and living my life in a way that would be a testimony to him and our faith.

1392	KELLY	Senator Rubio, I want to ask you the same question.
1393	KELLY	But I do want to mention, a woman just came here to the stage and asked, what about the veterans?
1394	KELLY	I want to hear more about what these candidates are going to do for our nation's veterans.
1395	KELLY	So I put the question to you about God and the veterans, which you may find to be related.
1396	RUBIO	Well, first, let me say I think God has blessed us.
1397	RUBIO	He has blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates.
1398	RUBIO	The Democrats can't even find one.
1399	RUBIO	[
1400	RUBIO	laughter ]
1401	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
1402	RUBIO	And I believe God has blessed our country.
1403	RUBIO	This country has been extraordinarily blessed.
1404	RUBIO	And we have honored that blessing.
1405	RUBIO	And that's why God has continued to bless us.
1406	RUBIO	And he has blessed us with young men and women willing to risk their lives and sometimes die in uniform for the safety and security of our people.
1407	RUBIO	Unfortunately today we have a VA that does not do enough for them.
1408	RUBIO	I am proud that last year we helped change the law.
1409	RUBIO	We changed the law to give the power to the VA secretary the ability to fire any executive that isn't doing their job.
1410	RUBIO	And it is outrageous they've only fired one person to date.
1411	RUBIO	When I'm president of the United States, we're going to have a VA that cares more about our veterans than about the bureaucrats who work at the VA.
1412	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
1413	KELLY	Dr. Carson, a question to you about God and his role, but also, one of the issues that the public was very interested in, and we touched on it earlier, is race relations in this country, and how divided we seem right now.
1414	KELLY	And what, if anything, you can do  you would do as the next president to help heal that divide.
1415	CARSON	Well, I think the bully pulpit is a wonderful place to start healing that divide.
1416	CARSON	You know, we have the purveyors of hatred who take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it, and drive wedges into people.
1417	CARSON	And this does not need to be done.
1418	CARSON	What we need to think about instead  you know, I was asked by an NPR reporter once, why don't I talk about race that often.
1419	CARSON	I said it's because I'm a neurosurgeon.
1420	CARSON	And she thought that was a strange response.
1421	CARSON	And you say  I said, you see, when I take someone to the operating room, I'm actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are.
1422	CARSON	The skin doesn't make them who they are.
1423	CARSON	The hair doesn't make them who they are.
1424	CARSON	And it's time for us to move beyond that.
1425	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1426	CARSON	Because...
1427	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1428	CARSON	...our strength as a nation comes in our unity.
1429	CARSON	We are the United States of America, not the divided states.

1435	KASICH	You know, tonight we hear about what people want to do.
1436	KASICH	I want to tell you what I've done.
1437	KASICH	I was a member of the Armed Services Committee for 18 years.
1438	KASICH	I spent a big chunk of my life studying national security issues and our role in the world.
1439	KASICH	No.
1440	KASICH	2.
1441	KASICH	I was the chairman of the House Budget Committee and one of the chief architects the last time we balanced a budget, and it was the first time we had done it since man walked on the moon.
1442	KASICH	We had a $5 trillion surplus and we cut taxes.
1443	KASICH	I spent ten years in the private sector, actually learning how business works.
1444	KASICH	And now I'm the governor of Ohio, and I inherited a state that was on the brink
1445	SYSTEM	[ timer sounds ]
1446	KASICH	of dying.
1447	KASICH	And we turned it all around with jobs and balanced budgets and rising credit and tax cuts, and the state is unified, and people have hope again in Ohio.

1453	CHRISTIE	Was the first person to graduate from college.
1454	CHRISTIE	He put himself through college at night.
1455	CHRISTIE	My mom was a secretary.
1456	CHRISTIE	I was appointed United States attorney on September 10, 2001.
1457	CHRISTIE	And I spent the next seven years of my career fighting terrorism and putting terrorists in jail.
1458	CHRISTIE	I'm a conservative, prolife governor in a state where it is really tough to be both.
1459	CHRISTIE	A state like New Jersey, with lots of Democrats, but still we cut taxes, we balanced budgets.
1460	CHRISTIE	We fought

1462	CHRISTIE	the teacher's union.
1463	CHRISTIE	This president has had weak leadership, which has led to bad choices.

1482	RUBIO	Here in this country, they never made it big, but the very purpose of their life was to give us the chance to do all the things they never could.
1483	RUBIO	My father was a bartender.
1484	RUBIO	And the journey from the back of that bar to this stage tonight, to me, that is the essence of the American dream.
1485	RUBIO	It is what makes our nation different.
1486	RUBIO	And I'm running for president because I want that to still be possible for the people trying to do that now.
1487	RUBIO	I run for president because I believe that we can't just save the American dream we can expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before.
1488	RUBIO	And that's why I'm asking for your vote.
