During a Feb. 3 appearance on Channel 12\u2019s \"Newsmakers,\" Chafee pointed to the negative effects of an increasing reliance on property taxes in Rhode Island\u2019s economically distressed communities -- Central Falls, West Warwick, Pawtucket and, of course, Providence.\n\n\"And no wonder there\u2019s empty stores in Providence,\" he said. \"The commercial property tax is second highest in the country behind Detroit.\"\n\nThe issue of property taxes has come to the fore in Providence with the ongoing fight between the financially struggling city and its tax-exempt nonprofits. Providence leans heavily on tax payments from businesses and residents to raise revenue. But is the city\u2019s commercial property tax really the nation\u2019s second highest?\n\nChafee\u2019s spokeswoman referred us to a report released last month by a financial panel advising Providence. The report, \"A System Out of Balance,\" from the Commission on Revenue, Sustainability and Efficiency, recommended a series of changes to raise money for the city, including higher sales tax receipts, more state aid and larger contributions from Providence\u2019s nine colleges and hospitals.\n\nTo put the issue in context, the report included a comparison of commercial property tax burdens in Providence and other major cities across the country, taken from a joint study in 2010 by the nonpartisan Minnesota Taxpayers Association and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit think-tank.\n\nThe \"50-State Property Tax Comparison Study,\" which has been done periodically since 1995, examines property taxes across the country in three ways: by comparing taxes in the largest city in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the second-largest cities in Illinois and New York \u00a0because Chicago and New York City have such idiosyncratic tax systems (so 53 cities in all); by comparing taxes in the 50 largest cities by population in the country; and by comparing the taxes in a single rural community in each of the 50 states.\n\nProvidence was considered among the first group of 53 cities. It did indeed rank second for the highest commercial property taxes, behind only Detroit. Des Moines was third, Philadelphia fourth and New York City fifth.\n\nAccording to the study, for a commercial property valued at $1 million and with $200,000 in fixtures, the net property taxes in Providence would be $47,695 a year. The effective tax rate, which factors in statutory exemptions and assessment practices, would be 3.975 percent.\n\nThe same property in Detroit would pay $48,141 for a rate of 4.012 percent. In contrast, that property in Cheyenne, Wyo., which ranked 53rd in the study, would pay $7,824 under a 0.652-percent rate.\n\nProvidence is not included in the second group of the 50 largest cities in the country. (With 178,042 people, Rhode Island\u2019s capital ranks 131st, according to the 2010 census.) If it were, it would still be second for commercial property taxes, again behind Detroit.\n\nIf Providence were included in the third group of rural communities, it would rank second for commercial property taxes, behind Iola, Kan.\n\nProvidence has moved up the list as its financial crisis has deepened in recent years: in 2007, the city ranked 16th for commercial property taxes. In 2009, it ranked sixth. It moved to second in 2010.\n\nSo Providence does have the second-highest commercial property taxes in the most recent 50-state study. But although that study is certainly comprehensive, it is not exhaustive. It did not look at every city in the country. We looked for more research.\n\nOur first call was to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group based in Washington, D.C., that does state-by-state comparisons of tax issues. Joseph Henchman, director of state projects, referred us to a draft report that compared the tax burdens that identical hypothetical corporations would have in about 100 U.S. cities. (The study looked at two cities in most states; it looked at only one city in Rhode Island and other small states.)\n\nIn that study, which has yet to be released, Providence would have the third-highest commercial property taxes for a corporate headquarters, according to Henchman, behind Des Moines and Columbia, S.C.\n\n\"It\u2019s looking like no matter how you do it, Rhode Island is not coming up real good,\" said Henchman.\n\nOur ruling\n\nChafee said that Providence has the second-highest commercial property tax in the nation, citing a City of \u00a0Providence report that cites the Minnesota report. Neither report makes that definitive claim.\n\nBut the Minnesota report does say Providence is second highest in its comparison of 53 cities. And if Providence were included in comparisons of the nation\u2019s largest cities, it would also rank second.\n\nA Tax Foundation study ranks Providence third for commercial property taxes by one measurement, but different ways of comparing tax burdens could account for the difference.\n\nIt\u2019s possible there are other cities with higher commercial property taxes, but we couldn\u2019t find any.\n\nAlthough Chafee went a step too far in saying definitively that Providence\u2019s commercial property tax is the second-highest in the country, there is ample evidence to support his statement and little that contradicts it.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.
