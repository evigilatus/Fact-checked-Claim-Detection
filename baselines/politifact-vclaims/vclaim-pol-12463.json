This research has prompted us to revise downward our rating of Paul\u2019s claim to Half True.\n\nInterviews and news articles confirm that Perry was among 28 Democratic legislators who endorsed Gore for president in January 1988. But there\u2019s no proof he led or ran Gore\u2019s campaign in Texas. It appears that a Democratic opponent slapped various Gore campaign leadership labels on Perry in a 1998 election year and, partly because Perry did not dispute them, the descriptives stuck.\n\nFor archival purposes, though, the article below retains the text of our original Paul fact check, which was published Aug. 15, 2011.\n\nU.S. Rep. Ron Paul told a gathering in Iowa the other day that he wasn\u2019t worried about his chances if fellow Texan. Rick Perry joined the Republican presidential race.\n\nAs caught on video by a San Francisco Chronicle reporter, Paul said Aug. 10 in Mason City that Perry\u2019s candidacy \"probably will help us, because he\u2019ll just further dilute the establishment vote. He\u2019s part of the status quo.\" Paul also said Perry\u2019s gubernatorial record doesn\u2019t show him to be a conservative. He added that Perry \"actually was the chairman for Al Gore at one time, not too many years ago.\"\n\nGov. Perry for Gore, the former Democratic vice president, not so long ago?\n\nIndeed, as we noted in a 2010 fact check, when Perry was still a Democrat, he was the Texas state chairman for Gore's presidential campaign in 1988, the year before he switched parties in anticipation of running for state agriculture commissioner in 1990.\n\nWhat brought Perry to pitch in for Gore, whose candidacy washed out after the Tennessee senator failed to do well outside his native South? At the time, many conservative Texas Democrats put stock in Gore\u2019s campaign, among them former Gov. Dolph Briscoe and then-House Speaker Gib Lewis, who flew to Washington to endorse Gore.\n\nLater, Perry said he found out Gore was far from a real conservative. \"Going through that (Gore experience) was part of what started me through the process of changing parties,\" Perry said. \"I came to my senses.\"\n\nIn the Texas primary, Gore ran third to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.\n\nIn late 2009, Perry revisited his disagreement with Gore over the human impact on global warming. Suggesting he'd seen the light on the climate issue while Gore had drifted into darker territory, Perry joked: \"I certainly got religion. I think he's gone to hell.\"\n\nDon\u2019t count on the two to be joined in a cause again.\n\nPer Paul\u2019s comment, Ryan J. Rusak of The Dallas Morning News wondered in an Aug. 11 blog post if it\u2019s fair to say Perry was Gore\u2019s chairman \"not too many years ago.\" Rusak wrote: \"Is 23 years really \u2018not too many years ago?\u2019 When you're about to celebrate (your) 76th birthday, as Dr. Paul is next week, I suppose not. But in politics, it's a lifetime, no?\"\n\nIt was more than two decades ago. For that reason, we rate Paul\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.
