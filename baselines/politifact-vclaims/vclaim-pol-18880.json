U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood, however, was not one of them. Asked during a TV appearance to explain why he voted against the measure, LaHood questioned the need for that financial support.\n\"The post office right now, this year, is operating with about a $12 billion surplus,\" he said on WTTW\u2019s \"Chicago Tonight\" Aug. 24 broadcast. \"The money isn\u2019t necessary to get us through the election. That\u2019s been a political football.\"\nHis assertions come as the Trump administration is taking heat for removing hundreds of sorting machines and yanking mailboxes in the walk up to an election that will rely on the postal service more than any other election in the country's history.\nUSPS says it has \"ample capacity\" to handle an influx of mail-in ballots this fall. But the agency\u2019s shaky financial footing is a well-known and longstanding problem: USPS hasn\u2019t recorded a profit in any year since 2006 and saw a net loss of $2.2 billion in the most recent fiscal quarter. So we decided to find out what LaHood was talking about when he said the agency was running a surplus.\n\"He was referring to the fact that the USPS had almost $13 billion cash on hand, as of June 30th,\" LaHood spokesman John Rauber wrote in an email, echoing a point made in the White House\u2019s statement of administration policy opposing the bill. That figure is backed up by USPS\u2019 latest quarterly report.\nCash on hand \u2014 or unrestricted cash, as the agency calls it \u2014 is not a surplus by any definition, according to experts. Instead, it refers to the amount of money the agency has in the bank at a given time. The USPS reports its net income \u2014 also known as a profit \u2014 or net loss at the end of each fiscal period, in accordance with accepted accounting standards.\nReferring to cash on hand as a surplus \"doesn\u2019t make sense,\" said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn McCain\n\n\nstated on March 21, 2007 in Oklahoma City.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The failings in our civil service are encouraged by a system that makes it very difficult to fire someone even for gross misconduct.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Angie Drobnic Holan \u2022 September 1, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The word \u2018surplus\u2019 suggests that the Postal Service\u2019s revenues exceed its expenses,\" he said. \"They don\u2019t. The Postal Service has been operating at a loss \u2014 certified by independent accountants and reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 since 2007.\"\nIn the last fiscal year, USPS brought in just over $71 billion in revenue. But it also shelled out nearly $80 billion to pay its carriers and cover expenses, including retiree benefits. A 2006 law made the agency responsible for prefunding future retiree health benefits, placing additional strain on its bottom line, which has also suffered over the years from declines in first-class and marketing mail. The postal service has run at a loss ever since.\n\"It's not even breaking even on its annual expenses and its annual income,\" said G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former Republican staff director for the Senate Budget Committee. \"I don't know how anybody could say they have a surplus.\"\nOur ruling\nLaHood said, \"the post office right now, this year, is operating with about a $12 billion surplus.\"\nHis spokesman told us he was referencing the nearly $13 billion \"cash on hand\" the agency reported at the end of June.\nBut cash on hand is not a surplus, experts said. The agency has reported a net loss in every year since 2007, the year after Congress required it to more robustly fund its retirement health benefit system.\nWe rate LaHood\u2019s claim Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18880"}
