Even during the period of growth of historic jobs, 57% of jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families living wages.\" We asked about this percentage. By e-mail, the director of the Adler campaign, Jim Wick, said that Adler saw the figure on April 26, 2014, analysis of Austin American-stateman news by Dan Zeher citing data collected by Idaho International for economic modelling specialists, which analysed labour force-related data. That story said that while the Metro Austin region had acquired thousands of jobs in recent years, inflation-adjusted revenues had declined. Then came the announcement that drew Adler's attention, which generally did not speak to families or jobs in Austin alone. \"From 2009 to 2013,\" the article said, \"about 57 per cent of newly created jobs in the region pay less than the living wage of a single parent with one child ($19.56 per hour), according to data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the calculator for living wages, which is often encouraged by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\" This corresponding figure for living wages, which corresponds to the provinces of Travis and Williamson, appears on the web pages of Amy Glasmeier, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Economic Geography and Regional Planning. According to interventions, the living wage is \"the hourly rate that an individual must earn to support his or her family, if he or she is the sole breadwinner and works full time (2,080 hours per year). In our inquiry, Zeheer submitted a table that he prepared based on increases or decreases in jobs across more than 730 occupations in the Austin-Rod Rock Statistical Region, which also shows the average hourly wage for each occupation. By e-mail, EMISI spokesman Joshua Wright said that the average hourly wage data came from the Federal Office of Labour Statistics and that the information was measured to industry-specific data from agencies such as BLS and the United States Census Office. According to our calculations, some 53,315 out of 92,620 net jobs were added in Austin from 2009 to 2013, or 58 per cent, the average hourly wage was lower than that of the single parent with one child. These lower-paid jobs include 394 types of jobs, including oil, gas and mining, as well as surveyors and loan clerks, pest control workers, leather workers and medical secretaries, according to the chart. In reviewing these details, we also asked whether the results for Austin workers were as bad as Adler said. For example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology website offers lower living wages, including $18.51 per hour for Travis and Williamson counties for adults and children; $14.88 for adults only; and $9.43 for one adult only. If you focus on income with a lower living wage, you will also conclude that more workers were better off. According to the data tables, for example, average hourly wages were less than $14.88 in 40,560 out of 92,620 net jobs achieved between 2009 and 2013, or 44 per cent; average hourly wages were less than $9.43 in 15,099 net jobs, or 16 per cent. In his interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry said that Hurricane Harvey \"dropped water in Houston in five days more than Niagara Falls in one year.\" In other words, the average wage in each occupation is the line between the highest 50 per cent of wages and the lowest 50 per cent of workers. It is therefore logical that some workers in the 75 percent still earn more than the living wage of the single parent with a child. But this also means that some of the other 43 percent did not receive the same living wage. It is clear that the limits of public wage data make it difficult to calculate an accurate percentage. Subsequently, for the independent consideration of this allegation, we moved to Cynthia Osborne, Assistant Professor at the University of Texas and Director of the Child and Family Research Partnership at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. By e-mail, Osborne told us that 57% might be true, but she needs more information - especially changes in wages around each intermediary - to come to a conclusion. Wright told us he didn't have that kind of information, but he could share wages for each occupation at certain points along the pay curve. Later, Daniel Dillon, a research partner in the partnership, said three extrapolations based on these added details, essentially confirming that about 57 per cent of the jobs added in Austin did not pay the living wage for an adult with one child. The Governor Adler said: \"57% of jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families living wages.\" In particular, the estimated share of net added jobs in the Austin multi-provincial region (not just Austin) is considered to be lower average wages than that of an adult with one child. However, families differ in size, as do the relevant living wages. We appreciate this statement, which lacks clarification, most often true.
