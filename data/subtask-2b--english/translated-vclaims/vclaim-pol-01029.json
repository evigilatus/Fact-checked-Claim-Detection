He also likes to underestimate his political opponents. On 11 February, Trump went to the border town of El Paso, Texas, to bypass his immigration policies. On the same night, Peto Aurourke, a potential democratic presidential candidate in 2020 who formerly represented El Paso in the United States House, spoke to a crowd of people elsewhere in El Paso. In his speech, Trump mocked the attendance of the Aurourke event. Trump described O'Rourke as \"a young man who has little taste for himself, except that he has a great first name.\" Trump added: \"He challenged us. So we had, let's say 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people. It's not very good.\" Was it true that \"200 people, 300 people\" only attended the Oroc speech? We may never know the exact number of participants -- we've asked the El Paso Police Department and the El Paso City Government, but none of them were provided at the time of deployment. Media reports indicate that the number was in thousands. For example, Texas Tribune reporters in El Paso wrote that \"about 7,000 people went to see Aurork talking in the park, according to an assistant, (The White House did not respond to a request for information). However, after reviewing the video footage and photographs of the event, we conclude that the figure was definitely higher than 200 to 300 trumps he said. Consider the video recordings that Aurourke distributed on Twitter. Here, the freezing framework that appears in the crowd from the perspective of the platform: Banning to the left, we see that the crowd is continuing (we planted it to avoid duplication): the distinguished fact-checkers on January 13, 2021 mentioned a story that General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, says. At the same time, he rejected a live video published by The El Paso Times, which had a different and narrower perspective -- in the face of the stage. However, even this view refers to a crowd of not more than 200 or 300 people. On the question of whether 35,000 people attended the Trump gathering, news reports indicate that law enforcement officials do not agree with his assessment. A spokesman for the El Paso Fire Department in The El Paso Times said that there were 6,500 people in Trump speaking for this type of event, and it was full of capacity. A few thousand others may be standing abroad, and media officer Enrique D. Aguilar released the newspaper, although there was no official census of the crowd. This means that the total crowd size \"may be 10,000 with people abroad,\" said Aguilar the newspaper. Other estimates reported were a few thousand higher. In both cases, these estimates were much lower than the Trump total. (We will update this article if an official government estimate is issued.) Our Governor Trump said that at the Aurourke rally in El Paso, there were \"200 people, 300 people.\" Our review of available visual evidence indicates that the number is multiplying several times. Media reports indicate that the number may have been much larger, in thousands. We're assessing the statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01029"}
