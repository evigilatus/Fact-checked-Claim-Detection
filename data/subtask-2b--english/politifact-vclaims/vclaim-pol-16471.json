The next president has to act. The Biden plan to end the war in Iraq has already won bipartisan support. When Pakistan erupted in crisis, I spoke to Musharraf before Bush did. You don't have to guess what I'll do as president. Just look at what I've done.\"\n\n\nWe have previously explored\n\nBiden's claims about his Iraq plan,\n\nso here we will focus on his statement that when Pakistan erupted, he spoke with President Pervez Musharraf before Bush did.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

I told President Musharraf how critical it is for relations between our two countries that elections go forward as planned in January, that he follow through on his commitment to take off his uniform and that he restore the rule of law to Pakistan.\"\n\n\nPresident Bush spoke with Musharraf on Nov. 7, one day after Biden did. At a press availability that day at Mount Vernon, Bush's remarks were very similar to Biden's the day before. \"My message was that we believe strongly in elections, and that you ought to have elections soon, and you need to take off your uniform,\" Bush said. \"You can't be the president and the head of the military at the same time. So I had a very frank discussion with him.\"\n\n\nIt's not clear why Bush didn't speak with Musharraf until after Biden, but the records indicate that Biden's claim is True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16471"}
