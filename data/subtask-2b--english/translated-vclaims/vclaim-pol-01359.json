His claim that Democrats oppose any effort to secure borders is also incorrect. The Democrats are generally opposed to the border wall, saying that it would be expensive and not in keeping with Trump's promise that Mexico would pay for it. However, they prefer other security measures, including more border patrol agents and technology control. They have introduced and co-sponsored legislation to achieve these objectives. Trump's claims for $1.6 billion financed the border wall came from a $1.3 trillion expenditure package passed in the House of Representatives and the Senate with the support of Democrats. The White House did not provide supporting evidence for Trump &apos; s claim and did not comment on the record. The border fence plan received democratic support from Tramp in March and signed an expenditure bill of $1.3 trillion, eliminating threats to reverse it because it did not include all the funds he wanted for a border wall. The bill included $1.6 billion explicitly earmarked for the construction of a new and alternative fence along the south-west border. This amount also covered $38 million for the planning and design of the border barrier and $196 million for the acquisition and deployment of border security technology. Although the Bill of Credits stated that the money was for fencing, Trump considered it to be money for the wall he promised. In his allegations, he ruled out that some Democrats supported this measure. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" The spending package was approved in the Senate, 65-32, with 39 Democrats voting in favour. In the House of Representatives, 256-167 passed with 111 Democrats supporting him. The Democrats in border security legislation criticized a complete copy of the proposed Trump border wall as a waste of money. Instead, most have been forced to find other ways to secure the border. They also opposed the immigration bill of June submitted by President Bob Godlate, R-Va (which was initially supported by Trump). In addition to financing the border wall, the Gudel\u00e1 bill contained reductions in legal immigration and allowed so-called dreamers to remain in the United States on a renewable non-immigrant status. The moderate Democrats and Republicans said that the bill did not provide a lasting solution to dreams. Over the years, Democrats have sponsored and supported proposals to help secure borders and voted for draft credit laws that finance customs and border protection in the United States, the federal agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws at the border. In 2013, the Democratic Chuck Schommer of New York sponsored a bill instructing the Minister of National Security to submit two reports on the border security strategy, including a report on where the fence, infrastructure and technology should be used; authorized the use of the National Guard to help secure the border; and called for an increase in the number of border patrol personnel at the southern border and other border security measures. The bill has been approved by the Senate but has not been dealt with in the Chamber of Deputies. More recently, 30 Democrats co-sponsored the House of Representatives Bill submitted by the Republic in January, Will Hurd of Texas. The bill was aimed at protecting dreamers from deportation. He also called for the deployment of the most efficient practical and effective technology to achieve operational control of the border. Within one year of the enactment of the draft law, the Ministry of Internal Security was instructed to submit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for the southern border, including details of physical barriers, margins, technologies, tools and other organs necessary to secure the border. In February, the U.S.A. sponsored Chris Connes from Delaware and the late Sin John McCain from Arizona, similar legislation to the Pete Hurd version. That proposal also authorized $110 million per year for five years for cooperation between local law enforcement agencies and the Customs and Border Protection Authority. In January, Deputy Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, D-IL., said that while the border wall was \"a huge waste of taxpayers' money,\" it would be in his favor if that was what it took to help the dreamers. Our Governor Trump said, \"Democracy opposes any effort to secure our borders.\" The large-scale Trump process has not succeeded in arresting other actions under border security supported by Democrats. The Democrats sponsored and supported legislation on border security, including control technology. Trump also claims that the border wall is under construction and that he has received $1.6 billion from Congress for him, but he neglects that Democrats have also voted in favour of that takeover. Trump's claim is inaccurate. We assess it wrong. 2018-10-30 21:34.
