This programme is aimed at the age group 25 and above and aims to help fill jobs in the \"high demand\" industries, although Parson has not explained what these jobs are. \"And I want to be clear as well: we will always need architects and doctors, and we will need professionals with degrees for four years. But 65-70% of people in Missouri don't have certificates,\" Parson said in an interview on KCUR in January 24. We wondered whether he was right that about two thirds of the population of Missouri did not have a university degree. We found government statements to support his claim. According to data from the 2017 Census of the Ministry of Higher Education in Missouri, it is estimated that 39.9 per cent of working-age adults received a university degree or higher in 2017. Only 19.6 per cent of them have bachelor &apos; s degrees. This large percentage can look amazing at first. However, the ratings from the United States News and World Report reveal that these figures are very average compared to the rest of the country. They ranked Missouri twenty-seventh in higher education - based on the share of citizens with a university degree, taking into account the time they spent completing their degree programmes, the costs of education and the amount of the student debt. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012, Missouri's educational attainment has been increasing steadily over the years. In 2015, 27.8 per cent of the Missouri population had a bachelor &apos; s degree or higher, compared with only 24.3 per cent in 2008. The number of associate certificates also increased, jumping to 7.7 per cent in 2015 from 6.7 per cent in 2008. As the Missouri population &apos; s share of the grades rises, the State receives an economic boost. \"It makes the country's labour market more competitive in attracting industry and employers, and also makes individuals who acquire these qualifications more likely to improve their quality of life than they are able to work and earn money,\" said Mark Ehlert, Assistant Research Professor of Economics at Missouri University. Ehlert's research focuses in particular on the economics of education. According to him, the proportion of the state &apos; s population with university degrees is the highest ever, and young people are more likely to receive a university degree. According to Ehlert, his research also shows a \"new pool of work\" that is ignored in older persons without certificates, certificates or technical training. This group of non-traditional college students is the goal of West Track. Some state legislators proposed a reduction of $4.2 million for the fast-track programme, arguing that it was a lot of money for the first-year programme. The funds will be transferred to finance the Department of Higher Education and the Department of Primary and Secondary Education. A Senate committee raised similar questions about the need for the programme. Our Governor Parson said, \"65 to 70% of the people in Missouri don't have certificates.\" His number is accurate, according to census data and the Ministry of Higher Education in Missouri. We're assessing this claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00865"}
