Joe Barton, R-Texas, is not popular among environmentalists. A former chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, Barton is a staunch advocate for fossil fuels and expressed skepticism about the role of manmade carbon emissions in climate change.\nBarton\u2019s critics like to paint him as blindly supportive of Big Oil and as anti-science. Exhibit A is a series of social media memes that mock him for suggesting that wind power can actually intensify global warming.\nThe most extreme version we found said Barton had claimed that \"wind power would stop the Earth from rotating.\" That\u2019s clearly not true, but it\u2019s also not clear that this claim was meant to be taken seriously. Instead, we decided to check a less outrageous -- and more common -- meme mocking Barton.\nA reader recently sent us a meme featuring a picture of Barton alongside the quotation, \"Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up.\" The meme\u2019s creator went on to comment, \"The only thing more stupid than this idiot heading the House-Senate energy conf(erence) is Michelle Bachmann's stint on the House 'Intelligence' Committee!\" (Michele Bachmann's name is misspelled.)\nUltimately, we concluded that Barton\u2019s words were significantly altered.\nWhat did Barton actually say?\nAs it turns out, the comments from the meme we\u2019re checking stem from a congressional hearing held almost six years ago, on Feb. 26, 2009.\nAs part of a lengthy question-and-answer session, Barton pressed witnesses on some of the risks of shifting the nation\u2019s energy portfolio from fossil fuels to renewable sources. In one exchange, Barton referred to a paper by Jay Apt, director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center and a professor of technology at the Tepper School of Business. In turn, Apt\u2019s paper relied on research in an earlier paper by David W. Keith, currently a professor of applied physics and public policy at Harvard University.\nBarton\u2019s off-the-cuff comments are somewhat meandering, but the general gist of what he said was to raise questions about some of the downsides of using wind to generate electricity.\n\"I am going to read a paragraph which is, if true, very ironic. And this is from Dr. Apt\u2019s paper, and I quote: \u2018Wind energy is a finite resource. At large scale, slowing down the wind by using its energy to turn turbines has environmental consequences. A group of researchers at Princeton University \u2026 found that wind farms may change the mixing of air near the surface, drying the soil near the site. At planetary scales, David Keith, who was then at Carnegie Mellon, and coworkers found that if wind supplied 10 percent of expected global electricity demand in 2100 \u2026 the resulting change in the earth\u2019s atmospheric energy might cause some regions of the world to experience temperature change of approximately 1 degree Centigrade.\u2019 \u2026 \n\"Now, wind is God\u2019s way of balancing heat. Wind is the way you shift heat from areas where it is hotter to areas where it is cooler. That is what wind is. Wouldn\u2019t it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we mandated massive switches to energy, which is a finite resource, which slows the winds down, which causes the temperature to go up? Now, I am not saying that is going to happen, Mr. Chairman, but that is definitely something on the massive scale. I mean, it does make some sense. You stop something. You can\u2019t transfer that heat and the heat goes up. It is just something to think about.\"\nReading the full text shows that the meme glossed over some important nuances, perhaps by relying on a brief summation published by Time magazine in 2010.\nFirst, even though the meme used quotation marks to frame the comment as a single, unified quote, it\u2019s actually a stitched-together mix of several snippets from Barton\u2019s remarks.\nSecond, the meme ignores that when Barton said that \"wind is a finite resource,\" he was explicitly quoting Apt\u2019s paper, rather than saying that was his personal belief.\nThird, the meme overlooks that when Barton supposedly said that harnessing the wind \"would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up,\" he was actually asking the witness a question rather than stating his view.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd fourth, the meme ignores that Barton said in the same exchange, \"Now, I am not saying that is going to happen, Mr. Chairman.\" In other words, what he was doing was posing a scenario to be discussed further.\nSo, while Barton\u2019s comments clearly show an openness to the ideas he addressed, the meme is off-base in suggesting that Barton was stating his own opinion.\nFor the record, Barton\u2019s spokesman, Sean Brown, told PolitiFact that the congressman \"believes in an all-of-the-above energy plan that includes wind and solar power but also doesn\u2019t ignore traditional sources of energy like coal or natural gas.\"\nIs there any credibility to the idea that wind energy might contribute to global warming?\nSo Barton didn\u2019t say what the meme said he did. But what about the substance of the claim -- that wind turbines can exacerbate global warming?\nThe idea isn\u2019t entirely out of left field, but it\u2019s a lot more complicated than it seems on the surface.\nLet\u2019s start with what was known at the time Barton made his comment six years ago. The paper ultimately referenced by Barton -- the one that Keith coauthored -- found some intriguing interactions between wind turbines and climate, namely that \"very large amounts of wind power\" can produce changes to climate \"at continental scales.\"\nHowever, the authors leavened this assessment with a more optimistic note -- that such changes in climate disappear at the global level, and that, on balance, using wind power rather than fossil fuels reduces climate change, rather than exacerbating it.\nKeith, who didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact, and his coauthors also emphasized that what negative impacts emerged from wind-turbine use could be eased, fairly economically, by better turbine design and placement.\nSubsequent research has bolstered this conclusion.\nA 2012 study that used satellite data for west-central Texas, published in Nature Climate Change and co-authored by Liming Zhou of the State University of New York at Albany, found a \"significant warming trend\" of up to 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit per decade over wind farms, compared to nearby regions that didn\u2019t have wind farms. However, Zhou told the Daily Telegraph that the climatic changes from wind farms paled when compared to the impact of manmade global warming.\nAnd Mark Z. Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of civil and environmental engineering, told PolitiFact that a 2012 paper he coauthored found that the impact of large arrays of wind turbines would be to cool climate -- not warm it. \"That paper is the most detailed to date,\" Jacobson said.\nJacobson agreed that even installing enough wind-power capacity to power \"half the world\" would have \"small\" global impacts on climate, even though the impacts locally could be more significant. If you weigh the negatives of wind power against the negatives of fossil-fuel use, he added, \"there is only a net benefit of switching to wind.\"\nOur ruling\nA social media meme says Barton once said, \"Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up.\"\nBarton raised that possibility while questioning a witness during a 2009 congressional hearing, but contrary to the meme\u2019s implication, he did not say that it was his personal belief. Rather, the meme makes fun of Barton by stitching together parts of his comments in a way that is misleading.\nThe statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06842"}
