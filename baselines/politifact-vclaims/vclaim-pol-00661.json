He spoke for almost an hour about his plans for increasing every Native American\u2019s present standard of living. Though vague in detail, he spoke about his ideas for helping his \u2018red sisters and brothers.\u2019 \nAfterwards, the Tribes presented him with a plaque inscribed with his new Indian name, \u2018Walking Eagle,\u2019 which he proudly accepted. \nAfter Trump left, a news reporter asked the chiefs how they came to select this name. They explained that \u2018Walking Eagle\u2019 is the name given to a bird so full of s*** it can no longer fly.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Bush or Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, it also did not take place with Trump.\nWe found the George W. Bush version of the joke in the 2008 book, \"Celebrity Smackdown: A Very Rude Joke Book\" by Luther Blisset, though it likely didn\u2019t originate there, as there have been versions of the joke reported as early as 2004.\nIt is simply a regurgitated joke that routinely swaps out the politician.
