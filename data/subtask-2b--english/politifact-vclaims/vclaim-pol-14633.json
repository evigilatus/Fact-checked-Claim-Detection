Despite Reid\u2019s barrage of heavily-funded attack ads this summer, Angle has held her own in the polls and managed to put out a few zingers herself.\n\nHer latest ad responded to Reid\u2019s claims that \"No One Can Do More\" for Nevada. Speaking on camera to a group of elderly supporters, Angle asserted, \"Harry Reid says he does more for Nevada. He's done more for unemployment. We were at 4.4 percent. Now we're at 14 percent. He's done more for the foreclosure rate. We have the highest foreclosure rate in the nation. He's done more for bankruptcy. We have the highest bankruptcy rate in the nation. Harry Reid has done more, and it\u2019s time for us to say stop doing it. We can\u2019t stand any more.\"\n\nWe wondered just how bad things had gotten in the Silver State, so we decided to check the facts.\n\nEasiest to check was Angle\u2019s claim that Nevada has the highest bankruptcy rate in the nation. Unfortunately for the state, at a per capita bankruptcy rate of 11.7 percent, Nevada is at the top of the charts, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n\nAngle was also correct that Nevada has the highest foreclosure rate in the nation. One Nevadan out of 23 was in foreclosure this year -- a rate of 4.34 percent. Nationally, only 2.7 percent of \u00a0homeowners were in foreclosure, according to data from RealtyTrac, which monitors foreclosure filings across the nation. The agency did note, however, that Nevada\u2019s filings for the first six months of 2010 decreased by 13 percent compared with the last six months of 2009.\n\nAngle was correct that Nevada\u2019s unemployment rate for May 2010 was 14 percent, it\u2019s unclear what time period she\u2019s referring to when she said \"We were at 4.4 percent.\" We did a little digging, and discovered she was referring to January 2007, when Reid became the Senate Majority Leader, and that was, indeed, the unemployment rate. But if she was trying to talk about the effect Reid himself had on Nevada\u2019s unemployment rate, it might have been more accurate to compare today\u2019s unemployment rates with those of 1987 -- when Reid first took office and the rate was 6.1. Instead, she chose to compare one of the lowest unemployment rates during Reid\u2019s tenure to the highest.\n\nAlthough her numbers are on-target, they don\u2019t tell the whole story. For one thing, the state\u2019s foreclosure and bankruptcy rates are beginning to improve. Many experts attribute Nevada\u2019s high unemployment rate to the recession -- not to Reid, since the state\u2019s largest industries have been hurt nationwide by the economic downturn.\n\n\"Nevada has been hit extremely hard as the recession has spread throughout the economy...Clearly, with its historical reliance on gaming and construction as engines of growth, Nevada has been at the epicenter of the current economic downturn, as these two sectors have each felt the brunt of negative economic forces,\" said a Nevada Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation press release.\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s up to voters to determine how much impact any one Senator has had on his state\u2019s bankruptcy, foreclosure, and unemployment rates -- even if that Senator is the Majority Leader.\n\nAngle has quoted her figures correctly, but there\u2019s more to the story than her ad implies. She cherry-picked numbers for one claim, comparing past unemployment rates in Nevada to the current rate. And she forcefully attributes Nevada\u2019s woes to Reid -- while his responsibility is unclear at best. We\u2019ll rate this one Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
