We've included it below, but be warned, it's a bit jarring.\n\"The Clintons are Finished Forever After Dirty Picture LEAKS! (NSFW),\" the website wrote Nov. 15, 2016.\n\n\nThe post says the images are not confirmed, but then goes on to speculate who the woman is and surmises that both the person in the image and Clinton are left-handed: \"If that\u2019s not Bill Clinton, it sure looks like him.\"\nThe post tracks back to the Twitter account of a user named 0Hour.\n#IMWITHHER #HILLARYKNEW#ProtestTrump For What?#LOL pic.twitter.com/PwtuAthUEP\u2014 \u23f00\u23f0 (@0hour) November 15, 2016\n\nIn reality, the image was cropped and lifted off the website of contemporary artist Alison Jackson.

Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jackson\u2019s productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of \u2018truth\u2019.\"\nJackson also has portrayed President-Elect Donald Trump as part of work for Vanity Fair. She has a new book with her images, entitled Private 2016,\u00a0available on Amazon.\nThrough a spokeswoman, Jackson told us that she is \"delighted one of my works is part of the \u2018fake news\u2019 movement. ...\u00a0My work is about celebrities and public figures in private, things we have all imagined but never seen before. We think we know them intimately but we only know them through the media imagery -- very few of us have met them for real.\u00a0Celebrities and public figures are created by the media industries.\"\nOur ruling\nThe website Political Insider is peddling fake news showing an alleged image of Bill Clinton naked with another woman.\nThe image was actually created by a contemporary artist who depicts celebrities and politicians in compromising positions. It is not a real image.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9dd956aa-6b64-45b1-ad42-922b9af7cbd6", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03942"}
