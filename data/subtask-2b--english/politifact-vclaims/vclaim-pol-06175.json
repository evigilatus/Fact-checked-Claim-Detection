All those counties have sheriffs and sheriff\u2019s departments. At least a dozen mostly metro counties also have county police forces. Scattered throughout those counties, according to the Georgia Municipal Association, are 538 cities of varying sizes, 352 with police chiefs. That doesn\u2019t count the host of state law enforcement agencies, including the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and State Patrol.\nWith all those law enforcement agencies in Georgia, could fewer than 20 percent be state-certified? We decided to do a little investigating.\nFirst, some background about the voluntary, 18-month to two-year process of becoming state-certified. The process begins with the agency undertaking a self-assessment. The department then goes through the time-consuming process of ensuring that all its policies and procedures conform with state laws and follow best practices in eight key areas. These include training, personnel, evidence, warrants, victims and witnesses, said Mark Bender, the director of state certification for the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police.\nBefore a department is awarded state certification, an independent team of assessors, typically from another law enforcement agency, makes an onsite visit to determine whether the department\u2019s officers and staff are adhering to those policies and procedures, Bender said.\nState certification is good for three years and renewable after a re-evaluation. Costs are about $650 for the initial certification, $375 a year for each subsequent year, Bender said.\nOfficers in a state-certified department can take pride in knowing they\u2019ve set high standards of professionalism for themselves and have voluntarily agreed to be reviewed every three years to see that they\u2019re living up to those standards, he said.\nThe state recognition can increase a community\u2019s respect and support for a department, Bender said. The department also can benefit financially: A 20 percent discount is offered on premiums for state-certified police departments if their cities are part of the GMA\u2019s property and liability insurance pool.\nFifty-five agencies are currently receiving the discount for a combined savings of $261,000, said Amy Henderson, a GMA spokeswoman.\nThe first state certification was issued in 1997, and 118 law enforcement agencies are currently state-certified through the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police, Bender said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey include city police departments, sheriff\u2019s departments, county police departments, campus police departments, the GBI and the Georgia World Congress Center. The Atlanta Police Department and Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett county police departments are all state-certified.\nFrank V. Rotondo, the executive director of the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police, said the reasons vary why local law enforcement agencies don\u2019t pursue state certification.\nThe process requires going \"through a lot of extra hoops, and some don\u2019t want to do it,\" Rotondo said. \"Some don\u2019t have the extra money to do what\u2019s required.\"\nFor instance, he said, a state-certified police department is expected to maintain a statistical evaluation to justify its traffic enforcement efforts, \u00a0and some are too small to take on this extra work.\n\"We wouldn\u2019t want 100 percent,\" Rotondo said.\nState-certified agencies should be \"better than most,\" he said.\nSo what about the specific claim that out of 700 law enforcement agencies in the state, fewer than 20 percent are state-certified?\nThat statement is based largely on an often-repeated statistic from the police chiefs association that indicates there are about 700 law enforcement agencies in the state.\nRotondo told us that\u2019s an estimate. An exact count would be difficult, he said.\nFor instance, \u00a0one small city police force in Middle Georgia is currently looking at dissolving and allowing the county sheriff\u2019s office to take over, Rotondo said.\nThe Georgia Peace Officer Standards and Training Council gave PolitiFact data showing the state has 1,178 law enforcement agencies and 58,413 law enforcement personnel. But Rotondo said many of those agencies do not qualify for state certification.\nHe suggested we stick to the 700 estimate. When we do, we come up with roughly 17 percent (or 118) are state-certified.\nOur ruling\nThe Dunwoody Police Department recently was recognized for becoming state certified. The city press release said: There are more than 700 law enforcement agencies in Georgia and fewer than 20 percent of those agencies have achieved this status. But the bar also has to be high here.\nClaims need to be based on data or disclose, as in this case, that they are based, in part, on estimates. That\u2019s missing context.
