Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., has touted her voting record and bipartisan work as examples of her independence in one of her campaign ads.\n\"Nonpartisan experts have consistently ranked Claire one of the most independent senators \u2014 right in the middle,\" her campaign said in a TV ad.\nHer Republican challenger, Attorney General Josh Hawley, is critical of her for often voting along party lines.\nDoes McCaskill follow party precedent, or does she often stray from the left side of the aisle when making her decisions?\nReport cards, records, and rankings\nMcCaskill\u2019s ad cited Congressional Quarterly, her GovTrack Analysis records and National Journal ideology rankings to back up the claimed independent streak.\nHere\u2019s what they said:\n\u2022 Congressional Quarterly: The publication\u2019s analysis showed McCaskill was one of the least likely to vote in line with her own party, doing so 82 percent of the time in 2017. Only three senators, Angus King (81 percent), Joe Donnelly (74 percent) and Joe Manchin (64 percent), broke from their party during votes more often than McCaskill.\n\u2022 GovTrack: GovTrack is a small, four-member organization that regularly publishes the status of federal legislation and information about representatives and senators in Congress. On the site\u2019s analytics page for McCaskill, the first metric displayed is her ideology chart. She is one of approximately 10 senators that rests ideologically close to the middle. GovTrack\u2019s report card for her 2017 legislative year ranked her the sixth most conservative Senate Democrat. She joined bipartisan bills the seventh most often of all senators.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJason Kander\n\n\nstated on August 10, 2016 in a campaign ad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoy Blunt \"voted to raise his own pay 12 times\" while in Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy George Ash \u2022 November 6, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 National Journal: Since 2007, her first year in office, McCaskill was ranked by National Journal as the 43rd, 52nd, 53rd, 48th, 51st, 57th and 50th most conservative member of the Senate, respectively, of the 100 members. National Journal stopped creating its ideology rankings in 2013, according to McCaskill\u2019s team.\nIndependent vs. moderate\nWe reached out to six political science experts to shed some light on what factors might qualify a senator as independent.\nAll but one of our experts noted that the wording of the claim is odd.\nAs Cato Institute research fellow and editor Jason Kuznicki noted, \"\u2018Moderate\u2019 and \u2018independent\u2019 are not synonyms.\" Only two senators are currently registered as independent \u2014 Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Angus King (I-Me.).\nUniversity of Missouri professor of American politics Marvin Overby said the claim was an exaggeration. \"We live in an epoch where politics is very partisan and independent politicians are extraordinarily rare,\" he said. \"But, comparatively speaking, it is fair to say that \u2014 in a hyper-partisan age \u2014 McCaskill shows more independence than most.\"\nOur ruling\nMcCaskill said \"nonpartisan experts have consistently ranked (her)\u00a0one of the most independent senators \u2014 right in the middle.\"\nIt\u2019s difficult if not impossible to define independence. Multiple studies show McCaskill voted against her party more so than\u00a0 mostother Democrats. However, experts cautioned that a moderate or centrist voting record does not necessarily equate to being independent.\nFor those reasons we rate this claim Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-11-05 18:59:04 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  \"Nonpartisan experts have consistently ranked Claire one of the most independent senators \u2014 right in the middle.\"     Claire McCaskill U.S. Senator from Missouri https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4uuhdv46Js   In a campaign ad Tuesday, October 2, 2018 2018-10-02    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01300"}
