During the campaign to persuade voters to mark \"yes\" on their ballots, the Library Yes! Committee made a number of arguments in the district\u2019s favor.\n\nOne of the most ubiquitous was the oft-repeated fact that the Multnomah County Library was the \"second busiest in the nation.\" Given that Portland doesn\u2019t even crack the 25 largest cities in the nation (by population), this fact has always struck us as pretty interesting.\n\nDuring the campaign season, we were a bit distracted with various other claims, but now that things are bit quieter, we thought we\u2019d come back to this one -- if only for curiosity\u2019s sake.\n\nWe e-mailed Liz Kaufman, who handled media requests for the library district campaign, and she quickly followed up with a handy breakdown of statistics about the Multnomah County Library and its peer institutions, compiled by the American Library Association.\n\nThe association doesn\u2019t track how \"busy\" a system is per se, but it does check the circulation -- or the total number of items issued in a given year. By that measure, the Multnomah County system is, indeed, the second busiest with 23,946,498.\n\nWe followed up with a phone call to the association for good measure and spoke with Macey Morales, their media point-person. She cautioned that their figures came from the Public Library Associations\u2019 survey. \"A total of 1,300 libraries from the U.S. and Canada voluntarily complete the survey, so the report reflects a sample of public libraries in North America,\" she wrote in a follow-up e-mail.\n\nThat said, the Multnomah County system does have the second highest circulation in the most recent survey. The New York Public Library comes in first -- although to be fair, that system has some 87 branches compared to Multnomah\u2019s 18. A quick aside: We also have the second highest circulation per capita. In that category, we were edged out -- 33 to 34 per person a year -- by Ohio\u2019s Cuyahoga County Public Library.\n\nMorales did point us to one other source, the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The institute does a more complete library census, looking at some 9,000 systems. The catch there is that their figures take a while to get published. They\u2019re currently waiting on 2010 figures.\n\nA report released by the institute in December 2009, said Multnomah County Library boasted the third highest circulation rate in the country -- there\u2019s no mention of who is first or second. Those figures, of course, would be somewhat dated compared to the other survey -- though potentially more complete.\n\nIt\u2019s often said that the Multnomah County Library system is the nation\u2019s second busiest. The most recent available statistics from a survey used widely in the industry backs up the claim.\n\nWe rate this claim True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09996"}
