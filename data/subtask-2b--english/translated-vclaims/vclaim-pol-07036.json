Try it in 1980.", "text": "Over the past two decades, Republicans have struggled to expel members of the Democratic Senate, although this trend is expected to change on Tuesday. Many forecasters have Republicans holding up to eight seats in the Democratic Senate -- they beat office holders in Arkansas, Louisiana, Alaska and Colorado. If this scenario succeeds, the Republicans will take control of the Senate, and they will have overcome a historic challenge. \"The last time we beat more than two (inmates) was 1980,\" said National Committee spokesman Sean Spesser in CNN State of the Federation in November 2. It is generally understood that current candidates have an advantage over their competitors for many reasons, including their visibility, their accomplishments in the post, and their being high-ranking candidates (the reason for their election in the first place). But did Republican Uniteds fight a lot to take democratic seats? We looked at the results of the previous Senate elections and found that the Republicans had made some successful gains in the past 35 years, but many of those gains were in races for an open seat when the Democratic Senator retired. In 1980, the Republicans held 12 seats for the Democratic Senate (nine of the occupants lost in the general elections, three lost in the initial elections). It is right that Spicer says that they have not defeated more than two of the incumbents since then. We found a great chart showing the rotation of Senate seats over the past half century in the most recent report of the Brookings Institution entitled \"Congress Vital Statistics.\" (h/t to Crystal Sabato ball) The arrows appear when a democratic seat (D) is converted into a Republican seat (R) and vice versa. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" \u2022 19 January 2021, from 1981 onwards, only 12 of the current Democrats were beaten by Republicans to take seats in the Senate. The greatest gains made by the Republicans in the Senate in that time frame include all open seats - such as 1994, 2004 and 2010, when they received four, five and six open seats, respectively. The Democrats of the Senate have not fought against Republican posts in recent years. Since 1981, they have beaten a total of 37 incumbents, compared with 12 Republicans. So if the Republicans are able to defeat more than two current Democrats on Tuesday, this will be a clear break with the recent past. If the Republicans hold seven seats, both winning positions and holding open seats (most likely the New York Times election model), this will be their second largest overall gain since 1980. In 1994, the Republicans won eight seats in the Senate, winning two seats in the Senate, and six seats in the Senate. What made 1980 so special? In the elections themselves, former President Ronald Reagan defeated current democratic President Jimmy Carter. Carter was slamming fast with the voters, given Iran's hostage crisis, troubled economy and other issues. In addition to Carter's conflicts, there has been a major split between the southern and northern Democrats. It was an extraordinary political environment that allowed the Republicans to conquer Congressional elections. In comparison to this year &apos; s Senate election, where, despite the absence of presidential elections, the Republicans are using President Barack Obama &apos; s relatively low popularity in the races against the current Democrats. The Governor, Spyser, said the last time Republican Senators won more than two (students) was in 1980. A total of 9 of the current Democrats were dismissed by the Republicans in 1980 (an additional three were lost at the primary level). Since then, the Republicans have held two or less seats in each election. Most of their success was in winning former democratic open seats. We're assessing Spesser's claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07036"}
