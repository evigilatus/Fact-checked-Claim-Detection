Wall Street, if you think what's going on to say. The commercial declaration refers to contributions received from donors in the financial services industry, and also states that it has used government pension funds to invest heavily in hedge funds - and the business proposes this unwisely. \"Payed $70 million from taxpayers to hedge fund managers, millionaire,\" commercial states. There was much debate about the decision of the State Investment Commission, chaired by Raimundo, to increase investments in hedge funds. Critics note that the fees charged by these funds - management fees of 1 per cent to 2.5 per cent of investments and performance fees of 17.5 per cent to 25 per cent of profits - have increased when questioning the transition. However, Raimundo states that these fees are justified because the Pension Fund portfolio is more diversified and less vulnerable. Because it became a charged issue, we thought it was important to check the numbers in the Fong commercial. The announcement cites a story from the Providence Journal of 25 August 2013 as a source of claim. We have not been able to find a story about investment fees from that date, but we found a story published on the provincejournal.com on 25 September 2013 and in the next day &apos; s newspaper. According to that story, the State Pension Fund earned investment returns of approximately $780 million in fiscal year 2013 after it paid about $70 million in fees. These fees were divided between management fees, totalling some $36 million, and performance fees, totalling some $34 million, according to the story. The story did not explain the fees paid for the various types of funds in which the State invested. This is an important point, because the State invests only a small portion of the $8 billion in pension funds in hedge funds. Investments are divided between cash, bonds, real estate, private companies and companies traded in the public sector and other areas. At present, 14.7 per cent of pension money is invested in hedge funds, according to the Office of the Treasurer General. All such investments are charged. So how much was he paid for the hedge funds? :: We examined the analysis of expenditures for fiscal year 2013, which is available on the Treasury Secretary &apos; s website. According to the document, the State paid $69.1 million in investment fees that year. Of this amount, $24.8 million was allocated to hedge funds for equities and $20.6 million to hedge funds for absolute return - for a total of $45.4 million - 25 million less than the number mentioned in the Fong Commercial Declaration. Facebook published on January 23, 2021 in social media \"Baiden invested the entire family's wealth in Ukrainian gas and oil. Then closes the Keystone pipeline. This figure, or a figure very close to it, has been published by the media on numerous occasions. The first report we found included the item Politi Fact Road Island in June 2013. Since then, it has been mentioned in the Journal in at least five separate stories in 2013 and 2014. Fees for fiscal year 2013 were announced more than a year ago. We were curious when the figures for fiscal year 2014, which ended on 30 June, were available. The Treasurer's office told us they wouldn't be ready until the end of the year. When the \"Wall Street Friend\" first came out, the newspaper asked Fong's campaign for $70 million. The spokesman for Robert Cobb was quoted in the 10 October story as stating that \"the announcement in Raimundo of the \"mistake to pay $70 million in fees associated with alternative investments only in fiscal year 2013.\" When we asked Cobb about the figure this week, he said that, in fact, $45 million had been paid for a hedge fund for fiscal year 2013 and an unspecified estimate for fiscal year 2014. \"In view of the history of the Pension Fund and the well-known information on rates of return and fee accounts, the conservative estimate of total fees paid is equal to or greater than the 70 million dollar claim contained in the Declaration,\" he told us. Our announcement to Alan Fong says that Jenna Raimundo paid $70 million in taxpayers' money to cover the charges to hedge fund managers. The commercial wrongly quotes the story of 25 August 2013 in Journal Jurnal as its source. But a bunch of other newspaper stories give the right number -- about $45 million -- as well as the location of the Treasury Secretary's office. The Fong campaign now insists that the figure they quoted is not limited to fiscal year 2013. They also assume that one or more payments will be made in fiscal year 2014. The Declaration does not say that, but it may be reasonable in the long run. If 2014 fees were equivalent to 2013, the total for the two years would easily reach $70 million. (In spite of the fact that the Fong campaign did not mention this, let us not forget the $16 million paid in hedge fund fees in fiscal year 2012. However, by reporting only the 2013 magazine story, the announcement indicates that the fees were paid only in 2013. Finally, the claim by the business that Raimundo itself paid taxpayers' money to hedge fund managers is at best misleading. Raimundo recommended an increase in hedge fund investments, but is not solely responsible for how the State invests in the pension fund. All decisions are taken by the 10-member State Investment Commission, which is the Chairperson of the Commission. Because the statement is partly accurate but it brings things out of context, we often judge it wrong.
