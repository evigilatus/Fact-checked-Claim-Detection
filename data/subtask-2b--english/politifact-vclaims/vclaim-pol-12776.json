They won't even feel it until the third year where they'll see any kind of an increase.\"\n\nTwo years without any increases in health care expenses?\n\nBased on the senator\u2019s own numbers, PolitiFact New Jersey learned that Sweeney is right about the first year, but in the second year, the average worker\u2019s costs would rise for every type of coverage -- including a nearly 80 percent jump for a family plan.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the health benefits reform piece of the legislation.\n\nSigned into law by Gov. Chris Christie on June 28, the legislation requires all public employees to contribute toward their health care based on a percentage of one\u2019s premium.\n\nThe contributions, which vary according to salaries and levels of coverage, will be phased in over four years for existing employees. The new regulations apply to all employees whose contract has expired and take effect after existing contracts expire. They also apply immediately to employees not covered by a union contract.\n\nBut contributions won\u2019t go below 1.5 percent of one\u2019s salary, the minimum amount currently paid by most public employees. Once the premium-sharing percentages exceed that minimum amount, employees would contribute according to the percentages.\n\nNow, let\u2019s turn to that \"grid\" Sweeney referred to in the radio interview.\n\nThe grid breaks down the premium percentages according to salaries. Because Sweeney referred to the \"average worker,\" we focused on someone earning $60,000, because federal data puts the average annual pay for a New Jersey state employee in that range.\n\nBased on the grid, that average worker would continue paying 1.5 percent of his salary in the first year, but starting in the second year, the percentage of premiums would increase his health care costs in each level of coverage.\n\nAn average worker with family coverage would continue paying $900 in the first year, and then $1,615 in the second year, according to the senator\u2019s grid.\n\nSweeney spokesman Chris Donnelly, who said the senator was aware of our correspondence, acknowledged in an email that the average worker would be impacted in the second year.\n\n\"The Senate President's goal with these reforms was to create a phase in system that was as fair as possible to lower and middle income workers. \u00a0He succeeded in doing that,\" Donnelly wrote in an email. \"While he firmly believes the cost of the new plans will lower premiums, if his comment that night mislead(s) anyone, he apologizes. \u00a0It certainly was not done maliciously, so he hopes to avoid seeing his pants being on fire.\"\n\nBut there\u2019s one more problem with the senator\u2019s calculation: we don\u2019t know what the premiums will be yet.\n\nSweeney used projected premiums in his grid, but the new legislation calls for two new committees to design new plans with an anticipated start date of Jan. 1, 2012. The senator argues the new plans could reduce premium costs.\n\nAlan Monheit, a professor of Health Economics at the Newark-based University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, said the average premium may be lower than it would have been under the old system, because the new cost-sharing could drive employees to opt for cheaper plans.\n\nStill, premiums depend on a group\u2019s level of health care spending, and the recent reform is mainly focused on shifting costs, Monheit said.\n\nLet\u2019s review:\n\nSweeney said in a radio interview that the average worker won\u2019t pay higher health care costs until the third year of the new health benefits reform. But the senator\u2019s own figures prove him wrong, showing increases starting in the second year.\n\nAlso, the premiums at the heart of this debate have yet to be determined by the new committees. Have no fear, senator, this statement isn\u2019t getting a Pants on Fire. We rate the statement Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
