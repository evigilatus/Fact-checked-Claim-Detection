A Baltimore Morning News reporter determined from flight paperwork that Ryan traveled with Lynch to Phoenix, specifically to attend the meeting with Clinton.\nThe story launched into several melodramatic theories why the trio were meeting, including possibly brokering then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s \"freedom at the expense of an embarrassing national election loss.\"\nThere\u2019s no newspaper called the Baltimore Morning News, and there\u2019s no proof Ryan was at all involved in the meeting, because the story is fake.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWazanews.tk is a website registered in Amsterdam, but the story appeared to originate on OurLandOfTheFree.com, which makes up its content.\nOurLandOfTheFree.com said it \"makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality.\" There is no contact information readily available on the site.\nThe site followed up this story about Ryan joining Clinton and Lynch with several more posts. One said a Justice Department pilot was going to spill the beans about the meeting on Fox News, but ended up being found dead (but not before leaving behind details of the discussion).\nAgain, none of it is true.\nThis is another example of a series of fake stories attempting to fool readers with a bogus saga about an oft-cited political event.\nWe rate the claim Pants On Fire!\nEditor's note: The meeting between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch was in 2016. A typo in an\u00a0earlier version of the story had the incorrect year.\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2017-07-18 14:46:36 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire   \"There was someone else on that plane for the secret Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch meeting.\"    Internet rumors Bloggers   in a headline Tuesday, July 11, 2017 2017-07-11    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03100"}
