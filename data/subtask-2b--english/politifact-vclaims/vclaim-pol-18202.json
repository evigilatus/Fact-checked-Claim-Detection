Here's why", "text": "Boasting about his administration\u2019s response to the novel coronavirus \u2014 and arguing the outbreak would soon be under control \u2014 President Donald Trump claimed that recent American efforts to test widely for COVID-19 surpass those of other countries.\n\"We've done more tests in eight days than South Korea has done in eight weeks,\" Trump said during a March 24 virtual town hall hosted by Fox News, re-iterating a statement made just moments prior by Dr. Deborah Birx, the head of the White House coronavirus response. The statement was repeated during the White House briefing that evening.\nTrump doubled down the next day, tweeting that \"over an eight day span, the United States now does more testing than what South Korea (which has been a very successful tester) does over an eight week span.\"\nWhy the comparison with South Korea? South Korea has been heralded globally for its swift response to the pandemic, which appears to have slowed its rate of new infections.\nMeanwhile, a national shortage of tests has hamstrung American efforts, resulting in many people at risk being forced to delay testing until they are seriously ill.\nWith that context, we were curious. Is the president\u2019s claim accurate? Has American testing been as robust as his statement indicates?\nWe contacted the White House and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but we never heard back. But the numbers suggest his picture is inaccurate and, more importantly, missing crucial context to understanding the battle against COVID-19.\nThe raw numbers\nSouth Korea publishes a daily report of how many tests it\u2019s performed. As of March 24, about 348,582 people had been tested, and testing began in early February. About 9,000 of those people were confirmed positives for the virus. (The 345,582 figure includes tests that were run, but hadn\u2019t yet yielded a positive or negative answer.)\nIn the United States, it\u2019s harder to tell. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn\u2019t put out updated, aggregated counts of tests performed in public and private labs \u2014 which is important. Since the start of March, a large chunk of American-done tests have been conducted in commercial \u2014 not government-run \u2014 labs.\nExperts pointed us to a credible tally that suggests that, on the raw numbers, the president\u2019s stat is flawed.\nThe COVID Tracking Project, a dataset managed and updated by volunteer journalists and scientists, estimates that, as of March 24, American labs performed a total of 359,000 tests for COVID-19. That number comes from state and local health departments around the country, including testing done in both public and commercial labs.\nBetween March 15 and March 24, the United States conducted about 331,000 tests, per the tracker.\nThe raw comparison, then, suggests that the United States\u2019 eight-day tally falls short of South Korea\u2019s eight-week tally. Out of curiosity, we looked at the March 23 data for South Korea as well. At that point, they had run 338,036 tests. So even if Trump was off by a day, the American figure still falls short.\nMore importantly, experts reminded us, this raw-data comparison isn\u2019t that meaningful. If you want to compare between the two countries, you need to look at the bigger picture.\nMore effective comparisons\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Scalise\n\n\nstated on February 2, 2021 in an interview on Fox News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNow (Biden) is saying that people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Victoria Knight \u2022 February 8, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut simply, \"raw numbers are not the best metric, given population size differences,\" said Jennifer Kates, a global health researcher at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\nThat\u2019s because the United States is simply a much larger country than South Korea \u2014 about 327 million people, compared to about 51.5 million.\nTo account for that, researchers serious about comparing the nations\u2019 responses would adjust to per-capita rates of testing. That shows the extent to which the number of tests performed accounts for helping people at risk of infection.\n\"If a country has five people in it, of course they could only have five tests,\" said Dr. Robert Gallo, director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and a co-discoverer of HIV.\nWhen you control for population, the American response compares poorly. Its current tally of 359,000 tests per 327 million people comes out to about 1,084 tests per million. South Korea has run closer to 6,768 tests per million.\nPut another way, South Korea\u2019s testing rate for coronavirus is more than 6 times that of the American rate. To catch up, Kates noted, American labs would need to perform 2.24 million more tests \u2014 not an insurmountable task, but definitely a lift.\nIt\u2019s not just the number of tests performed, either. Researchers have stressed repeatedly that the timing of when the tests were run is also a big part of the equation. Both nations reported their first cases on the same day, Jan. 20.\nIn the entire month of February, American labs ran fewer than 1,000 coronavirus tests, per the volunteer COVID tracker. (Government health officials had begun sounding the alarm in January.)\nBy Feb. 29, South Korea had completed more than 55,000 tests, with almost 30,000 awaiting confirmation, for a total of more than 80,000 tests performed.\n\"For the assertion \u2026 the U.S. has done more #COVID19 testing in the last 8 days than South Korea cumulatively, that doesn't mean anything,\" tweeted Dr. Eric Topol, a physician and researcher. \"Nearly 0 tests were done for 2 months when they were desperately needed.\"\nWhat\u2019s needed now\nMany public health researchers say the U.S. is still not running enough diagnostics daily to meet demand \u2014 arguing that, though there has been significant improvement, labs need to be doing about 150,000 tests per day.\nRight now, the COVID tracker suggests about 65,000 tests are being run per day. While that is a substantial increase from even a week ago, it\u2019s still well below the target number.\nBeyond testing, there\u2019s the question of what happened after results were confirmed. Patients infected, epidemiologists argue, should be targeted, caught early and quickly separated from other people. That\u2019s a key step to stopping the spread of the virus \u2013 and something that still hasn\u2019t happened on a large scale.\n\"South Korea followed up tests vigorously to support isolation and quarantine \u2014 the steps needed to reduce spread,\" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for Public Health Practice and Community Engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. \"The U.S. has a long ways to go to develop this critical capacity.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump claimed that the United States has \"done more tests in eight days than South Korea has done in eight weeks.\"\nThe CDC has not put out comprehensive data on this. But independent work on the subject suggests the comparison is flawed. In eight days, the United States performed almost as many tests as South Korea did in eight weeks, but not necessarily more.\nIn addition, that statistic is relatively less important. The American rate of testing per capita is more than six times lower than South Korea\u2019s. It\u2019s certainly possible to catch up, but that hasn\u2019t happened yet.\nThe president\u2019s statement frames the data in a way that is misleading and doesn\u2019t accurately represent the status of the American response to COVID-19.
