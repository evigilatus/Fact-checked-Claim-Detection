Several States have sued the Trump administration for its executive order, which temporarily prohibits migration and travel from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa. A federal court judge in Seattle ruled on 3 February that the federal Government could not enforce the executive order as long as the case was pending. The Department &apos; s lawyers appealed against this decision to the Ninth Circuit, which hears cases from most of the United States, Alaska and Hawaii. On February 9, a panel of three judges unanimously decided to confirm the decision of the Seattle judge. (The court did not decide whether the executive order was lawful. This will happen later.) The administration could try to appeal their case again, this time before the Supreme Court. Right after the judges made their decision, Trump tweeted, \"You're in court, our nation's security in Stick!\" As Hanetti observed, the Ninth Circuit has a reputation for being liberal. However, we wondered whether it was true when he said that the Supreme Court was abolishing cases from the ninth chamber more than any other court of appeal in the country - implying that the ninth division was incompatible with the Supreme Court. In our research, we found that the Ninth Circle has a higher than average reverse rate, but not higher. In addition, experts told us that counting the implications does not necessarily mean much about the quality or substance of the work of the Ninth Circle. In order to evaluate this claim, we have moved to the Supreme Court Statistics Archives, namely, SCOTUSBLog, which follows the extent to which the Supreme Court judges agree or disagree with the lower court decisions. The Supreme Court hears cases from 50 state courts and 13 federal courts of appeal, known as district courts. The lower courts often dispute cases that the Supreme Court chooses to hear, which are complex and problematic, so there is a reasonable possibility that the Supreme Court will decide that the lower court decision was wrong. In fact, the Supreme Court reflected about 70 per cent of the cases it had taken between 2010 and 15. Of the cases reviewed by the Court of Appeal, the ninth instance reflected about 79 per cent. The reflection rate of the Ninth Circuit is higher than the average, but not the absolute highest among the Circuit Courts. This distinction goes to the Sixth Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee, with an average of 87 percent between 2010 and 15. The ninth circle is in third place. \u2219 Sixth Circuit - 87 per cent; Eleventh Circuit - 85 per cent; Ninth Circuit - 79 per cent; Third Circuit - 78 per cent; Second Circuit and Federal District - 68 per cent; Eighth Circuit - 67 per cent; By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, 5th Circuit - 66%; 7th Circuit - 48%; Capital District - 45%; 1st and 4th Circuit - 43%; 10th Circuit - 42%. We also found that the Ninth Circuit did not have the highest reverse rate in any individual mandate period between 2004 and 15. (This is as far as we can go back.) A Haniti spokesman referred to a 2014 article in National River magazine entitled \"The new circle leading the herd for'most reverse'.\" But the evidence presented in the article does not support the headline. Thus, Hanetti's claim that the Ninth Circuit is the \"most coupling court in the country\" is incorrect. The Supreme Court hears only a few cases from each district each year, so the rate of reflection is very variable, as stated by Jonah Gilbach, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania and a statistical expert. In 2014, for example, the Second Circuit had a 100 per cent reverse rate, which seems very bad until it finds out that the Supreme Court heard only one case from the Second Circuit that entire season. The Ninth Circuit is the largest circle ever. In the 12 months preceding March, 31, 2015, slightly less than 12,000 cases were filed in the 9th Circuit - more than 4,000 from the next largest Chamber, the 5th Circuit. Despite this huge file, the Supreme Court heard only 11 cases from the Ninth Circuit in 2015, reflecting eight cases. This means that the Supreme Court usually denounces less than 1 per cent of all cases decided by the Ninth Circuit (and other Chambers). \"In view of the small number of cases involved, it may be difficult to draw any serious conclusions from such statistics on the quality of the courts concerned,\" Gilbach said. \"After he said that, the Ninth Circuit seems to have consistently had a high rate of coup over time.\" It is likely that the absolute size of the Ninth Circuit, as well as some of its proceedings, makes it \"weird decisions,\" cases that the Supreme Court has always reflected, more than others - leading to a higher reverse rate, as stated by the Professor of Law of the University of Pennsylvania Kermit Roosevelt. Roosevelt said that there might have been a time in the past when the Ninth Circuit was much more liberal than the Supreme Court, because of the fact that Democratic President Jimmy Carter did not have the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court judge, even though he appointed several judges to the Ninth Circuit. Today, the Ninth Chamber may still have the largest number of democratic appointees in any court of appeal, but there has been enough change in the past few decades so that it is not as surprising as Roosevelt said. Our verdict, Hannity, said that the ninth precinct was \"the most court that's turned over in the country.\" While the Ninth Circuit has a higher than average reverse rate among the cases it sends to the Supreme Court, it has not recorded the highest rate since at least 2004 (the oldest data point we can find). Even if that were to happen, the experts told us that the huge size of the Ninth Circuit compared to a handful of cases that it sends to the Supreme Court each year makes the rates of regression an incomplete measure of the quality of the decisions of the Ninth Circuit. More generally, experts say that these statistics are a poor way of comparing courts. We're appreciating Hannity's false claim. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/71a91833-9701-4d94-8ae4-023f5a3fe5d6", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03683"}
