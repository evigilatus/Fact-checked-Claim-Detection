Why do they say that?\" Carson continued. \"Because of the high homicide rate, particularly in our large, inner cities; because there are more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than there are in higher education.\"\nAre there more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than in college?\nPrevious factcheck \nTo back Carson\u2019s statement, a spokeswoman for his presidential exploratory committee initially cited a December 2014 factcheck from PolitiFact Rhode Island that touched on the first part of Carson\u2019s statement. That factcheck was on a\u00a0claim that there were more African-American men in prison or jail, or on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850. Our colleagues rated it True.\nBut that rating doesn\u2019t help Carson\u2019s claim, given that the figures pertained to all adult black males in the criminal justice system, rather than young ones.\nWhen we contacted the spokeswoman again, she cited statistics for black males ages 18 to 24, which would correspond to young black males in college. The statistics cited for involvement in the criminal justice system\u00a0are from a U.S. Department of Justice report on arrests in 2010.\nBut that report counted the number of arrests of black people, not the number of black people arrested. Some people, of course, get arrested more than once in a year.\nAside from that, there\u2019s also an issue with using arrests as a definition for being involved in the criminal justice system.\u00a0There\u2019s no dispute that someone who is in jail or prison, or is on probation or parole, is involved in the system. But many arrests go away without any criminal charges being filed. And not all charges result in convictions.\n\"Involvement in the criminal justice system is usually defined as being in prison or jail or being on probation, parole, or pretrial supervision,\" Craig Prins, research director of the Public Safety Performance Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts, told us. \"Even under that standard definition, it\u2019s very difficult to say with certainty how these numbers stack up because the data rarely identify offenders across all three variables of age, race, and sex.\"\nIndeed, as we\u2019ll see, the federal government does not produce many criminal justice statistics that count black males ages 18 to 24.\nCriminal justice system\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe contacted the Department of Justice about Carson\u2019s claim and were referred to several reports for the latest figures.\nArrests: There were nearly 3 million arrests of black adults in 2012. (And again, that\u2019s a count of arrests, not people.) But there is no breakdown for black males ages 18 to 24.\nPrison inmates: There were 526,000 black males in state and federal prisons in 2013. About 14.3 percent, or roughly 75,000, were between the ages of 18 and 24.\nJail inmates: There were 261,500 black people in local jails in mid-2013. But there was no breakdown for the 18 to 24 age group.\nProbation and parole: More than 4.75 million adults of all races were on probation, parole, or some other type of supervision in 2013. But no breakdown by age is available.\nSo, there is only one solid figure -- 75,000 black males ages 18 to 24 in prison. We\u2019re not aware of any recent counts of the black males in that age group who were arrested, in jail, or on probation or parole at a particular time.\nHigher education \nThe higher education part of Carson\u2019s claim is easier to sort out.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau counts by race and with age breakdowns the number of people enrolled in school. For higher education, that includes full- and part-time students in universities and\u00a0colleges, technical colleges and other institutions that award two-year degrees,\u00a0and professional schools such as law schools that award advanced degrees.\nThe latest figures, for 2013, show there were 690,000 males in college, ages 18 to 24, who listed black as their race. The number grows to 779,000 if you include males who identified themselves as black and some other race, such as Asian.\nOur rating\nCarson stated: \"There are more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than there are in higher education,\" later saying he was referring to the 18 to 24 age group.\nCarson did not provide evidence that backs his claim. The latest federal figures we found show 75,000 black males in that age group who were in prison in 2013 and in the range of 690,000 to 779,000 who were in college. We are not aware of any recent figures for the number of black males ages 18 to 24 arrested, in jail, or on probation or parole at any particular time.\nIf figures do surface, we\u2019ll re-evaluate this item, but we rate Carson\u2019s claim False.\u00a0\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06446"}
