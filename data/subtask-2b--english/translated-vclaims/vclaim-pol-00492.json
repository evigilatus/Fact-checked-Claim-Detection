But now a recent Facebook article shares disturbing extracts from a speech by Kissinger on compulsory vaccination, sterilization and extermination services. Here's the complete quote attributed to Kissinger: \"When the herd accepts compulsory vaccination, the game ends! They will accept anything - by force of blood or organs - for \"the greater good.\" We can genetically modify and sterilize children for the \"greatest good.\" You control the minds of sheep and you control the herd. Vaccinators will make billions and many of you in this room today. It's a big win for both sides! We narrow down the herd and the herd pays us for the services of extermination. Now, what's for lunch, huh?\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let us get to the point: this is misleading information. There's no evidence that Kissinger said or wrote this. On 20 January 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated in the article \"World Health Organization (WHO) is blatantly exaggerated that the examination of individuals was positive for the Committee.\" By Noah Y. Kim, 22 January 2021, we found that other copies of the quotation also included the time and place that Kissinger was supposed to have given the address - \"to the Council of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Eugenix, February 25, 2009. However, when we contacted Christine Lindmere, the WHO spokesman, he told us that there were not only records in the WHO archives of the speech, but that \"the WHO Council on Eugenex\" did not exist. \"We don't have records of any such speech,\" Lindmeer Poletti Fuckett wrote in the e-mail. \"Please also note that there is no such \"Council\" as is alleged in the statement, respectively, to be relevant.\" We're also looking at Kissinger's website, which lists many of his letters and interviews, and we haven't been able to find any part of the quote. Kissinger gave a speech at the 45th Munich Security Conference on 6 February 2009, but the discussion did not include vaccination. This fake quote is pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00492"}
