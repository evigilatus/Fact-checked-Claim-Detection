The article features a photo gallery showing Lady de Rothschild at her \"storied English estate.\" Among the photos is one showing her standing in front of a fireplace with a painting by George Stubbs above the hearth called \"Five Brood Mares at the Duke of Cumberland\u2019s Stud Farm.\"\nThe oil painting shows five horses. Not a demon chowing down on children. But a doctored image being shared on social media shows otherwise.\u00a0\n\"Evil mega mass murderer Lynn Rothschild and her eating babies decor,\" reads the description above the photo. \"How conscious are you? What is a few trillion dollars of currency and devil eating baby art to you?\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Forbes, for example, reported in March that conspiracy theorists in Iraq are peddling the idea that the Rothschilds are behind the coronavirus pandemic. In certain corners of the internet, Lynn Forester de Rothschild has been named in connection with the unfounded belief that powerful people across the globe are involved in a child sex trafficking operation. But there is no evidence to support that theory, and this photo of her is obviously a hoax.\u00a0\nWe rate it Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17766"}
