Bill Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) doesn\u2019t want that to happen.\n\nDuring a Nov. 16 House hearing, Pascrell spoke against the proposed National Right-To-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011. If H.R. 822 becomes law, states that allow people to carry concealed weapons would be required to recognize other states\u2019 valid concealed carry permits. At least 40 states already have some form of reciprocity for out-of-state concealed carry permits. The bill has been referred in the Senate to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\nIn opposing the bill, Pascrell said, \"We haven't had any legislation which took away one gun in the past 20 years from anybody in this country -- not one.\"\n\nPascrell\u2019s spokesman, Paul Brubaker said the congressman was specifically referring to federal legislation, noting that his \"point would have beeen clearer had he specified that he was referring to nonviolent, law-abiding gun owners.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey found Pascrell\u2019s argument somewhat on target.\n\nBut two gun-rights organizations we spoke with say two laws do take guns from people.\n\nLarry Pratt, executive director of Virginia-based Gun Owners of America, and Joe Waldron, legislative director for the Washington state-based Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, both said a provision of The Violent\u00a0Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned semiautomatic weapons with detachable devices. That, in effect, takes a weapon away from someone who wants it, they said.\n\nBrubaker disagreed.\n\n\"The 1994 federal assault weapons ban prohibited for 10 years the possession, transfer, and manufacturing of semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices,\" Brubaker said in an email. \"However, there was a grandfather clause in the bill, and semiautomatic assault weapons that were legally-owned before the ban went into effect were NOT restricted. Those weapons could be transferred and sold within the confines of federal and state laws. \u2026 Neither the assault weapons ban, nor any federal prohibition of particular guns from being imported, resulted in the federal government taking legally-owned guns away from Americans.\"\n\nWaldron also pointed to The Domestic Violence Gun Ban, more commonly called the Lautenberg Amendment for its author, Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ). The amendment to the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997 bans anyone convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense from owning or possessing a firearm, even if the person had it\u00a0before the conviction. The law requires that person to immediately surrender the weapon \u2013 but not necessarily to law enforcement.\n\nThat person\u2019s gun and ammunition should be transferred \u00a0to a \"third party who may lawfully receive and possess them, such as their attorney, a local police agency, or a federal firearms dealer. In addition, such firearms and ammunition are subject to seizure and forfeiture,\" according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms\u00a0and Explosives\u00a0website.\n\nThe result of the Lautenberg Amendment \"is that people have been disarmed of weapons within the past 20 years and they\u2019ve been sent to prison when they\u2019ve been caught in possession,\" Waldron said.\n\nThe consequences of one\u2019s actions are central to the issue, according to ATF\u00a0spokesperson Ginger Colbrun. As an example, she said that if a gun owner is convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence, the person\u2019s actions are to blame for him no longer being allowed to possess a weapon -- not the law.\n\n\"It really is semantics when you look at it,\" she said.\u00a0\n\nBut the person still\u00a0has to give up the gun and to some, that's taking it away.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPascrell said there hasn\u2019t been any legislation in the past 20 years that took a gun from anyone in the United States. Gun advocates disagree, pointing to the federal crime bill and the Lautenberg Amendment as examples.\u00a0But the facts are a gun can't be taken from someone who never had it, and\u00a0having to surrender a\u00a0gun\u00a0because of a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction\u00a0can be construed as\u00a0it\u00a0being taken away.\u00a0We\u00a0rate Pascrell\u2019s claim\u00a0Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCory Booker\n\n\nstated on October 13, 2011 in a radio interview on WBGO\u2019s \u201cNewark Today\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays \"if you are shot in the city of Newark, you have over an 80 percent chance that you've been arrested before an average of 10 times.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Erin O'Neill \u2022 October 24, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.\n\nEditor's Note: This story was initially published by accident with a Mostly True ruling.
