Yes, really.\nIt all started going down Jan. 24 when B.o.B. tweeted a picture of himself at a high elevation, with two distant cities \u2014 but no discernable curve \u2014 on the horizon.\n\nHe then tweeted a series of images intended to raise questions about the fact that the Earth is round.\n\"I'm going up against the greatest liars in history,\" he wrote. \"You've been tremendously deceived.\"\nStep in, Tyson. The popular astrophysicist published a brief series of tweets to counter B.o.B., including the fact that the Earth\u2019s curve does shield part of the Manhattan skyline from a distance, but the buildings are too tall to be fully obscured.\nTyson ended with: \"Duude \u2014 to be clear: Being five centuries regressed in your reasoning doesn\u2019t mean we all can\u2019t still like your music.\"\nThe debate escalated when both B.o.B. and Tyson dropped rap tracks, Tyson\u2019s rapped by his nephew, calling each other out (sample lyric: \"I'm bringing facts to combat a silly theory because B.o.B has gotta know the planet is a sphere, G\").\nWe won\u2019t attempt to rap; we\u2019d only embarrass ourselves. But we did ask a few astronomers what they would tell B.o.B. to convince him the Earth is round.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, this is a settled question. Since at least the ancient Greeks, people have had a hunch that the Earth is round, and it has been accepted as a universal truth for the past few centuries.\nCornell University astronomy professor Lisa Kaltenegger pointed out the obvious: Pictures and videos taken from space clearly show the Earth is spherical. For example, NASA scientist Reid Wiseman took this timelapse from the International Space Station.\n\nShe said there\u2019s an experiment B.o.B. and others could do. He could fly from the East Coast to Australia, going over Europe and Asia. Then he could fly back going over the Pacific Ocean and landing on the West Coast. If the Earth was flat, you would not be able to take both routes to and from a single destination.\nIt\u2019s a modern-day version of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan\u2019s 16th century voyage, the very first circumnavigation of the globe.\nWe also know the Earth is round because of the curved shape of the Earth\u2019s shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse, said Raymond Jeanloz, an astronomy professor at the University of California Berkeley.\nFurther, the planet reacts to earthquakes in a very different way than it would if the Earth were a flat plane, Jeanloz said. Then there\u2019s time zones, the fact that the sun appears at different angles at the same time in different locations.\nAnd, while you have to be fairly high up with clear skies to see the Earth\u2019s curve, you can observe the effects of curvature from the Earth\u2019s surface by watching a large ship go over the horizon, disappearing from the bottom up.\nCould there be a global conspiracy to hide the fact that the Earth is flat? No way, said David Trilling, an astronomy professor at Northern Arizona University. Millions of people and many countries, as well as numerous private corporations, would all have to be in on it, and they would somehow have to keep all the evidence concealed in the age of Buzzfeed and Wikileaks, he said.\n\"There is no chance that a secret that big could be concealed,\" he said. Rather, \"the evidence for a round Earth is abundant and all around us.\"\nOur ruling\nRapper B.o.B. said, \"You've been tremendously deceived\" by people who say the Earth is not flat.\nThe world\u2019s scientists have gathered proof that the Earth is round for centuries. Now that we\u2019re in an age where we can view the Earth from space, we can say with certainty that our planet is spherical. Even without a spaceship, we can see the effects of a round Earth by watching a ship on the horizon or looking out of an airplane window on a clear day. B.o.B.\u2019s claim is Pants on Fire!\nCorrection: Ferdinand Magellan was\u00a0Portuguese, not Spanish.
