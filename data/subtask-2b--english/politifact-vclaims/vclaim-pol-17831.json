It was taken by a Getty photographer in November 2019 in Santiago, Chile, where demonstrators pointed lasers at riot police during a protest against inequality and the policies of Chilean President Sebastian Pinera. The updated post says, \"This picture is from protests in Chile however the protesters are also using them in Portland.\"\nOver the past decade, protesters around the world have increasingly used laser pointers to distract or repel riot police, according to a 2019 report in The Atlantic magazine. They\u2019re also used in celebrations, to show solidarity in groups, or to communicate.\u00a0\nProtesters in Portland have shined lasers at federal officers and at security cameras surrounding the courthouse to try to block the officers\u2019 view of the crowd, according to the New York Times.\u00a0\nIn a March story about the use of lasers in protests, the Harvard Political Review wrote that lasers may temporarily blind people when shined directly into the eye and, \"in the most extreme cases, laser pointers may seriously burn the retina, causing permanent blindness.\"\nBut this photo does not show Portland protesters trying to blind federal officers.\u00a0\nWe rate this miscaptioned post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17831"}
