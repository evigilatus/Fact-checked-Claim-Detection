As they spoke, Trump repeatedly claimed that he won the contest in the state, despite the final count that delivered victory to President-elect Joe Biden.\n\"We won very substantially, Georgia. You even see it by rally size, frankly,\" Trump said at the beginning of the call with Brad Raffensperger, according to an audio recording.\nTrump echoed his claim several times in the call, at one point saying: \"We won Georgia easily. We won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But if you go by basic, simple numbers, we won it easily, easily.\"\nRaffensperger during the call rejected Trump\u2019s assertions: \"Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong.\"\nElection results in Georgia were counted three times: the initial count, an audit-triggered hand recount, and a formal recount requested by the Trump campaign. Both recounts supported the original outcome: that Biden won in the state. The election results were certified in late November and recertified Dec. 7.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a close race, but the margin of victory was in the thousands.
