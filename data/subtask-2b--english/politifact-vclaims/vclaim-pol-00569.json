The school psychologists provide the first line of treatment and often set in motion any necessary referrals to specialists. Their role is complicated by the fact that, beyond school walls, there is a serious shortage of adolescent and child psychiatrists.\nIt\u2019s a problem, Biden said, given that \"too many of our children are not getting the mental health care they need from a trained professional.\"\nThis talking point about school psychologist ratios suggests a glaring gap in health care services, and in an area where need is only growing.\nWith that in mind, we decided to dig in. We reached out to Biden\u2019s press team for comment but never heard back.\nA controversial figure\nBiden appears to be using a number promoted by the National Association of School Psychologists, a Washington-based trade group. That statistic comes from the organization\u2019s 2015 membership survey, which found a 1,381-to-1 ratio of students to psychologists \u2014 which is \"roughly 1,400.\"\nBut this tally is not ironclad. \u00a0\nThough NASP sent the survey to a nationally representative sample, the requirement that participants send back responses affects the results of such a survey.\n\"There are always limitations when you have a process of self-reporting. Those limitations are recognized,\" said Eric Rossen, NASP\u2019s director of professional development and standards. \"For now, this is the best data we have. \u2026 It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s the best there is.\"\nThere are other numbers and sources to consider, too.\nThe Department of Education sent us its data from the 2015-16 National Teacher and Principal Survey. It found about 49 million kids enrolled in public schools, and, nationally, about 44,210 full-time psychologists employed by schools.\nThat yields a ratio of roughly 1,115-to-1 \u2014 still nowhere near what experts say is appropriate, but slightly less stark than the 1,400 figure. This is at least in part because DOE\u2019s survey does not differentiate between a school psychologist \u2014a specific discipline within the field \u2014 and any other kind of psychologist a school might employ. This category could include specialties such as clinical, developmental, cognitive or child psychology, among others.\nThe DOE tracks the extent to which schools employ guidance counselors, nurses, psychologists, social workers, speech therapists and \"other professional staff.\" (If one counted those, it would yield an even more favorable ratio.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n By Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo these distinctions matter?\nNASP says yes, arguing that school psychologists are trained in a way that gives them specific, distinct advantages in navigating the educational system \u2014 for instance, helping teachers adapt their work to better educate kids with learning disorders \u2014 and that they better understand school-specific concerns like discipline, violence prevention and helping families adapt to a school culture.\nStill, it\u2019s not a settled issue.\n\"A school psychologist is great. I would even say a counselor, a therapist, a social worker \u2014 there are any number of potential therapists that have the skills and can detect these issues and refer,\" said Dr. Brian Greenfield, a child psychiatrist who directs the emergency psychiatry service at the Montreal Children's Hospital, and who has researched children\u2019s mental health in the United States.\nA growing need, but no one solution\nThat said, whichever number you look at, Biden\u2019s bigger point appears true \u2014 children don\u2019t have enough opportunities to get mental health care in schools.\nBiden\u2019s 700-1 aspirational ratio also comes from an analysis by NASP, Rossum said. The group looked at previous surveys, finding that school psychologists were best able to care for students when the ratio hovered between at least 500-to-1 and 700-to-1.\nBoth the 1,115 and 1,400 ratios mask wide national disparities. DOE\u2019s data suggests that more than 13 million students go to school without any psychologist on staff. More than 1 million students go to schools that not only do not have a psychologist on staff, but also no guidance counselor or social worker.\nFor its part, NASP\u2019s data shows that in some parts of the country, the ratio can be as high as 1 school psychologist per 4,000 students.\nAnd the consequences are significant. Evidence suggests children are experiencing increased rates of mental health problems. For instance, research published in April found that the number of kids reporting suicidal thoughts in the emergency room went up significantly between 2007 and 2015. (Greenfield, the Montreal psychiatrist, co-authored that paper.)\nPreventive mental health care could help address this trend. Most students who receive this care get at least their first assessment in schools. And if there isn\u2019t someone on hand to provide it, they probably go without.\nThat said, Greenfield noted, the school psychologist is only one part of a team. Lots of school employees \u2014 teachers, guidance counselors and administrators \u2014 could be trained to notice when something is wrong. The next step is likely more crucial, he said: referring the child to a clinic or other specialized setting for mental health care. That brings its own set of challenges, like confronting the shortage of pediatric psychologists nationally.\n\"Bravo to our politicians that have this in their heads and want to address it, but we can\u2019t expect one school psychologist to be able to do it all, even if you increase the ratio in the school,\" he said.\nOur rating\nBiden\u2019s specific claim about school psychologist-to-student ratios is correct, and it reflects a substantial problem for adolescent and pediatric mental health. But focusing on school psychologists alone doesn't encompass the entire issue.\u00a0\nAnd given the broader point he is making \u2014 that many kids cannot access mental health care in schools \u2014 his statement would benefit from more context.\u00a0\nChildren may not have a \"school psychologist,\" but may still attend a school where another kind of psychologist or mental health professional is employed. That means they can still get care from a \"trained professional,\" even though the provider doesn\u2019t have the same level of specialty training.\nBiden\u2019s claim is accurate but needs additional information.
