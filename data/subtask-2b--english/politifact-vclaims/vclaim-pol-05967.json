Several of the candidates blasted the deal between the United States, Iran and several world powers -- including the former governor of Arkansas..\n\"We've just now given over $100 billion (to Iran),\" Huckabee said. \"The equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion.\"\nWe\u2019ve looked into similar claims before, so we decided to take a look at Huckabee\u2019s version.\nThe $100 billion\nIt\u2019s true that Iran will reap significant economic benefits from the deal, because many sanctions levied against Iran will be lifted if Iran complies with restrictions on its nuclear program. Iran will have access to a good deal of these funds within several months of the deal being enacted, said Matthew Kroenig, a professor of international relations at Georgetown University.\nHuckabee made it sound as if the United States is giving some kind of subsidy or compensation. But the money already belongs to Iran; Iran just hasn\u2019t been able to access it. In similar claims by other candidates and officials, the $100 billion figure has referred to the dollar amounts of Iran\u2019s foreign assets that could be unfrozen when sanctions are lifted. An example is money Iran earned from selling oil but is held by a foreign bank.\nIt also includes the billions of dollars Iran has lost in revenues and opportunity costs because the country has not been able to fully participate in the global marketplace, said Michael Malloy, a law professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law and an expert on economic sanctions, in a prior interview with PolitiFact.\nEstimates of the value of Iran\u2019s foreign assets start as low as $25 billion, and they run as high as $150 billion. Most experts we\u2019ve interviewed on this question peg the amount of unfrozen assets at about $100 billion, but no one is 100 percent sure of the amount.\nIran has financial obligations other than the sanctions, so even if all the sanctions are lifted, Iranian officials won\u2019t suddenly have all of these assets at their disposal. For example, Iran owes billions to China for infrastructure projects. The lower estimates take into account restrictions on the money other than the sanctions, said Richard Nephew, an expert on economic sanctions at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, also in a prior interview.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration has said that after Iran pays its outstanding financial obligations, it will have about $56 billion at its disposal.\nHow does this translate into $5 trillion in America?\nThe $5 trillion\nBased on a prior fact-check, we can deduce that Huckabee is comparing the Iranian and U.S. economies based on gross domestic product, the standard measurement of an economy\u2019s size.\nAccording to the World Bank, Iran\u2019s economy is $415 billion. So the $100 billion in sanctions relief amounts to about 25 percent of the economy. The United States\u2019 economy is about $17 trillion. Twenty-five percent of that is $4.25 trillion -- a little low but not too far off from Huckabee\u2019s $5 trillion.\nIt\u2019s not a perfect measurement, said Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University, who said she would be more interested in comparing the two in terms of GDP per capita.\nThough, \"I do think it gives an interesting comparison of the scale,\" Sinclair said of Huckabee\u2019s claim.\nOur ruling\nHuckabee said, \"We've just now given over $100 billion (to Iran). The equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion.\"\nHuckabee\u2019s $100 billion figure is one of the most commonly cited estimates of how much the Iranian economy will reap from sanctions relief under the Iran deal, though no one is fully certain of the amount. But he gives a misleading impression of the transaction by implying the United States is giving the money to Iran when it would just unfreeze the assets.\nWe rate Huckabee\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05967"}
