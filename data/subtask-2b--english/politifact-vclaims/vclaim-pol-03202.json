Gabby Giffords\u2019 shooting", "truth_label": "false", "date": "stated on June 14, 2017 in a New York Times editorial:", "title": "No evidence Sarah Palin\u2019s PAC incited shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords", "text": "After a lone gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers June 14 while they practiced baseball, the New York Times published an editorial that broadly condemned political violence but sparked controversy with a claim about the motive behind a 2011 attack on a Democratic member of Congress.\nThe New York Times has since issued a correction following broad criticism.\nThe original editorial claimed that maps circulated by Sarah Palin's PAC amounted to \"political incitement,\" which the authors said was clearly linked to the subsequent 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz.\n\"In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear,\" the uncorrected editorial read. \"Before the shooting, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.\"\nThe editorial, penned amid the frenzy of the mass shooting, sought to connect the attack on GOP lawmakers with the 2011 Giffords shooting to make a broader point about politically motivated violence. The piece reasoned that the latest attack, which left the gunman dead and four injured, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R\u2013La., was probably \"evidence of how vicious American politics has become,\" and that the shooter\u2019s derangement \"found its fuel in politics.\"\nThe editorial ran into trouble when it turned its focus to the Giffords shooting, so we decided to explore why the connection between Palin\u2019s PAC and Loughner\u2019s motivation is problematic.\nWhat we know about the Giffords shooters\u2019 motivations\nAccording to news reports, Loughner became fixated on Giffords several years before his Jan. 8, 2011, shooting rampage that killed six and injured 14, including the Arizona congresswoman.\nLoughner first met Giffords in 2007 at a community event where he asked her a question and was \"unsatisfied with her answer,\" CNN reported. It was at this point he developed a fixation for the lawmaker.\nSeveral years elapsed between the time Loughner first met Giffords and when Palin posted a note to Facebook that linked to her political action committee. The PAC circulated a map of House Democrats' districts (not individual members) the GOP would seek to recapture.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, there is no evidence Loughner was aware of Palin's maps. And according to an interview with one of Loughner's high school friends, the gunman did not watch the news. His rampage was akin to \"shooting at the world,\" said Loughner\u2019s friend Zach Osler.\nLoughner was ultimately sentenced to serve seven consecutive life terms plus 140 years, without the possibility of parole.\nNew York Times\u2019 correction\nThe uncorrected editorial appeared in today\u2019s print version of the newspaper, and was available online between roughly 9 p.m. June 14 and 10 a.m. June 15, a spokesperson said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt some point before 11 a.m. this morning, staffers removed the language about the clear link between political incitement and Giffords\u2019 shooting, and issued the following correction:\n\"An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords,\" the correction reads. \"In fact, no such link was established.\"\nThe New York Times\u2019 Opinion twitter account also issued a pair of mea culpas.\n\"We got an important fact wrong, incorrectly linking political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Giffords. No link was ever established,\" read the first tweet from the\u00a0NYT Opinion account.\nWe're sorry about this and we appreciate that our readers called us on the mistake. We've corrected the editorial. https://t.co/t1FZ3iEYQJ pic.twitter.com/k7WW5uJIQO\u2014 NYT Opinion (@nytopinion) June 15, 2017\n\nA follow-up tweet read:\u00a0\"We're sorry about this and we appreciate that our readers called us on the mistake. We've corrected the editorial.\"\nAround 4 p.m., the New York Times amended its correction to clarify its description of the maps distributed by Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee.\n\"The editorial has also been updated to clarify that in a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting, electoral districts, not Democratic lawmakers, were depicted beneath stylized cross hairs,\" it read.\nOur ruling\nThe New York Times editorial board said a political map circulated by Palin\u2019s PAC incited Rep. Gabby Giffords\u2019 shooting.\nWe were unable to find evidence Loughner was even aware of the maps, and a friend told an interviewer Loughner did not closely watch the news. \u00a0\nThe New York Times corrected its story some 13 hours after publication to say no such link has been established between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Giffords.\nAt PolitiFact, our rulings are based on when a statement was made.
