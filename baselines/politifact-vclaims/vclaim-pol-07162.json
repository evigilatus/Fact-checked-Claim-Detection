Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist, Scott repeatedly hammered Crist for jobs lost during his tenure.\nScott said that 832,000 jobs\u00a0were lost during Crist\u2019s tenure. Crist -- who served from January 2007 through January 2011 as a Republican but is now running as a Democrat -- countered that he governed during a global economic meltdown.\n\"One of the decisions I made to get us through it was to work with the president so that we would have funds available to keep teachers on the job. Now, Rick Scott has said taking the recovery was an absolute mistake, which would have led to the firing of 20,000 teachers.\"\nCrist used the term firing, which isn't quite accurate, since these would have been layoffs. However, we don't see this as a serious issue, because the context makes clear the kind of job losses\u00a0he's talking about.\nIs it true that by taking federal stimulus dollars Crist saved 20,000 teachers from being laid off?\nStimulus money saved jobs\nCrist made a similar statement when he announced he was running for governor in St. Petersburg in November. It is one of many back-and-forth attacks about education funding and teacher layoffs hurled between the two candidates.\nCrist\u2019s statement refers to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the $787 billion federal stimulus bill pushed by President Barack Obama and passed by Congress in 2009.\nThe Florida Department of Education published information in 2010 about how many \"instructional personnel\" the Recovery Act affected. The department identified 19,166 full-time equivalent jobs affecting a total 31,003 employees for the quarter ending June 30, 2010. Instructional personnel included classroom teachers as well as other school employees including guidance counselors, librarians and audio-visual workers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.

(Smith was appointed by Crist.)\nThe stimulus money was paid out over two years: In 2009-10, nearly $908 million went to K-12 education, and another $873 million the year after, according to Ruth Melton, director of government relations for the Florida School Boards Association.\n\"The infusion of this federal cash was tremendously important in keeping school districts solvent during the recession,\"\u00a0Melton told PolitiFact Florida when we first looked into this claim in 2013.\nBut it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the exact number of teachers who would have been laid off without the federal infusion of money, because we can\u2019t predict how each district would have handled their own budgets. Some districts with healthier reserves might have avoided or minimized layoffs more than other districts. Or perhaps they would have found ways other than teacher cuts to reduce their budgets.\n\"It could have meant actually more teachers than reported,\" Melton said. At the other extreme, some districts could have laid off more expensive teachers who were close to retirement -- and that could have lowered the number.\nOur ruling\nCrist said that if Florida had not taken the stimulus it \"would have led to the firing of 20,000 teachers.\"\nThe Education Department identified 19,166 full-time equivalent jobs affected by the stimulus money. That\u2019s close to what Crist said, but that figure includes not just teachers but other types of school workers as well.\nIn addition, it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the exact number of teachers who would have been laid off statewide, since districts would have had discretion in how to handle budget cutting and may have had other options to reduce spending beyond laying off teachers.\nThe statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07162"}
