David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, government documents indicate more than 500 detainees were released or transferred from Guantanamo while George W. Bush was president. A White House executive order issued on the second day of Obama's presidency said, \"\n\nThe federal government has moved more than 500 such detainees from Guant\u00e1namo, either by returning them to their home country\n\nor by\u00a0releasing or transferring them to a third country.\"\n\n\nThat's backed up by a fact sheet from the military task force that runs the detention camp, which says 520 detainees had been released or transferred by March 2009.\n\n\nOur only quibble with Hoyer is his use of the word \"released.\" That could be interpreted to mean that under Bush, 500-plus detainees left the center and were immediately freed. But the Pentagon says there is a difference between a release and a transfer to another country. The vast majority of detainees leave Gitmo under a transfer, which means they are transported to another country that places them under some type of restrictions. Some are incarcerated in those countries because of criminal charges, while others face monitoring or travel limitations.\n\n\nBut Hoyer only said \"released,\" so we'll take him down a notch to Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15713"}
