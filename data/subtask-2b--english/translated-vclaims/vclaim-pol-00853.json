And if you're a member of the Republic of Mark Walker, R-N.C., you've seen enough of them, apparently. This month, Walker makes fun of the political campaign announcements and the home Democrats' plan to help finance them. The video shows an actor playing a political role, watching him run wood by the river. \"Hello there,\" says the actor. \"I'm a politician, I'm trying to do human things so I look graffitiable.\" The Declaration is aimed at human resources 1, the vast electoral bill approved by the Democrats in the House of Representatives on 8 March. Walker, representing the sixth Congressional District of North Carolina, posted it on YouTube on 7 March and distributed it the following day on Twitter and a press release. \"This week, the Democrats of the house will pass from HR 1,\" the actor in the ad says. They call it \"people's law,\" but in fact, it's for my campaign counselor. \"HR1 will take the hard-won tax money and millions more and send it to my campaign so I can put ads on TV,\" he continues. ==History==Polyte Fact North Carolina found the announcement funny, but also interesting. We decided to verify her claims against the text of the bill, which aims to reform the laws surrounding the money in politics but is expected to die in the Senate. Our conclusion: Despite what the Walker Declaration says, the Human Resources 1 public finance programme will not depend on tax dollars, and not all candidates will be eligible to benefit from it. What human resources 1 say about public funding of campaigns is a human resources objective 1 to minimize the impact of major donors and the higher electoral commissions on elections. Human resources 1 would provide a 6 to 1 small dollar contribution match and establish a pilot programme in three states to provide 25 vouchers to eligible voters to give money to candidates for Congress. The Walker Declaration gives the impression that anyone running for federal office will benefit from these provisions, but that is not the case in fact. For beginners, a ratio of 6 to 1 applies only to voluntary contributions of $200 or less, including through the voucher programme. Not all candidates will be allowed to receive identical contributions either. In order to be eligible, they will have to raise $50,000 in small dollar contributions from at least 1,000 persons during the qualifying period, and will have to agree not to accept contributions in excess of $1,000. Ray Laraga, Professor of Political Science and Campaign Finance Expert at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said that eligibility requirements would make the matching program more attractive to some candidates than others. \"My sense is that many Democrats will participate in the reform framework, but perhaps not those who expect very competitive elections,\" he said. \"They don't want to risk getting money for the campaign.\" He added: \"In addition, candidates with ideological followers are likely to benefit from this programme.\" \"Geogeological candidates tend to attract more small donors\" \u25cf Will these programs affect taxpayers? The Walker Declaration indicates that such programmes - and declarations that can help finance them - will be paid for the use of taxpayers &apos; funds. Since the draft law has now been drafted, this is not the case. In fact, the money comes from the new \"Emancipation Fund\" under the United States Department of the Treasury, which collects funds from a 2.75 per cent fee divided by fines, criminal and civil penalties or settlements with banks and companies that commit corporate offences. Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. \u2022 On 29 January 2021, Michael Malbin, Executive Director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a non-profit think tank for campaign financing research, said that the money from the fees would not be taxpayers' money. He said: \"Anything that is financed by sanctions that are not financed by taxpayers.\" Rick Hassen, Professor of Law and Politics, University of California, Irvine, took a less assertive position. \"I think it's possible to discuss whether it's still fair to call it 'tax dollars' used to pay advertising,\" said he added that the money would enter the \"public apartment\" with taxpayers' money even though it's \"not direct tax.\" In any event, the spokesman for Walker Jack Minor said that the fees were not part of the Human Resources 1 version submitted to the House of Representatives in January 3 or the version reported by the Home Management Committee on 4 March. \"Congersman Walker is a member of the Board of Directors of the House of Representatives,\" said Mouther. \"The bill that passed through there... there was no significant funding structure.\" The fees were added through an amendment during a discussion by the Rules Committee on 5 March after the budget office in Congress had estimated the costs of the bill. The previous copies of the bill did not explain where the emancipation fund was supposed to have had the most of its money. But the funding mechanism existed before Walker posted his ad online. There were problems that could arise when fee funds were transferred to the Fund for Freedom from Impact. He said: \"This money will go to the Treasury General Fund where it is mixed with all taxpayers' money as public funds.\" \"A similar amount will then be transferred from the Treasury General Fund to the Fund for Freedom from Impact.\" Noting that the organization had estimated the very high costs of the provisions of the bill, the minor also stated that the funds derived from the fees would not be sufficient to pay for matching contributions and vouchers. \"The federal government takes money from an American citizen is a tax,\" he said. \"When Congress creates irresponsible new funds of funds that inevitably fall short of adequate funding levels, Congress must take money from taxpayers to pay for the deficit.\" However, the bill expressly states that no funds will be withdrawn from outside the Fund for Freedom from Impact and that payments used for vouchers and grants will be reduced if there are not sufficient funds in the Fund. \"In any case where the Committee determines that there are insufficient funds in the Fund to pay the participating candidates under this title, funds may not be made available from any other source for the purpose of making such payments,\" says the Bill. If human resources become 1 law, future legislation can change the funding mechanism to a mechanism based on tax dollars. A similar programme for judicial candidates in North Carolina - which was abolished in 2013 - received half of its funds from a voluntary deduction of $3 from the government tax form, according to a summary of a programme from Democratic North Carolina, an advocacy group focusing on voter participation and funds in politics. So it wouldn't be unusual to see taxes get into the game. However, HR version 1, which has passed, takes specific steps to avoid indulging in taxpayers &apos; funds. The Governor &apos; s Walker Declaration said, \"HR1 will take the hard-won tax money and millions more and send it to a campaign (candidate) even (he) can put advertising on television. The video polishes some of the main details of HR1 to make a misleading impression. First, public funding options in the Bill will not be available to all candidates, in general. In order to be eligible, candidates must meet certain minimum requirements and refuse to accept individual contributions in excess of $1,000. Second, as the bill is currently structured, the program will get money from a fee of 57.2 percent on people and companies that commit irregularities. The Declaration contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. So we evaluate it mostly wrong.
