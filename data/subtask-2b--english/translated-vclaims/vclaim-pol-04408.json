It didn't take long to find out what Trump and Bribos were referring to, but for this fact-checking, we wanted to take a closer look at the full context of Clinton's observations. The line \"Supervisors\" comes from a 1996 speech in New Hampshire, where Clinton spoke in support of the 1994 Violent Crimes and Law Enforcement Act, signed by her husband Bill Clinton. \"We're making some progress,\" said Clinton. \"Part of it relates to an initiative called \"community policing\" because we finally got more police officers on the street. This was one of the objectives of the President when he pushed forward the crime bill passed in 1994.\" The provisions of the law included a ban on certain offensive weapons, increased funding for community policing, and the extension of the death penalty. The legislation, defended by Bill Clinton as a means of reducing the number of African Americans killed in drug-related incidents, has in recent years criticized the fact that disproportionate numbers of African Americans have been sent to prison. The note \"Superbridgedator,\" referred to by Bribos and Trump, was in the same speech after a few lines. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 \"But we also have to have an organized anti-gang effort,\" Hillary Clinton said in video C-SPAN. \"As in a previous generation, we had an organized anti-mob effort. We need to take these people on. They are often associated with large drug cartels, no longer just child gangs. They are often children who are called superiors, not conscience, not compassion. We can talk about why they ended up this way, but first, we have to bring them to the heels.\" The entire context of this incident connects children and superiors, but anywhere in the discourse, African-American youth are not directly named in this way. However, the feedback from this speech followed the Clinton election this year. Two Black Life programme activists faced Clinton at a private fundraiser in February, and told the candidate that she owed black people an apology. After one day of this confrontation, Clinton issued a statement to Jonathan Kibhardt of the Washington Post, in which he regretted that her statement had been chosen. \"Looking back, I didn't have to use those words, and I didn't have to use them today.\" Later in the election cycle, the former democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, also criticized her language in a Brooklyn debate. When Saunders was asked by the moderator why Bill Clinton called for Clinton's defence to use the term \"Superbridgedator,\" Sanders replied, \"because it's a racist term, and everyone knew it was a racist term.\" The governor Bribos said it was Hillary Clinton who described African-American youth as superior. Clinton - In the course of defending her husband's 1994 crime legislation - the term \"Super Predator\" was used when referring to \"child's molds.\" She did not specifically call predators African Americans, but the context of her speech and subsequent apology decades later suggested that it was a reasonable conclusion. The claim of Bribos is accurate, but it needs some clarification, which is why we assess his statement as mostly true.
