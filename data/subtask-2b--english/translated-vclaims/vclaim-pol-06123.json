Rick Perry. Perry -- 11th place in the polls and currently shy of entering the first Republican debate in August 6 -- had been punching Trump for weeks. Trump made fun of Perry's glasses in July, and Perry responded by calling Trump \"conservative cancer\" and challenged him in a drawing contest. Perry changed his attacks from physical to political on Sunday in the Fox News in August 2. Perry said, \"It's for a lone cannon.\" \"How can a conservative person stand up and say I'm health care for one pregnant woman?\" The Berry campaign referred us to the Bazved article and the Bondet Fucket article, which referred to Trump's past support for a Canadian-style single-drive scheme. Perry's claim goes even further to refer to Trump, such as Socialist Vermont and Democratic Presidential candidate S. Bernie Sanders, currently supports a mono-drive system, a specific type of comprehensive health care where the government provides the bill to all residents. We wanted to know if Trump was still supporting this model. The Trump campaign did not respond to our interrogation, and its website does not summarize any of its positions on key issues, including health care. We therefore examined the texts and videos of the public statements and the Trump interviews. Trump has been a strong opponent of the Affordable Care Act, but his general position on health care is even more nagging. In the medical record, Trump said several times that he would get rid of Obamacker once he took office. It has also repeatedly attacked the health-care website as a $5 billion failure that \"has never worked\" (which is considered wrong). However, the rejection of the Affordable Care Act, which is not a one-time system, is not the same thing that condemns the concept of health care for all. During his short-term flirting with a 2000 RP presidential bid, he unequivocally supported comprehensive health care packages and expressed support for a single payment system in several cases. \u2022 \"If you can't take care of your patients in the country, forget it, it's over. .................................................................................... I believe in global health care, \"Tell Trump Larry King in October 1999. \u2022 \"I will develop a comprehensive health-care programme funded by an increase in corporate taxes,\" Tramp said to the lawyer just before he withdrew from the race in February 2000. \u2022 \"The Canadian Plan also helps Canadians to live longer and healthier than America. We need, as a nation, to reconsider the single payment plan, as many individual nations do, Tramp wrote in his 2000 American book we deserve. Trump has said very little about one-time health care since 2000, according to our research on Lexie Nyxes database. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced verification of the remarkable facts in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the US Navy, said that they rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, they read between the lines that Trump recently made in his comments on health-care systems that conflicted with each other, which experts say was not a clear position. While chatting with David Litterman on January 8, 2015, he was impressed by the Government-funded health-care system in Scotland and pointed out that the problem in the Affordable Care Act lay in its implementation. Here's a copy of their exchange: Letterman, tell me how cheap it is to treat injuries abroad: \"In one case, I had my arms reconnected and at the end of the procedure... it was like $12!\" Trump: \"A friend of mine was recently in Scotland. He got very, very sick. They took him by ambulance and he was there for four days. He was really in Trubel, and then they released him and he said, \"Where do I pay?\" and they said, \"There's no price,\" and not just that, he said, like great doctors, great care. I mean, we could have a great system in this country.\" Letterman: \"Are people afraid of socialism?\" Trump: \"Well, people are afraid of a lot of things. But it's mostly incompetence. How do you spend $5 billion on a website, just creating the site itself, and it's not working? There are things you can do to give incredible health care and a much better health care system. It's a complicated subject, unfortunately.\" The experts told us that Trump either implicitly supports the single payment system or puts his foot in his mouth. Timothy Ghost, Professor of Health Care Law at the University of Washington and Lee, said, \"The Scottish system is a classic one-time system, such as the English system, except for better funding.\" \"He must stop martyring Scotland,\" said Gil Wilensky, a healthy economist and former President Medicare and Medicaid under the presidency of President George H.W. (Bosch) \"He doesn't seem to know what a Scottish system is. Most people who go to the market aren't interested in it.\" In a radio interview in July, Trump failed to reject his previous position on a Canadian-style plan and instead spoke of a completely different approach. He called himself \"heavy-hearted\" and described his replacement for the Affordable Care Act: \"Great (Special) Plans\" developed through \"hospital dealings\" that allow the government to help people \"at lower levels.\" On July 31, a spokesman for Trump for Forbes explained that he \"has never supported social medicine\" but \"a global market-based plan\" would offer a range of options. Just said that the kind of system that Trump refers to - a global market-based system with a combination of public and private finance - is essentially what affordable care law creates. The most dramatic conservative alternatives with less government regulation than the Affordable Care Act can be found in John McCain's proposal in 2008 or in the Wisconsin State Reform Bill. Our verdict, Perry, said Trump was \"for health care to one-payers.\" Fifteen years ago, Trump was determined to have a comprehensive health-care system similar to Canada, in which the Government paid for care for all citizens. More recently, he was impressed with the single payment system in Scotland, and had been informed of the Affordable Care Act as an inefficient implementer. However, a spokesman for Trump denied that the candidate supported \"social medicine\" and suggested that Trump prefer to solve the \"free market.\" However, otherwise, the Trump campaign remained silent on what its health-care policies were; Trump might be pressured on this point during the debate on 6 August. Given the current evidence, Perry's attack is partially accurate, but he ignores the details. We evaluate the statement half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06123"}
