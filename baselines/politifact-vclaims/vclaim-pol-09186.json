Chris Christie is very far apart from Democrats on those key issues, according to state Senate President Steve Sweeney (D-Gloucester).\n\n\nSweeney emphasized the divide in a recent interview during the June 1 episode of \u2018On The Record with Michael Aron\u2019 on NJTV.\n\n\n\"People want the minimum wage, they want marriage equality, they want women\u2019s health care,\" Sweeney said. \"There\u2019s issues that actually that really do matter, social issues that matter to the people of this state. So I know Barbara would support those issues, I know the governor hasn\u2019t. You\u2019ve seen the actions he\u2019s taken on them.\" Sweeney last week endorsed Barbara Buono, a Democratic state senator from Metuchen, in November\u2019s gubernatorial contest with Christie.\n\n\nFor this fact check we\u2019re looking only at the claim that Christie doesn\u2019t support these issues -- concerns that PolitiFact New Jersey has addressed previously. What we have determined is that while Christie sees these issues differently than Democrats, it\u2019s not quite true that he doesn\u2019t support them at all.\n\n\nLet\u2019s look back at claims on each topic, starting with minimum wage.\n\n\nIn January Christie vetoed a Democratic proposal raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 an hour, with future increases tied to inflation. So he didn\u2019t support the Democrat proposal -- but he offered an alternative that Democrats reject: phase in a $1 increase over three years and eliminate automatic hikes.\n\n\nNext, marriage equality.\n\n\nChristie, a Catholic, has said repeatedly that same-sex marriage goes against his beliefs, but has said he supports civil unions and ensuring that same-sex couples have the same legal protections as married couples. Back in February, Christie conditionally vetoed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage and suggested a referendum on gay marriage for the Nov. 5 general election.\n\n\nThat suggestion drew fire after several lawmakers, including Sweeney, said same-sex marriage is a civil rights issue and doesn\u2019t belong on a ballot.\n\n\nFinally, let\u2019s look at where Christie stands on women\u2019s health care.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) in May 2011 claimed that six of New Jersey\u2019s 58 family planning centers closed after Christie stripped $7.5 million in funding for the centers from his first budget for fiscal year 2011.\n\n\nRepresentatives of those clinics previously told us that state funding cuts forced the closures.\n\n\nChristie has since rejected at least three efforts by the Legislature to restore the family planning funding that he cut, noting on several occasions that New Jersey residents have access to \"comprehensive reproductive health care services\" at other sites and the state can\u2019t afford to \"provide duplicative funding for family planning centers.\" The centers that closed were in rural parts of South Jersey.\n\n\nTo recap, the governor proposed an alternative to the Democrats\u2019 proposal on minimum wage that would mean a smaller hike for low-income earners; opposes same-sex marriage personally but suggested it be a matter for public referendum; and cut funding for women\u2019s health care, saying family planning services were available elsewhere.\n\n\n\"That\u2019s 100 percent accurate in terms of the distortions and outright misrepresentations of the Governor\u2019s positions that have been repeated over and over by the Buono campaign and its allies,\" Christie for Governor campaign spokesman Kevin Roberts said in an e-mail. \"Unfortunately it\u2019s not a surprising tactic from an increasingly desperate campaign that continues to fall further and further behind.\"\n\nSenate Democrats spokesman Chris Donnelly could not be reached for comment.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nSweeney said, \"People want the minimum wage, they want marriage equality, they want women\u2019s health care,\" Sweeney said during the June 1 episode of \u2018On The Record with Michael Aron.\u2019 \"There\u2019s issues that actually that really do matter, social issues that matter to the people of this state. So I know Barbara would support those issues, I know the governor hasn\u2019t. You\u2019ve seen the actions he\u2019s taken on them.\"\n\n\nWe\u2019ve determined that Christie appears to support a minimum-wage hike, albeit one that is quite a bit smaller than the one supported by Democrats; opposes gay marriage, but supports civil unions and letting voters decide the matter via referendum; and cut funding for that women\u2019s health care that closed six family planning centers in the state.\n\n\nWe rate Sweeney\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09186"}
