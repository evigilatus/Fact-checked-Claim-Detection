The building was finished one year and 45 days later.\nSo Trump is close in terms of the year-long timeline of construction he gave.\nHowever, we were unable to find how long the permitting process took, and the Empire State Realty Trust doesn\u2019t offer any clues. It notes only that several parties formed Empire State, Inc. in 1929, and name Alfred E. Smith, a former governor of New York, to head the corporation.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether or when they applied for a permit.\nCan it take 10 years to get a permit approved?\nAccording to the lead infrastructure aide on the White House\u2019s Council on Environmental Quality, the permitting process for how the government builds roads, bridges, rails and pipelines is now an average of under five years.\nThe Wall Street Journal quoted Alexander Herrgott telling a Washington conference in January that he hopes the administration will \"take permit delivery times from what is now an average of 4.7 years down to two years.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

It bears repeating that his own White House aide to the Council on Environmental Quality said the average was 4.7 years.\nThe White House also did not provide an example of a \"minor permit\" for a \"simple road\" taking 10 years.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"America is a nation of builders.

The only study we found that claims a 10-year approval is common comes from a pro-deregulation group, which raises questions about its reliability.\nWe rate this Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-01-31 04:16:07 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  \"America is a nation of builders.
