Hillary Clinton had not made a pledge not to accept campaign contributions from lobbyists, as Sen. Barack Obama has.\n\n\"He (Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee,\" Bill Clinton said. \"He said one thing and did another.\"\n\n\nClinton is talking here about Obama's leadership PAC, Hopefund. Leadership PACs are political action committees established by members of Congress to support other candidates.\n\n\nAll the other presidential candidates shut down their leadership PACs when they announced their candidacy, but Obama's PAC continued to distribute more than $400,000 to political candidates and parties after Obama entered the ring on Feb. 10, 2007.\n\n\n\"And this money did come from lobbyists and special interest groups,\" Clinton said.\n\n\nClinton is right, but some scale is in order.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an analysis for PolitiFact by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, of the $4.5-million raised by Obama's Hopefund, $16,500 came from lobbyists, and $125,000 from political action committees such as Lockheed Martin Employees' PAC, AT&T; Corp. PAC and Walt Disney Productions Employees. The biggest donors were lawyers and law firms, accounting for nearly a half-million dollars.\n\n\nSo Obama's leadership PAC did raise money from lobbyists and PACs, though it amounted to just a fraction of the total fundraising. Also notable is that the money was collected before Obama announced his presidential candidacy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\n\nPolitiFact has already weighed in on Obama's campaign pledge not to take money from lobbyists or PACs, finding that\n\nwhile he has eschewed money from federally registered lobbyists, he has accepted thousands from people who work for lobbying firms.\n\nWe have also noted that Hillary Clinton has\n\nraised more campaign donations from registered lobbyists than any other candidate.\n\n\n\nCommon sense suggests the distributions to candidates were meant to advance Obama's campaign, particularly when almost 43 percent of the money was spent on candidates in states with early primaries.\n\n(See our related ruling on this point here).\n\n\n\nOne question is whether Obama's Hopefund distributions violate Obama's pledge not to accept lobbyist or PAC money in his run for president. Because the contributions were made prior to the start of his campaign, we find they do not. Therefore it's a stretch for Clinton to say, \"He said one thing and did another.\"\n\n\nBut we're checking Clinton's claim that \"(Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee.\" And Obama's leadership PAC did accept $16,000 from lobbyists, and another $125,000 from PACs, even though it was collected before Obama was an announced candidate. And nearly half of Hopefund's money was spent on key primary states during the campaign. So we rate Clinton's claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16289"}
