The winner of their Aug. 14, 2018 primary will face Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin.\nNicholson\u2019s 30-second ad shows clips of Vukmir criticizing Trump, including saying Trump is offensive to different groups of people. It starts -- and ends -- with Vukmir saying:\n\"I\u2019m not endorsing Donald Trump.\"\nThat leaves the impression that Vukmir never endorsed Trump for president. But she she eventually did -- prominently.\nAnd she backs Trump today.\n\n\n\n\nAll of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChronology\nThe clips of Vukmir criticizing Trump are from March 2016, prior to Wisconsin\u2019s primary election in April 2016. Trump lost that contest by 13 points to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But, of course, Trump went on to win the GOP nomination before defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November 2016 general election.\nOK, now let\u2019s track Vukmir.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the Wisconsin primary, Vukmir first supported Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who briefly ran for the GOP nomination before dropping out in September 2015.\nThen she backed U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who ended his run in March 2016. Vukmir said she ultimately voted for Cruz in the Wisconsin primary.\n(For his part, Nicholson wasn\u2019t an original Trump supporter, either. He supported Rubio initially, but said he voted for Trump in the primary.)\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook.

It\u2019s not.\n(Note: We\u2019ve rated as False a claim by Vukmir that \"I have always been there with\" Donald Trump.)\nOur rating\nNicholson says that Vukmir said: \"I\u2019m not endorsing Donald Trump.\"\nBut that was before Trump became the GOP nominee for president in 2016. After he won the nomination, Vukmir endorsed Trump and prominently supported him, as she does today.\nWe rate Nicholson\u2019s claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-08-08 17:43:11 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says Leah Vukmir said: \"I\u2019m not endorsing Donald Trump.\"     Kevin Nicholson Republican U.S. Senate candidate, Wisconsin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVpkI6Uf8sQ&feature=youtu.be   In an online ad Wednesday, August 1, 2018 2018-08-01    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01755"}
