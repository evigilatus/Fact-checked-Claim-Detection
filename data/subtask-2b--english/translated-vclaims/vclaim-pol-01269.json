On 31 October, the Facebook newspaper Daily Post published the title: \"Only immigrant invaders set fire to a facility, open fire to the police.\" Clicking on the link takes readers to a story on preferentially Post.com with the main title, \"Caravan Violence: Invaders Shoot Police, Group Fire to Immigration checkpoint; Violence escalates with the use of firearms, firebombs and rocks by convoy.\" The site says the story was shared more than 3,300 times. This story was highlighted as part of Facebook &apos; s efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Several elements of this story indicate that they are subject to factual objection. It's hard to find a lot of information about the fire referred to, but here's what we know. There is a link in the story of the daily Post, which takes readers to the 30 October report Britt, which in turn relies on the story of 29 October of Televisa News, which says that a fire broke out in the area of a migration checkpoint in Pejepan, Chiapas, which is located in Mexico, 90 miles by road to the Guatemalan border. A television news story doesn't tell when the fire happened. At the time of the fire, the checkpoint housed 21 men who were detained and awaiting deportation to Guatemala, as the television story says. The fire caused minor damage and no injuries. In addition, according to Televisa, it appears that the fire was caused by one or more immigrants who had already left the convoy and were planning to return to their homes, but were detained by Mexican officials. Although the history of the fire is not included in the story, we know from the news reports, including the timetable in the story of the United States of America today, that the beginning of the convoy was about 90 miles from Pejiaban on 28 October, the day before the story was first published on the Internet -- and at a time when the convoy was traveling about 40 miles a day. On January 11, 2021, Facebook was published in Nancy Belusi's newspaper, no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman on January 12, 2021, in addition to the photo accompanying the story of the conservative Daily Post, showing a border patrol facility in the United States at night, and the stock photo found on Schtterstock and other stock photo sites. The title says, \"The immigration checkpoint facility was set on fire and the police were shot when the immigration invasion force became more violent.\" Together, the image and address can give the impression that the arson occurred at an American border facility, and that's not what the television story says. On October 12, when the first convoy was formed, until November 7, no stories of arson appeared at a border checkpoint. According to the daily governorate newspaper, the shooting occurred when two men saw the officers guarding the group of attackers and decided to fire. Intruders refer to immigrants. Our best information on this incident indicates only one weapon. According to a statement issued by the Ministry of the Interior on 29 October, only one of two Hondurans was armed and the man opened fire while trying to escape from the police. The newsletter does not indicate why the couple, aged 22 and 17, escaped or why they shot the officers guarding the convoy. The gun's loaded with nine rounds of 380. It's still in the gun. No one was hurt. :: Shooting site: Ignacio Zaragoza, Chiapas, Mexico, near the Guatemalan border, where a second convoy was formed about 230 miles from the front end of the main convoy. Our ruling in the daily conservatives said: \"Caravan violence: invaders shooting at the police, setting fire to the immigration checkpoint.\" In addition to the photograph of the United States Border Patrol Establishment, it gives the false impression that the fire and shooting involved United States officials and an American facility. The evidence shows she didn't do it. The fire was in southern Mexico, and men reportedly left the convoy and returned south, but were detained by Mexican officials. There were no \"invasions\" (more than one person) shooting at the police, unless the two men in custody were required to shoot the same weapon. If they were part of the convoy, it's not clear why someone would shoot the police to guard them. The incident took place in Mexico, far from the American border. Because this phrase contains elements of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, we often assess them as false.
