Ralph Northam faces national contempt for a racist image that appears in his name in his 1984 Medical School Yearbook. President Donald Trump was destroying democracy, but for a different reason. Here's what Trump said during the February 11 march in El Paso, Texas: \"The Governor said that he would allow even a newborn child to go out into the world, wrap up the child, make the child comfortable, then talk to the mother and talk to the father, and then execute the child. \"Exterminate the child!\" A similar statement was made by Tramp in his State of the Union address on 6 February. After criticizing the recent easing of restrictions on abortion in New York, Trump said, \"And then, we had a case of the Governor of Virginia where he said he was going to execute a child after giving birth.\" Did Northham, a pediatric neurologist, really say he was gonna get a baby out after birth? Northam's comments are confusing, but Trump put words in the Governor's mouth. The story begins in January 28, when a subcommittee of the Virginia Council of Delegates was considering a draft law supported by Democrats that would have relaxed the State abortion laws at all stages of pregnancy. However, much of the discussion focused on late abortions. Virginia allows third-degree abortions in hospitals if three doctors confirm that the continuation of the pregnancy would \"probably\" kill the woman or \"cause substantial and irreparable harm\" to her mental or physical health. The proposed bill, which was rejected, would have reduced the authorization from three doctors to one. This doctor must only certify that the pregnancy will be harmful to the health of the woman. It was possible to eliminate a \"high and irreparable\" threshold. The sponsor of the Bill - Del. Cathy Tran from De Fairfax faced difficult interrogations from Republicans about phase three proposals. She asked whether legislation allowed women who were expanding to have an abortion, and said: \"A legal bill would allow for that. Yeah.\" A video of her testimony became viral, drawing party accusations that Democrats supported \"killing children.\" The Democrats accused the World People &apos; s Party of launching a hijacker during the election year when all 140 seats in the General Assembly were in the ballot. According to the records of the Virginia Department of Health, two third-degree abortions have been performed in Virginia since 2000, according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch. Northam's comments on Trump Northam's tossing are based on confusing comments made by the Governor in January - two days after the hearing - during a World Trade Organization radio interview in Washington. Northam, a defender of abortion rights, was asked to explain Tran &apos; s statement. \"That's why such decisions must be made by caregivers, doctors, mothers and fathers concerned,\" said Northam. \"When we talk about abortion in the third stage, this is done with the consent, obviously from the mother, with the consent of the doctors - more than one doctor, by the way. This is done in cases where there may be severe distortions. There may be an unviable embryo. \"So, in this particular example, if the mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what could happen,\" he added. \"A baby is born. The baby will be comfortable. The child will be refreshed if this is what the mother and family want, and then there will be a discussion between the doctors and the mother.\" Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 20 January 2021, a number of conservative media and national Republican leaders were accused of punishing the killing of children at the speed of Northam. Trump's expectation of Northham's words will \"raise the whole pro-life movement like it may not have been lifted before.\" During a press conference held in Northham on 31 January, he assaulted the charges against him but failed to clarify his remarks on the World Trade Agenda. \"I have dedicated my life to caring for children and any hint otherwise is shameful and disgusting,\" he said. The Director of Communications at Northham, Uvira Jeskel, issued a written statement accusing critics of the words of the Governor. \"No woman seeks a third degree abortion except in the case of tragic or difficult circumstances, such as unviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities. The Governor's comments were limited to actions taken by doctors in the event of a woman entering labour in such circumstances, Jeskel's books. \"Trying to cross-read these comments in another way is in bad faith and confirms exactly why the Governor believes doctors and women, not legislators, must make these difficult and in-depth personal medical decisions.\" While he added a statement of some clarity, he did not refer to the requests of the correspondents for clarification of what Northam meant by the mention of \"bis\" and \"discussion\" in the same sentence about what happened to a tragically distorted birth. We asked whether the Governor meant that there would be a discussion between doctors and parents about whether extraordinary means should be taken to keep the child alive. She refused to answer, saying, \"I feel like we've spoken that, and I don't know that I want to go any further.\" He added: \"Any hint that the Governor or any doctor would do anything but provide the family with the best possible care and drain all options is disgusting and shameful.\" Our referee Trump says Northham says he's even gonna let a newborn child go out into the world and wrap the baby up, make the baby comfortable, talk to the mother, talk to the father, and then execute the baby. \"Exterminate the child.\" Northam, a doctor, never said he would be punished for the execution of newborns. What he said during a radio interview is that in rare late pregnancies when embryos are not viable, doctors give birth to the child, and in the event that the baby is born, the baby is born. The question is that Northam refuses to say what that debate will entail. Trump says in the Governor's mouth, that doctors urge the mother to allow her to kill the newborn by force, a felony in Virginia that is punishable by long imprisonment or death. Trump insults Northam's words and exaggerates them in ways that promote division. It's often enough to burn someone's pants. But Northam left himself open to some explanation by refusing to explain his confusing remarks. Therefore, Trump's statement is evaluated in vain.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00999"}
