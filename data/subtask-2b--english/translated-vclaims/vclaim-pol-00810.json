Life expectancy in America has declined over the last three years in a row, the first time in a hundred years, due to suicide surges and drug overdoses.\" The CDC shows that the Yang campaign did not respond to our requests for information to support his statement. However, the campaign had previously cited a Pol\u00edtico news article on the November 2018 reports of the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These reports were on life expectancy in 2017. We'll take Yang's statement in three parts: 1. Yang was a little bit of a saying that life expectancy fell for three consecutive years, in that there was no change from 2015 to 2016, according to figures slightly revised after its initial launch: 2014: 78.9 in 2015: 78.7 in 2016: 78.7 in 2017: 78.6 years of verification of the specific facts of Ryan Fornier, mentioned on 31 January 2021 in Twit, \"Biden's administration has lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\" This was the first time that such an extension had taken place for three years since the influenza epidemic a century ago, as the CDC said. So he's right about it being \"100 years\" since something similar happened. 3 - A report from the Centre for Disease Control referred to three causes of death that contributed to lower life expectancy: drug overdoses and suicides, as Yang said, but also chronic liver diseases. The Centre for Disease Control stated that chronic liver disease may be caused by both biological and behavioural factors, including hepatitis C or hepatitis B and excessive alcohol consumption. According to the Centre for Disease Control, in 2017 there was a record number of lethal overdoses (70,237) and continued growth in suicides (47,173), with the suicide rate rising by one third since 1999. Therefore, overdoses and suicides were the main causes of low life expectancy. Shannon Monat, Professor of Sociology and Co-Director of the Policy, Space and Population Health Laboratory at Syracuse University, went so far as to say that the recent decline was \"almost entirely\" due to increases in overdose and suicides. She told us that \"though the declines are small, they are unprecedented, indicating that there is a serious welfare crisis in the US. Professor Andrew Finylon of the University of Maryland, a socio-demographic scientist whose research disciplines include health and population differences, told us that Yang goes far in referring to overdoses and suicides as causes of degradation. \"The determination of 'cause' of a very slight decline in life expectancy is difficult, because many of the causes of death in which increases in mortality have occurred can, in essence, be said to be the cause of this decline,\" Phenylon said. However, as media reports of the CDC figures at the time clearly reflected, overdoses and suicides were among the main factors leading to this decline. As to the importance of the decline, Finylon agreed with Monat, calling the decline for three years \"unusually.\" \"We are simply not accustomed to seeing, at the national level, reductions in life expectancy, especially those that last more than one year. He said it was a major crisis.\" \"Not only have we failed to improve life expectancy in absolute terms, as we have done over the past 100 years, \"The life expectancy of America has declined over the past three years in a row, the first time in a hundred years, because of suicide surges and drug overdoses.\" Yang &apos; s claim is based on the latest figures from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the three years since 2014 for which data are available, life expectancy declined in 2015, remained unchanged in 2016 and declined in 2017. This pattern has not been seen in 100 years. The CDC reports suicides and drug overdoses, which have shown significant growth, as two of the three main factors in the decline. We value Yang &apos; s statements that they are often true. &quot; Sharing the facts 2019-04-03 19:32:49 UTC PoliticalFact 5 1 7 PoliticalFacting: Mostly true: \"The life expectancy of America has declined over the past three years in a row, the first time in a hundred years, due to suicide surges and drug overdoses.\" Andrew Yang 2020 Presidential candidate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpWomZiUDkM in an interview on Friday, 22 March 2019 2019-03-22 Read more information", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00810"}
