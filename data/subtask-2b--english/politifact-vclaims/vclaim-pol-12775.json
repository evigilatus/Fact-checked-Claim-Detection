Mitt Romney was asked what he would do about the corporate tax rate, whether he would cut government spending or raise taxes and whether it was possible to do both.\n\nRomney said he had a plan to lower the corporate tax rate but noted the nation's huge debt.\n\n\"What I would like to do is bring the tax rate down and eliminate some of the special breaks that go to the big businesses that have found ways to take advantage of loopholes,\" Romney said. \"So, I\u2019d take that corporate tax rate down at least from 35 down to 25 percent. Then we can talk about where we can go from there. I\u2019d like to get it a lot lower, but what I don\u2019t want to do is add to the deficit. I don\u2019t want to come back with a tax rate so low that we end up seeing our deficit go shooting up, because what we don\u2019t want to have happen is the circumstance where we have larger and larger deficits.\n\n\"I mean, this president is on track to have added so much debt to this country, that by the end of his first term, he will have added as much debt as all the prior presidents of this country combined. Think of that. I don\u2019t want to do what he\u2019s done, but I do believe we need to bring the corporate tax rate down, close special deals and loopholes to help finance that and encourage investment and growth by virtue of doing so.\"\n\nReally? More debt than all 43 presidents before President Obama?\n\nFirst we had to determine which \"debt\" Romney was referring to in his statement.\n\nThere are actually two main ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities.\n\nThe other is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money which is owed to beneficiaries in the future.\n\nRomney spokesman Ryan Williams said the candidate was referring to debt held by the public.\n\nWe then needed to determine the start and end points for calculating how much of the debt can be categorized as falling within Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nObama took office on January 20, 2009, but who \"owns\" the debt recorded for fiscal year 2009 is unclear. Obama signed off on the budget that year, but it was assembled during Bush\u2019s term, and it does not really bear Obama\u2019s imprint. Similarly, it\u2019s possible to say that either the fiscal year 2012 budget or the fiscal year 2013 budget is Obama\u2019s last from his first term.\n\nSo we decided to analyze Romney\u2019s claim by using three possible date ranges for our calculations.\n\n-- October 1, 2008 (the start of fiscal 2009) to Oct. 1, 2012 (the end of fiscal 2012)\n-- January 20, 2009 (the day of Obama\u2019s inauguration) to Oct. 1, 2013 (the end of fiscal 2013)\n-- October 1, 2009 (the start of fiscal 2010, Obama's first full budget year) to Oct. 1, 2013 (the end of fiscal 2013)\n\nWe\u2019re offering several options because each of these measurements have shortcomings for the purpose of measuring the debt accumulated under Obama.\n\nWe\u2019re able to calculate the debt figures for the earlier dates using the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s \"Debt to the Penny\" calculator. The future debt amounts come from Office of Management and Budget projections. Because they are projections, they\u2019re subject to change as economic circumstances change, but they are are widely cited among experts. (OMB doesn\u2019t project future debt to specific dates, only to the end of future fiscal years, so that\u2019s why our ending dates are only at the end of fiscal years.)\n\nHere are the debt totals accumulated during the three periods we listed above:\n\n* End of fiscal year 2008, when the accrued debt under the 43 presidents was $5.851 trillion, to the end of fiscal 2012, when the debt is projected to reach $11.881 trillion. Yes, more than the previous 43 presidents.\n\n* Obama inauguration, when the accrued debt was $6.307 trillion, to the end of fiscal year 2013, when the debt is projected to reach $12.784 trillion. Yes, more than the previous 43 presidents. \n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* End of fiscal year 2009, when the accrued debt was $7.506 trillion, to end of fiscal year 2013, when the debt is projected to reach $12.784 trillion. No, not as much as the previous 43 presidents.\n\nOver the first two scenarios above, the debt more than doubled from the starting point (which reflects the debt under the prior 43 presidents) to the ending point. So in these two scenarios, Romney is right -- Obama accumulated more debt than the previous 43 presidents combined. But for the third scenario, the debt didn't double, so Romney would be wrong. This exercise is a testament to the fact that small changes in assumptions can produce big differences in outcomes.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no guarantee that Obama\u2019s administration will actually preside over as much publicly held debt as predicted, since new budgets and projections will change debt outcomes every year. And the current negotiations over raising the debt ceiling could significantly change the forecasts. Still, this is what we can conclude given the data when Romney made his statement.\n\nNow let\u2019s throw in a further complication. In an interview, Romney\u2019s staff backed up the candidate\u2019s statement in part by citing a prior ruling by PolitiFact.\n\nWilliams, Romney\u2019s spokesman, cited PolitiFact \"True\" ruling on a claim by Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va.\n\nIn a letter to the editor of the Richmond Times-Dispatch in October 2010, Cantor wrote that \"the budget submitted by Obama will add more to the debt than the outstanding debt of the previous 43 presidents combined.\"\n\nPolitiFact rated the statement True, and that was good enough for Romney\u2019s campaign. \"We actually pulled it right off the (Politifact) website,\" Williams said in an interview. \"We\u2019re making the same contention that (Cantor) made.\"\n\nBut when the topic came up in Romney's claim, we re-checked our work and realized that in the Cantor fact-check we had only used the first option (the end of fiscal 2008 to the end of fiscal 2012) rather than the other two. Based on all three measurements, Romney is right by two but off by the other one. So we find his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12775"}
