We are seeing very small numbers of vaccine waste recorded in our CVMS system, but it\u2019s very few, like in the tens of doses,\" Cohen responded.\nIs North Carolina\u2019s spoil number \"very small,\" even \"in the tens?\"\u00a0\nThe state health department says, on average, it\u2019s receiving reports of fewer than 10 spoiled doses per provider. However, the total number of spoiled doses is in the four digits, not two.\u00a0\nA day after Cohen\u2019s briefing, North Carolina\u2019s health department told the Associated Press that a total of 1,280 doses had been discarded.\nAbout the discrepancy\nWe asked the department about the comments Cohen made on Thursday. Was she describing the 1,280 number? Had she seen that specific 1,280 figure?\u00a0\nChris Mackey, the department\u2019s director of communications, said no.\nCohen hadn\u2019t seen the specific total when she spoke at that Jan. 21 briefing, Mackey said, because the department didn\u2019t run a report on the numbers until later. Cohen based her comments on \"one-off conversations\" with other health officials.\n\"We ran a report when someone asked us for it. Mandy didn\u2019t have the number,\" Mackey said in a phone interview. \"She was trying to say we haven\u2019t seen any big incidents of vaccine waste.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1,280 spoiled doses account for 0.1% of the 1.1 million doses in the state, the department said in an email.\u00a0\nThere are 250 healthcare providers administering the shots, the email said, meaning the losses average out to about five doses per provider.\nComparing states\nIt\u2019s difficult to know how North Carolina\u2019s numbers compare with other states.\nThe CDC has instructed states to report vaccine waste into its tracking system, agency spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund told PolitiFact. However, ProPublica reporters found that some states aren\u2019t tracking their spoiled doses.\n\"We are working to figure out how to provide this data online in the future when the data is more complete,\" Nordlund said.\nA 2019 report from the World Health Organization says vaccine waste is expected to be anywhere between 5% and 20% during mass vaccination campaigns.\u00a0\nThere are reports of other states losing hundreds of doses in single incidents.\nWisconsin received national attention when authorities charged a local pharmacist with deliberately destroying around 500 doses of the vaccine.\nIn Massachusetts, NBC News reported that a Veterans Affairs hospital lost 1,900 doses after a cleaning contractor accidentally unplugged a refrigerator. In Ohio, the Columbus Dispatch reported, a pharmacy spoiled 890 doses by failing to keep them properly stored. In another case, nearly 12,000 doses spoiled on the way to Michigan after the shipping truck got too cold.\nOur ruling\nCohen said the health department is receiving reports of \"very small numbers of vaccine waste \u2026 but it\u2019s very few, like in the tens of doses.\" The health department provided clarity on Cohen\u2019s remarks a day later.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s fair to say the rate of vaccine spoilage is \"very small\" \u2014 a tenth of 1%. However, it was inaccurate for Cohen to say the number was \"in the tens.\" The total number was 1,280.\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19231"}
