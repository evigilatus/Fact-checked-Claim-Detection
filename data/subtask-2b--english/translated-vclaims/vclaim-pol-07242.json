At that time, the Congress was considering Obama's care - also known as the Affordable Care Act - and there was a loud debate about whether the bill would strip people of their health insurance policies and want to keep them. \"Let me make it clear, I will not support the health-care reform plan that will take the health care that I have now received or the health-care plan that you love,\" Warner said in the 2009 video. While Warner says this, the term \"LIE of the year\" appears in large red letters and underneath, in black hats, the reference to \"POLITIFACT, 12/12/13.\" Our colleagues in the National Polyte Fact gave the lie of the year in December of each year. The Gelsby claim that Warner took the title last year was news to us because the questionable distinction went to President Barack Obama's statement that \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\" Obama has repeated this pledge at least 37 times since 2009, including during the 2012 re-election campaign. These promises were revealed last fall when insurance companies reported to millions of Americans buying their own coverage - rather than getting it through work - that their policies were being eliminated because they did not meet the minimum standards set by the agreement. Paul Logan, Gelsby's spokesman, basically told us that the publicity claim was fair because Warner and Obama's promises were identical. Logan said that the year's lie wasn't specifically addressed to the president, but to anyone who did the same, he kept it. However, the Polyte Fact National article, which declares the year's lie, refers only to the repeat of the White House's false claim. The report indicates that when insurance companies began to cancel policies last fall, Obama's first reaction was to deny that he made comprehensive promises that people would be able to maintain their pre-existing coverage. Our colleagues wrote: \"For all these reasons, you have named Poletti Fruitah \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it, and the lie of the year 2013.\" In a follow-up article - which Logan also sent us - detailing the national reaction to the award. It is clear, therefore, that Gillespie's campaign took the liberty of explaining the lie of the year. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On January 20, 2021, there are significant differences between Obama's and Warner's comments. The Gillespie campaign publishes tapes of two events at which Warner pledged not to vote in favour of a bill that would remove existing insurance schemes: the video used in the advertisement and video used at the September 2009 meeting of the Municipality in Fredericsburg. These registrations occurred when the draft anti-corruption law was prepared. Warner was talking about the terms of his support for the legislation; he did not provide long-term assurance as to how the law would operate. Warner ended up voting on a bill that contained language that protected current policies from meeting the minimum ACA coverage standards, but left it to the White House to fill out the details. Later, Obama imposed strict regulations that prevent insurance companies from adapting new plans to market conditions or selling them to new customers, but ensure that policies that do not meet the required standards are destroyed. Warner says he was surprised by the President's actions. Obama repeated what he said, and kept it long after it imposed regulations that ensure that the law would not operate in this way. The rules were published by the White House in June 2010, with an estimated 39 to 69 per cent of employers with new plans to abandon them by 2013. Unlike Obama, we did not find any record of Warner doing so, and it was maintained by the previous 2009 statement. The Governor Gillespie's announcement indicates that Politifakt National described Warner as \"Lee of the Year\" in 2013 for promising four years ago that he would not vote for health-care reforms that took away insurance schemes like people. :: Polyte Fact National did not mention Warner in the distribution of the award. In articles and videos, our award colleagues focused on Obama's insistence over the years that under the Anti-Corruption Act, \"If you love your healthcare plan, you can keep it.\" The data and the circumstances behind them are not clones. The President had much greater power in shaping the law that he had as his name from the Senator. Warner did not repeat his pledge after voting in favour of the Anti-Corruption Act in 2009. Obama continued to break away long after adding regulations to the Act in mid-2010, which ensures that ACA will terminate some of the pre-existing insurance schemes. The obvious effect of Gillespie's announcement -- that Poletti Frucate cited Warner for saying he lied to the public -- is simply wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07242"}
