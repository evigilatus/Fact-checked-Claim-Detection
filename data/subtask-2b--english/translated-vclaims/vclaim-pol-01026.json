The impact of the Act, signed by President Donald Trump in December 2017, has begun to become more evident as Americans start to apply. The law is in force for the first time for the 2018 tax year, so people will see the impact now. On February 11, Harris tweeted, \"The average tax refund is a decrease of about $170 compared to last year. Let us call for a reduction in the President &apos; s taxes to what it is: raising taxes from the middle class to the point where the pockets of already rich companies and the 1% ratio are made. Average tax recovery has decreased by some $170 compared to the previous year. Let us call for a reduction in the President's taxes on what he is: substantially raising middle-class taxes in the pockets of already rich companies and 1%. Is the average tax refund going down by about $170 this year? Harris said, \"The average tax refund fell by about $170 compared to last year.\" Recent statistics from the Internal Revenue Service indicate that refunds have decreased, although it is worth looking at $170 fairly carefully. The Internal Revenue Service reported that the average refunds of $16 million received up to February tax decreased from $2,035 in tax year 2017 to $1,865 in tax year 2018. This is a decrease of $170, as Harris said, which amounts to an 8 per cent decrease in the amount of refunds from the previous year. But it is important to note that this is based on a small sample of tax returns. In 2017, more than 154 million returnees were processed by the Tax Service, making a lump sum of less than 5 per cent of the total forecast for this year before February. The Government &apos; s closure in January also slowed the processing of early returns, thus the sample is smaller than the one in a normal unstoppable year. Furthermore, early returns may not represent the final patterns of restitution operations. \"We just don't know yet\" is the pattern that Mark Mazur, Director of the Urban Institute - the Brookings Institution Tax Policy Centre, will say. \"Beware not to run with a drop of 8%,\" seems to be refunding the usual amount when all returns are in. Is the law supported by the Republicans a middle-class tax raise and a gift to the rich? Harris said: \"Let's call on the President to reduce taxes on what he is: raise taxes from the middle class to cover the pockets of already rich companies and 1%. There is something in this assertion, but tweeting ignores some important warnings. :: Democrats always draw the tax code as heavily inclined towards the rich. For example, the National Democratic Committee stated that the Democratic Party had approved a tax bill that gave 80 per cent of its benefits to the highest 1 per cent. The Committee noted an analysis of the final version of the draft tax law by the Centre for Tax Policy. The analysis found that by 2027, the tax law would achieve 82.8 per cent of its benefits to the largest 1 per cent of the income spectrum. However, the distribution of benefits in previous years would be very different. For example, in 2018, the bill would have provided 20.5 per cent of the benefits to the highest 1 per cent - well below the 83 per cent figure applied by the National Democratic Council. In late 2025, the Centre projected that 25.3 per cent of the benefits would flow to the highest 1 per cent. Main cause: By 2027, a number of key tax provisions benefiting middle-income taxpayers will have expired unless extended by Congress. On January 28, 2021 in Facebook blog, bloggers tried to \"close\" the California government's summoning campaign. \u2219 (Gavin Newsom) \u2022 On February 2, 2012, the Centre for Tax Policy also expected the middle class to benefit the most. An average of 60 per cent of the income distribution is likely to receive a much larger reduction than the increase in 2018, with about 90 per cent of those households receiving a tax reduction in that year, compared with much less than 10 per cent of those who will see an increase. (By 2027, taxpayers in that group will experience greater increases than decreases). Does the initial reduction in refunds shed any light on the tax burdens of the middle class? By putting the two assurances together, Harris points out that the smaller amounts received are evidence that changes in the law do not help middle-income taxpayers. In fact, however, there is no direct link between the recovery of funds and the burden of taxes. Even beyond concerns about the reliability of early recovery statistics, there is an important difference between refunds and tax burdens. Refunds are realized when the taxpayers are paid more than twice a week. When this occurs, the Tax Authority sends a cheque to the taxpayer for overstatement after processing their return. It's quite possible to get a smaller response even with your lower tax burden -- you'll get a little more a week, eat in the year-end response. It is also possible to recover a larger amount as the tax burden increases. All this depends on the amount of taxes withheld on a biweekly basis. The Harris campaign said that \"the tweet says certain assertions with a limited number of characters.\" Is it wrong to feel pressure if you get less money even if you pay less than taxes? Not -- it's quite understandable to be afraid to recover a smaller amount than usual, an experiment that imposes taxes on wanks and ordinary people looking at them very differently. For tax experts, the objective of taxpayers should be to get as close as possible to the recovered zero and outstanding zero. Anything different, in this view, amounts to an interest-free loan from the taxpayer to the Government. \"People, if you want to know if tax law is good for you or not, stop obsessing about the size of your recovery and pay attention to your total income tax law,\" fellow Howard Glekman of the Tax Policy Center begged in a recent blog. However, this runs counter to the number of Americans' budget this year. \"For those who rely on refunds, the argument \"you give the government a interest-free loan\" is correct, but it is not any consolation for people who use it as a means of saving,\" John Paul, the spokesman for the Tax Corporation. Small weekly changes over a long period of time tend to give an impression of less than one large annual payment, especially if you are used to relying on them to cover the cost of living. The Harris campaign noted that the Gallup poll, which was launched in October 2018, found that about two thirds of respondents said that they had not noticed an increase in their domestic salaries since the introduction of the Tax Code. \"If you ask 100 people, what is your tax responsibility last year?\" said Mazor from the Centre for Tax Policy, about 99 percent will not know, and the other one will be a tax expert.\" \"But everyone knows how much they paid back.\" They may be their biggest financial transactions throughout the year.\" Vanessa S. Williamson, Senior Fellow of the Brookings Institution, who studied this question, agreed. She said: \"It is clear that legislators should not encourage further confusion between the recovery of the taxpayer and its net tax contribution.\" However, the downside risk of end-of-year taxation was large enough to justify higher amounts withheld during the year, particularly for those without significant savings reserves. \"It makes sense for these Americans to want to be absolutely sure that they're going to see some extra money coming during the tax season, and to be absolutely sure that they won't have to cheat to cover an unexpected bill from the IRS,\" said Williamson. Our rule, Harris, said, \"The average tax refund fell by about $170 compared to last year. Let us call for a reduction in the President &apos; s taxes to what it is: raising taxes from the middle class to the point where the pockets of already rich companies and the 1% ratio are made. The average amount of tax refunds has been reduced by $170 so far this year, although this initial figure may or may not stand. The rich gain disproportionately from the tax changes that took place in 2017, but this brightens expectations that most families will see tax cuts for the first eight years or so. However, the mention of these two assertions in a quick succession indicates that smaller tax refunds are evidence of the negative impact of the draft tax law on middle-income taxpayers, which is not the case. It is quite possible to recover a lower amount even if you are paying lower taxes than this year &apos; s total taxes, as the vast majority of taxpayers in 2018. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong. Sharing the facts 2019-02-13 22:11:20 UTC PoliticsFact 3 1 7 PolityFacting: Mostly false: \"The average tax refund fell about $170 compared to last year.
