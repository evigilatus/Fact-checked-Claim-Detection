Again, what doesn't happen during the budget season. However, at a press conference held in May, the Republic, Matt Landy, a Democrat in Ilaria, made a few comments calling for the release of cold water on the Republican Governor's plan to sell five adult prison facilities and one youth detention centre. Cassich said the deal could make a profit from Ohio in the amount of $200 million. Landy doesn't agree. He argues that there are still bonds and debt improvements to be served and that this will reduce profits. The proposal was characterized by \"selling a crazy yard\" and called into question the logic of selling State assets during a low economic period when they might attract low tenders. The Republicans who control the house have also been accused of helping Kasi\u0107 lure buyers. \"The alternative budget now adds tax exemptions and tax cuts to those who buy these prisons,\" said Lundy. The Board approved its version of the budget on 5 May. Ohio's politician decided to take a closer look. The House of Representatives has proposed an exemption from the sales tax, a deduction from the income tax, and an exclusion from the commercial tax of any buyer who makes a deal with Ohio to seize the prisons offered for sale. Lundy said such friendly jewelry would eat away in the expected profits of the state on the deal. So why was it involved? The Kasesh proposal did not present tax exemptions, but the Republicans in the House of Representatives did so. The head of the Finance Department of the House of Representatives, Ron Amsotze, a Wester Republic, said that tax provisions had been added to ensure that private prison buyers were treated in the same way as any other State entity, since they would essentially perform a government function by residents. \"State entities do not pay taxes on their functions, and this also applies to local governments.\" \"I believe that it is the desire to maintain this situation in order to provide services at the lowest possible cost.\" If private entities pay these private taxes, which are due to community support where the facilities are located, then \"mainly state taxpayers will support local taxpayers at that stage for the function of the state, and we usually do not do so,\" Amaztz explained. However, State Prison spokesman Carlo Lobaro indicated that any prison buyer was expected to pay property taxes each year, which would bring a large amount of cash to local governments with facilities. Lubaro said, \"That's very essential.\" The Ohio Rehabilitation and Corrections Department had closely monitored the negotiations of the House of Representatives to ensure that no property tax was involved. \"We took the pain to make sure there were no gaps,\" he said. \"We fully expect them to pay property taxes to those communities where prisons are located.\" The impact on local governments can be significant. For example, there are two facilities on sale in Marion - the Northern Central Correctional Corporation, which houses adults and the Marion Juvenile Correctional Facility, which is currently closed. The combined value of real estate is $100 million, which will result in the collection of approximately $1.5 million per year of property taxes for that small city. Lubaro stated that this amount should be sufficient to assist the Marion police force in conducting criminal investigations in the two annexes, which would fall to the city and not to the State Highway Patrol, as is currently the case. So where does Lundy land on Troth or Meter? It is true that the alternative budget includes tax exemptions and tax deductions for those buying prisons. There will be no sales tax on procurement, and there are other exceptions with respect to income and commercial taxes. The Department demands that local property taxes be paid in full, which can generate significant revenue for local governments and schools. And Lundy is right that tax exemptions and budget cuts have been added by the House of Representatives. With regard to the O-Meter truth, we value Lundy &apos; s comment as correct.
