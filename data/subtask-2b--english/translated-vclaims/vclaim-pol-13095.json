On May 9, the members of the Council attached the Berman legislation as an amendment to the House Bill 274, a reform measure for damage by the Government. Rick Perry announced the emergency legislation earlier, before sending the general proposal to the Senate. But Berman, R-Tiller, drew our attention to April 4, when he told the Committee of the Council of Representatives on the Judiciary and Civil Jurisdiction that Islamic law \"is done in Dearborn, Mitch,\" adding: \"The judges are employed in Dearborn, and allow the use of sharia law. Also in England... in France and in Germany, the use of sharia is also permitted.\" To preserve this fact check in the United States, we were wondering whether the judges in Dearborn, the suburb of Detroit, were practising sharia law. But first, what is it? According to an international press article of 3 April, sharia law is \"almost like the Talmudik tradition in Judaism\" - in other words, the religious principles in which its followers seek to live. Farhana Khaira, Head of Muslim Advocates, a legal resource for the Muslim community, testified before the Judicial Committee of the United States Senate on 30 March, said that the Shariah guides Muslims \"in the way that religious law guides the daily activities of Christians, Jews and other religious communities in the United States.\" When we sought support for Berman &apos; s claim, his legislative director Sharon Guthrie directed us to Grand Prairie, Texas, resident Dorrie O &apos; Brien, who told us that she was a business spokesman! For America, a group based in Florida describes itself as the Citizens' Action Network, which \"defenses America and democratic values against terrorism and extreme Islamophobia.\" On 24 February, O'Brien referred to an article on \"Scary Shari'a,\" a blog on \"Slow, Deliberate and Systematic Progress of Islamic Shari'a in Non-Islamic Countries,\" according to the blog \"over\" page. According to the blog, on 18 June, the police at the annual Dearborn Arab International Festival imprisoned four Christian missionaries, one of whom was \"discussing peacefully his Christian faith with Muslim youth\" and three others who were \"proclaimed to be\" destroying peace. According to a free newspaper article in Detroit on 20 June 2010, the missionaries were with the 17 apologizers, who sought to convert Muslims to Christianity. They were arrested and imprisoned for their disorderly conduct. As one of the four, Nijin Mayel, was accused of not following a police officer's order to put the camera she was recording on a video, according to the article. A newspaper article on July 27 says that the Mayor of Dearborn Jack O'Reilly and others said that the missionaries were trying to provoke the festival players, according to the article. \"The Scared Shari'a\" has a different choice: \"Christians have been pushed away in handcuffs by the police to applause and cheer the Muslims who have just witnessed the Shari'a victory over Christians.\" The essay by Richard Thompson, President and Senior Adviser to the Thomas Moore Law Center, quotes: \"Muslims control the political and law enforcement process in Dearborn. The police seem to have been more interested in satisfying the mayor and the Muslims than in following our constitution. The Shariah makes it a crime to preach the Gospel to Muslims. This is a classic example of hidden jihad being waged here in America.\" Christians were accused of disorderly behaviour after the police said that Thier had filed a complaint with a Christian volunteer working at the festival, who said that he had been harassed by the group, according to a free press article issued on 25 September. When the missionaries faced the trial in September, the festival volunteer Roger Williams testified that at the festival, they were \"making me nervous and scared.\" According to the free press, the jury acquitted the missionaries. Mile was convicted of failing to obey the officer &apos; s order. The newspaper Dearborn published the headlines of the national news that month, when the hopeful U.S. Senate (Charon Angel) claimed from Nevada that the city was subject to Islamic law. She said, \"We're talking about a radical terrorist situation.\" A few weeks later, O'Reily appeared on CNN to object to this description. He said, \"There's no law in Dearborn, Mitch.\" In a letter from October 11 to Angel, he wrote: \"Obligation to false law, there are Christian evangelists who preach to Muslims 365 days a year without resistance or interference from anyone.\" On February 22, this year, the Thomas Moore Law Center, which describes itself as a law firm defending and promoting the religious freedom of Christians, filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Mayor of Dearborn, the Chief of Police and two executive directors of the American Arab Chamber of Commerce, which holds the festival. The case is still pending, and neither the city nor the police department nor the law centre responded to our questions. :: David Walid, Executive Director of the Michigan Branch of the Council of American Islamic Relations, based in Detroit, which he called \"full nonsense.\" The sharia is the \"psychic compass\" with which Muslims live, not the \"dirty law law,\" as he said. \"It is clear that the Constitution of the United States and Michigan are the land law of Dearborn, Mitch.\" This example was given: Islamic law prohibits a Muslim from marrying Hindus. \"But clearly if a Muslim man wants to go to peace justice with an Hindu woman, he can marry an Hindu woman,\" he said. \"The conduct guided by a person's faith in what God desires is not anything that the State can support.\" However, as stated by Polyte Vak Florida this month, religious laws may be used by the courts when interpreting a contract that, for example, defines sharia law as a legal basis, and the parties have agreed to those laws from the outset. Marcus Wagner, Professor of International Law at the University of Miami School of Law, said: \"It happens all the time and we can use Jewish law, Canal law, as long as it is not contrary to public policy.\" In an e-mail, Detroit Noel Saleh's lawyer, a specialist in civil liberties and immigration law, told us that \"judges in Michigan (like all judges in the United States) have sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the State.\" The probity clause in the United States Constitution makes the Constitution and United States laws \"the supreme law of the country.\" With regard to the manner in which Berman proposed the use of sharia law by judges, Saleh said: \"There are no courts in Dearborn, Michigan using sharia law in any form or form. This is an urban legend.\" Finally, we searched the Internet and the Lexi-Nixs database, which keeps news articles, to obtain evidence of Berman's claim. We found nothing but unfounded allegations and speculations. While we were finishing this item, Mark Sommers, Chief Justice of the 19th District Court in Dearborn, sent us an e-mail: \"As with every judge, judge and judge in this state, the judges and judges of the 19th District Court of Michigan have sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States and the State of Michigan, and to discharge faithfully the functions of the office for which they were elected or appointed. There are no other laws governing the determination of matters within the jurisdiction of this Court.\" In any case, the Dearborn Muslims, like all American Muslims, can follow Islamic law in their personal lives and conclude contracts - such as prenuptial agreements - that are bound by their principles. As well as practitioners of other religions. Judges may use religious laws to interpret such contracts, provided that all parties agree from the outset. But as far as we know, judges do not use sharia law instead of the Constitution of the United States or the laws of the United States, nor do they use it in Dearborn. We're assessing the statement wrong. In an interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \"falled in Houston in five days more than in Niagara Falls in one year.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13095"}
