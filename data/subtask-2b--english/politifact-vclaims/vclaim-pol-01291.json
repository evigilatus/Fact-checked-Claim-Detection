Ten women \"stripped, held ballots in strategic positions, and let a photographer snap their images in an attempt to convince people to vote on Tuesday,\" Minnesota Public Radio reported.\nOn Oct. 30, the group posted a mission statement to a Facebook page called Grab Them By The Ballot, named for the get-out-the-vote campaign. It touches on progressive causes and concerns, but doesn\u2019t mention Democrats.\n\"With the #MeToo and #Wetoo movements and recent confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh there is much at stake in the upcoming elections,\" the mission statement says. \"This group of courageous Vermont women came together in a vulnerable artistic expression to protect al women\u2019s right to choose regarding their body, health, reproductive rights and sexual expression. We joined hands as an outcry against the collective sexual and emotional abuse and trauma endemic in our society.
