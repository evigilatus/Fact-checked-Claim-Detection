Time to hold \u2018em.\nThe number on the Council\u2019s website doesn\u2019t hold up to scrutiny.\nRose Gruber, executive director of the council, said the 333,000 figure was based on nationwide findings in the National Gambling Impact Study Commission Report requested by Congress and released in 1999.\nThere is no Wisconsin-specific data in that study or any other we located.\nGruber said the 1999 study showed that nationally, 5 percent to 7 percent of the \u00a0total population had either a pathological gambling issue or are \"problem\" gamblers, a category that is considered less serious. In Wisconsin, that range would yield a number in the 333,000 range that Gruber\u2019s organization cites.\nBut there are several big problems.\nFirst, Gruber\u2019s estimate came from the total state population, while the Impact Study Commission report she cites actually focuses strictly on the adult population.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat mismatch significantly raises the Wisconsin estimate she uses.\nSecond, we couldn\u2019t find the 5 percent to 7 percent range in the 1999 study, nor could she point us to it.\nThird, the study is almost 15 years old.\nThe Wisconsin council\u2019s national umbrella organization, the National Council on Problem Gambling, says more recent research shows that 1 percent of U.S. adults are estimated to meet criteria for pathological gambling in a given year. An additional 2 percent to 3 percent would be considered problem gamblers.\nThe combination (3 to 4 percent) is a significantly lower than 5 percent to 7 percent range.\nThe national group also uses the adult population -- not total population -- when talking about the prevalence of problem gambling, based on figures cited by the national group\u2019s veteran executive director, Keith Whyte.\nApplying Whyte\u2019s figures to Wisconsin\u2019s adult population would mean that up to 173,000 adults are problem gamblers.\nOutside experts\nTo help sort this out, we turned to two of the country\u2019s leading experts on gambling addiction: Howard Shaffer, a Harvard professor of psychiatry and past editor of The Journal of Gambling Studies, and Ken Winters, a University of Minnesota psychiatry professor.\nThey said it was scientifically problematic to estimate Wisconsin\u2019s problem from a national figure, but not a major shortcoming because gambling is so widespread now.\nShaffer said the 3 percent to 4 percent figure was on target for adult problem gamblers. The prevalence has come down since the 1999 study, he said. Winters said the range in recent studies has been 3 percent to 6 percent.\nThe national range cited by the pair, applied to Wisconsin, would mean that 130,000 to 260,000 Wisconsin adults are problem gamblers.\nAppling\u2019s statement was broad and would include adolescent gamblers, who studies have shown more easily fall into gambling addiction. That would boost the number of problem gamblers past the adult figures we\u2019ve discussed. Our experts said, though, that it\u2019s hard to quantify how much because of problems inherent in studying juvenile gambling. And casinos don\u2019t allow gamblers under 21.\nThere\u2019s a shortcoming in Appling\u2019s claim that makes that something of a moot point: her use of the term \"addictive.\"\nThat applies to the small subset of pathological gamblers, but not to the broader group of problem gamblers who have not been diagnosed with a gambling disorder, the experts said.\nThe \"addictive\" group is limited to the pathological \"gambling disorder\" group, and it\u2019s 1 percent or less of adults, the two researchers said.\nIn Wisconsin, that would be 43,400 adults or fewer, a far cry from more than 300,000.\nThe number would still be under 100,000 if you added in adolescents at the rates we saw in various studies, 6 percent.\nSo Appling relied on a number that turns out to be way too high, and compounded the problem with her description.\nOur rating\nAppling said more than 300,000 Wisconsinites have \"some kind of addictive gambling problem, whether it\u2019s pathological or what we\u2019d categorize as a problem gambler.\"\nShe relied on a published figure from a legitimate organization, but even in the squishy world of problem gambling research, there is little if any hard evidence that backs up this estimate extrapolated from an outdated national study.\nThe best evidence is it\u2019s much lower, especially when describing \"addictive\" gambling problems. Perhaps fewer than 45,000 Wisconsin adults fit that description, plus an unknown number of adolescents.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08558"}
