I'm sure that the same thing is true of food stamp recipients. Each Walmart \u2018associate\u2019 costs the taxpayers an average of more than $1,000 in public assistance,\" Grayson wrote in a Huffington Post column on Nov. 24, 2012.\n\nHe doubled down in a subsequent interview with The Young Turks show on Current TV, saying Walmart employees represent \"the largest group of food stamp recipients.\"\n\nDemocrats and labor unions have long been critical of the non-union retailer and have recently been emphasizing that its low wages end up costing government because workers seek food stamps and other aid. (\"Wal-Mart\" is the corporation. \"Walmart\" is a store.)\n\nWe wondered if Grayson was right that the chain's impact was that large, so we dug into the numbers.\n\nLargest group of Medicaid recipients?\n\nNewspapers, lawmakers and liberal policy groups for years have analyzed which companies have large numbers of employees that seek public health insurance assistance.\n\nIn nearly all 24 states in which a study was completed, Grayson\u2019s point proved accurate, according to a list from Good Jobs First, a labor-funded group\u00a0that has criticized government support for Wal-Mart.\n\nWe should note not every study examined Medicaid, the joint state-federal partnership that insures the poor and disabled. Many reports focused on state-run programs aimed at people with low-paying jobs who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid and don\u2019t make enough to provide insurance their families (these are often called SCHIP).\n\nPhilip Mattera, Good Jobs First research director, pointed to two simple reasons for it: Wal-Mart pays relatively low wages and is the biggest employer in the country.\n\nHere's a sampling:\n\nIn Florida, Wal-Mart topped all companies operating in Florida with the largest number of employees and family members (12,300) eligible for Medicaid, according to a 2005 Tampa Bay Times story. Wal-Mart also ranked highly (No. 2) for dependents enrolled in Florida Healthy Kids or KidCare, trailing Miami-Dade County employees.\n\nIn Missouri, where Wal-Mart is the largest employer behind state government, the state\u2019s social services department determined Walmart employees outnumbered all others with employees and family members enrolled in MO HealthNet, the state\u2019s Medicaid plan, in the first quarter of 2011. However, at almost 14 percent, it did not represent the highest percentage of workers enrolled or responsible for an enrollee (Dollar General, for instance, was much higher at 42 percent).\n\nAnd in Pennsylvania, a 2006 Philadelphia Inquirer\u00a0investigation revealed the company had the highest percentage of employees enrolled in Medicaid. One in six of Walmart\u2019s 48,000 Pennsylvania employees were enrolled in Medicaid, costing the state about $15 million a year (it\u2019s likely higher because the Inquirer\u2019s story did not cover employees\u2019 dependents on Medicaid, or any other public assistance such as food stamps).\n\nThere was at least one exception on Good Jobs First\u2019s list. In Vermont in 2005, Wal-Mart placed fourth of companies with employees and families enrolled in Medicaid, trailing Price Chopper, McDonald\u2019s and Hannaford, according to Good Jobs First, which cited a 2005 Vermont Guardian report.\n\nAs labor groups pushed states to consider laws that would make Wal-Mart and companies like it pay more for employee health benefits, the New York Times\u00a0reported on a 2005 internal memo\u00a0from a Wal-Mart executive that showed the company knew a \"significant number of associates and their children who receive health insurance through public insurance programs.\"\n\nThe memo from Susan Chambers, Wal-Mart's executive vice president for benefits, said 5 percent of Walmart associates were on Medicaid compared to an average of national employers of 4 percent. In sum, she wrote, 46 percent of associates\u2019 children were either on Medicaid or uninsured. Her memo did not address employees on food stamps.\n\n\"On both of these issues \u2013 affordability and public assistance \u2013 it is important to note that our offering and performance are on par with other retailers,\" Chambers wrote. \"Wal-Mart\u2019s critics, however, hold it to a \u2018large company\u2019 standard, not a retailer standard.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Despite the difference in industry economics, critics believe we should behave more like a GM or a Microsoft than a Target or a Sears.\"\n\nSo on Medicaid, the sampling of states shows Grayson\u2019s assessment of this happening in \"state after state\" is accurate.\n\nLargest group for food stamp recipients?\n\nThere\u2019s no national tally of where food stamp recipients work.\n\nA handful of researchers and reporters have mined state data for Walmart employees on food stamps, though not as frequently as the Medicaid studies.\n\nIn Ohio, the \u00a0state Department of Job and Family Services report found Wal-Mart to be the state\u2019s\u00a0top employer\u00a0for workers and family members who receive Medicaid (16,098), food stamps (14,799) and cash assistance (803), according to January 2012 numbers. A state spokesman cautioned the report\u00a0does not tell the difference between full- and part-time employees, or employees who do not yet qualify for benefits, or why employees sought Medicaid.\n\nIn Maine, Wal-Mart topped employers with the largest number of workers on MaineCare, food stamps and temporary cash assistance, according to a 2005 Lewiston Sun Journal report, but it did not break down how many employees receive each subsidy. The company was fourth in the percentage of employees on public assistance.\n\nIn Florida, 1.9 million households receive food stamps, and nearly 500,000 have earned income as of October 2012. Of those with earned income, 9,095 households get paychecks from Wal-Mart, according to a report prepared for PolitiFact by the state Department of Children and Families.\n\nThe Florida taxpayer tab for their food stamps: $2.6 million.\n\nDCF cannot determine how this bill compares to other Florida employers. The employer data field in DCF\u2019s database is not mandatory and is usually filled in by hand. That leads to a lot of different entries for the same workplace (Wallmart, Wall mart, Wal-mart, Walmart, etc), making it difficult to draw conclusions about all employers.\n\nGrayson cited a figure circulated by the liberal Daily Kos\u00a0that \u00a0\"as many as 80 percent of workers in Wal-Mart stores using food stamps.\"\u00a0(We couldn't find a study that backs up that number, but did find it was mentioned as an anecdote.)\n\nGrayson could not provide solid evidence to us that he was right, but he said it was accurate largely because Walmart is simply such a big company.\n\n\"Walmart is the largest private employer in the country, by a substantial margin,\" Grayson wrote. \"Even if 100 percent of the employees of the second largest employer were on food stamps \u2013 an unlikely scenario, to say the least \u2013 Walmart employees would still be the largest group.\"\n\nHe added: \"Given the similarity between qualification rules for Medicaid and food stamps, if Walmart is #1 in a state for Medicaid, it\u2019s very likely that it is #1 for food stamps, too.\"\n\nHere, too, there is support for Grayson's point, but it is not conclusive.\n\n$1,000?\n\nThere's less factual support for this aspect of Grayson's claim. We found the data is eight years old.\n\nGrayson\u2019s spokesman cited a 2004 study called the \"Hidden Cost of Wal-Mart Jobs\" by the University of California Berkeley\u2019s Labor Center. The study, which Wal-Mart has criticized, analyzed Walmart employees\u2019 use of safety net programs in California.\n\nThe researchers found taxpayers paid $86 million a year to subsidize Walmart workers\u2019 wages -- $32 million for health programs and $54 million in other assistance. (\"Other assistance\" could be food stamps, subsidized housing and school lunches, and use of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is a tax credit for low- to moderate-income workers.)\n\nThe average taxpayer bill per employee was $730 for health expenses and $1,222 for other expenses, researchers found. The totals for other large California retailers totaled $521 for health and $880 for other.\n\nAlso widely cited by the anti-Walmart contingent is a 2004 Democratic U.S. House committee report\u00a0that examined the company\u2019s record on many issues, including public subsidizing of employees\u2019 wages. A 200-person Walmart store could require $420,750 in tax dollars for employee assistance a year, working out to $2,103 per worker, according to the Democratic Staff of the Committee on Education and the Workforce report.\n\nWalmart does not dispute that many of its employees receive public health assistance. But company spokesman Kory Lundberg criticized Grayson citing the Berkeley study, saying, \"They\u2019re pointing out data that\u2019s at least seven to eight years old.\"\n\nPlus, he said, it\u2019s expected the company would top such lists because its employs the most people.\n\nAnd even though just over half of its employees take the company health care plan, Lundberg said, workers often have other options for health insurance, including from the military, Medicare, or a parent\u2019s or spouse\u2019s plan.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGrayson's claim about Wal-Mart employees on Medicaid and food stamps has support from several reports, although it's worth noting that some of them come from Democratic or labor-funded groups that are critical of Wal-Mart.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nComprehensive figures are not available, but we did find considerable evidence that echoes Grayson\u2019s point about employee dependence on public health assistance in several states. His claim about Walmart employees on food stamps is not as substantiated, but we did not find any substantial evidence that contradicted his point.\n\nHis claim about the $1,000 cost has the least support because it's based on two studies that are eight years old.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
