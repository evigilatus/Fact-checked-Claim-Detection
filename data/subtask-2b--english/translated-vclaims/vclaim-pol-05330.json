First, Mr. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, said that \"of all the people on this podium, Donald Trump performs the worst against Hillary Clinton\" in high-end matches in the general election. Ohio Goof. Subsequently, John Kasesh added that he was the best candidate for Clinton, the first candidate for the democratic candidacy. \"Hilary Clinton was defeated by more than anyone, by 11 points,\" said Cassish. He was referring to the four Republicans in the debate phase -- himself, Rubio, Trump, Sin. Ted Cruz from Texas. Was Cassich right? We switched to average polling in Realecle Politics.com, a popular pool of comprehensive polling data. We will begin by noting that polling experts usually urge caution when comparing the match between the President and the President to the general elections at the beginning of the campaign cycle. We then looked at the results of the ballot in two different ways. One is the average of public policy opinion polls, which averages the most recent opinion polls. The other result has been the scope of the results since 1 February. Here is a table summarizing the results: the Democratic candidate, the Republican RPCR candidate average, the President-to-head leader average of RPCR leader, and the largest Republican poll since February 1, the weakest Republican opinion poll since February 1, Hillary Clinton 40.3% John Kasi\u0107 47.7% Kasi\u0107 + 7.4% Kasi\u0107 + 11 Casi\u0107 + 3 Hilary Clinton 43.5% of the distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned in the story of \"The Trump Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 11 January 2021 Marco Rubio 48.5 per cent Rubio + 5.0 per cent Rubio + 7 Rubio + 2 Hilary Clinton 45.0 per cent Ted Cruz 46.5 per cent Cruz + 1.5 croz + 3 Clinton + 2 Hillary Clinton 45.4 per cent Donald Trump 42.0 per cent Clinton + 3.4 tramp + 2 Clinton + 8 what does this tell us? First, it confirms Kasi\u0107's assertion that he defeats Clinton \"more than anyone else\" is still in the race. The recent average polls show that the Cassish edge over Clinton is 7.4 points, larger than the Clinton leads published by Rubio, Cruz or Trump. (In fact, on average, Trump already loses Clinton by 3.4 points.) The only element of the Kasesh statement not fully supported by the data is that it defeats Clinton by 11 points. It is true that Cassich defeated Clinton at his most powerful poll recently at 11 points -- it was a survey of the United States of America today -- Suffolk was made between February 11 and February 15. But emphasizing that one of the polls is a little cherry picking. He also tells us that Rubio was right that Trump was doing worse against Clinton, because he lost her an average of 3.4 percentage points in recent polls. Our governor, Casi\u0107, said in the polls in the general election, \"I've overcome Hillary Clinton by more than anyone, by 11 points.\" The recent poll rate of the Real Claire Polytis rule shows that Cassich incites Clinton better than Rubio, Cruz or Trump. But focusing on the margin of 11 points in his best poll is a little bit of cherry choice. The statement is accurate but requires additional information, so we often appreciate it.
