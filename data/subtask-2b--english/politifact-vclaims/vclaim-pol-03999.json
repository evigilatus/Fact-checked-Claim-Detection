The deadline for most voters to make that request is Nov. 3, 2016.\nVoters who have already mailed absentee ballots back to the municipal clerk\u2019s office can go to the clerk\u2019s office and make the request for a new ballot in person. \u00a0The deadline to request a new absentee ballot would the last day the clerk offers in-person absentee voting. \u00a0For most clerks, that is Nov. 4, 2016, but voters should contact their municipal clerk for scheduled hours.\nAbsentee voters cannot spoil their ballot at their polling place on Election Day. \u00a0That was prohibited by a 2011 state law.\nVoters in at least three other states -- Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania -- also accommodate early voter\u2019s remorse, according to news articles in the past two days by the Washington Times, ABC News and Fox News.\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures doesn\u2019t have a list of states that allow re-casting a ballot. In some instances, it may come down to the discretion of a local election official, spokesman Mick Bullock said.\nOur rating\nTrump says: \"Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake.\"\nAs long as you do it in time -- in Wisconsin, several\u00a0days before election day -- you can \"spoil\" your original ballot and cast a new one. At least three other states allow re-voting, too.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a44566ab-602e-42cc-bac3-47e4efcdee04", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03999"}
