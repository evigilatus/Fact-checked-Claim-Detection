Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to combat fake news.\nThe article called Clinton the \"Butcher of Benghazi\" and quoted Dr. Eugene Icsa of Westchester Memorial Hospital in upstate New York as saying, \"We predict she\u2019ll be at rest within hours.\"\nThe story further said daughter Chelsea was visiting, but husband and former President Bill Clinton was \"sitting on the front porch of the Chappaqua mansion drinking what looks like either tomato juice or a Bloody Mary.\"\nThere have been no other reports of Hillary Clinton suffering a massive coronary episode;\u00a0it\u2019s because she hasn\u2019t. The story is fake.\nThe photo ostensibly of a doctor feverishly working to save Clinton\u2019s life is actually a stock photo we most recently found on a Seattle Times story about the challenges facing trauma nurses.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s not even a Westchester Memorial Hospital in upstate New York, as far as we can tell. There is a Westchester Medical Center in Westchester, N.Y., but that\u2019s it.\nThis item was originally posted on July 22 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website run by a man named Christopher Blair, who creates absurd news stories in an attempt to fool conservative readers.\nA footnote on the bottom of the website said that \"everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction.\" The warning is repeated in the About Us section, where a disclaimer reads, \"We present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist.\"\nThis site and its troll-run brethren like to write about Clinton\u2019s death quite a bit. OurLandOfTheFree.com, a related website, wrote on July 13 that Clinton died of an overdose of Dilaudid, which is a brand-name of the opioid painkiller hydromorphone. TheLastLineOfDefense.org also ran a series of stories in which Hillary and Chelsea Clinton died in a boating accident that was the result of sabotage.\nClinton is still very much in the news, since Republican members of Congress continue to push for investigations into her own campaign activities. But she\u2019s still alive.\nWe rate this claim Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-08-03 19:42:17 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Hillary Clinton has third heart attack \u2014 docs says she \u2018won\u2019t survive\u2019.\"    Internet rumors bloggers   in Internet posts Friday, July 28, 2017 2017-07-28    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03035"}
