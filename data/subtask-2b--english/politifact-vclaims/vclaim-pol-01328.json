This looks at general purpose revenue (GPR) routed to schools, which includes per-pupil aid, equalization aid and other categorical aids.\nIt starts with the 2010-\u201911 budget, the last one under Gov.

The \"cuts\" Evers alleges come from comparing actual funding in the following two years to what funding would have been if it remained at that $5.27 billion level annually.\nThe GPR school aids dropped by $426.5 million in 2011-\u201912 and then rose by $68.9 million in 2012-\u201913. Taken together, that reduced school aid by $784.1 million in the two-year budget.\nThat\u2019s in the ballpark of Evers\u2019 claim, but it leaves out a lot of information.\nThe missing pieces\nIt\u2019s critical to note the 2011-\u201912 funding reduction did not happen in isolation.\nAct 10, enacted in 2011, required public employees to pay more toward their pensions and decreased their collective bargaining power. That allowed schools to save money that would have gone toward employee pensions and to charge employees more for health insurance.\nWhen all districts were tallied in 2012, they spent $451.5 million less on employee benefits than in 2011, according to a study by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, now the Wisconsin Policy Forum. In 2013, benefits were $433.6 million less than in 2011.\nSo across the two years where state funding was cut by nearly $800 million, school districts saved nearly $900 million in benefits. And that savings would be higher if you assume costs would have continued to rise from the 2011 levels (likely about 4.3 percent per year, according to the study).\nAnother important factor: The Evers ad does not say it is referring to a funding change made more than five years ago in a single budget.\nThus, viewers might assume school spending is $800 million less today than when Walker began. In reality, after the initial cuts, Walker has increased GPR school aids every year, hitting a high of $5.84 billion this year.\nThat\u2019s above the last year of Doyle\u2019s term, though that doesn\u2019t account for inflation.\nThose increases mean most of that $784 million in cuts has been returned to the budget. The right-hand column of the chart shows the difference between actual funding and what it would have been cumulatively if the schools budget remained $5.27 billion every year since 2011. That gap was more than $1 billion at one point but now is down to $183.6 million.\nOur rating\nIn the ad, Evers claims Walker cut $800 million from schools. He did cut close to that ($784 million), in raw dollars in a single two-year budget.\nBut that ignores changes made through Walker\u2019s Act 10 that saved districts money. And the ad does not make clear that it\u2019s referring only to cuts from 2011-\u201913, so viewers wouldn\u2019t know that subsequent funding increases have made up most of that reduction.\nOur definition for Mostly False is \"The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\"\nThat fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01328"}
