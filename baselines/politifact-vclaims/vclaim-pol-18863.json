It was not a widespread condemnation of law enforcement officials who are facing protests and violence across the country. And it is not the only place he has laid blame, as the litany of other comments shows.\nOur ruling\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s campaign claimed that \"Biden failed to condemn far-left violent groups like Antifa, instead faulting only the brave men and women of law enforcement.\"\nNumerous statements from Biden decrying violence, arson and looting tied to protests against police brutality show that claim is demonstrably untrue.\u00a0\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18863"}
