Her opponent, Attorney General Josh Hawley, is part of a lawsuit that tries to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and that's why he's not here. Hawley says he protects this coverage, but not through current law. During the second discussion, Hawley referred to a bill on reinsurance as a way of covering persons in pre-existing circumstances. This measure is sponsored by Mr. Bill Nelson, Mr. D. Fla, Mr. Susan Collins, Mr. R-Main. Macaskel's reply was quite clear: \"The Collins-Nelson Bill will not protect pre-existing circumstances. She said it had nothing to do with the circumstances that existed before. So who's right? We've reached out to the Macaskel Evidence Campaign, which referred to an article on CNC. We decided to check the bill ourselves. What would the Bill do when Collins introduced the Bill, she said that \"a Bill allowing states to protect people who already have pre-existing circumstances while reducing premiums through the use of these high-risk pools.\" But the draft law does not actually contain the term \"pre-existing circumstances\" -- more so in the second. The actual name of the bill is the Minimum Loans through Reinsurance Act 2017. It is intended to \"reinsurance\" insurance companies to deal with individuals most at risk. The bill would allow states to design their own reinsurance programmes, allowing them to qualify for federal funding. The bill will allocate $4.5 billion over two years, and states can use federal funding to provide reinsurance back to them. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: 2 February 2021 the issue is the role of high-risk complexes. This is where people with high premiums are assembled, regardless of whether they have pre-existing circumstances. The term \"pre-existing circumstances\" does not appear anywhere in the draft law. Instead, the bill uses \"high-risk\" as a funding qualification. The health-care experts we reached disagreed with Macaskel that the circumstances before would not have anything to do with the draft law. Anub Malani, Professor of Law and Medicine at the University of Chicago, said that many of the pre-existing conditions could qualify for medical care. Alan B. Cohen, Professor of Research at Boston University, believes that there is no straight answer, because reinsurance programs shift risks from one entity to another. Cohen raised an interesting point that was not mentioned in the bill in the definition of \"high-risk\" individuals. \"It is reasonable that a State can identify high-risk individuals as those with pre-existing medical conditions, but there is no guarantee that this is the case.\" States will be responsible for developing their own definitions of high-risk complexes and deciding whether to ensure coverage of persons in pre-existing circumstances through this draft law. So although Collins referred to pre-existing conditions when he spoke about the bill, there is no guarantee that states will be able to protect everyone with a pre-existing situation. This approach also depends on adequate funding. States have already tried high-risk fund-raising funds, often falling short because they did not have enough money. The bill is an incentive for the states to re-insure insurance companies to cover individuals at high risk. If the Government covers the costs of high-risk people, insurance companies can keep low-risk individuals, and thus logic has been applied. Our rule, Macaskel, said, \"The Collins Nelson Bill will not protect pre-existing circumstances. It has nothing to do with the circumstances that existed before.\" The bill would help insurance companies cover high-risk individuals, a category in which many of the pre-existing circumstances fall. While the draft law allows states to make their own decisions - in the sense that there is no guarantee that the pre-existing circumstances will be widely protected - it is an exaggeration to say that it has nothing to do with the pre-existing circumstances. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong.
