In support of Graham, the Democratic Congress Campaign Committee is using a new commercial to revive an old attack. \"Kungrsman Southerland voted for life care,\" September 30, 2014, says the ad. This allegation is followed by a list of procedures which the Commission believes will be hated by voters. Southerland's office denied it, and when we looked at this allegation before, we looked at this overestimation. When a pro-democracy group said the Republic of Arkansas, Tom Cotton voted in favour of \"tax-funded health care for life,\" Let's see how this allegation goes to the O-Meter truth. This land code gets a little complicated, so carry with us. The foundation stems from the fact that Congress must abide by the terms of the Health Care Act signed by President Barack Obama as much as you do. In 2010, the Republican Mr. Chuck Grasley of Iowa attached an amendment to the law requesting members of Congress to obtain health insurance through exchanges. Prior to that, the lawmakers purchased insurance through the federal employee health benefits programme, in which federal employees under 65 years of age opted for a plan and divided premiums with the federal government. This is how anyone with a collective plan is working -- in this case, just that their employer is the government of the United States. If the Congress abolishes Obama &apos; s sponsorship, the federal employee health benefit programme will return. The majority of the ruling party has been trying to cancel Obama's care for years now, voting to get rid of or change the law more than 50 times, depending on what you think. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, the announcement refers to July 11, 2012, the vote on HR 6079, the annulment bill that benefited from Southerland's vote. The congressman had a lot of approved votes on similar bills -- his online profile boasts that he voted \"to cancel, replace, and withdraw (Obamakari) more than 40 times.\" But the Counter-Narcotics Commission referred to a story in the hill about this particular case. \"The Republicans not only help their insurance company donors, but also try to help themselves,\" said a democratic official who was not named The Heel in the 9 July article before the vote. The Republicans in the House of Representatives are ready to break the promise that congressmen have health care like everyone else. The use of this as evidence is questionable, as Democrats cite mainly one of their anonymous sources. They mainly launder a democratic dialogue point through a non-partisan newspaper. So let's say Obama Carrie was magically legislated and the old congressional system returned. Here the problem lies in the prosecution: legislators and their associates cannot use the Federal Health Plan forever. If a politician loses an election or leaves his assistant in Congress, he will not be eligible for the federal employee health benefit programme. And then, when they're 65 years old, medical care will be taken over, but the legislator can, if he chooses, maintain his current plan to pay for things that are not covered by medical care. In both cases, they still have to continue to pay the premiums. At the same time, in the real world, if a congressman buys an insurance scheme from the stock exchange, this coverage is subject to the same conditions as any other person's policy. Once again, if they do not pay the premiums, they do not enjoy coverage. This does not guarantee a man &apos; s health insurance for life. The Southland Office indicated that the Republicans in Panama City voted in favour of the Council &apos; s budget decision in April 2014. This bill covered the budget policy of the General Democratic Party, which in part states that \"the retirement benefits of members of Congress should not include free and lifelong paid health care.\" It passed along the party lines and was sent to the Senate, where it stopped. Our ruling at the DEA says that Southerland voted for himself in health care for life. This is the campaign tactic used by the Democrats earlier, indicating how members of Congress can get back to the federal employee health benefit program if Obama's welfare program is cancelled and insurance markets are closed. This federal program does not last for life, but only as long as a member of Congress or an assistant to the federal government works. It also shifts to medical care when the lawmaker is still in office for 65 years. We're assessing this claim pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07180"}
