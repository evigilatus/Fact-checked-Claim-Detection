Califf, is a strong supporter of President Trump and his efforts to build a wall along the United States-Mexico border. The Congressman, representing the suburbs east of Sacramento and a large part of Sierra Nevada, states that the construction of a wall is a necessary step for border security. This argument was presented during a speech on the floor of the United States House last month, which the readers of Polyte Vak California proposed to verify the facts. In particular, one statement emerged: \"In 2017, illegal aliens killed 1800 Americans,\" said McClintock in his January 29 speech. We've verified that amazing allegation. Our immigration researchers say there is no comprehensive national database or study to track the number of persons killed by undocumented migrants or the nationality of their victims. Law enforcement officials in many states do not require suspects to obtain their immigration status. It is estimated that 10.7 million unauthorized migrants were living in the United States in 2016, according to this month &apos; s report from the Pew Research Centre. This figure has been the lowest in a decade and represents about 3.3 per cent of the country &apos; s population. Some undocumented migrants certainly commit violent crimes. When asked to support the claim of 1,800 murders, McClintock referred, without explanation, to a report by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency or the Immigration and Customs Service, entitled A Report on Immigration and Deportation Enforcement Operations 2017. The McClintock Office referred to the ICE 2017 report, which contains the above data on convictions for murder and other crimes by \"received aliens.\" However, the crimes listed did not necessarily occur in 2017, but for many years, according to immigration experts. The document summarizes the Institute &apos; s deportation efforts, including the illegal deportation of persons in the country after being sentenced to imprisonment for offences from traffic to murder. We have asked many immigration experts to evaluate the report with a particular focus on a graph most likely used by McClintock for 1,800. The experts said that the number was significantly inflated, and that careful examination showed that it did not represent murders in 2017, as alleged by the Congressman, but instead represented death convictions that had accumulated over a much longer period of time. \"1. 1. Murder by illegal immigrants who are insanely high\" wrote by Alex Noraste, a senior immigration policy analyst at the Kato Institute, \"Irregular migrants, about 3.75 per cent of the population, did not commit 10.4 per cent of murders in the United States,\" in 2017. There were 17,284 murders in the United States in 2017, according to FBI crime data, which do not contain information on the immigration situation. \"It is not a final source,\" NURASTE said, \"the 1,800 McClintock number (in fact 1,886 in the report) represents a combination of murder charges (355) and death convictions (1,531), mostly of persons released from prison and taken to pretrial detention in 2017 for deportation. But, as he said, the murders occurred \"over the past few decades,\" not in one year. A spokesperson for the CIA said that she had no information on the date of the crimes. Nor could she say how many of the 355 murder charges resulted in convictions. Luis de Cibio, Professor of Political Science, University of California, Irvine, added an immigration specialist. On January 27, 2021, Marco Rubio said in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World you do not see the usual use of the trials of former leaders.\" The report appeared to cover not only unauthorized migrants, or \"illegal aliens,\" as described by McClintock, but also the larger group of legal permanent residents. Asked about that, she said that the vast majority of individuals detained by the Agency were illegally in the country. Charles Cobrin, Professor of Criminology at the University of California at Irvine, asked whether the report consisted of less serious crimes with homicides, given the footnotes discussing \"criminal background\" and \"all criminal charges and convictions.\" The spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Authority stated that this was not the case. Corbin said: \"It's a twisted way of presenting data.\" \"I can see why someone looks at 1,886, goes more (in the same table of the report), looks at \"murder\" and wants to make this allegation. But this allegation is not true.\" The spokesman for McClintock said Congressman stood next to his speech. He noted that Vice-President Mike Pines had made the same allegation last July. McLintock, faking the facts that look at past facts, is not the first to distort the facts on this subject. In December, PolitiFact National verified a viral Facebook bulletin claiming that \"2,000 illegal aliens were arrested by the Immigration and Customs Authority in 2017 for murder here in the United States\" Polyte Fruitte classified this claim as false after finding that it misinterpreted ICI data, and noted that the crimes contained in the IAEA report could have accumulated over many years. In that case, immigration experts reported that there were no comprehensive data on murders committed by unauthorized migrants. \"There's no way to count it because no one's tracking it,\" Jessica Vaughn, Director of Policy Studies at the Centre for Migration Studies, Randy Caps, Director of Research for United States Programs at the Institute of Migration Policy, also said Politi Fact \"crimes may have been committed at any time, not in one year.\" Earlier this week, Polyte Fruitte also classified a false allegation from the Republic Matt Gates, R-Fla. He also found that he had inaccurately photographed data on murders attributed to illegal immigrants in the country. In 2017, illegal aliens allegedly killed 1,800 Americans. There is no comprehensive database to track these figures. Migration researchers said that the 2017 report of the Immigration and Naturalization Authority, on which McClintock relied, did not support his claim and that the figure of 1,800 was largely amplified. The report calculates 1,531 convictions for murder and 355 counts of murder of persons taken into custody by the CIA in 2017 for deportation, some of them after completion of prison sentences for their crimes. However, according to immigration experts, convictions represent crimes that have occurred for many decades, not necessarily in 2017. Nor is there any calculation of the number of murder charges that led to convictions. In addition, the figures may also include some legally permanent residents, a much larger group of illegal residents of the country. Overall, we found the Maclintoc allegation to be highly exaggerated and distorted by the information contained in the report. We assess it wrong. - The statement is not accurate.
