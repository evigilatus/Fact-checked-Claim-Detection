But the post goes beyond what is known about his actions to say he was \"participating.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A spokesman for the White House did not comment for the story.\nThe arrest\nThe story of Fred Trump\u2019s arrest\u00a0at a KKK rally has challenged reporters even before his son entered the 2016 presidential race.\nThe KKK riot broke out during the May 30, 1927, Memorial Day parade in Jamaica, Queens, N.Y., according to archives from The Brooklyn Daily Eagle.\nA week prior, police commissioner Joseph Warren was warned that the Klan intended to parade in hoods and gowns. Warren said they were not issued a permit to have a parade, but a report later said the KKK had permission from the Grand Army of the Republic,\u00a0a veterans\u2019 organization that had charge of the parade arrangements.\nHowever, on the day of the parade, police were unable to keep at least 1,000 Klansmen from participating. The New York Times stated that \"1,000 Klansmen and 100 policemen staged a free-for-all battle in Jamaica.\"\nFred Trump, then 21, was arrested\u00a0at the parade along with six others, according to the New York Times. (His address was listed as 175-25 Devonshire Road, Jamaica, which matched the 1930 Census.) However, unlike the other men arrested who faced various charges of assault and disorderly conduct, the Times reported that Trump \"was discharged.\"\nWe checked other reports of the riot to find more information \u2014 and found some discrepancies. A May 31, 1927, Brooklyn Daily Eagle article\u00a0named\u00a0six prisoners and all but one, bystander Ralph Losee, were called \"avowed Klansmen\" by the police. But this article did not mention Trump's name.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Daily Star, Trump was \"dismissed on a charge of refusing to disperse from a parade when ordered to do so.\"\nA June 2, 1927, Long Island Daily Press article said \"seven of the berobed marchers\" were arrested. So Fred Trump might have been wearing a Klansman robe.\nAlberto Martinez, a history professor at University of Texas, Austin, wrote his own in-depth report on Fred\u2019s arrest.\n\"Even if Fred Trump was involved in the riot, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that he was a KKK member or marcher, because news reports and court records both specify that local spectators (men and women) got involved in disrupting the parade,\" Martinez wrote in an email.\nAdditionally, he said, Fred Trump was the only one arrested who was promptly released without any charges.\nMartinez said the disposition of the police officers also made him question whether Fred Trump was involved.\n\"The Queens County Grand Jury accused the police \u2018for the disgraceful assault not only upon the (KKK) marchers but innocent civilians along the line of the march\u2019 in the parade,\" Martinez wrote.\nA police car hit and seriously injured Losee, the innocent bystander who was arrested, and several minors were injured by the police.\nThe president of the Grand Jurors\u2019 Association of Queens said, \"Atrocities were committed by the police which were unwarranted and which should be condemned.\"\n\"These points show that the police clashed not only with Klansmen but with innocent spectators, which again calls into question whether Fred Trump was necessarily a KKK marcher or a local spectator,\" Martinez wrote.\nOur ruling\nA picture on Facebook claims Fred Trump was arrested for \"participating\" a KKK riot.\nYes, Trump's father was arrested\u00a0in connection with the KKK's appearance at a Memorial Day parade. The group's march led to a violent confrontation with police. However, there is not enough documentation to show Trump was participating. Unlike other men who were arrested that day, his charge\u00a0was quickly dropped.\u00a0\nThe post stretches what is known about the events that day to leave a misleading impression.
