Haas has compelling experience with gun violence: Her daughter, Emily, was grazed twice in the head during the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech that left 32 dead and 17 wounded.\nHer brief remarks touched on background check laws. All states require licensed gun dealers to conduct a background check before selling a firearm to make sure the prospective buyer does not have a criminal record or disqualifying mental condition. But Virginia and 32 other states don\u2019t require background checks for firearms bought through an unlicensed seller -- someone who isn\u2019t in the routine business of selling guns. Haas backed a bill that would have \u00a0narrowed that exception.\nIn states that run background checks for privately-sold handguns, \"49 percent fewer women are shot and killed,\" she said.\nSince Haas spoke, the General Assembly has scuttled major gun control bills, including the loophole closer. But background checks for all gun buyers is a perennial issue before the legislature and we wondered whether Haas\u2019 statement was correct in terms of the number she used and the cause and effect of background check laws on women\u2019s lives. She told us the figure came from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\nThe numbers\nThe group issued a report last September examining firearm homicides of women by intimate partners -- current and former husbands, as well as boyfriends. It found that from 2008-2012, the rate of such murders was 46 percent lower in 14 states that had background checks for some or all private handgun sales when compared with the rest of the nation. Stacey Radnor, a spokeswoman with Everytown, said the group also found that the level of non-gun intimate partner homicides of women was much less stark -- only 4.3 percent lower in the states with private-sale background checks for handguns.\nWe should note, however, that Haas\u2019 statement focused on a broader definition of victims. \u00a0She cited \"women\" without any reference to whether they were domestic violence victims.\nSo to examine her exact statement, we needed to find figures on gun murders deaths of all women, which are not in Everytown\u2019s report.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compiles fatality data based on information from death certificates filed in each state. We looked at the 14 states that had background checks on private handgun sales during the 5-year period Everytown references. Those states are California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. Three other states have in recent years added private-sale background checks: Colorado, Delaware and Washington.\nWe found those firearms homicide figures of women for all but three states with small populations -- Rhode Island (which requires a background check for private handgun sales) as well as Vermont and Wyoming (which do not). The CDC withholds the number of firearms homicides of women in those states because they are so few in number. But given the small size of each state\u2019s population, it wouldn\u2019t affect the overall trend line for the 47 other states where the information was available.\nWe found that in states with private-sale background checks, the rate of firearm homicides of females age 18 and over was 1.0 per 100,000 women. In the states that didn\u2019t extend background checks to private handgun sales, the homicide rate was 1.6 per 100,000 women in that age group.\nThat means there were 38 percent fewer firearms homicides of women in the states with private-sale background checks for handguns than the rest of the nation, lower than Haas\u2019 statistic but still a significant figure.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Virginia, the rate was 1.4 per 100,000 women.\nWe should note some states without background checks on all handgun sales bucked the trend of lower firearms violence against females.\nMinnesota, which has no requirement for background checks on private handgun sales, had a rate of 0.6 firearms homicides for every 100,000 women. That was one-third the rate of North Carolina, which requires a background check of anyone seeking to buy a handgun.\nCause and effect\nTwo analysts we contacted urged caution in interpreting a correlation in lower rates of gun violence to private-sale background checks.\n\"Making causal claims is always riskier,\" Jacquelyn White, a psychology professor at the University of North Carolina Greensboro, said in an email. \"States that require background checks may also be more likely to support other efforts that contribute to the well-being of their residents. Remember, correlation is not causation. There may be other factors, such as a more enlightened commitment to creating healthy and safe communities, that result in an array of programs and policies that reduce domestic violence.\"\nGary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University, said Everytown\u2019s figure \"takes no other account of any other factors that affect homicides.\"\n\"States do not randomly pass gun laws -- those that pass gun laws are different in many ways from those that do not,\" Kleck, who has studied the impact of background checks on homicide rates, said in an email. \u00a0\"For obvious political reasons, it\u2019s easier to enact stricter gun laws in states with fewer gun-owning voters. Thus, states that extended background checks to private gun transfers had lower gun ownership rates even before those laws were passed. Likewise, states with stricter gun laws are more urban, less likely to be Southern or Western (and thus culturally different), more politically liberal etc. You can\u2019t isolate the effect of a gun law without controlling for other violence-related factors.\"\nOur ruling\nHaas said in states with comprehensive background checks for handguns, \"49 percent fewer women are shot and killed.\" She supports that statement by pointing to figures examining a narrower group of female firearms victims -- those killed in domestic violence situations.\nBut figures examining the broader group of victims she cited in her statement -- women in general -- show 38 percent fewer women were shot and killed in the states with private-sale background checks on handgun sales.\nThat\u2019s not quite high as the figure she cited, but it still represents a lower rate of gun homicides of women in states with comprehensive background checks.\nBut experts cautioned against reading too much into that correlation. They noted that there may be other factors beyond background checks that led to that result.\nWe rate her claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06724"}
