But although we have responded to these concerns, I believe that there are still some who are trying to move the targets on us again.\" \"Siredon's higher fence\" said Obama. \"They may need a ditch. Maybe they want crocodiles in the trench. They will never be satisfied. I understand that. This is politics.\" The skiing along the United States-Mexico border was a long time ago a difficult political issue, so with Obama's announcement to complete the mission, we decided to verify that. Ministry of Internal Security officials told us that they had completed 649 miles of 652 miles of fence (99.5%), which included 299 miles of vehicle barriers and 350 miles of infantry fence. However, on the same day that Obama delivered a speech, Jim Dement wrote a newspaper article in a national magazine in which he replied that the Obama administration \"did not do its duty to end the border fence, which is a crucial part of preserving American safety and stopping illegal immigration.\" \"Five years ago, legislation was enacted to build a 700-mile double-layered border fence along the south-west border,\" by Dimint. \"This promise has not been fulfilled. Today, according to the Department of Homeland Security staff, only 5% of the double layer fence has been completed, only 36.3 miles.\" So what does it give? Is the border fence \"now complete\" or not? I don't want to be Clinton on you, but it depends to a large extent on how you define the fence. You must return to the \"safe fence\" law of 2006 approved by the Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. It authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fences along the border with Mexico. The law has defined \"at least two layers of reinforced fence.\" However, the law was amended in an important way the following year. In response to the Ministry of Internal Security's urging - which said that the various border terrains required different types of fence, the one-size-fits-all approach across the entire border did not make sense - Sen. Kay Bailey Hachison, R-Texas, proposed an amendment to give the Ministry of National Security the discretion to determine the type of fence appropriate in different regions. The Act was amended to read as follows: \"Nothing in this paragraph shall oblige the Minister of National Security to install a fence, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras and sensors at a particular location along an international border of the United States if the Minister decides that the use or placement of these resources is not the most appropriate means of achieving and maintaining operational control of the international borders at that location.\" In other words, the Border Patrol will have the scope to determine what type of fence is appropriate in the various regions. The amendment was introduced into the Federal Budget Bill in late 2007 despite conviction by legislators such as Reps. Petter King, R-N.Y., and Danchan Hunter, R-Calif., who claimed that the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised by the 2006 Bill. At that time, Hotchson told the San Antonio Express News, \"The border patrol agents reported that coyotes and drug dealers were changing their ways during the deployment of the fence, so the amendment gives our agents the discretion to locate the fence when necessary to achieve operational control of our borders.\" There are currently 36.3 miles of double-layered fence, the type with a sufficient gap that you can drive between layers. However, most of the duel that was set up was a vehicle barricade, designed to stop vehicles rather than people (see here) and a single-layer infantry fence (see here). The design specifications vary according to geographical and climatic characteristics, but according to the customs and border patrol web site, they include the steel \"rail pillar\" in concrete; the steel picket pattern fence in concrete; the hoses of vehicles similar to those around federal buildings; the Normandy vehicle fence consisting of a steel beam; and the concrete shirts walls with a steel network. That's not enough for some anti-immigration opponent. Mark Crickoryan, Executive Director of the Centre for Migration Studies, said that he would prefer stricter enforcement against irregular migration. There may be a car barricade, but \"Your grandmother can jump over them,\" he said, \"That's not what Congress thinks it was voting for.\" Cricorian said, \"The President's claim that the job was done is misleading.\" A report issued by the Government Accountability Office for Border Security in February 2011 paints a mixed picture. The report acknowledges the progress made on the fences, as well as hundreds of other miles considered to be under \"operational control,\" but \"DHS reports that the south-western border remains vulnerable to illegal cross-border activity, including smuggling of human beings and illicit drugs.\" The retired President of the National Border Control Council, the Union representing all members of the forward border patrols, said that the type of fence was less important than whether the border was safe. It is estimated that for every person arrested (the Border Patrol reported that it had arrested more than 445,000 persons who had entered illegally in 2010) two others occurred, as Bunner said. \"For me, this doesn't look like border security.\" But is it accurate for Obama to claim that \"the fence is now basically complete\"? According to the Ministry of National Security, there is now a fence of 649 miles out of the 652 miles described in the Public Security Act 2006. However, the vast majority of this requirement has been met by vehicle barriers and a single-layer infantry fence. The original law specifically calls for a double-layered fence, and there are currently only 36.3 miles of double-layered fence. However, the law was subsequently amended to allow border security with discretion to determine the type of fence suitable for the different regions. Therefore, Obama can make the case that single-layer vehicle barriers and pedestrian fences satisfy the text of the amended law. But we also believe that Obama is being misled, especially when he mocks Republican opponents, saying that despite the building of the fence, \"they're going to throw a higher fence. Maybe they need a trench. Maybe they want crocodiles in the trench.\" The border patrol did not go \"up and above\" what the Republicans demanded, as Obama claimed. What they originally asked for was a double-layered fence, and they didn't get much of it. We therefore assess Obama's statement hardly true.
