Federal prosecutors claim that Epstein has arranged a sex trafficking scheme by paying teenage girls money to participate in sexual acts. News outlets and social media users quickly referred to its affiliation with the Democratic Party and its links with politicians, including President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton. While there is little evidence to suggest that such figures were aware of the alleged crimes of Epstein, Facebook users benefit from the link between Epstein and Democrats in post-incitement allegations linking the party to sexual misconduct. Among these articles is a diary with photographs alleging that former President Barack Obama is giving the Presidential Freedom Medal to four men: Clinton, actor Bill Cosby, former Congressman Anthony Weiner, and former film producer Harvey Weinstein. All four have been charged with or charged with sexual abuse or misconduct in the past. \"I didn't know there was a sex predator prize... thanks to the Democrats,\" reading the article. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Many comments suggest that people believe that the page is real, and the amulet has captured thousands of fans, subscribers and comments. So we wanted to see if the picture was real. It turns out that all but one of the images listed in the mem are false. The search for the opposite image of the entire meme brought us to the verification of the facts of the Snoops of October 2017. According to fact-checker Dan Yvonne, Obama &apos; s image of Clinton &apos; s freedom presidential medal was true - Clinton was granted this honour in November 2013. But his image is said to give the prize to the other three men a fake. At the outset, only Cosby is included in the official Senate list of persons who won the Presidential Medal of Freedom. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook that says that Nancy Belusi sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"requiring him to stick to a proven democratic playbook.\" By Sira Aurourke on January 11, 2021, we came looking for the reverse picture of Winston's photo to the Hoff Post exhibit with the image of former Vice President Joe Biden who received the medal from Obama in January. As Snoops first mentioned, it seems that the face of Winston over Paden's face looks like the previous man has won the prize instead of the last. It was taken from Getty A's photos, a reverse image of Weiner's photo that brought us to France 24 stories with Tom Hanks' video photo, getting a medal from Obama in November 2016. Looks like Weiner's photo was made based on Hanks'. It's no wonder that Cosby's image that she allegedly got the Presidential Order of Freedom is also fake, but not for the reasons you expect. Searching the reverse image of Cosby from the Mimi took us to Mick's story about Bruce Springsteen. The article contains a picture of Springsteen, who received the award in November 2016 and which once again appears to be the basis of the fake image of Cosby. == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man George W. Bush gave it to him on July 9, 2002, according to the Senate's list of winners. Our Facebook governor, Mimina, claimed to show Obama the presidential freedom medal to Bill Clinton, Bill Cosby, Anthony Weiner and Harvey Weinstein. The Senate included Clinton and Cosby only as official winners in the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Research of the opposite images on all the images listed in the mem shows that everything except Clinton's image has been manipulated. The other fact-checkers have dismantled this Mimi before. The Facebook article is not accurate and claims to be ridiculous. We value it pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00430"}
