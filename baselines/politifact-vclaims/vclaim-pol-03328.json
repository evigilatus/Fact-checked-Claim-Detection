Democrat repeats misleading claim rape a pre-existing condition under GOP bill", "text": "Democratic Congresswoman Judy Chu of Los Angeles County repeated a deceptive claim about the GOP health care bill last week after it narrowly passed the U.S. House.\nChu said the legislation \"would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition,\" in a press release on May 4, 2017. Chu and all other Democrats in the House opposed the bill, which has an uncertain future in the U.S. Senate.\nThe national PolitiFact team fact-checked similar claims in the headlines of several blogs and rated them Mostly False. It called the statements \"bombastic\" and \"misleading.\" The Washington Post Fact Checker also rejected this claim, giving it four pinnochios.\nPolitiFact noted that some blogs have changed their headlines or issued corrections.\nIn a written statement on May 10, 2017, Chu said she stands by her claim:\n\"While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the (American Health Care Act),\" she said.\nSummary of PolitiFact\u2019s findings\nPolitiFact Wisconsin also looked at the national PolitiFact\u2019s analysis and summarized it\u2019s findings this way:\n\n\nThe GOP bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition.\n\n\n\n\nConditions stemming from a sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be judged to be a pre-existing condition.\n\n\nStates would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with an existing condition, possibly making coverage unaffordable.\n\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with the claim\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because a person has a pre-existing medical condition.\nRepublicans\u2019 Affordable Care Act replacement \u2014 the American Health Care Act, which the House passed May 4 \u2014 weakens those protections.\nThese blog posts get at a real problem with the Republican bill if it were to become law. Victims of sexual assault could, conceivably, find themselves in a situation where they can\u2019t afford insurance because of medical issues that stem from their assault.\nBut the headlines that say the GOP bill makes sexual assault a pre-existing condition are hyperbolic based on the what the bill actually says.\nThey stoke fears that the bill singles out victims of sexual assault, limiting their access to health care specifically.\nBut the Republican bill doesn\u2019t pinpoint any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition; that\u2019s something the insurance companies or individual states would decide. As it stands, anyone with a pre-existing condition could face problems.\nProblems prior to the Affordable Care Act\nThe blogs discuss anecdotal stories of women who, prior to the Affordable Care Act, were sexually assaulted and then sought treatment stemming from that assault. Later, when these women tried to purchase health insurance, they were denied coverage.\nThese women weren\u2019t necessarily denied coverage because of the sexual assault; rather, it was because of residual treatment they sought afterward, such as taking HIV-preventative medication or seeing a therapist.\nNone of the several health insurance experts we consulted were aware of insurance companies with policies that specify \"sexual assault\" or \"rape\" as a condition to consider when evaluating someone\u2019s eligibility. But insurance resources did regularly list mental health issues or sexually-transmitted illnesses as pre-existing conditions.\nFor example, if a person were pricked with a used needle or had consensual sex with someone they later discovered had HIV, that person might also take HIV preventatives. And because they took that medication, they, like some sexual assault victims, might have trouble buying health insurance on the open market.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a sexual assault victim chose not to seek medical treatment, he or she wouldn\u2019t necessarily face the same challenge in getting insurance.\n\"This is not something specific about sexual assault,\" said Urban Institute senior fellow Linda Blumberg. \"But to the extent victims of sexual assault are needing to take this (HIV) medication, they\u2019re very vulnerable in terms of getting insurance coverage in the future.\"\nWhat repealing the Affordable Care Act could mean\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent authority on health policy, recently wrote policy papers about pre-existing conditions prior to the Affordable Care Actand how repealing the law would affect women. \u00a0Neither of those two articles say sexual assault victims would face a particular challenge.\nThe Republicans\u2019 bill doesn\u2019t change what is or is not a pre-existing condition.\nWhat it does is allow more consideration of pre-existing conditions than is permitted under the Affordable Care Act.\n\"The bill just leaves it to the imagination at this point,\" Blumberg said, referring to what insurance companies might consider as a pre-existing condition.\nTo be clear, the bill doesn\u2019t allow insurance providers to deny coverage to someone based on pre-existing conditions outright. But with a waiver, states can allow providers to set premium costs based on an individual\u2019s \"health status.\" Even though the bill puts in some protections, health economists say this could make insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions.\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies were not transparent about what counts as a pre-existing condition, and the House Republican replacement doesn\u2019t change that, said Kathryn Votava, president of health care consulting company Goodcare.\nThis allows for the real possibility that sexual assault victims who seek medical treatment could face challenges in getting health insurance if the Republican bill becomes law, she said.\n\"Could\" is the key word.\nWhat ultimately happens depends on whether the bill is changed in the Senate and how states and insurance companies respond.\nThe lack of transparency, as well as the potential for different policies from state to state, would put a significant burden on consumers trying to figure out whether they can obtain insurance given their health status, said Claire Brindis, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California San Francisco.\nFor victims of sexual assault in particular, the bill could have a chilling effect, she added. Women might choose not to seek medical treatment after an assault because they are concerned it might affect their ability to get health insurance down the line.\nSexual assault \"is the tip of the iceberg,\" Brindis said. \"There are many many other examples of unexpected events that occur in day to day life, that you can\u2019t plan for, can\u2019t avoid.\"\nOur ruling\nVarious bloggers, and some members of Congress, wrote that under the House Republican health plan, sexual assault and domestic violence is a pre-existing condition.\nSeveral websites have since softened their headlines to be more careful, going from \"would\" to \"could.\"\nThe bill does not change what is or is not a pre-existing condition; the health insurance companies write those definitions for themselves. The House bill also does not single out sexual assault or any other medical issue as a pre-existing condition.\nPrior to the Affordable Care Act, some victims of sexual assault said they had trouble getting health insurance because they sought medical services that the insurance companies viewed as evidence of a pre-existing condition, such as for sexually transmitted illness or mental health.\nThe Republican bill might make it harder for people who have pre-existing conditions to get affordable health care coverage. Victims of sexual assault would face the same challenge as others with pre-existing conditions. But we don\u2019t know for sure given the bill\u2019s current form.\nPolitiFact National rated this claim Mostly False.\nFollowing the same analysis, PolitiFact California rates Chu\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013\u00a0The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nUPDATE: This fact check has been updated with a response from Rep. Chu, who issued a statement on May 10, 2017, which reads in full:\u00a0\n\"As it stands today, anybody with a preexisting condition is protected thanks to the Affordable Care Act. This includes women, who were previously charged more for a range of care that is, today, considered \u2018essential\u2019. The AHCA makes it easier for insurers to earn waivers to charge more for preexisting conditions and leaves the question of what should be covered up to others. In my statement, I said that this bill \u2018would once again allow a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition.\u2019 While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the AHCA. We should not even be discussing how women can be charged more for their care, even if it requires 2, 3, or 4 extra steps. This bill represents a step backwards for Americans\u2019 health in a number of ways.\"\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-09 23:05:50 UTC   Politifact    4 1 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly False  The GOP health bill \"would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition.\"    Judy Chu California Congresswoman    Thursday, May 4, 2017 2017-05-04    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03328"}
