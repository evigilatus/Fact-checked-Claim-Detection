Tom Price, a Republican from Georgia, complained that Obama has been hostile toward GOP suggestions on health care.\n\"You have repeatedly said, most recently at -- at the State of the Union, that Republicans have offered no ideas and no solutions,\" Price said on Jan. 29, 2010.\n\"I don't think I said that,\" Obama replied. \"What I said was within the context of health care -- I remember that speech pretty well. It was only two days ago. . . . I said I'd welcome ideas that you might provide. I didn't say that you haven't provided ideas. I said I'd welcome those ideas that you'll provide.\"Price then said, \"Mr. President, multiple times from your administration there have come statements that Republicans have no ideas and no solutions, in spite of the fact that we've offered, as demonstrated today, positive solutions to all of the challenges we face, including energy and the economy and health care.\"\nBecause Price appeared to correct himself after Obama's reply, we decided to focus on the second claim, that people in Obama's administration have made \"statements that Republicans have no ideas and no solutions.\" Price spokesman Brendan Buck provided a couple of examples and we found a couple of our own:\n\u2022 At a picnic with labor officials in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Sept. 7, 2009, Obama complained that the critics of health care reform -- he didn't identify them as Republicans, but it was clear he was referring to them -- were not offering their own solutions. He said, \"I've got a question for all those folks: What are you going to do? What's your answer? What's your solution? And you know what? They don't have one. Their answer is to do nothing. Their answer is to do nothing.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
