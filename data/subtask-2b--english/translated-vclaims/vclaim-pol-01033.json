No.", "text": "The late President of the Nirvana Front, Kurt Coban, was known to be pushing the border, whether on stage or outside, and often talking about his beliefs and personal life. His frankness also led to some forgery, yet there is a false quote attributed to Kobin as he distributes the Internet, claiming that the Rock in 1993 was predicted and approved by Donald Trump. It is reported that it was first posted on the Facebook page \"Tromp Train\" in 2016 and has since appeared in various formats. She reappeared in an article on February 9th, saying, \"In the end, I think my generation will surprise everyone. We already know that both political parties play on both sides of the centre and we will elect a real outsider when we're fully mature. I wouldn't be surprised if he wasn't a businessman who couldn't be bought and who did what was right for the people. Someone like Donald Trump is as crazy as it looks.\" As part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast, reference has been made to the Mim. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The meme includes any sources or information about where Cob\u00e1n predicted (along with 1993) and there is no record of Cob\u00e1n ever saying so. The statement has also been seen by several media outlets since it became viral. Moreover, a former director of Nervana, Danny Goldberg, refused that the late singer had spoken in an article of opinion about the nation in August 2018. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \"As one of Nervana's directors when Kurt was alive,\" wrote Goldberg by Tom Kircher on January 16, 2021, \"I know that the quote is not just an invention but also an atrocity of Kurt's beliefs.\" It is also important to note that one of the most well-known political beliefs in Cob\u00e1n is its opposition to the rich and established. The famous, when he showed up on Rolling Stone's cover in 1992, he was wearing a T-shirt that read \"Corborate magazine still sucks!\" In an interview in 1992 with Argentine journalist Sergio Marche, Cob\u00e9n discussed his preference to see someone \"not a professional politician\" become president. But he was equally clear about what he thought about work (Ross Beirut), and then a third-party candidate: \"The man is bad. He's rich, and I don't trust him as president.\" Our verdict with a false quote predicting his headship, Donald Trump, attributed to the late Kurt Cob\u00e1n, reappeared on the Internet after he had circulated the Internet for years. There are no records of Cob\u00e1n saying the statement, and those close to him categorically reject what he said - or might say - the words. We value it pants on fire!
