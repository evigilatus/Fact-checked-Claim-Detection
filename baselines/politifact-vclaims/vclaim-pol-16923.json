(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe photo that is repeated in all of them, however, is of Conor Wilmot, a 13-year-old boy from County Clare, Ireland, who died after reportedly participating in a self-harm challenge. The story was\u00a0covered\u00a0by local media at the time after the boy\u2019s loved ones spoke out.\nLet\u2019s look at each image in the Facebook post:\n1. Conor Wilmot\nThe first screenshot includes a portion of a legitimate May 16, 2017, news article in the Irish Times about Conor\u2019s death.\u00a0\nThe boy\u2019s father said in the article his son died from playing a \"choking game\" he had found on the internet and did not intend to take his own life.\nThe photo of Conor in that article, visible in the screenshot, is authentic.\n2. Isaiah Gonzales\nThe second screenshot includes the same photo of Conor.\u00a0\nBut the caption identifies the boy as Isaiah Gonzales and the photo credit is from a TV station in San Antonio, Texas.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaiah Gonzales is the name of a 15-year-old boy from San Antonio who hanged himself on July 8, 2017, news reports show.\nAccording to his family, Isaiah\u2019s suicide was possibly tied to a sometimes-dangerous online game known as the Blue Whale Challenge, the Washington Post reported.\nBoth suicides occurred more than two years before the coronavirus first surfaced in China.\n3. Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab\nThe third screenshot also has the same photo of Conor.\u00a0\nIt includes the headline from an April 1, 2020, news article about the youngest person in the United Kingdom to die from COVID-19.\nThat person is Ismail, who was 13 and lived in London.\u00a0\nAFP Fact Check and other websites have reported that social media posts have falsely included a photo of Conor with news articles about Ismail\u2019s death.\nA family\u2019s grief\nThe newspaper in Conor\u2019s home area, The Clare Echo, published a news article April 6, 2020 about the misuse of Conor\u2019s photos. It included a screenshot of the same images in the Facebook claim we\u2019re checking.\u00a0\nThe article said Conor\u2019s older sister, Melanie Wilmot, posted a message online that said: \"We\u2019re devastated that they can do this, frankly had enough just let us be and leave Conor alone.\"\u00a0\nOur ruling\nThis Facebook post does not show that the media is falsely suggesting that the same boy had died of the coronavirus in three different countries.\nRather, it shows that someone used doctored images of a child who reportedly killed himself to falsely suggest a media conspiracy over COVID-19.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16923"}
