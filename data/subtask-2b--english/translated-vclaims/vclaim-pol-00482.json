Under the image of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now Tramp's lawyer, it seems as a headline: \"Giliani forwards the indictments to Belosi on behalf of the White House.\" On top of this picture, these words are: \"Wow, Juliani filed an application for dismissal, but she also filed the first public official charge against Triasun. This post was published on Facebook on June 20th and appears to be a Twitter tweet that appears to no longer exist, @Robert_QSentMi. It was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There was no evidence that Giuliani had come to isolate Pelosi, and unfortunately for some 200,000 people who signed a petition to the White House to isolate Pelosi, the Constitution \"gives the House of Representatives the sole power to isolate an official and makes the Senate the sole court,\" according to a history of isolation on the Council's website. The Constitution provides that the President, Vice-President and civil servants of the United States \"shall be removed from office for treason, bribery or other serious crimes and offences and shall be convicted of them.\" \u2022 On January 12, 2021, individual members of the House of Representatives can submit removal decisions such as bills, or the House of Representatives can initiate proceedings by issuing a decision authorizing an investigation into isolation. Of the more than 60 indictments, less than one third resulted in total isolation, and only eight persons were convicted and removed from office by the Senate, according to the date of dismissal in Congress. These eight people were all federal judges. Two presidents, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, were also isolated. Here is a list of all 19 persons sentenced by the House of Representatives, as a result of those proceedings. The source of Facebook appears to be the 18 March story on Bostatroll.org, which presents the same picture and address. The first line of this story says: \"Rody Giuliani entered the First Circuit Court of Writing today and kept articles about Nancy Pelosi's accusation.\" When you click on the interface, the site provides the words \"first circle of books,\" it takes you to Google's translated page, which basically mentions everything we know to be true about this story: \"No. Nothing like that.\" This is because Bustatroll.org is a branch of America's last line of defense, a naive publication. We're assessing this Facebook mail pants on fire! Correction, October 15, 2019: Andrew Johnson was one of two isolated presidents. An earlier version of this story wrongly stated that Andrew Jackson had been sentenced.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00482"}
