Rick Scott for spending too much time defending Enterprise Florida and not enough time on issues that protect jobs.\nIn an April 3 Tampa Bay Times column, Corcoran warned that not addressing the state's workers' compensation system and a property insurance issue known as \"assignment of benefits\" will put small and family-run businesses in jeopardy.\nCorcoran said that instead of working with the House on these issues, Scott has spent most of the 60-day legislative session fighting for an agency that doesn\u2019t help small businesses.\n\"(Enterprise Florida) subsidizes big companies with over 1,000 employees to compete against our small businesses, which make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce and who almost never receive a penny of government money,\" Corcoran wrote.\nFor this fact-check, we decided to focus on the statistics about small businesses in Florida and whether they \"almost never\" receive government money.\nRegardless of how you define them, small businesses make up a large chunk of all businesses in Florida. However, his point that small businesses \"almost never\" receive government money is at best an exaggeration.\nSmall businesses not so small in Florida \nThere is no standard definition for a small business. The difference between large and small firms can depend on how many people a firm employs, the amount of revenue the firm makes or the type of industry.\nNo matter which way you slice the pie, small businesses in Florida comprise a significant chunk of all business in the Sunshine State.\nFlorida is home to approximately 2.4 million businesses of all sizes. That figure includes large firms, small firms and nonemployer firms \u2014 a technical term to describe a business with no employees.\nMost nonemployers are self-employed individuals whose business may or may not be the main source of income, such as someone who earns money as a tutor.\nNonemployers make up 81.5 percent of all businesses in the state.\nThe latest snapshot comes from the federal government. The Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy considers a small business as any firm with fewer than 500 employees (including the nonemployers).\nUnder that metric, the total number of small businesses is about 2.3 million. That comes out to 99.8 percent of all businesses, an even larger share than Corcoran\u2019s figure.\nCorcoran got to his figure of 98.9 percent by excluding firms without a single employee. The figure came from a report that divided the number of firms with fewer than 500 employees (almost 420,000) with the total of firms with employees (424,550).\n\nTo throw out another measure that still proves the prevalence of small businesses, firms with fewer than 20 employees make up about 90 percent of all businesses in the state.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Nelson\n\n\nstated on June 11, 2009 in during a U.S. Senate debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The truth is any oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, reducing our use of foreign oil not by one single drop.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 October 5, 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorcoran\u2019s point about small businesses employing \"nearly half\" of the workforce is slightly above the actual figure.\nThe latest number shows that small businesses (defined as fewer than 500 employees) employed 3.2 million people. That is about 42.8 percent of the workforce.\nKwame Donaldson, a senior economist at Moody\u2019s, said that compared to the national average, small businesses in Florida employ a smaller share of the workforce (43 percent in Florida vs. 48 percent nationwide).\nAre small businesses getting gypped?\nCorcoran said small businesses \"almost never\" get government money.\nCorcoran\u2019s team pointed to a December 2016 review of Enterprise Florida\u2019s economic development system by the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, a nonpartisan research arm of the Legislature.\nThe analysis found that the majority of businesses incentives (51.9 percent) went to employers with more than 1,000 employees.\nThe analysis pointed out that businesses with less than 50 employees received only 14.5 percent of economic incentives.\n\"Although 96 percent of the state\u2019s businesses employ fewer than 50 employees, most state-level economic development programs, particularly incentives, generally benefit large businesses,\" it reads.\nHere\u2019s the breakdown:\n\nIf we consider a small business as a firm between 1 and 499 employees, as Corcoran did for the other part of his point, then small businesses were awarded 38.3 percent of economic incentives.\nThat\u2019s not as much as the big firms got, but it\u2019s not \"almost nothing.\"\nOur ruling\nCorcoran said small businesses \"make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce\" and \"almost never receive a penny of government money.\"\nNo matter the definition, small businesses in Florida make up the majority of all businesses in the state. Corcoran\u2019s specific numbers are accurate if a small business is defined as any firm with fewer than 500 employees.\nHowever, by that 500-employee metric, it is not the case that small businesses \"almost never\" receive government money. While large firms get the majority of incentives, firms that employ between 1 to 499 people in Florida were awarded almost 40 percent of all incentive projects in past years.\nSo while large firms receive the majority of economic incentives, it is imprecise to say there\u2019s \"almost nothing\" left for the little guy.\u00a0\nFor a partially accurate claim that requires explanation, we rate it Half True.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    3 7  Politifact Rating: Half True  Says small businesses \"make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce\" and \"almost never receive a penny of government money.\"    Richard Corcoran House Speaker   in an op-ed Monday, April 3, 2017 04/03/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03444"}
