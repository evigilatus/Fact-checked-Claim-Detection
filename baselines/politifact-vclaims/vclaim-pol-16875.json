In a CNN virtual town hall, Biden talked about the early days as the virus spread from China.\n\"I said, among others, that, you know, you should get into China, get our experts there, we have the best in the world, get them in so we know what's actually happening,\" Biden said March 27. \"There was no effort to do that. He didn't put any pressure on (Chinese President) Xi. I guess because of his trade deal, which wasn't much of a deal. And in addition to that, what happened was, we had one person in-country who was working. He pulled him out of the country.\"\nThere are two claims to sort out: that Trump made no effort to get American epidemiologists into China, and that he pulled out the one person who was working there.\nBiden\u2019s first claim distorts the American response, and the second skips over other changes that took place at the same time.\u00a0\nChina resisted all outsiders\nThe words of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Jan. 28 undercut Biden\u2019s sweeping statement that \"there was no effort\" to get experts into China.\nAzar said that by Jan. 6, about a week after China confirmed the existence of a new virus, \"we offered to send a CDC team to China.\"\n\"I reiterated that offer when I spoke to China's Minister of Health on Monday (Jan. 27), and it was reiterated again via the World Health Organization today,\" Azar said. \"We are urging China: More cooperation and transparency are the most important steps you can take toward a more effective response.\"\nThere is no question that China resisted the presence of outside experts.\nThe World Health Organization was working its own medical diplomacy to get more visibility into the China situation. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus met with Xi on Jan. 28 in Beijing. That was a month into the pandemic and while he won approval for the deployment of a WHO team, that didn\u2019t happen until Feb. 10.\nThe WHO group included some Americans, but in a statement, the Health and Human Services Departments said the Chinese \"limited the ability and timing for CDC staff to participate in the WHO joint mission.\"\nBiden\u2019s campaign staff said that Trump himself should have pressed the issue in his conversations with Xi. We asked the White House press office if he had and got no comment.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless, Azar, a high-ranking member of the cabinet, did tell his Chinese counterpart that the United States was ready to provide people.\u00a0 In a Jan. 27 tweet, Trump said he had broadly done\u00a0the same.\n\"We have offered China and President Xi any help that is necessary. Our experts are extraordinary,\" Trump said.\nRemoving the one person in China\nBiden said Trump pulled the \"one person\" in China \"who was working.\" This, his staff said, referred to the July 2019 departure of an American epidemiologist from the CDC\u2019s China office. (The CDC maintains offices in countries around the world. The one in China dates back to 2003.)\nReuters reported that the CDC epidemiologist, Linda Quick, would have been in a position to help Chinese experts respond to the emerging disease precisely because she was embedded in China\u2019s CDC to train Chinese specialists.\nThe CDC\u2019s website shows that the U.S. staff in China went from eight in March 2019 to three in December 2019. The change was driven by a shift in the U.S. strategy to combat HIV/AIDS, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department said.\n\"The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief under the Office of Global AIDS Coordinator moved to a regional model in this region and based on the epidemic in China to date, changes were made to the existing footprint,\" the department\u2019s statement said.\nIn July 2019, the CDC said it would complete its PEPFAR-funded work in China that year.\nThe department\u2019s statement also said that CDC began \"scaling up\" before the outbreak. That didn\u2019t necessarily mean additional U.S. staff. The program hires more Chinese staffers than American ones.\nOur ruling\nBiden said that Trump made \"no effort\" to get American experts into China and pulled the \"one person\" the U.S. had on the ground out of China.\nTrump\u2019s personal role is unclear, but his Health and Human Services secretary did make the effort to get U.S. experts inside. The department reached out to China in the first week of January, and secretary Azar asked his Chinese counterpart again in late January. China resisted outsiders, both from the U.S. and WHO.\u00a0\nBiden\u2019s assertion that Trump pulled the \"one person\" out of China has more substance, but is not as straight-forward as he made it sound. An American CDC epidemiologist left in July and was not replaced. The overall American staff went from eight down to three. According to the Health and Human Services Department, the staff reduction was mainly driven by changes in the U.S. strategy to reduce HIV/AIDS. Biden made it sound as though everyone left, but some CDC staff remained.\nThe first claim is, at best, exaggerated, and the second is murky on the details.
