The highest 0.1%, which will pay me #Ultra MillireTax, owns the same wealth as 90% of America. What is \"fucking\" is the billions who think they can buy the presidency to keep the system ready for themselves while the opportunity is wasted on everyone. The first 0.1%, who will pay me #UltraMillireTax, have the same wealth as 90% of America. It's time for change. https://t.co/D04G5fNvpa-Elizabeth Warren (@earen) 29 January 2019 is the highest 0.1% below 200,000 families. Less than 90%? About 110 million families. Warren taxes 2 percent on each dollar of net value more than $50 million and 3 percent on each dollar of net value more than $1 billion. Do people like Jeff Peso in the Amazon ($160 billion), Bill Gates ($97 billion) and the rest of the bulls have a big piece of pie, as Warren said? They certainly have a highly disproportionate share, but the estimates differ in terms of the amount of this share. Warren &apos; s wealth of data is often confused with income, and while the two often go hand in hand, they are different. Income is the amount of money a person earns from a job or investment. Fortune is the value of everything a person has after taking credit for religion. For example, the capital at home, retirement savings, and bank accounts are part of a person's wealth. There are several ways to measure wealth in America, none of which is ideal. Warren's number comes from an analysis by economists Emmanuel Sayes at Stanford University and Gabriel Zukman at the University of California-Berkeley. Cys and Zukman sent Warren a message with their estimates of the amount of revenue that their tax plan would increase. They wrote that the greater 1.0 percent have about 20 percent of the nation's wealth. The lower 90% owns about 25%. Mortgage, credit card, and student debt, as they said, took a bite of the net worth of most American families. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, this supports Warren's statement that people at the top have \"about the same\" 90% below. But another credible study found a somewhat smaller share of the wealth that the very rich have. The last group of economists from the Federal Reserve and the University of Pennsylvania found that the highest 0.1 per cent in 2013 had about 15 per cent of the wealth. This is about five percentage points lower than Warren indicated. When we compared the data from both studies (we had complete data tables from each), Syz Zukman's estimates tend to show the rich who have a little more and the rest of the population have a little less than the Fed. The findings of the 2013 Federal Reserve Group included the adjustment of standard survey data normally provided by the Central Bank. (There are more recent data for 2016, but they are unmodified and do not speak of a wealth higher than 0.1 per cent.) One of the reasons for the differences in the two studies is their use of different methods. The Federal Reserve Group began a survey on consumer financing in the Federal Reserve and then added survey errors to the data. Cys and Zukman worked with tax data. Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses. But while the estimates differ, there is no disagreement about the broader trend. \"In all the estimates discussed here, the highest wealth in the United States has contributed very high and increasing over time,\" wrote the Federal Reserve Group - University of Pennsylvania in its 2016 article. All results should be read carefully because changes that seem small will change percentages slightly. For example, when Saize and Zukman look at individuals, rather than families or tax units, their numbers are closer to the Fed results. Our ruling Warren said that the highest 0.1 per cent of people own almost the same 90 per cent of the bottom. It relied on a message from two economists who generally spoke of the highest 0.1 per cent holding 20 per cent of the wealth, while at the bottom 90 per cent had about 25 per cent. On this basis, the two figures are almost identical. But another study found that the greater 0.1 percent had about 15 percent of all family wealth, while the lower 90 percent had 29 percent. This remains a great wealth in the hands of a small part of families, but it is difficult to say that the amounts retained by the two groups are almost the same. We're mostly assessing this statement right. 2019-01-31 20:12:58 UTC Politic Fact 5 1 7 PoliticFact Dating: Elizabeth Warren, member of the Democratic Senate of Massachusetts, https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1090252713156403200 in Tweedda.
