Ted Cruz in November 2018, replied during the program\u2019s March 16, 2018, episode: \"I don\u2019t take a dime of PAC money--no corporations, no special interests.\"\nMAHER: \"First of all, for those, anybody who\u2019s watching that might not be a political junkie, what is PAC money? What does that mean?\"\nO\u2019ROURKE: \"So, political action committees represent the corporations and interests that have business before Congress \u2014 so the pharmaceutical industries, the telecom industries, the energy industries, the insurance industries \u2014 and they give money to members of Congress not just for access, although that\u2019s part of it.\n\"They\u2019re also buying outcomes, actual legislative language that appears in the bills, and in the bills that become laws,\" O\u2019Rourke said. \"When you wonder why Congress is so dysfunctional, why it doesn\u2019t represent the interests of the people it purports to serve, it\u2019s because it\u2019s so tied to the sources of money that are coming in.\"\nO\u2019Rourke, initially elected to the House in 2012, accepted PAC donations through his 2014 re-election. In 2017, we rated Half True an O\u2019Rourke claim that he was one of two members of Congress taking no corporate cash or political action committee money. (There were five, and no member of Congress can legally take corporate cash.) O\u2019Rourke had received about $297,000 in PAC donations in his House bids of 2012 and 2014 but hadn\u2019t accepted PAC aid from 2015 into 2017.\nO\u2019Rourke, who announced his Senate candidacy in March 2017, has since out-raised Cruz in all but one quarter.\nO'Rourke campaign's finance reports\nSo, has O\u2019Rourke also not taken PAC money?\nChris Evans of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign replied to our inquiry about this claim by noting in an email that for the second quarter of 2018, O\u2019Rourke reported raising more than $10.4 million from individuals and absent PAC donations. Evans said all of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 2017-18 filings with the Federal Election Commission would show a similar pattern--all contributions from individuals, none from PACs.\nOn the FEC\u2019s website, we checked O\u2019Rourke\u2019s seven campaign finance reports covering 2017 through June 2018. In the period, the reports state, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign reported raising more than $23.5 million entirely from individuals. Each report shows a zero for contributions from PACs.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCruz\u2019s Senate campaign reported raising more than $14 million in the same period--counting a little over $1 million from PACs, according to its finance report filed in July 2018.\nA PAC\u2019s bundling\nMonths after O\u2019Rourke made his claim to Maher, Cruz\u2019s campaign suggested that O\u2019Rourke had benefited from a PAC\u2019s--running afould of his no-PACs self-description. In July 2018, as noted in a Dallas Morning News account, Cruz said O\u2019Rourke had accepted $167,408 in contributions collected, or bundled, from individuals by the J Street PAC, which says it endorses candidates based on goals including a focus on American diplomacy \"toward a two-state outcome between Israel and the Palestinians.\"\nTo our inquiry, Evans defended the PAC-bundled donations, saying by email: \"Each contribution was made by an individual following individual contribution limits and the reporting requirements mandated for individuals such as name, address, employer.\"\nWe separately heard back from the Center for Responsive Politics, which has long tracked the influence of money in politics.\nAndrew Mayersohn told us by email that the center doesn\u2019t consider PAC earmarking/bundling of donations by individuals to be the same as a PAC contribution. Mayersohn also pointed us to an Aug. 6, 2018, Associated Press fact-check confirming that $170,000 in donations by individuals were routed to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign through the J Street PAC, \"which also hosted an event to collect individual donations to put directly toward his campaign.\"\nThat story quotes an unidentified FEC spokeswoman saying the commission doesn\u2019t consider individuals\u2019 donations delivered through \"conduit\" PACs to be PAC money. The AP story went on: \"Neither do campaign finance experts, who say the donations are more transparent than PAC donations. \u2018No, it's not a PAC donation,\u2019 said Victoria Farrar-Myers, an expert on campaign finance at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.\" Noted too: \u00a0By law, individual donations are capped at $2,700 per election while PACs may donate up to $5,000.\nOur ruling\nO\u2019Rourke told Maher: \"I don\u2019t take a dime of PAC money.\"\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign finance reports from the launch of his candidacy in 2017 through June 2018 show no PAC contributions. O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t object to a PAC focused on Israel bundling donations for his campaign, but all of those were made by individuals.\nWe rate this claim True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.
