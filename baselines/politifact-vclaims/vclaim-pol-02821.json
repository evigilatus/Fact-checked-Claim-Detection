Schumer says President Donald Trump\u2019s tax plan would raise the federal income tax rate for the country\u2019s lowest earners while lowering it for the wealthy.\nDemocrats oppose the plan, saying it benefits the rich over the poor.\n\"It\u2019s completely focused on the wealthy and the powerful - not the middle class,\" Schumer said on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation.\nThe plan\u2019s framework is big on policy but scarce on details. So is Schumer right? Given the proposed changes to tax rates, brackets,\u00a0deductions and tax credits, does the Trump plan focus only on the nation's wealthiest taxpayers?\nThe tax rates\nTrump\u2019s tax plan would increase the lowest federal tax rate, but it also would increase the number of people who don\u2019t have to pay federal income tax.\nThe lowest earners currently have a federal income tax rate of 10 percent. Those are single filers who earn up to $9,325 and married couples who earn up to $18,650 in 2017.\nTrump\u2019s tax plan would increase the lowest rate from 10 percent to 12 percent. The White House hasn\u2019t said what income level would top out that bracket.\nPeople in the highest tax bracket would pay a lower rate. Single filers who make more than $418,400 and married filers who make more than $470,700 are currently taxed at 39.6\u00a0percent. That rate would decrease to 35 percent in Trump\u2019s tax plan.\nTrump leaves open the possibility of adding a fourth tax bracket for the highest earners. Adding another bracket means the new tax code \"does not shift the tax burden from high income to lower and middle income taxpayers,\" according to the plan. Details on what that bracket would look like were not in the plan.\nRELATED:\u00a0Are Republicans paying for tax cuts with reductions in Medicare, Medicaid?\nThe deductions\nMore people in the lowest tax bracket would not have to pay federal income tax under Trump\u2019s plan.\nMost low-income filers already pay no federal income tax because their deductions are more than their reported income. Filers who make less than their total deductions do not pay federal income tax.\nTwo major deductions benefit low-income filers the most: the standard deduction and personal exemptions.\nThe current standard deduction is $6,350 for single filers and $12,700 for married filers. Filers can itemize their deductions rather than taking the standard deduction.\nPersonal exemptions allow filers to deduct $4,050 for each taxpayer and dependent they claim, including themselves.\nThe two combined equal a deduction of $10,400 for a single filer without children in 2017. The amounts change each year.\nTrump\u2019s plan would eliminate personal exemptions but double the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married filers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means any filer who earns less than those amounts would pay no federal income tax.\nLooked at in a different way, a single filer currently in the gap between $10,400 and $12,000 would no longer pay federal income tax.\n\"The framework is basically taking the current 10 percent tax rate and increasing it to 12 but at the same time it\u2019s effectively increasing the size of the zero tax bracket, at least initially,\" said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax policy think tank.\nTrump\u2019s plan would replace personal exemptions with a higher Child Tax Credit, which currently allows a $1,000 credit for each child claimed.\nA tax credit is different from a deduction. A credit is a dollar amount put toward a filer\u2019s total return while a deduction reduces the amount of a filer\u2019s taxable income. The Internal Revenue Service says a tax credit is always worth more than a deduction of the same amount.\nThe new plan does not specify how much the credit would increase.\nWho gets the best deal?\nMany of the tax changes would benefit high-income earners more than others, a report from the Tax Policy Center said.\nSome of the proposals, like ending the alternative minimum tax and estate tax, would benefit high-income earners disproportionately.\nAbout 80 percent of the total tax benefit would go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers by 2027, the report said. Their after-tax income would increase 8.7 percent.\nTaxpayers who make less than about $150,000 each year would see an average tax cut of half a percent or less by 2027 under the plan. Taxpayers who make between $150,000 and $300,000 would actually pay about $800 more on average in taxes.\nTaxes would increase for about a quarter of all taxpayers by 2027. The report estimates about a third of people making between $50,000 and $150,000 and close to two-thirds of people making between $150,000 and $300,000 would see a tax increase.\nThe report partly attributes those increases to Trump\u2019s plan to replace personal exemptions with a higher Child Tax Credit. Trading the deduction for a credit could leave larger low and middle income families worse off than the current tax code. That will depend on how much the Child Tax Credit increases under the Trump plan.\nFilers also would no longer be able to deduct state and local taxes from their federal taxes under the plan. That means residents in high tax states like New York could end up paying more in federal taxes.\nA report from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s office estimates 3.3 million residents in New York would on average pay $5,300 more in federal income taxes if they were not able to deduct state and local taxes.\nMore than three million of those residents make below $300,000, according to the report. About 1.8 million make less than $100,000.\nOur ruling\nSchumer said Trump\u2019s tax plan is \"completely focused on the wealthy and the powerful - not the middle class.\"\nGranted, there are lots of details missing from Trump's tax plan. But the plan presented so far\u00a0does deal\u00a0with taxpayers who are not wealthy. So in a strict reading of his claim, Schumer is saying the Trump plan has no changes, positive or negative, for low- or middle-income taxpayers. That isn't the case.\nIt's possible that by \"completely focused\" Schumer meant the Trump plan benefits only the wealthy and the powerful. But\u00a0that also isn't\u00a0completely true. While many of the plan\u2019s proposals would benefit the wealthy, doubling the standard deduction would mean more of the country\u2019s lowest earners would pay no federal income tax and taxpayers earning less than about $150,000 would see a tax cut.\nWe rate Schumer's statement False.\n Share the Facts 2017-10-10 14:11:11 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Trump\u2019s tax plan is \"completely focused on the wealthy and the powerful - not the middle class.\"    Chuck Schumer U.S. Senator https://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-october-1-2017-transcript-ryan-rubio-schumer-schieffer/    Sunday, October 1, 2017 2017-10-01    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02821"}
