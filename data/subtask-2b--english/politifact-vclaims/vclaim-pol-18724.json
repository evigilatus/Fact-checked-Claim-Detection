He talked about the importance of pre-kindergarten education and successfully completing 12 years of school after that. Then he pivoted to housing and affordability, and compared white homebuyers to Black homebuyers. If a house was built in a white neighborhood and then the same exact house was built in a Black neighborhood, the home in the Black neighborhood would be valued at 29% less than the home in the white neighborhood.\u00a0\n\"We\u2019ve got to end this,\" Biden said.\u00a0\nHe then talked about his own family history, saying that after his father lost his job he couldn\u2019t afford to buy a home for years, but that once he did, the Biden family was able to start accumulating wealth. In the meantime, though, \"we lived in an apartment,\" Biden said, \"which became Section 8 housing much later.\"\nBiden then says, \"It wasn\u2019t \u2014\u00a0it was just normal apartments.\"\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t claim to live in Section 8 housing, a program that was authorized by Congress in 1974 to provide rental subsidies for eligible Americans. Biden would have been about 32 in 1974.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18724"}
