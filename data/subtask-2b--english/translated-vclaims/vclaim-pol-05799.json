In the Presidential-Republican debate on 28 October, hosted by the Committee in Boulder, Colo, the moderator asked Karl Quintanella Carson about his involvement with the company. \"This is a company called Manatek, the food supplements maker, which you had a ten-year relationship with,\" said Quintanella. \"They have made allegations that they can treat autism, cancer. They paid $7 million to settle a fraudulent marketing case in Texas, yet you continued to participate. Why? \"Well, it's easy to answer this question: I wasn't involved with them,\" said Carson, a former child neurosurgeon. \"This is full publicity. And this is what happens in our society -- full publicity. I've made two speeches for them. I've written to other people. He paid them a speech. It's ridiculous to say that I have any kind of relationship with them. Should I take the product? Yeah. I think it's a good product.\" Manatek sells food supplements made from the larch and aloe tree bark, which have disputed health benefits. In 2009, the company settled the lawsuit, which resulted from allegations that the company was fraudulently offering treatments and treatments for diseases such as cancer and even Down Syndrome. For Carson to say \"He had nothing to do with\" Manatek is an extension. While not as many employees as we can say, it is difficult to see the speeches he made, as well as other promotional work, as anything but full support for the product. Moreover, Manatek seems to view Carson as a product promoter. First, speeches. Carson delivered four to Manatek according to the Wall Street Journal. Carson wrote these paid notes as many of the various letters he booked in Washington by the Speaker's Office. But in the speeches, he talks about his personal fondness for the product, which he started taking together with cancer therapy years ago. For example, Carson made observations to Manatek sales partners in 2004. In the speech, he spoke about his introduction to Manatek's supplements and his personal conversation with the company's lead doctor. \"I started taking the product, and within three weeks, my symptoms went away,\" plus he played with the idea of using only supplements, instead of performing cancer surgery. In the remarks, he said that it was inappropriate to be a spokesperson or sales partner, but he referred people to Manatek. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, he has since appeared in the videos produced by Manatek, which seem to be promotional material. In 2011, he answered questions in an interview with the co-Executive Director of Mancek and the Chief Science Officer. In the 2013 Manatek video, Carson described his experience with supplements. \"The wonderful thing about a company like Manatek is that they realize that when we created God, he gave us the right fuel. And that fuel was the right kind of healthy food,\" Carson said in the 2013 video. \"In essence, what the company is doing is trying to find a way to restore the natural diet as a medicine or as a mechanism for maintaining health.\" Carson also reported on his use of food supplements on the PBS device in 2014, and promoted Manatek to meet on its home page. While Manatek &apos; s website was no longer accessible, it was marked specifically for all articles on Carson. The Carson campaign requested that Manatek remove some of the videos and articles showing Carson from its website. Since media outlets are beginning to look at this question, Manatek has dropped more, according to journalists in the Wall Street Journal. The Governor Carson said, \"I had nothing to do with\" Manatuck Food Supplements. As far as we know, Carson wasn't a paid employee or official certification of the product. Anyway, his claim suggests that he has no ties to Manatech any. In fact, he was paid to give speeches to Manatek and appeared in promotional videos, and he consistently gave glowing reviews of food supplements. As a world-renowned surgeon, Carson &apos; s opinion on health issues bears great weight, and Manatek used Carson &apos; s support to his advantage. We're assessing Carson's claim that he's wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05799"}
