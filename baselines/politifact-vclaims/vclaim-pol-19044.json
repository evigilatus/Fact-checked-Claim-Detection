Here\u2019s what the data looks like, with Obama\u2019s tenure in blue and Trump\u2019s in red.\n\n\u00a0\nThis shows that Trump is wrong to say that 700,000 manufacturing jobs were created on his watch. The actual rise prior to the coronavirus pandemic was about 450,000 manufacturing jobs. (If you do account for the recession prompted by the pandemic, which is not advisable since the economy is so volatile at the moment, manufacturing employment has declined by 237,000.)\nThe situation under Obama is trickier to parse.\nDuring Obama\u2019s entire tenure in the White House, manufacturing employment fell by 192,000. Keep in mind, though, that Obama inherited the Great Recession. A fair comparison between Trump and Biden excludes both recessions.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the low point of the recession in 2010, the manufacturing sector added 916,000 jobs on Obama\u2019s watch. That was roughly seven years, about twice the amount Trump\u2019s been in office, so on an annual basis, the manufacturing employment gains per year were roughly similar between the two presidents. In fact, you can see in the chart that the pace of increase was fairly constant for Obama\u2019s final seven years and Trump\u2019s first three years.\nIn awarding Trump a Promise Broken for his pledge to bring back manufacturing, we also noted that another metric, gross manufacturing output by quarter, found nothing special on Trump\u2019s watch. Manufacturing output rose during the first year and a half of Trump's presidency, but at a rate not much faster than during most of Obama's presidency. And after that, output stagnated or even declined slightly.\n\"There was nothing special or extraordinary about Trump's two years of manufacturing job growth, other than to say he benefited from synchronized global growth, which is very rare, and juice from the corporate tax cut, which probably shifted investment and hiring forward a bit,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, told us in June.\nFinally, presidents can have an impact on economic conditions, but they are not the only factor. Among the things out of their control are external economic shocks such as oil price fluctuations, changes in technology, and the state of the global economy.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that in the manufacturing sector, \"I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing.\"\nTrump is wrong about the job gains on his watch; the actual increase is about 450,000 prior to the pandemic.\nAs for the record under Obama and Biden, Trump wants to have his cake and eat it, too. If he\u2019s going to ignore the coronavirus pandemic, then it\u2019s fairest to ignore the Great Recession in comparing himself with Obama. And during the post-recession recovery, Obama oversaw gains of 916,000 manufacturing jobs.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19044"}
