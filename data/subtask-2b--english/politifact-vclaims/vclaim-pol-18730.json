The exchange, which took place in a noisy site crowded with workers, turned contentious as the worker repeatedly challenged Biden\u2019s responses, with Biden shouting at times and other workers and aides trying to cut off the exchange.\u00a0\nAt one point, according to media reports, the worker said to Biden, \"You\u2019re working for me, man.\" Biden\u2019s reply was not uniformly reported by the media, and video footage of the incident does not clearly capture all of the dialogue.\u00a0\nWATCH: \"You\u2019re full of sh*t,\" @JoeBiden tells a man who accused him of \"actively trying to end our Second Amendment right.\"\"I support the Second Amendment,\" Biden adds while vising under-construction auto plant in Detroit. @CBSNews pic.twitter.com/sueOSBaY9P\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Bo Erickson CBS (@BoKnowsNews) March 10, 2020 \n\u00a0\nSome outlets, including CBS News and The Detroit News, reported that Biden responded, \"I\u2019m not working for you. Don\u2019t be such a horse\u2019s a--.\" Other outlets, including Politico and CNN, reported it slightly differently, quoting Biden as saying, \"I\u2019m not working for \u2014 gimme a break, man. Don\u2019t be such a horse\u2019s a--.\"\u00a0\nCNN\u2019s report was presented more like a transcript of the exchange, while other media accounts appeared to paraphrase it or edit it down. For example, Biden clearly says \"give me a break\" at the 1-minute mark in the video before saying \"don\u2019t be such a horse\u2019s a--.\" Neither the CBS nor Detroit News article included that phrase.\u00a0\nThe Facebook post includes a photo of Biden pointing his finger at the worker. While video footage shows Biden was pointing at the worker through much of the exchange, at times directly at his face, he wasn\u2019t doing so when he said the words \"I\u2019m not working for \u2014.\"\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post suggests Biden told a factory worker, \"I don\u2019t work for you!\" while pointing a finger at the worker\u2019s face.\u00a0\nBiden and the worker got into a confrontation over Biden\u2019s proposed gun control policies; the worker falsely accused Biden of wanting to take away people\u2019s guns. While news accounts differ on what words Biden said, the quotes are similar to the phrase attributed to Biden in the Facebook post. Biden was not pointing at the worker during that part of the exchange.\nThe claim is partly true, but leaves out important details and context.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18730"}
