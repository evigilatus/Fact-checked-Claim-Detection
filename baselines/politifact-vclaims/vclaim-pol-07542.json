John Kitzhaber\u2019s first debate with Republican challenger state Rep. Dennis Richardson covered a lot of ground, with both candidates spending considerable time on economic issues.\nTheir exchanges made clear that the economy will continue to be a pivotal issue as the campaign heads toward the November election.\nThe claim:\nKitzhaber, a Democrat seeking a historic fourth term in office, touted his job-creation work and said his policies have helped stabilize the state\u2019s budget. Looking ahead, he said, the state has untapped gold in the form of international trade possibilities.\nThen Kitzhaber added this: \"We are the most trade-dependent state in the nation.\"\nPolitiFact Oregon decided to check.\nThe analysis:\nWe called Christian Gaston, a policy adviser for the governor\u2019s campaign. He was sitting in the front row at the debate and said the claim caught his ear as well. In a subsequent email, Gaston said, \"The governor misspoke. He meant to say that Oregon is one of the most trade-dependent states in the nation.\"\nThe latter claim is one Kitzhaber has made before, Gaston said. His email included a YouTube link to an interview in December 2013 in which the governor does say \"is one of\" the most trade-dependent states.\nFor context, we looked at where Oregon ranks.\n\"Determining trade dependence is extremely difficult,\" said Robert Whelan, an economist with ECONorthwest, a Portland-based company that provides economic analyses and professional consulting services to public and private entities. \"It\u2019s one area that cannot be absolutely checked.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, Whelan said, Oregon exports about $1.6 billion worth of chemicals a year, much of that in soda ash and potash.\n\"Most people would see that figure and say, \u2018Wow,\u2019\" Whelan said, \"\u2018where\u2019s the chemical factory?\u2019 Well, there isn\u2019t any. It\u2019s mined elsewhere, brought in by rail and shipped. But it shows up as an export.\"\nAll of the products made at a Boeing plant near Gresham, on the other hand, are hauled to Seattle, where they are finished and shipped. Those are counted as Washington exports, not Oregon.\nStill, Whelan said, \"there\u2019s no way to say we are the most trade-dependent, but we are certainly one of them.\"\nThe value of exports from Oregon to foreign countries this year will be about $19 billion, a figure that ranks 23rd among the 50 states, according to International Trade Association statistics.\nA trade study released in 2010 by the Portland Business Alliance ranked Oregon seventh nationally in the share exports hold -- 12 percent -- of the state\u2019s economy. A more recent study prepared for the same group indicates that nearly 80,000 jobs in Oregon are directly tied to exporting goods and services, with one in four manufacturing jobs in the state being export-related.\nThose same numbers are far larger in states that dwarf Oregon in terms of population. But according to the Portland Business Alliance\u2019s study, Oregon exports ranked seventh on a per capita basis in 2013.\nThe ruling:\nGov. John Kitzhaber, in a debate with Republican challenger Dennis Richardson, claimed that Oregon is \"the most trade-dependent state in the nation.\"\nA spokesman said Kitzhaber has previously said that Oregon \"is one of\" the most trade-dependent states in the U.S. If he had said that, we would have reached a different ruling.\nAs it is, we find Kitzhaber\u2019s claim False.\nThoughts on this ruling?
