Another disturbing theory now appeared on Facebook: children's bones were found on Epstein's private island. The island, the small St. James, is part of the United States Virgin Islands and has reportedly been named \"Children's Island\" and \"Orgie's Island\" by the local population. This article, which has received over 4,500 shares since August 22, says: \"The children's bones were found on Epstein Island. My question? Why isn't this in the headlines of every major network?\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

The title of that article? \"FBI Divers recovers human bones in the water off Epstein's island of Urgia with 'State Deb' accelerating Miltdown.\" It is well known that the Sorsha Fall website disseminates misleading information by including existing parts of legitimate news in their stories (in this case by writing that Epstein owned an island and that the FBI raided the building) and then uses this as a basis for building gruesome fictions, claiming that he was the first to break the story without reliable sources. A group of FBI investigators raided Epstein Island on August 12, but there were no reports of human bones anywhere, including under the \"Epstein Demon Temple,\" as the article claims. News organizations around the world have submitted very extensive and detailed reports on the Epstein case, and therefore the fact that no reliable media outlets have disclosed any of this information indicates that it is fabricated.
