But even in 2015, it lives on.\nThis myth has been debunked over and over and over again. We\u2019ve been fact-checking claims about this since 2007, the year PolitiFact went live. Yet it resurfaced Sept. 17, 2015 in Rochester, N.H., at a town hall event for Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump.\nAn unidentified audience member asked the first question: What would President Trump would do about Muslims in the United States? Here\u2019s the exchange.\nAudience member: \"We have a problem in this country. It's called Muslims. You know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American.\"\nTrump: \"We need this question. This is the first question.\"\nAudience member: \"Anyway, we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question: When can we get rid of them?\"\nTrump: \"We're going to be looking at a lot of different things. You know, a lot of people are saying that and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening. We're going to be looking at that and plenty of other things.\"\nTrump was immediately criticized for not countering\u00a0the man\u2019s comments -- both the assertion that Muslims are a \"problem\" and that Obama is one.\nA recent CNN poll found that 29 percent of Americans and 43 percent of Republicans think Obama is Muslim. Let\u2019s revisit why we know this is not true. (He\u2019s actually Protestant.)\nMuslim?\nIn 2010, we rated the statement \"President Obama is a Muslim\" Pants on Fire. Our fact-checking has shown that Obama is a Christian.\nAccording to the president's memoirs and independent biographies, Obama became a Christian when he was in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago. (He was not raised in any particular faith as a child.) Obama said the churches there impressed him with their commitment to social justice and the hope they gave to the poor. Several independent reports have documented Obama's church membership and faith life.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn office, Obama has not attended one church regularly. Instead, he has worshipped at various churches in the Washington area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church. He also has attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat.\nPolitiFact has debunked claims in chain e-mails that he attended a radical Islamic school, that his political rise mirrored a biblical tale about the Antichrist, and that he took the oath for U.S. Senate on a Koran. All three earned our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.\nWhy do so many people keep saying he's Muslim? One explanation is that there is genuine confusion about his religion because Obama has Muslim ancestors on his father's side and a traditionally Muslim middle name, Hussein. Another possible explanation\u00a0is that people who disagree with him politically and dislike the Muslim religion like to associate him with something they perceive to be negative.\nBorn in Kenya?\nThe audience member also said Obama isn\u2019t an American. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, back in 2011 and 2012, Trump argued that Obama wasn\u2019t really eligible to be president because he was born in Kenya, not the United States.\nThis is also not true -- Obama was born in Honolulu. PolitiFact went to great lengths to document Obama\u2019s Hawaii birth certificate. See our guide to Obama\u2019s birth certificate.\nAs part of his \"birther\" crusade, Trump said in 2011, Obama's \"grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth.\"\nThe claim is based on an Oct. 16, 2008, telephone call between Bishop Ron McRae of the Anabaptist Churches of North America and Sarah Obama of Kenya, Barack Obama's elderly step-grandmother. In the call, we hear a very rough Swahili-to-English translation in which an elderly woman agreed to a leading question that Obama was born in Kenya and that she was present. But the grandmother and translator immediately, clearly and repeatedly corrected the answer to say that Obama was born in the United States, and she was not present. We rated Trump\u2019s claim False.\nJust this year, an image circulating on Facebook accused Obama of reaching back to his Kenyan roots for inspiration in choosing to drop President William McKinley as the namesake of America\u2019s tallest mountain. The image said, \"\u2018Denali\u2019 is the Kenyan word for \u2018black power.\u2019\" In reality, Denali means \"high\" or \"tall\" in a native Alaskan language and has been used by native Alaskans as a name for the mountain for generations. Pants on Fire!\nOur ruling\nAn audience member at a Trump campaign event said, \"You know our current president is (Muslim). You know he's not even an American.\"\nPolitiFact and others have repeatedly debunked both of these claims -- that Obama is Muslim and that he wasn\u2019t born in America. Against all odds, they live on.\nObama is Christian and was born in Honolulu, Hawaii.\nWe rate the audience member\u2019s claim Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05956"}
