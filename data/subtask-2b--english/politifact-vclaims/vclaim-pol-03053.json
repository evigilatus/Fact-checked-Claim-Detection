It\u2019s home to more than 4.5 million people in sprawling San Bernardino and Riverside counties east of Los Angeles.\nLt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democratic candidate for governor, recently claimed this region of high desert and valley communities is among the leaders in California job growth.\nThe Inland Empire is \"the second fastest growing region\" in California, Newsom said in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on July 12, 2017. \u00a0\"It\u2019s about logistics, warehousing, transportation.\"\n\nNewsom makes his claim at about the 2:00 minute mark above.\u00a0\nWe took Newsom\u2019s statement to mean the Inland Empire has the state\u2019s second fastest job growth rate because the lieutenant governor went on to talk about statewide job growth immediately after making this claim.\nNewsom\u2019s comments follow Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s recent claim on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that California\u2019s Central Valley and Inland Empire \"are experiencing tremendous job growth.\" We examined that claim and rated it Mostly True.\nStill, we wondered whether Newsom was right.\nWe set out on a fact check.\nOur research\nAsked for evidence to support the claim, Newsom\u2019s spokesman cited research from John Husing, chief economist with the Inland\u2009Empire Economic\u2009Partnership. The industry group advocates for jobs creation in the region.\nThe spokesman specifically pointed to a section of Husing\u2019s April 2017 report that found the Inland Empire\u2019s \"3.47% growth rate in 2016 was second to San Francisco (4.16%).\"\nThe report went on to say the region added the second most total jobs of any in the state, 47,500, behind Los Angeles\u2019 109,000 and ahead of San Francisco\u2019s 43,800.\nThese figures back up Newsom\u2019s claim.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis statement also holds when looking at job growth rates over the past five years. In April 2017, Jeffrey Michael, director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, compiled data showing job growth rates by metro area. The Inland Empire had the fastest job growth rate over the past year at that time, 3.2 percent, and the second fastest rate, 22.3 percent, over the past five years.\nThe economists analyzed data from the California Employment Development Department.\n\nTypes of jobs\nNewsom\u2019s claim about the rapid pace of job growth appears on the money. But what about the type of jobs he described: \"logistics, warehousing, transportation\" ?\nHusing told us this description was also on the right track. With the explosion of e-commerce, developers have seized on the Inland Empire\u2019s vast and affordable stretches of land to build warehouses for products shipped through ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach.\nMore than 60,600 distribution and transportation jobs have been added in the Inland Empire since its rebound from the Great Recession in 2010, Husing said. In addition, nearly 46,000 construction jobs; about 25,000 healthcare jobs and 15,000 manufacturing positions have been created.\nLogistics, transportation and construction \"are overwhelmingly the sectors that are driving the growth,\" the economist said.\nHusing described most of these positions as \"blue collar jobs.\" In April, Husing described in more depth the Inland Empire\u2019s wage picture. He said it had a lower share of high-paying administrative jobs compared with the state as a whole. But, he said, the region was outperforming the state in its share of middle-class jobs that pay between $45,000 and $60,000.\nOur ruling\nLt. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently claimed the Inland Empire is \"the second fastest growing region\" in California.\nWe took Newsom\u2019s claim to mean it has the second fastest job growth rate.\nData compiled by two leading economists back up Newsom\u2019s assertion. It shows the Inland Empire\u2019s nearly 3.5 percent jobs growth rate in 2016 was second only to San Francisco\u2019s 4.16 percent. Figures over the past five years show the Inland Empire grew jobs at 22.3 percent, again second only to the San Francisco market. \u00a0\nThe lieutenant governor was also correct to describe these Inland Empire jobs as based in the transportation and distribution sectors, based on data from the economists.\nWe rate Newsom\u2019s claim True.\n\nTRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2017-07-28 00:00:02 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  The Inland Empire is \"the second fastest growing region\" for jobs in California.
