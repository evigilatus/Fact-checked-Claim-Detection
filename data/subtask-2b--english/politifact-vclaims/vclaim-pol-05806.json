They were highlighted in memorable TV ads created by the late Steve Eichenbaum.\nAmong the promises: Feingold said he would \"rely on Wisconsin citizens for most of my contributions.\"\nThat grassroots approach helped him win the Senate seat three times. But in 2010, Feingold was ousted by Republican businessman Ron Johnson, who spent millions of his own money on the race.\nIn May 2015, Feingold announced that he would challenge Johnson in 2016. Six weeks later, Feingold filed his first campaign finance report with the Federal Election Commission. It showed he had already raised about $2.3 million.\nThe National Journal reported Aug. 13, 2015 that it had examined Feingold\u2019s individual contributions and determined \u00a0the majority of the money had come from out of state.\nTimes change. And so do positions.\nCue the Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has changed position on an issue. Remember: It does not measure whether any change is good or bad policy or politics, only whether the candidate has been consistent.\nThe more-than-half-from-Wisconsin pledge is not a 1992 campaign relic. Feingold followed it in his re-election bids in 1998, 2004 and in 2010.\nThis time around it was clear early on that Feingold planned to run a different kind of campaign.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an Aug. 13, 2015 interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Feingold noted that the campaign finance rules were different now than when he first ran for federal office.\nThe McCain-Feingold campaign finance rules that he famously championed have been undone by the courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens\u2019 United decision, which unleashed virtually unlimited campaign contributions to outside groups. \u00a0\nFeingold said he will not operate in this campaign by the pledge he made in past races.\n\"It makes no sense now,\" he said.\nFeingold argues the pledge was made on an election-to-election basis.\n\"Every single election is different based on the reality of the campaign finance law at the time,\" he said. \"What I did in the past is to offer a pledge or a series of proposals for a six-year term.\"\nMaybe so, but that does not affect us here. We\u2019re rating the consistency of a position, not whether a promise had been broken.\nOur rating\nIn four Senate campaigns, Feingold abided by the pledge he inscribed on his garage door: He would raise the majority of his campaign cash from Wisconsin residents.\nFeingold said he was changing with the times, and is no longer bound by his previous pledge.\nThat\u2019s a complete reversal.
