And I would hope that in the midst of all of this discussion this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us.\"\nSanders has been making this claim for more than a year, including on Twitter in 2014, in a 2014 CNN interview and at a Minnesota campaign event last summer.\nBut is it true? Have 500,000 American veterans really returned home from recent conflicts with PTSD and brain injuries?\nSanders\u2019 claim is at the higher end of the range of estimates available.\nThe U.S Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that between 11 and 20 percent of veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) have PTSD in a given year. As of late 2014, about 2.7 million troops had served in Iraq or Afghanistan. That\u2019s a wide range: 11 percent of 2.7 million is 297,000; 20 percent is 540,000.\nAdditionally, a U.S. Senate resolution identifies \"more than 390,000\" cases of PTSD among veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn in Afghanistan, citing the secretary of Veterans Affairs as its source.\nThose figures only account for PTSD, not traumatic brain injury, or TBI, which Sanders also referenced.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2013 Congressional Research Service paper on traumatic brain injury found that almost 57,000 Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans were evaluated or treated for \"a condition possibly related to TBI\" by the VA.\nThat number is slippery though. It\u2019s not clear that all of those nearly 57,000 actually received a TBI diagnosis, and it doesn\u2019t account for the potentially thousands more veterans who experienced a traumatic brain injury but did not receive care through the VA.\nThe VA also estimates that brain injuries account for 22 percent of all combat casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe Defense Department, meanwhile, identifies 333,169 instances of traumatic brain injury among service members between 2000 and 2015. That\u2019s a big number, but there are some caveats that come with it: It includes all U.S. forces, not just those deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and is overwhelmingly comprised of concussions and \"mild TBI\" that by definition lasts less than 24 hours.\nAlso worth noting: that same U.S. Senate resolution noting 390,000 PTSD cases also references \"more than 615,000\" veterans of recent conflicts who have been diagnosed with \"at least 1 mental health disorder.\"\nOur ruling\nSanders said 500,000 U.S. troops came home from Iraq and Afghanistan \"with PTSD and traumatic brain injury.\"\nNo firm numbers exist for the number of veterans who have returned from America\u2019s most recent conflicts with post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries, but Sanders\u2019 claim of 500,000 does fall within the range of estimates provided by the VA and other sources.\nSanders\u2019 statement needs that caveat.
