This allegation was made during a campaign speech in Sacramento last week, a block away from the Capitol, California, where the former Goof. Jerry Brown signed a law last year to abolish cash bail and adopt a risk assessment system. Saunders introduced legislation in the U.S. Senate in 2018 to end monetary bail throughout the country. It is part of his criminal justice reform programme. However, the issue remains unstable, including in California. In January, the bail industry qualified for a State referendum in November 2020, giving voters an opinion on whether the bail should be abolished. Given the focus on this topic, we wanted to know whether Sanders' number was \"about 200,000\" accurate. In the past, Polyte Fact reported that there was no official national tracking of this figure, although researchers used data from the United States Office of Justice Statistics to check the number of persons who might be in prison because they could not pay bail. They refer to the Office &apos; s 2018 report, which uses the 2016 data. She states that there were 458,600 \"unconvicted\" persons detained in prisons throughout the country. However, some of them were detained without bail, while others await commitment to a mental health facility. For these reasons, Polyte Fact has classified half of a related claim by the Republic of California, Ted Leo, last year. I found that the Democratic Congressman overestimated the total when he said: \"Every day more than 450,000 Americans sit in prison not because they were convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail and do not have high-powered lawyers.\" Saunders' campaign says 200,000 numbers are a \"safe estimate\" based on the December 2018 report of the Hamilton Project, the arm of the Brookings Institution, a non-partisan research group. However, this report places the figure much higher. \"There are more than 400,000 people in prison who the judge would have allowed their release had they been able to pay bail,\" he says. Ryan Nan, one of the authors of the report, told us that the figure of 400,000 \"is definitely the estimate of the field.\" His report drew on 2009 data from the Office of Justice Statistics. Shima Paradaran Bohman is a law professor at Utah University, where she wrote widely about monetary bail. Devin Nunes reported on January 10, 2021 in an interview on \"The Republicans have no means of communication\" after the Barler tech companies were cut off. By Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021 \"Looks like a low rating,\" she said about Sanders' number. Darren Hutchinson, a professor of law at the University of Florida who also studied the subject, confirmed that all figures were estimates. \"I'm not aware of any national database that tracks a number of people in prison because they can't bail,\" said Hutchinson in the e-mail. \"Most recent studies on this issue continue to depend on expectations that compare the average income and assets available to individuals detained in prisons and an estimate of the average amount of bail.\" \"It is quite possible that the number of detainees who cannot pay bail exceeds the number mentioned by Sanders,\" added. Last year, Sanders quoted an article from The Guardian, which put the figure at 400,000 people, matching estimates in recent studies. The governor, Bernie Sanders, recently claimed that \"about 200,000 people are in prison for poverty and inability to pay bail.\" Experts say that there is no national database to track this figure, only estimates. The report mentioned by Sanders put the figure close to 400,000. However, the experts told us that the Sanders general point is true: many Americans are in prison for the sole reason that they cannot pay bail. In the end, we found that his claim was partially accurate but underestimated the total. We value it half right. The truth is now - the statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or leaves things out of context.
