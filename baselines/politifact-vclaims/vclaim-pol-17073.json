The first bump, it says, reflects when at-risk patients were tested for COVID-19 in hospitals. The second bump reflects when testing became more available to more people, according to the post.\u00a0\n\"We\u2019re looking at the downward trend of that second bump,\" the post says. \"Ask any biostatistician what it means when you test hundreds of thousands of people a day for an infectious disease and return a consistently lowering positivity rate. I\u2019ll give you a clue: it means heard immunity has been reached and the virus is dying out.\" (The misspelling of \"herd\" is in the original post.)\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll cut to the chase before drilling down into the details: No, we have not reached herd immunity, a subject we\u2019ve written about before.\u00a0\nScientists generally say herd immunity could play a role in curbing the spread of the coronavirus before a vaccine becomes available. The idea is that once a disease infects enough people in a community, if the infection confers immunity, then there are fewer people left who can still transmit the disease, so the spread slows. For the coronavirus, scientists estimate herd immunity will probably be reached when 60% to 70% of the population has been infected.\u00a0\nThe graph featured in the Facebook post shows daily changes in COVID-19 tests performed in the United States and test positivity rates over the months. It\u2019s available on Johns Hopkins University\u2019s website.\u00a0\nBut Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, said it \"cannot in any way be used to assess whether or not we\u2019ve achieved herd immunity.\" The Facebook post, she said, is a \"completely inappropriate interpretation of what it\u2019s showing.\"\u00a0\nRather, she said, test positivity is a measure specialists use to gauge whether a community is conducting enough testing. Because the rate of people testing positive for COVID-19 can change depending on the number of tests administered, it doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect how many people are becoming infected. Low positivity rates, for example, could result from simply testing a large number of uninfected people, she said. Plus, asymptomatic people who are infected and possibly spreading the disease may never get tested.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists use serological surveys of a representative sample of the population to estimate what fraction of a community has likely been infected with COVID-19, Nuzzo said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has done this, and according to its most recent findings, \"no one is near herd immunity, even in the hardest-hit places in the United States.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Other countries, including places like Sweden that have not implemented the same level of shutdowns like the United States \u2014 their surveys say the same thing: that the vast majority of us remain susceptible to this virus,\" she said.\u00a0\nWe contacted several other specialists for help parsing the claims in the Facebook post. We even asked a biostatistician, as the post suggested.\n\"This post is not accurate,\" said Natalie Dean, a biostatistics professor at the University of Florida.\u00a0\nBecause test positivity is low in some areas, like New York, and high in others, like Florida, it\u2019s \"not particularly meaningful to look at the entire United States as one unit,\" she said. \"While numbers in some of the hotspot states appear to be stabilizing, it is hard to know for sure, because testing capacity is strained and there are significant backlogs.\"\nThat makes daily positivity numbers less reliable. Still, she said, decreasing 911 calls for respiratory distress in some cities and indicate that the spread of COVID-19 is slowing down. That\u2019s likely due to policy and behavioral changes in different communities.\nBut broadly in the United States, COVID-19 is \"spreading like wildfire,\" said Andrew Noymer, a population health and disease prevention professor at the University of California-Irvine.\u00a0\nWhen testing increases, the percentage of positive tests can decrease simply because more people are being tested, he said. \"So percent positive testing going down doesn\u2019t mean anything.\"\nThe Facebook post, he said, \"is just a bunch of mumbo jumbo.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nJaquelin Dudley, a professor of molecular biosciences at the University of Texas at Austin, said it\u2019s possible there are areas where herd immunity has been established, \"but there are still many unknowns, including lack of testing for asymptomatic individuals or missing the right point during infection for testing.\"\nAt this point, though, we can\u2019t accurately predict a timeline for when there will be herd immunity throughout the United States, she said.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17073"}
