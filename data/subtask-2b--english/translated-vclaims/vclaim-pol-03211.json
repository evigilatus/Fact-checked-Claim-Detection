Most of the time, yeah.", "text": "The Iranian nuclear agreement was aimed at Karen Handel in two television debates held recently prior to the special elections in Georgia, accusing Iran of non-compliance with the agreement to reduce its nuclear programme in exchange for the easing of economic sanctions. \"From the things I saw, they and (had) already violated the terms of the deal,\" said Handel in a debate on June 8 against democracy, John Osov, before the vote on June 20. In the campaign for Georgia VI, an area historically affiliated with the Republican Congress, Handel was strongly critical of the agreement, which President Donald Trump mocked as \"the worst deal I negotiated\" during his period of operation in 2016. The declarations of the attack launched by the World Congress Party in May sought to paint Osov as a dangerous national security nephew, in part by highlighting its support for the Obama deal. The Agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan, was signed in 2015 by the United States and Iran, as well as by China, Russia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Under this deal, Iran agreed not to seek nuclear weapons and to allow continuous monitoring of their compliance. The United States and other countries agreed to lift the sanctions on condition that Iran committed itself to the end of the deal, for fear of reinstating the sanctions. The precise details of the agreement become very technical very quickly, with dozens of restrictions on Iran &apos; s nuclear-related activities. However, the main points relate to Iran &apos; s relinquishment of materials that could be used to accelerate the construction of a nuclear weapon. Iran has agreed to abandon almost all its stocks of enriched uranium (97 per cent) and 70 per cent of its centrifuges, which are used for uranium enrichment. It also agreed to halt plutonium production and dismantle its plutonium reactor. Because Iranian compliance is a crucial national security issue, we have decided to consider closely Handel &apos; s repeated allegations that the Islamic Republic has violated the terms of the agreement. The prevailing view among the main authorities is that Iran has complied with the Agreement. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations nuclear observer, has the primary responsibility for monitoring, and its quarterly reports are the official opinion of Iran &apos; s compliance. With some minor exceptions to be addressed later, the Agency has repeatedly found that Iran is in compliance with the terms of the agreement. The United States Department of State, which is required to report to Congress every 90 days on Iran &apos; s compliance, also confirmed in April that the Islamic Republic is at the end of the agreement. In addition, the experts we met agreed that Iran was complying with the Nuclear Charter. So the case is closed, right? Mostly, but with some simple qualifications. While the IAEA confirmed Iran &apos; s compliance in its quarterly reports, Iran &apos; s record is flawless. Handel's campaign has reached this. The Handel campaign assistant referred to news reports and congressional testimony that highlighted cases in which Iran had committed two minor crimes of a highly technical nature. The agreement states that Iran can retain 130 metric tons of \"heavy water,\" a modified liquid used in some nuclear reactors. However, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran has infiltrated twice over its limit each time with a fraction of one ton. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 February 3, 2012, these violations were the main basis for Handel's claim that Iran had violated the nuclear deal. Some of the experts with whom we spoke said that Iran had tried to create space for volatility by interpreting parts of the agreement in the interests of its own interests. However, the clear consensus is that the assertion that Iran has violated the agreement is exaggerated. Darryl Kimball, Executive Director of the Arms Control Association, underestimated the issue of heavy water as a \"simple breach,\" and noted that Iran currently does not have a heavy water reactor. In other words, from a practical point of view, the issue is of fundamental importance because excessive heavy water will not bring Iran closer to building a nuclear weapon. Several experts also noted that Iran had quickly corrected its breach in order to return to compliance. The Handel campaign referred to the testimony of Congress by David Albright, President of the Institute of Science and International Security, who warned legislators in February that Iran was exceeding the heavy water cover. But now it seems that Handel's own source has a richer view of Iran's compliance status. \"Iran appears to be complying more strictly with the restrictions imposed on Japan's controversial programme of work, such as heavy water cover,\" Albright wrote in an analysis on 5 June of Iran's latest IAEA report. It should also be noted that on 5 April Albright told legislators that he did not believe that Iran &apos; s excessive supply of heavy water justified the re-establishment of sanctions. Several experts said that any technical agreement must involve minor implementation issues. \"A complex technical operation like this will inevitably face a small hiccup,\" said Aryan M. Tabatabay, a visiting professor at the Georgetown University Foreign Service School. \"As Iran believes, there was a hiccup on the United States. The side.\" It was important to distinguish between short mistakes - such as Iran &apos; s temporary and somewhat excessive stock of heavy water - and gross violations. Tababe said: \"What is so important to see is whether the parties are resolving those issues in a timely manner and whether they are still somewhat deficient.\" \"To date, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the State (administration) and the European Union (EU) believe that this is the case.\" Richard Neff, Senior Researcher in Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, added that allegations of fraud were best limited to clear and consequential violations, if they occurred. \"I don't agree with Mrs. Handle's assertion,\" he said, \"and I think that's too much.\" The governor, Handel, said that Iran had violated the terms of the nuclear deal. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the first authority in this regard, has repeatedly considered Iran to be in compliance with the Nuclear Agreement. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also confirmed that the Islamic Republic is ending the transaction, and a large number of experts have confirmed these final results. However, IAEA reported two cases in which Iran had barely - in short - exceeded its supply of a nuclear reactor known as \"heavy water.\" However, the experts said that such a minor breach posed no practical risk of bringing Iran closer to the development of a nuclear weapon, and added that such irregularities should not be interpreted as meaning that Iran had not complied with the terms of the agreement. We're assessing Handel's statement that it's mostly wrong.
