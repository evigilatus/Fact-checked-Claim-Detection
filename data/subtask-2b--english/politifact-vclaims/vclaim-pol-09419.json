Randy Forbes, R-4th, has never been shy about seeking money for the Navy. He represents a district that\u2019s anchored in Hampton Roads, home to the world\u2019s largest naval base and two of the nation\u2019s busiest shipyards.\n\nIn an April 9 op-ed, Forbes and Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., called for more funding to replace the nation\u2019s aging fleet of attack submarines, or SSNs. The column appeared on AOL Defense, a website that describes itself as \"the idea hub of the U.S. defense world.\"\n\nForbes and Courtney wrote, \"The Navy has stated it requires 48 SSNs to execute current missions, but given the current rates of replacement, the SSN force is scheduled to drop below the stated minimum in less than a decade.\"\n\nThey wrote, \"All Americans should be gravely concerned\" by the loss of national security that will be caused by the diminution of the fleet. The attack subs, which cost about $2.6 billion apiece, are sent on a variety of missions, including intelligence, mine warfare, anti-submarine, anti-ship, small-scale special forces insertion and land target strikes.\n\nWe decided to check their claim that the number of attack submarines is scheduled to fall below the Navy\u2019s required level in less than a deacde. Forbes\u2019 office referred us to two studies published in March by the Congressional Research Service and documents from the Department of Defense in 2010 and 2012.\n\nThe Navy, since 2006, has said it needs 48 attack submarines to carry out its missions, according to a CRS report released March 27. So Forbes is right on that part of his claim.\n\nThe Navy now has 55 attack subs, but these nuclear-powered vessels have about a 30-year lifespan. In a nutshell, the SSNs are scheduled to be retired during the next 22 years at a faster pace than the nation will replace them. The Navy\u2019s long-range plan calls for scrapping about three submarines annually for a number of years and replacing them with one or two new subs.\n\nForbes based his column on Navy projections released last year. They showed that the number of attack subs would sink below the 48-ship standard in 2022 and not resurface to that level until 2035. Forbes\u2019 claim that the fleet would fall below the Navy\u2019s stated need \"in less than a decade\" was based on the best information available at the time his op-ed was published.\n\nThe Navy has since updated its 30-year projections to fit into the federal budget proposed by President Barack Obama on April 10. The Navy said its attack sub force wouldn\u2019t fall under the 48-ship threshold until 2025 and would stay below that level for 10 years. The Navy would hit bottom in 2029, with 42 SSNs.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForbes, who is chairman of the House Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, has scheduled hearings on the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding plan. He has urged Congress to ensure that at least two new attack subs are produced every year.\n\nThe decline in the SSN fleet, Forbes says, particularly threatens U.S. intelligence and security operations in East Asia and the Western Pacific, where China is becoming increasingly dominant.\n\nEric Wertheim, author of \"Combat Fleets of the World\" and an expert on global sea power, told us it\u2019s hard assess the degree of threat the reduction of the SSN fleet poses to U.S. security.\n\n\"What the Navy and military are trying to do is have a balanced force,\" he said. \"They plan to respond and be ready for any kind of operation, whether it\u2019s low-intensity, such as Libya, peacetime activities, like intelligence or a high-intensity operation, such as is possible with places like China.\"\n\nWertheim said it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the U.S. won\u2019t be able to carry out missions with a reduced attack sub fleet but, in military planners\u2019 minds, there are increased risks that it won\u2019t be able to respond to all threats.\n\n\"The question for them is what amount of risk are we willing to take,\" he said. \"We don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll need until the future comes.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nForbes wrote that the nation\u2019s fleet of attack submarines is scheduled, in less than a decade, to fall below the 48 boats the Navy says it needs to carry out current missions.\n\nThe congressman accurately cited the best information that was available when his column was published on April 9. Since then, the Navy has issued new projections that say the fleet won\u2019t fall below 48 SSNs until 2025.\n\nWe don\u2019t fault Forbes for not knowing information that wasn\u2019t available at the time.
