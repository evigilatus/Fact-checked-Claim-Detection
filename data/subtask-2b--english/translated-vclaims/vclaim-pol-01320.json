Scott Walker's claim about flat childhood health care.", "text": "In a final push before the elections of 6 November 2018, the democracy of Tony Evers imposed a new claim against the Republican Government. The Scott Walker Health Care Policy. Health insurance was a major issue throughout the campaign - Walker wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Wisconsin is suing in the Federal Court of Texas to try to do so. At the same time, Walker made a last-minute proposal on the pre-existing circumstances, saying that he would rule in state law the same protection as the anti-corruption law. In November 1, 2018, at O &apos; Claire, Evers reiterated that he would protect the people of Wisconsin with preexisting circumstances, then beg for a new claim against Walker. \"How many students are still in their parents' health care (insurance)?\" He then added: \"He wants to get rid of it too.\" Does Walker really want to force students to stop their parents' health insurance? Ives did not provide any specific evidence that he was asked to support this allegation, as the spokesman for Ives Sam Lao referred only to Walker's opposition to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, usually called Obamakari. \"The Affordable Care Act allows you to stay in health care for your parents until the age of 26, and Walker sues for disposal of the Affordable Care Act,\" said Lou. That's true enough. The Affordable Care Act provides that insured persons who provide coverage to dependent children shall provide such coverage until the child reaches the age of 26. However, the Wisconsin Act also contains a similar - albeit less comprehensive - requirement that exists even if the Anti-Corruption Act is repealed. This provision was made as part of the 2011-2013 budget, based on the wording added by the Joint Finance Committee to comply with the requirements of the Anti-Corruption Act. On January 26, 2021, Jim Steinke stated on Republican Twitter that they \"come to the table\" and were part of a compromise \"Give and Take\" on the Corona virus bill. \u2022 On January 27, 2021, Wisconsin will not apply to employer-sponsored and self-financed insurance - about half of the employers who plan to work in the state. This exemption, which is part of federal law, means that half of the employer's plans will not be required to cover children up to the age of 26, as John Peacock, Director of Research for Children Forward, a group of Madison-based advocacy groups, said. However, Walker has already signed a ruling based on what Evers said about Walker's opposition -- it provides the ability for \"children\" to be on their parents' health plans. What's more, the last data from Walker went further. The spokesman for the Walker campaign, Ben Foyle, said that the Governor continued to support him in leaving the rule as in the Anti-Corruption Act. He cited several articles, including an article on August 18, 2015 from the Baker web site. In the midst of Walker &apos; s short presidential campaign, this article looked at key points from Walker &apos; s plan to replace the anti-corruption law. Among the points noted, \"under his proposal, Americans will not be fined for not having health insurance and those under the age of 26 can keep their father's plans.\" He also referred to an interview in Washington Post in 2017, where Walker identified \"youth coverage\" as one of the things that would prevent her from the Affordable Care Act if he were to develop a new policy after the repeal of the Act. Our Evers assessment says that Walker \"want to get rid of\" the ability of students to survive on their parents' health insurance. But Evers doesn't provide direct evidence of this allegation. The only evidence provided - that Walker is opposed to the Anti-Corruption Act, which also covers coverage up to the age of 26 - is not logically linked. It is not logical to conclude from Walker &apos; s opposition to the Anti-Corruption Act that he opposes every position of individual policy within it. The allegation ignores the fact that Walker has already signed the law on the condition that health insurers in Wisconsin allow young people to remain in parental insurance until the age of 26. We appreciate having to make a mistake. :: Editor &apos; s observation: This item was updated on 5 November 2018 to reflect information from Joe Pecock of Children &apos; s Organization on how to compare the state law provision with the anti-corruption law. The evaluation is still wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01320"}
