Former Gov. Sonny Perdue even began his automated call by apologizing for ringing voters\u2019 phones at dinnertime on election eve. Perdue said he just had to make a last-minute pitch for his cousin David Perdue, who went on to finish first in the crowded GOP race for the U.S. Senate.\nFor many people, the automated campaign calls aren\u2019t just annoying, they also are irrelevant. For the primary, more than 239,000 voters went to the polls in advance of Election Day to cast ballots for U.S. senator, governor, and a long list of state and local officeholders. An additional 772,643 followed on Election Day.\nSecretary of State Brian Kemp said the numbers \"make clear that Georgia voters are increasingly taking advantage of early-voting opportunities.\"\nKemp was specifically comparing early votes from the primaries in 2010 (at 19 percent) to 2014 (at 24.2 percent), Kemp spokesman Jared Thomas said.\nWe decided to see whether Kemp is right.\nThirty-three states and the District of Columbia have early voting -- Georgia included.\n\"We were one of the later states to come to the table. By that time, it had already become a pretty accepted practice,\" former Secretary of State Cathy Cox recalled. \"It just makes such common sense in a busy world.\"\nThe Georgia General Assembly passed legislation in 2003, allowing a one-week early-voting period, the Monday through Friday before Election Day. By the 2004 general election, when Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat John Kerry for president, 13 percent of Georgia voters cast ballots early.\nSince then, the number of voters who have cast their ballots early has generally risen steadily, according to data from the Secretary of State\u2019s Office.\nThey soared to the highest level \u00a0-- 53 percent -- in the 2008 election, when Barack Obama was elected president, the data show. Last month, they accounted for 24.2 percent of votes in the GOP and Democratic primaries.\nAndra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University, said looking at the presidential elections in 2004, 2008 and 2012 and the midterm elections for governor in 2006 and 2010, \"it\u2019s clear that early voting is now quite common.\"\n\"The fact that more than a third of Georgia voters cast early ballots in 2012 is impressive,\" Gillespie said.\nHere\u2019s the specifics:\n\n\n\n\nElection\n\n\nEarly votes\n\n\nTotal votes cast\n\n\n% registered voters\n\n\n% early votes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2004 Primary\n\n\n90,266\n\n\n1,401,915\n\n\n35%\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n2004 Primary Runoff\n\n\n36,076\n\n\n559,920\n\n\n14%\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n2004 General\n\n\n422,814\n\n\n3,303,453\n\n\n78%\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\n2004 General Runoff\n\n\n25,145\n\n\n254,376\n\n\n6%\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n2006 Primary\n\n\n129,129\n\n\n924,480\n\n\n22%\n\n\n14%\n\n\n\n\n2006 Primary Runoff\n\n\n51,865\n\n\n396,360\n\n\n9%\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\n2006 General\n\n\n375,536\n\n\n2,139,235\n\n\n49%\n\n\n18%\n\n\n\n\n2006 \u00a0General Runoff\n\n\n51,171\n\n\n219,485\n\n\n5%\n\n\n23%\n\n\n\n\n2008 Primary\n\n\n218,179\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1,012,257\n\n\n21%\n\n\n22%\n\n\n\n\n2008 Primary Runoff\n\n\n91,292\n\n\n464,189\n\n\n10%\n\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\n2008 General\n\n\n2,093,029\n\n\n3,939,235\n\n\n76%\n\n\n53%\n\n\n\n\n2008 General Runoff\n\n\n553,614\n\n\n2,109,917\n\n\n41%\n\n\n26%\n\n\n\n\n2010 Primary\n\n\n212,487\n\n\n1,116,820\n\n\n23%\n\n\n19%\n\n\n\n\n2010 Primary Runoff\n\n\n88,734\n\n\n688,261\n\n\n14%\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\n2010 General\n\n\n783,702\n\n\n2,622,729\n\n\n52%\n\n\n30%\n\n\n\n\n2010 General Runoff\n\n\n57,965\n\n\n290,325\n\n\n6%\n\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\n2012 Primary\n\n\n412,541\n\n\n1,644,066\n\n\n32%\n\n\n25%\n\n\n\n\n2012 Primary Runoff\n\n\n98,562\n\n\n412,222\n\n\n8%\n\n\n24%\n\n\n\n\n2012 General\n\n\n1,922,144\n\n\n3,911,750\n\n\n73%\n\n\n49%\n\n\n\n\n2014 Primary\n\n\n239,031\n\n\n987,618\n\n\n20%\n\n\n24%\n\n\n\n\nSource: Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp's Office\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPolitiFact has looked previously at the research on in-person early voting that\u2019s been growing as more states have added this option. Before 2008, much of the research suggested that early voting did not raise the overall level of voter participation in presidential contests over several decades.\nBut that year in Obama\u2019s run to become the first African-American president, and in major elections since, prominent researchers have detected a small turnout increase due to early voting, especially among black voters.\nSome top researchers say the increase is not significant.\n\"Our take on this is that instead of increasing turnout, it just makes it easier for those who would have voted on Election Day to show up at other times to vote,\" Jan E. Leighley, a co-author with Jonathan Nagler of \"Who Votes Now? Demographics, Issues, Inequality and Turnout in the United States,\" told PolitiFact earlier this year.\nCox said Georgia officials had hoped early voting would boost overall voter participation. But Maxine Daniels, who runs elections in DeKalb County, said she hasn\u2019t seen that result.\n\"It\u2019s not an uptick in voting. It\u2019s basically a shift in when people vote,\" Daniels said. \"It just made it easier for the people who were going to vote anyway.\"\nThere have been other benefits, Daniels and Cox said. Election Day lines are shorter, and counties have been spared the costs of adding more voting machines and ramping up staffing of the polls on Election Day, they said.\nGeorgia has changed its rules on early voting more than once. After having early voting for one week in advance of the elections in 2003 and 2004, the law was amended in 2005 to allow a voter to request an absentee mail-in ballot without giving a reason up to 45 days ahead of a federal or state election or 21 days ahead of a special election. They could still vote in person in the week before the election.\nIn 2010, the law was amended to in-person early voting for seven weeks without giving a reason. In 2011, early voting was reduced to 21 days, ending the Friday before the election and including at least one Saturday of early voting.\nTo sum up, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that Georgia voters are taking advantage of the chance to cast their ballots early. In the 2012 presidential election, 1.9 million early votes were cast. That\u2019s up from about 420,000 in 2004, the first time Georgians could vote early in a presidential election.\nWe rate Kemp\u2019s statement as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07787"}
