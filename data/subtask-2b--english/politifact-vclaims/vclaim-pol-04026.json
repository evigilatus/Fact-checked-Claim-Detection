House seat \"raised taxes on clothing, school supplies \u2013 even baby diapers!\"", "truth_label": "pants-fire", "date": "stated on September 28, 2016:", "title": "N.C. legislator accuses opponent of creating a non-existent tax increase", "text": "Chris Malone, a Republican member of the N.C. House of Representatives, took a pretty standard tactic of accusing his Democratic opponent of having raised taxes in a recent mailer.\nMany races for seats in the North Carolina General Assembly are not very closely contested, as we found in a Mostly True fact-check about gerrymandering.\nBut Malone\u2019s is. John Wynne, a conservative analyst for the website PoliticsNC, rates the district as \"leans Republican.\"\nMalone faces Democratic challenger Terence Everitt in House District 35, which represents the suburbs in northeastern Wake County. Malone\u2019s mailer is clearly aimed at parents who might still be feeling the pinch of their back-to-school shopping bills.\n\"Terence Everitt raised taxes on clothing, school supplies \u2013 even baby diapers!\" declares the mailer, sent to homes in the area. \"That\u2019s right. As a member of the Wake County Transit Advisory Committee, Everitt engineered a $78.5 million tax increase. Not one cent of his tax increase will even go to our schools! We can\u2019t trust Terence Everitt!\"\nEveritt has never held elected office before, so we were intrigued by the claim that he \"raised taxes on clothing, school supplies \u2013 even baby diapers!\"\nThis isn\u2019t the only controversial mailer that Malone has sent out. He has also called for the repeal of the controversial \"bathroom bill\" HB2 \u2013 in a mailer paid for by the North Carolina Republican Party, which raised some eyebrows. The tax mailer we\u2019re looking into now was also funded by the NCGOP.\nLocal government 101\nThere are multiple problems with the mailer\u2019s accusation.\nThe biggest is that the $78.5 million tax increase it references doesn\u2019t actually exist.\nThe mailer is very specific on where it gets its claim, so we\u2019ll break it down. City and county governments\u2019 budget decisions are up to the elected officials. But for large or controversial projects, officials often let voters decide though a municipal bond referendum. It\u2019s a community-wide vote to raise funds, which can be done by raising taxes, borrowing money or both.\nState law since 2007 has allowed a handful of North Carolina\u2019s largest counties to raise sales taxes by half a cent to fund mass transit programs. The Wake County Board of Commissioners decided it wanted to use the option, so it asked for volunteers to study transit plans.\nEveritt was one of 72 people who ended up on the Wake Transit Advisory Committee. The county commissioners liked the committee\u2019s plan, so they decided to let the county\u2019s nearly 700,000 registered voters choose at the ballot box\u00a0whether\u00a0it\u2019s worth a sales tax increase.\nBut that vote won\u2019t happen until the same day that many of them will also be choosing between Malone and Everitt. So to say Everitt has already raised taxes is simply not true.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMalone did not respond to our request for comment.\nThe number Malone cited is right, for what it\u2019s worth. If the bond does pass, it will raise the county\u2019s sales tax rate from 6.75 percent to 7.25 percent. County estimates show that will bring in an estimated $78.5 million in its first year.\nIf it passes, Wake County residents will pay an additional 50 cents on every $100 in goods they purchase.\nBut wait\u2026there\u2019s more\nWe should also note the irony of Malone attacking an opponent for increasing sales taxes on school supplies.\nTwo years ago, state Republicans cut income tax rates and paid for it by broadening the sales tax base and eliminating some exemptions. We looked at some of the details in this Half True claim from Roy Cooper, the Democratic candidate for governor who said Gov. Pat McCrory raised taxes on the middle class \"in 67 different ways.\"\nOne part of the new tax law was eliminating North Carolina\u2019s tax-free, back-to-school-shopping weekend after 2013. From 2002 until that change, families shopping for school supplies such as clothes, laptops and binders could go to stores across the state on one particular weekend and pay no sales taxes.\nNorth Carolina and Kentucky are now the only states in the Southeast\u00a0without a tax-free weekend for back-to-school shopping. Although businesses fought its repeal, the state said doing so could mean $13.6 million extra in tax revenues.\nMalone wasn\u2019t in office\u00a0when the legislature created the tax-free weekend. In 2013, he voted for the bill that eliminated it.\nSo if anyone in this race could be said to have raised taxes on clothing and school supplies, it would be Malone \u2013 not Everitt.\nOur ruling\nChris Malone, a Republican member of the N.C. House of Representatives, said his Democratic challenger Terence Everitt \"raised taxes on clothing, school supplies \u2013 even baby diapers!\"\nThat\u2019s not true. No one has raised these taxes, including Everitt. There will be a vote on whether to raise them, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet.\nThis doozy of a mailer is dishonest in multiple ways. It\u2019s too bad Malone can\u2019t save money on a new pair of slacks during a tax-free weekend, since we rate this claim Pants On Fire.\n https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4ec19f47-e6bd-43ac-8f57-9805b12dee3b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04026"}
