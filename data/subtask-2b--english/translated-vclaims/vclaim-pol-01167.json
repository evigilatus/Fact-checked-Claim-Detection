This is not accurate and not the first time Trump has made false allegations about annual military increases. His full remarks: \"I've just got one of the biggest wage increases I've ever had... never had one in over 10 years - more than 10 years. We got you a big one. I got you a big one. I got you a big one. \"They had a lot of people who came. They said: \"We can make it smaller. We can make it 3%. We can make it 2%. I said, \"No, no...\" Make it 10%. Make it over 10 percent, because it's been a long time. It's been over 10 years. It's been over 10 years.\" We verified a similar allegation from Trump in May, when he told mothers and military husbands at the White House event that he had signed an invoice to give members of the service more than \"the first time in 10 years.\" And we evaluated it on fire. In fact, members of the service receive wage increases each year for more than three decades. The increase in military wages in 2019 by 2.6 per cent has been the largest in nine years, but not the \"more than 10 per cent\" cited by Tramp. The 2.6 per cent increase for military personnel in 2019 is the largest since 2010, but there have been increases each year since then, ranging from 1 per cent to 2.4 per cent. We have previously stated that the last time the members of the service did not receive an annual increase in wages was in 1983, but that was the year when Congress began raising wages in January of the new year, instead of the first day of the Government's fiscal year in October. Thus, members of the service were paid at the beginning of the fiscal year a few months earlier, but not during the calendar year. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to launch security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman (January 17, 2021), you have to go back to 1961 to find a calendar year without an increase in military wages. Tramp notes that the increase was more than 10%, but that is not true either. Increases in military wages are determined by a legal formula provided for by federal law - increases must be equal to increases in the labour cost index, or the labour cost index. According to a report issued in April 2017 by the Congressional Research Service, \"the President may set an alternative salary adjustment to replace automatic adjustment,\" and \"the Congress may enact legislation to determine annual wage increases, which would replace automatic adjustment and/or any presidential settlement if enacted.\" In fact, while the increase of 2.4 per cent for 2018 was the largest in eight years, Trump actually requested 2.1 per cent, \"a quantity less than the automatic adjustment (2.4 per cent) for 2018.\" In the end, Congress revoked the Administration's proposal. For 2019, the Central Tax Authority stated that Trump requested 2.6 per cent, an increase equal to ECI, and one that the President's budget for 2019 called \"mostest.\" On his first trip to a war zone as president, Trump told the service members that he had received \"one of the largest increases\" in wages at all, and said that they had not received a allowance in more than 10 years. This is wrong. The members of the service receive wage increases each year, as provided for by federal law, for more than three contracts, and the increase in 2019 is set at 2.6 per cent. Even if Trump meant that members had not received such a significant increase for more than a decade, it would also be false. The increase exceeded the increases in 2008, 2009 and 2010.
