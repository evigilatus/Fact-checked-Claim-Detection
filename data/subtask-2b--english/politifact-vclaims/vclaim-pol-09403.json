Tom Graves of Ranger called the backlog \"immoral\" in a recent op-ed, and he used a stream of factoids to demonstrate how bad the problem has gotten.\n\n\nThese figures piqued our interest:\n\n\n\"Despite having their budget increased by over 40 percent since 2009 \u2026 pending claims for benefits with the VA have increased from 391,000 to 890,000 under the Obama Administration,\" he said on ZPolitics, a website launched by talk radio host and former congressional candidate Martha Zoller.\n\n\nIf Graves is correct, the number of pending claims has grown by more than 125 percent. Is this true? And was the agency\u2019s budget hike really this steep, despite the budget-cutting debates of recent years?\n\n\nWe contacted Graves spokesman John Donnelly for more information.\n\n\nThe congressman\u2019s criticism is part of a growing chorus of complaints that the VA takes too long to tell veterans whether they\u2019ll receive disability assistance.\n\n\nNews stories have chronicled cases where veterans died as they waited for an answer.\n\n\nLawmakers are clamoring for action, and VA Secretary Eric Shinseki has vowed to eliminate the backlog by 2015.\n\n\nDonnelly responded to PolitiFact Georgia\u2019s request for more information with the VA\u2019s own figures. \u00a0\n\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the VA\u2019s budget. A 10-year overview published on its website showed that in fiscal year 2009, it totaled $97.7 billion. Now it\u2019s $140.3 billion.\n\n\nThat\u2019s a 43.6 jump, or as Graves said, an increase of \"over 40 percent.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanford Bishop\n\n\nstated on July 23, 2012 in an online video of an earlier speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are close to 900,000 unemployed veterans in America right now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 August 3, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider disability claims. Although the controversy centers on backlogged claims -- defined as those pending more than 125 days -- Graves\u2019 statement concerns \"pending\" claims, those awaiting a disability rating decision by the VA.\n\n\nGraves wants veterans to have to wait no more than 30 days for a decision.\n\n\nFor this portion of our fact check, Donnelly referred us to the VA\u2019s weekly disability claims reports. On Jan. 21, 2009, one day after Obama was sworn into office, the department released a report that said the number of pending cases totaled 391,127.\n\n\nThe April 8, 2013, report was the most recent one available when Graves submitted his op-ed to ZPolitics, Donnelly said. We found it reported 889,981 pending claims.\n\n\nSure enough, Graves used accurate figures. But did he put them in the correct context?\n\n\nAlthough Graves did not accuse Obama of causing the growth in pending claims, he did mention that the increase took place under the president\u2019s watch. This suggests that the current administration bears at least some responsibility for the problem. We looked to see whether it does. \u00a0\n\n\nWe found that the backlog has been a long time coming. The benefits system had been outdated for years before Obama took office.\n\n\nWhen Shinseki, an Obama appointee, took over the department in 2009, it used paper files, not electronic ones. It did not have enough staff to handle the onslaught of veterans returning from a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\n\"I don't think we really anticipated the nature of injuries, the multiple deployments. Men and women are surviving injuries that would have been sure death 20 or 25 years ago,\" said Dave Autry, a spokesman with DAV, an organization that advocates for disabled American veterans.\n\n\nThe VA hired more staff and in fiscal 2011 completed 1 million claims, a 6 percent increase from 2009, according to the Government Accountability Office. But the number of claims received grew 29 percent, the GAO reported.\n\n\nVeterans advocates told us that even though the VA increased staff, training fell short and claims administrators made bad decisions. Veterans appealed, and the backlog grew even larger. A computerized system intended to streamline the process is still being implemented.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that to prove they are disabled, veterans have to pull together documents from the Social Security Administration, the Department of Defense and other federal bureaucracies that do not share information, said Paul Rieckhoff, who heads Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, which has been pushing for improvement.\n\n\n\"What you see is really a bureaucratic failure that stretches across the government,\" Rieckhoff said. \"We don't think it's been a partisan issue.\"\n\n\nIn sum, Graves\u2019 numbers are correct. The VA\u2019s budget has increased by more than 40 percent, and the number of pending claims has skyrocketed from some 391,000 to 890,000 under the Obama administration.\n\n\nGraves also was accurate in noting that the increase took place under the president\u2019s watch. While the VA\u2019s benefits system has been troubled since well before Obama took office, efforts during his administration have not prepared the department for its current challenges.\n\n\nWe rate Graves\u2019 statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09403"}
