And a statewide recount in the 2011 Wisconsin Supreme Court race changed the margin by just 310 votes, retaining a 7,000-vote win for David Prosser.\nEven former Republican Gov. Scott Walker has noted on Twitter that Trump is unlikely to see a recount change the outcome.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Meagan Wolfe, director of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, has said her agency had \"not received any report of any irregularities\" \u2014 despite repeated claims to the contrary from Trump and his team, made without evidence.\nNevertheless, some Republicans have pushed forward on the idea of a statewide recount, including U.S. House Representative-elect Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau.\u00a0\nSpeaking before the completion of the statewide canvass that confirmed the 20,000-vote margin, Fitzgerald said Nov. 8, 2020, on WISN-TV\u2019s UpFront program it appeared the state was in \"recount territory.\" Then he said this about recounts:\n\"That is a very back-and-forth type of process in which arguments are made as to whether or not to keep a ballot, or throw a ballot out, and I\u2019ve seen elections change as a result of those. I know some say that\u2019s a high margin to really change but, you know, it can happen.\"\u00a0\nHave recounts really flipped Wisconsin elections?\nYes. But not any statewide races or ones with the margin of difference seen here.\nElection recounts have not flipped statewide elections here\nFitzgerald, the current state Senate majority leader, did not respond to repeated requests from PolitiFact Wisconsin to provide evidence for his claim. So we checked with experts and news archives to see what we could find.\nReid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said to his knowledge no statewide race in Wisconsin has ever flipped due to a recount.\u00a0\nSince 2000, only three statewide races have flipped anywhere in the United States, according to a 2020 Survey and Analysis of Statewide Election Recount from FairVote, which advocates for ranked choice voting. They were a 2004 governor\u2019s race in Washington, a 2006 auditor\u2019s race in Vermont and a 2008 U.S. Senate seat race in Minnesota. All had initial margins of less than 300 votes.\nThe FairVote study found the average statewide recount shifted results by 430 votes between the frontrunners, representing 0.024% of the vote in those elections.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut results have shifted in local races on multiple occasions in Wisconsin given the smaller vote totals involved. A few we came across in our research:\n\n\nIn a 1996 race for Appleton mayor, a recount flipped the race from an eight-vote loss to a 14-vote win for the challenger.\u00a0\n\n\nIn an April 2009 race for chairman in the Town of Wausau, a challenger had defeated an incumbent by a card draw after a tied vote, but a recount yielded one extra vote in favor of the incumbent.\u00a0\n\n\nIn 1997, the former town chair of the Town of Fayette in Lafayette County ran as a write-in and won by a single vote in the initial count, but after a recount he lost by two.\n\n\nOther recounts have broken or created ties, including a 2004 mayoral election in South Milwaukee that initially ended in a tie, but showed a one-vote margin upon a recount.\u00a0\nAnd an April 2011 Oshkosh Common Council election showed a 14-vote victory, but a recount ended in a tie, forcing the candidates to draw cards to determine the victor.\u00a0\nHow recounts work\nRecounts are conducted by the County Board of Canvassers, made up of a county clerk and two other electors appointed by the clerk, one from each party.\nA candidate who lost a race but was within 1% of the winner\u2019s total can request a recount. For races with at least 4,000 votes, the candidate must pay for the recount unless the margin is less than 0.25%. In those tightest races the municipality bears the cost.\nThe board of canvassers decides whether to hand-count votes or use a machine tabulator.\nMagney said there can be a \"back and forth\" at a recount, in line with Fitzgerald\u2019s claim.\n\"If there is an objection to the counting of a particular ballot, there could be a situation where arguments are made on both sides that the recount board of canvassers hears, it is documented in the minutes, the board of canvassers makes a determination, the decision is noted, and they move on,\" Magney wrote in an email. \"The issue is preserved for any potential legal challenge to a decision made by the recount board of canvassers.\"\nUnder state law, board members might discuss votes if a petitioner for a recount believes an error has been made (9.01(1)(b)9), if they need to determine voter intent (9.01(1)(b)8s), or if the person demanding a recount object to the counting of a ballot in a recount (9.01(1)(b)11).\nOur ruling\u00a0\nAmid discussions of a potential presidential recount in Wisconsin, Fitzgerald said Wisocnsin appeared to be in \"recount territory\" and \"I\u2019ve seen elections change as a result of\" recounts.\nSome local races have indeed flipped, which lines up with Fitzgerald\u2019s claim.\u00a0\nBut he made this comment in the context of a potential recount affecting the presidential race, and no races of that magnitude or vote-gap have flipped in Wisconsin. Nationwide, a total of three statewide races flipped in a recount between 2000 and 2020, but none had margins anywhere near the 20,000 we see in Wisconsin.\nSo races have flipped, but not races like this.\nWe define Half True as a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18545"}
