Scott Walker \"hasn't done a public event this entire year.\"", "truth_label": "pants-fire", "date": "stated on August 27, 2013 in an interview:", "title": "Scott Walker hasn't done any public events in 2013, Democratic state senator says", "text": "Gov. Scott Walker has so cocooned himself from regular folks, state Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson contends, that he \"hasn't done a public event in this entire year.\"\nWait, what?\nLarson made the statement Aug. 27, 2013, on Madison-area radio station WEKZ-FM (93.7), then quickly told liberal talk show host John Sylvester what he meant.\n\"Just to be clear, Sly. His events, they're open to press, donors and for invited guests. I wouldn't consider that a public event,\" Larson said. \"A public event, I would consider something where folks, the working class, can actually make it, where it's not working hours and it's something where it's not invite-only.\"\nSo, the Milwaukee Democrat has his own idea of what constitutes a public event, although we\u2019re not bound by that definition in rating his claim.\nNarrow definition\nWhen we asked Larson to back his statement, he elaborated by saying that, besides being open without invitation and held outside of regular working hours, a public event should allow ordinary citizens to express opinions to or ask questions of the governor, he said.\nBut that\u2019s not evidence of what Larson said in the interview and it\u2019s an even more narrow definition of public event.\nBy that definition, most meetings of legislative committees -- typically scheduled during business hours -- are not \"public events.\" And it suggests that when the governor visits a factory or business and talks to workers, it shouldn\u2019t count simply because someone off the street couldn\u2019t walk in and participate.\nSo, Larson doesn\u2019t exactly back off his claim. He just aims to shift it to more favorable terms for himself.\nLarson also pointed to a series of public hearings he held on evenings and weekends on the 2013-\u201915 state budget, saying Walker has appeared at no such events this year.\nThere's no question that access to the governor -- really, any governor -- is limited.\nWalker typically gives a day\u2019s notice to news media of what some of his appearances will be the following day. Indeed, he doesn't release detailed daily itineraries until weeks after the fact, a practice followed by Walker\u2019s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, for most of his time as governor.\nYet, just a few weeks before Larson made his claim, there was Walker addressing folks along with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, to open the Wisconsin State Fair, and attending the Governor\u2019s Red, White and Blue Ribbon Livestock Auction. The fair, obviously, is about an accessible public an event as there is.\nSo, let's take a closer look at where Walker has been.\nEvents in 2013\nWalker spokesman Tom Evenson sent us a list of more than 100 Walker events in 2013 that Evenson described as public. Some were easily accessible to the general public; others, because of cost, membership requirements or other reasons, weren't.\nHere's a sampling:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Championship Snowmobile Derby in Eagle River, an event that attracted thousands.
