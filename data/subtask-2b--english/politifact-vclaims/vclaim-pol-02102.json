Is he right?\n\"Recently\" claim a stretch\nMitchell, the president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin union, is part of a large Democratic field seeking to unseat Gov. Scott Walker. He is making his second run for statewide office, having lost a 2012 bid for lieutenant governor to Rebecca Kleefisch.\nThe laws he references created additional benefits for Wisconsin firefighters or their families in two specific scenarios.\n2009 Wisconsin Act 284 established a presumption that firefighters, law enforcement officers and emergency responders who are killed or disabled by an infectious disease contracted the disease through their employment, giving them access to related benefits.\n2009 Wisconsin Act 285 required municipalities to pay health insurance premiums for the surviving spouses and dependent children of firefighters who die in the line of duty if they were paying premiums for the firefighter.\nYou\u2019ll notice the year built into the titles of the laws isn\u2019t exactly, well, recent.\nThe laws both were drafted in 2009 and took effect in May 2010.\nWas Mitchell a key force behind laws?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitchell\u2019s \"instrumental\" claim is a bit subjective, but leaning on the\u00a0dictionary definition we\u2019ll take that to mean Mitchell is claiming a key role in getting the laws passed.\nA lot goes into making a bill into a law \u2014 cue Schoolhouse Rock \u2014 but it seems fair to say a key person would be centrally involved with proposing the law, writing the law or pushing for its passage, through things like lobbying or testifying on behalf of the bill.\nMitchell was a member of the union\u2019s board when the laws were passed, in charge of outreach and public relations, according to his campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Allen. She said Mitchell attended committee hearings and floor debates in support of the bill and arranged for other firefighters to do the same. And he was part of the group that organized the bill signing.\nBut Mitchell did not testify on behalf of the bills \u2014 that was left to other union representatives.\nAnd he did not formally lobby for the bills, either, since he was not a registered lobbyist until February 2011.\nAs to the how the laws came to be,\u00a0drafting records for the health insurance bill show it was introduced by state Sen. David Hansen (D-Green Bay) after the widow of former Green Bay firefighter Arnie Wolff wrote to him about her family\u2019s financial struggles. The bill was drafted by the Legislative Reference Bureau at Hansen\u2019s request and modeled after similar legislation in Illinois.\nDrafting records for the infectious diseases bill don\u2019t specify the origin of the idea (and Mitchell didn\u2019t claim he proposed it), but show it was drafted by the reference bureau at the request of then-state Sen. Jim Sullivan (D-Wauwatosa) based on a bill in Virginia.\nThe union president who preceded Mitchell, Mike Woodzicka, said the union worked with legislators on the language of the bills, so Mitchell and other board members would have been part of email exchanges on that topic.\nJay Wadd, a spokesman for Hansen, said he assumes such a step would have been part of the process on their bill, though he doesn\u2019t have specific records of it given the time that has passed.\nOur rating\nMitchell claims he was recently \"instrumental to passing two pieces of legislation that were a huge victory for fire fighters across the state.\"\nBut it\u2019s a stretch to say the action was recent, and that Mitchell\u2019s role was instrumental.\nMitchell\u2019s union supported the bills, and he was involved with supporting them, but there\u2019s no evidence the bills wouldn\u2019t have become law without his involvement.\nWe rate Mitchell\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-05-07 15:54:25 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Says he was \"instrumental to passing two (recent) pieces of legislation that were a huge victory for firefighters across the state.\"    Mahlon Mitchell Democratic candidate for Wisconsin governor https://mahlonmitchell.com/bio   On his campaign website Monday, April 30, 2018 2018-04-30    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02102"}
