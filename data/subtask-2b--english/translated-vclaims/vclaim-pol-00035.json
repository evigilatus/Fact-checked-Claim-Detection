The ads say they were sponsored and paid for by the United States Department of Defense, challenging the idea that AARP is a \"non-partisan organization.\" But you have to understand what you're supporting if you're a member of the League. The Association supported Obamakari, strictly seized the weapon, and federal funding for family planning. AMAC fought against all these things.\" We found a number of other articles on Facebook where users claimed that AARP \"supports abortion,\" a service that provides many family planning clinics. We wondered whether the Association &apos; s declarations were correct in saying that the Association supported federal funding for family planning. In an e-mail, Ellen Cora, a member of the American Family Planning Association, told us that, as an American over 65 years of age - and a member of the Association itself - she recalled the Association's publications, which spoke \"positively about family planning,\" and added that \"we often refer to the Association for Family Planning beyond the Hijab\" for more information about the Association. \"Behind the veil: AARP America does not know,\" the 2011 report was prepared by the Republic of the United States, Wally Herger, R. Calif, Dave Richert, R. Wash. She was released when a subcommittee of the House of Representatives opened a hearing to discuss the status of the Association in tax exemption. CNN then stated that the Republicans had been targeting the group following the report allegedly revealing \"the conflict between the Association's profit campaign, the best interests of its members, and the organization's tax-exempt status.\" Democrats claim that the attacks resulted from the Association &apos; s support for the bill on health care submitted by then President Barack Obama, according to CNN. However, the report does not mention family planning. When we followed Jeff Semanski, another political contact AMAC, he remembered \"it was the radio personality that made the allegation that I mentioned, not AMAC.\" The language in the advertisement showing the character of Radio Dennis Brager is almost identical to that of Sebastian Gorka. Both are linked to the AMAC website and say that the network is sponsored and reimbursed. We asked Semanski if he didn't write the ads but he didn't respond. Instead, PolityFact was directed to a page about AARP on the website 2ndVote.com, which calls itself the \"conservator of corporate activity.\" Under a section called \"Life,\" the page says: \"ARP is a company supporting the National Women's Legal Centre, an organization supporting abortion.\" It is linked to the report of the National Centre for Women &apos; s Law 2013-14, which lists the association of organizations that contributed between $25,000 and $49,999 to the Centre in the fiscal year ending 30 June 2014. 2th Vote.com is also linked to a fact sheet produced by the Centre on equality in marriage. But he doesn't mention abortion. According to its website, the National Centre for Women's Law calls for gender justice \"to work through issues that are at the centre of women's and girls' lives.\" Its issues include child care, ethnic justice, health care and reproductive rights. According to the Centre, \"abortion is a key part of women's freedom, equality and economic security.\" In 2013, the Centre produced a fact sheet called \"The Hyde Amendment Injures Women.\" The amendment provides that the federal government can only pay for abortion when the mother's life is in danger or if she becomes pregnant as a result of rape or incest, and the centre calls it a \"painless ban\" to the detriment of low-income women. We sent an e-mail to AARP to ask about AAAC's allegation and supporting evidence. The spokesman for Jason Young confirmed that the Association had donated to the Centre and directed us to a file of the Tax Authority that said that the Association had donated $25,000 that year to \"support the project for the protection and improvement of social security for women.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, social security is another issue of concern to the status of law. On its website, it states that it is working with legislators to develop proposals to strengthen social security and increase benefits to improve women &apos; s pension security. In 2013, Young, AARP, legal status and other groups opposed the \"restricted consumer price index,\" described by the Washington Post in this explanation as \"a way of indexing expenditure and taxes - including social security benefits - to inflation, or price increases over time.\" Social security benefits would have increased at a slower rate using this indicator, and the Association considered, inter alia, that this reduction in social security benefits was not justified. The Association said \"She has no position on abortion,\" and said Young. The Association does not fund and does not finance family planning. AARP did not support or press for federal funding for family planning.\" He also noted that JPMorgan Chase, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Citi, among others, had contributed to the National Centre for Women &apos; s Law in the same year as the Association. The Family Planning Union of America was a supporter of the Centre that year, amounting to between $5,000 and $9,999. In the past, the organization has received federal funding through the reimbursement of costs of preventive care, and section X, a grant programme in health and humanitarian services that funds comprehensive family planning services. However, family planning and others are prohibited from using federal funds for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest or when a woman &apos; s life is at risk. More recently, because of the Tramp management base that would deny any health clinics that refer women to abortions, the Family Planning Organization has chosen - for the time being - not to participate in the programme. Benjamin Sommers, a professor of health policy and economics at Harvard University, said that the Comprehensive Health Care Act, known as the Obamaker, had not specifically identified any family planning funds. Chan School of Public Health. Instead, he told us that he extended health insurance to 20 million people, and some of these people may have received care in family planning. \"It seems difficult to say, however, that the Association's support to the American Bar Association has been more directly calling for the provision of family planning funds than for the sending of funds to any qualified health-care provider at the national level - including thousands.\" \"I believe the most logical explanation is that AARP was supporting the expansion of health insurance, not calling for any particular health-care provider.\" Gretchen Eli, a professor at the Faculty of Social Work at Buffalo University, echoed this feeling. She said: \"It seems particularly elusive in this particular example, given the Association's focus on persons who are old enough to retire.\" In November 2009, when the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) passed the Law on High-cost Health Care in America - the text of the House of Representatives &apos; Legislation on Health Care Reform - Barry Rand, then Executive Director of AARP, said in a statement that the bill contained \"critical elements for which AARP had been struggling on behalf of its members and all older Americans to improve health care for themselves and their families.\" He cited examples, including \"protection and promotion of medical care for older persons today and future generations of retirees\" and \"reduction of the cost of medicines for older persons.\" It does not mention family planning, family planning or abortion. More recently, in 2017, the Association opposed the American Health Care Act, the Public Health Care Bill, which would have eliminated a large segment of the Obama Care Program. One of the provisions of this measure is to effectively prevent family planning from receiving reimbursement from Medicaid for one year. The slogans. Lisa Morkovski, War-Alaska and Susan Collins, R-Mine, who joined the Democrats together with John McCain, R-Aries, to kill the bill in the Senate, referred to the financing of family planning as one of the conditions in support of the bill. The Association published a publication on its website in June 2017, entitled \"Five Ways the Senate Health Care Bill will Hurt You.\" However, it focused on \"excessive insurance premiums,\" medical coverage and care services, not family planning funding. The claim that they opposed the bill because of family planning is \"a completely misleading allegation,\" said Sarah Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University. In addition, Rosenbaum told us that, while the Association for Health Benefits and Preventive Health Services for Women had called, she was not aware of any specific pressure or advocacy by the Association for Family Planning. She said it would be completely different for them to defend another organization. Our resolution AMAC claims that AARP supports federal funding for family planning. It is not easy to say that an organization wants to use taxpayers &apos; dollars for family planning because it once donated to a legal centre supporting abortion in addition to seeking pay equity, family tax exemptions, affirmative action and combating social security cuts. The Association does not have a published position on abortion or federal funding for abortion. Her health-care advocacy focuses on issues related to older Americans, such as social security benefits, the pricing of prescription drugs and elder abuse in nursing facilities. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00035"}
