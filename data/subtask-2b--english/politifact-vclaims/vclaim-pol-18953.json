Who\u2019s paying these monsters?\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\nLet\u2019s review what we know about the protest arrests.\nNearly all arrests were from Kenosha and surrounding areas\nThe numbers in the post come from an Aug. 30 news release issued by Kenosha police.\nThe department reported 175 people were arrested from Aug. 24 (when the first protests started) to 12:30 p.m. on Aug. 30. Of those, 102 listed addresses outside Kenosha.\nThe release also noted 69 of those people were arrested for curfew violations, while 34 were arrested for violating curfew as well as other charges such as carrying concealed weapons, burglary and drug possession.\nThe implication from the Facebook post is that the people arrested from outside Kenosha were an organized \"industry,\" or for some other reason weren\u2019t people who naturally assembled.\nPolice booking data tells a different story.\nOnline booking data doesn\u2019t line up precisely with the police report. But it shows 165 people were arrested from Aug. 24 to 12:30 p.m. on Aug. 30, which gives us insight into how those protest arrests broke down.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the 165:\n\n\n59 were from Kenosha (roughly in line with the ratio in the post and news release)\n\n\n60 were from elsewhere in Wisconsin, mostly Milwaukee (23) and Racine (14)\n\n\n28 were from Illinois, the border of which is about 6 miles from the heart of the protests\n\n\n11 were from Washington and Oregon\n\n\n7 were from elsewhere (Kentucky, Minnesota, Indiana and California, as well as three listed by police as homeless)\n\n\nThe Washington and Oregon residents are largely related to a Seattle-based group called Riot Kitchen, which provides meals for protesters and homeless people. A widely shared video showed police forcibly removing people from a minivan with Oregon plates at a Kenosha gas station Aug. 26.\nPolice said the group had several vehicles and had been filling gas cans there. Authorities suspected \"the occupants of these vehicles were preparing for criminal activity related to the civil unrest,\" police said in a statement. But a Riot Kitchen board member told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel the gas was to run a generator they use for making food.\nThe group had detoured to feed people in Kenosha during a planned trip to Washington, D.C., they told a New York Times reporter.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says \"out of 175 arrested in Kenosha, 102 were not from Kenosha. Rioting has become its own industry.\"\nThe numbers are correct, but the implication connected to them is not.\nThe majority of those arrested were from outside the city of Kenosha, but about 90% were from either Wisconsin or nearby Illinois. In other words, people one would expect to organically gather for a local protest spurred by a local event.\nAnd most of those from farthest away can be traced to a single group that drove from the West Coast.\nOur definition of Mostly False is a claim that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18953"}
