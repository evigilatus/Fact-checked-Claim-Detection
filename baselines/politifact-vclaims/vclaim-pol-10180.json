Robert Menendez says the Budget Control Act is the federal budget", "text": "When it comes to passing a budget, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez hasn\u2019t been doing his job, according to his Republican challenger, state Sen. Joe Kyrillos.\n\nIn a heated debate Wednesday on New Jersey 101.5-FM, the Democratic incumbent and Kyrillos argued over whether the U.S. Senate has passed a budget in the last three years. The two candidates will face off in the Nov. 6 general election.\n\n\"The Senate hasn\u2019t passed a budget in three years,\" said Kyrillos, who represents part of Monmouth County. \"That\u2019s just a fact, hasn\u2019t done it.\"\n\nBut Menendez said that wasn\u2019t true: \"Secondly, there is a budget. It\u2019s called the Budget Control Act and you should look it up. You\u2019d understand then that your statement about not having a budget for the last three years would be wrong.\"\n\nSo, is Menendez right that Kyrillos\u2019 statement is inaccurate and the Senate has passed a budget \"called the Budget Control Act\"?\n\nThat legislation performs budgetary functions -- such as setting limits on certain types of future discretionary spending -- but the Act is not a budget plan under the official congressional budget process.\n\nThat kind of plan is called a \"budget resolution\" and the Senate hasn\u2019t passed one in more than three years.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said in an e-mail that \"a completed budget is expected to do much more than set spending levels for discretionary programs.\"\n\nGalston added, \"The 2011 BCA kept the government open, but it didn\u2019t constitute a full budget.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLet\u2019s explain what a budget resolution is.\n\nThe House and Senate are supposed to adopt a budget resolution that covers the upcoming fiscal year and at least the following four fiscal years.\n\nA budget resolution does not become law, but instead serves as the framework for appropriations bills and other subsequent legislation dealing with budgetary matters.\n\nWith Menendez voting yes, the Senate last passed a budget resolution on April 29, 2009 for fiscal year 2010. In the absence of a budget resolution, Congress has taken other steps to spend money and set certain budgetary guidelines.\n\nNow, let\u2019s turn to the Budget Control Act.\n\nEnacted in August 2011, that legislation also included provisions to raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, and set up a process that could trigger additional spending cuts. Menendez voted against the bill.\n\nThe Act is similar to a budget resolution in terms of setting those discretionary spending limits, according to Jason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction.\n\nBut the legislation did not \"set forth projections for mandatory spending and targeted revenue levels for five years,\" which budget resolutions do, Peuquet told us.\n\nHarvard Law School professor Howell Jackson added in an e-mail that \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to consider this a substitute for the actual adoption of a budget resolution, which has lots of other implications (and procedural vehicles for getting around the filibuster).\"\n\nIn a statement, Mike Soliman, Menendez\u2019s campaign manager, argued that Menendez didn\u2019t say the Senate passed a budget resolution, but that it passed a budget.\n\n\"The Budget Control Act is stronger than a budget resolution because it actually has the force of law,\" Soliman added. \"The Budget Control Act carries the force of law, it sets our spending limits for two years, and it actually dictates our nation's spending. A non-binding budget resolution does not.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nDuring last week\u2019s debate, Menendez claimed Kyrillos\u2019 statement was wrong and that the Senate has passed \"a budget\" in the last three years, \"called the Budget Control Act.\"\n\nThat Act set limits on discretionary spending, but it is missing other features of a \"budget resolution,\" which is considered a budget plan under the official congressional budget process. The Senate hasn\u2019t passed such a plan in more than three years.\n\nWe rate the statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Codey\n\n\nstated on July 13, 2011 in an interview on Hannity on Fox News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every president has raised the debt ceiling.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill Wichert \u2022 July 21, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10180"}
