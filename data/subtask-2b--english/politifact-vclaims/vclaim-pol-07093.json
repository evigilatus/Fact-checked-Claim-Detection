According to the Chronicle, Houston attorneys threw out more than 2,000 pages with about 11,300 signatures because the people who collected the signatures were either not registered voters in Houston or did not sign the petition themselves.\nIn reaction the next day, several residents filed a lawsuit charging the city with wrongfully invalidating the repeal petition.\nThe city issued the subpoenas, as allowed by Texas law, as part of its defense in the lawsuit, in which it had said it will argue against the validity of many signatures on the repeal petition. Feldman told the Chronicle the city included its request for sermons in the subpoenas because pastors who led the petition effort gave instructions on gathering signatures during church service.\nWe sought elaboration from the city -- does Houston\u2019s government suspect preachers of coaxing congregants to fake signatures? -- without success.\nThe city also didn\u2019t respond to our inquiries about the described subpoenas, copies of which came from Abbott\u2019s state office.\nLegal Documents\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo our inquiry, Abbott\u2019s state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, emailed copies of five subpoenas, issued Sept. 10, 2014 via a city attorney, Kristen Schlemmer, addressed to Houston pastors Steve Riggle, Hernan Castano, Khan Huynh and Dave Welch and church leader Magda Hermida.\nEach subpoena lists 17 categories of documents and communications which the church leaders were told they had to submit by Oct. 10, 2014, including:\n--\"All speeches, presentations or sermons related to HERO, the petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by or approved by you or in your possession.\"\n--\"All communications with members of your congregation regarding HERO or the petition.\"\nAccording to the subpoena, documents and communications include writings, notes, diaries, electronic or videotape recordings, emails, instant messages, text messages, emails or relevant \"electronically-stored matter.\"\nMeanwhile, two days after Abbott wrote his letter, the city revised the subpoenas to remove mention of \"sermons.\" Parker said opponents deliberately misinterpreted the subpoenas\u2019 original language, which sought speech about the signature-gathering process; then again, she also maintained the changes didn\u2019t preclude sermons from being produced, according to a Chronicle news story.\nOur Ruling\nGreg Abbott said a city lawyer \"demanded that several Houston pastors hand over to the city government many of their private papers, including their sermons.\"\nFive subpoenas, submitted by the City of Houston, required pastors to furnish sermons and personal communications with members of their congregation.\nWe rate this statement True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07093"}
