You\u2019ve got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean,\" Obama said. \"Now, you just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq. That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.\"\n\nWe were interested in Obama\u2019s claim that Romney recently said troops should still be in place in Iraq.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll note Romney\u2019s point about how both candidates wanted some troops to remain as part of an agreement with the Iraqi government is fair. Before President George W. Bush left office in 2008, the Iraqi Parliament ratified a pact, or a status of forces agreement, with the U.S. that put the complete withdrawal of troops by the end of 2011.\n\nStill, officials on both sides expected some American troops to remain to help protect and train the Iraqis with security threats to their border, waterways and airspace, the New York Times reported.\u00a0Over the course of 2011, Obama scaled down the number of troops he thought should be in place to between 3,000 and 5,000.\n\nIn the end, the breaking point was not over the size of a remaining force, but over Iraqi officials not wanting to grant American soldiers immunity under Iraqi law.\n\nThe result: No combat troops remained in Iraq. About 200 people in the military are there now, and they report to the U.S. ambassador, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman said. This does not include security contractors, for which the spokesman had no estimate.\n\nSome U.S. military officers saw Obama\u2019s Oct. 21, 2011, announcement of a complete withdrawal as him \"putting best face on a breakdown in tortured negotiations with the Iraqis,\" the New York Times reported.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis brings us back to our check: Did Romney say the U.S. should have troops in Iraq to this day?\n\nHe has not used those words, but it\u2019s a reasonable inference of his public positions on the withdrawal of troops from Iraq.\n\nThe Obama campaign directed us to Romney\u2019s remarks on foreign policy\u00a0at the Virginia Military Institute on Oct. 8, 2012. In that speech, like many times before, Romney criticized Obama for pursuing a total withdrawal from the country instead of securing a residual force.\n\n\"In Iraq the costly gains made by our troops are being eroded by rising violence, a resurgent al-Qaida, the weakening of democracy in Baghdad and the rising influence of Iran,\" he said. \"And yet America\u2019s ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence. The president\u2019s tried, he tried, but he also failed to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains.\"\n\nRomney did not specify in his foreign policy speech what he thought a reasonable residual force would be. But in a December 2011 interview with Fox News, he said \"we should have left 10-, 20-, 30,000 personnel there to help transition to the Iraqi's own military capabilities.\"\n\nWe could not find an instance in which Romney said how long troops should have been in place. The main takeaway from the debate exchange, a Romney spokesman said, is Obama did not fulfill his own plan to leave a residual force in Iraq after 2012.\n\nThe Obama campaign says it is reasonable to say thousands of troops would still be in place had Romney has his way.\n\n\"So those comments -- and with no clear plan forward on Iraq \u2013 mean troops would be there right now,\" wrote Kara Carscaden, Obama campaign spokeswoman, in an email.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAccording to Obama, Romney said in a recent speech \"we should still have troops in Iraq.\"\n\nIn a speech at the Virginia Military Institute, Romney said the United States has been \"undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence\" and that Obama \"failed to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown.\"\n\nSo Romney wanted a sizeable presence of U.S. troops in Iraq past 2011 as part of a status of forces agreement, which the Obama administration sought but did not get with the Iraqi government. The agreement would have been part of an overall drawdown.\n\nWe rate Obama\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10102"}
