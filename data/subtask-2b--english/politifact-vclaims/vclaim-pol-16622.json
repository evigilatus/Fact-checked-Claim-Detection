Our whole food system in this country has now been \u2014 most of it is genetically engineered. And no safety testing was done, no testing for the health consequences of this food.\"\n\nHe's exaggerating.\n\n\nFirst, a little history. The FDA caused a storm of controversy in 1992 when it declared that it would hold plants developed through biotechnology to the same standards as all other foods. Under the ruling, foods made with plants whose genetic material had been altered using biotechnology would not face higher scrutiny than foods produced in traditional ways.\n\n\nIn 1994, the agency for the first time approved a bioengineered food product \u2014 a tomato that resisted rotting \u2014 for human consumption.\n\n\nAlthough the safety standards are the same for bioengineered and traditional foods, the agency says that, in practice, genetically modified foods usually receive a more thorough review. These foods are subject to a voluntary consultation process, where the producer can choose to review its own health research with the FDA's scientists.\n\n\nThat process appears to give an advantage to the food companies, but it still involves more testing than Kucinich's statement suggests.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of 2004, every bioengineered food product on the market had completed this consultation process, the FDA said. (More recent statistics were not available.)\n\n\nSo Kucinich exaggerates when he says that \"no safety testing\" has been done on the products that are on the market, although the process has been criticized for giving food companies too much influence.\n\n\nIn 2001, the New York Times reported on the political considerations that went into the FDA's decisions on genetically engineered foods in the 1990s, revealing that many scientists in the agency had expressed doubts about the safety of the foods but were silenced by the focus on the deregulation of industry by the first Bush administration.\n\n\nMany environmental groups continue to push for greater regulation of genetically modified foods, including labeling, while the FDA continues to insist that these foods do not pose health risks to consumers.\n\n\nKucinich is closer to the mark with his claim that most food is genetically engineered.\n\n\nThe Center for Food Safety, an advocacy group critical of biotechnology, says that a handful of genetically modified crops - mostly corn, soybeans, canola and cotton \u2014 account for most of the foods involved. But the group also estimates that 60 to 70 percent of processed foods contain at least some residual genetically modified organisms.\nJoe Mendelson, the group's spokesman, said Kucinich \"has firm ground to say it's penetrated our food markets a great deal. But it is certainly not everything.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16622"}
