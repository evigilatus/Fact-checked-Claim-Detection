Story that FBI issued warrant for Obama in Trump wiretapping case is fake", "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s unproven allegations that former President Barack Obama wiretapped phones in Trump Tower have\u00a0proven to be a petri dish for fake news.\nIn the last two weeks, multiple fake news sites have written stories claiming that the FBI has a warrant out for Obama\u2019s arrest stemming from allegations he wiretapped Trump\u2019s phones.\n\"FBI issues Warrant For Obama\u2019s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower Wiretap,\" read the headlines on multiple fake news sites. Facebook flagged several claims as part of its efforts to weed out fake news from its news feeds.\nThese stories don\u2019t have a grain of truth. There\u2019s no warrant out for Obama\u2019s arrest, and he\u2019s definitely not getting arrested by the FBI. We\u2019ve also found no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim that the wiretapping even took place.\nMost of the stories are all essentially identical, saying that Obama will be \"picked up by\" the FBI sometime today or be charged with unlawful use of authority for ordering an illegal wiretap on the phones in Trump Tower.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stories also quote a \"spokesman\" for the FBI, Todd McMartin, who supposedly told Fox News: \"The proof is undeniable. Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can\u2019t find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.\"\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious that quote is made up, though. This story about Obama\u2019s arrest is originally from a site full of faux news stories, TheLastLineOfDefense.org.\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn\u2019t identify the warrant story as fake, but the About Us page notes that \"all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts   Politifact    6 7  Politifact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"FBI issues Warrant For Obama\u2019s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower Wiretap.\"    Internet rumors Bloggers   internet posts Saturday, March 4, 2017 03/04/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03566"}
