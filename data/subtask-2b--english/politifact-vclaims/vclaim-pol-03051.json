Chris Sununu says he\u2019s proud of his state\u2019s record of environmental stewardship. The Republican says New Hampshire will take care of its natural resources with or without a demand from Paris or Washington, D.C.\nWhen he was asked whether he\u2019d sign onto the United States Climate Alliance \u2013 a state-level agreement to uphold the objectives of the Paris climate accord developed after the U.S. withdrew from the latter \u2013 he bristled.\nIn an interview with New Hampshire Public Radio, Sununu said the climate alliance is \"quasi-meaningless\" and \"more of just a political statement than anything.\"\nHe specifically called out its founders, the governors of California and New York, saying their motive in championing the U.S. Climate Alliance was to distract from their states\u2019 shortcomings.\n\"That piece of paper that folks wanted me to sign \u2013 think about where it came from,\" Sununu told the public radio station. \"It came from the governors of New York and California, the two biggest polluting states in the country.\"\nPolitiFact New Hampshire decided to take a closer look at the biggest polluting states in the country.\nClarifying the statement\nSununu made the statement in response to a listener\u2019s question about climate change and the Paris accord, which suggests that his \"biggest polluting states\" remark was a reference to carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions. But he also discussed other types of pollution.\nBefore he was the CEO of a ski mountain or the governor, Sununu received a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in civil and environmental engineering and worked as an environmental engineer cleaning up waste sites. He said he brings \"more environmental experience to the governor\u2019s office than any governor in the history of the state.\"\nHis work cleaning up hazardous waste sites in California showed him first-hand, he said, \"It\u2019s deplorable what they\u2019ve done in parts of that state \u2013 or New York up in some of those rivers.\"\nSo what exactly is the measure he\u2019s using to define the \"biggest polluting states?\" Carbon dioxide? Greenhouse gases in general? Other air pollutants? Water pollutants? We asked his press secretary, Ben Vihstadt, for data to support the claim.\nVihstadt cited a study by the Energy Information Administration, a division of the U.S. Department of Energy, that specifically looks at energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.\nThe data\nThe study that Vihstadt cited shows state-by-state data collected as recently as 2014. In his email, he softened the governor\u2019s original claim, saying instead that the study showed California and New York \"are two of the top polluting states in the country\" \u2013 not the top two.\nWith its 642 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted in 2014, Texas is head and shoulders above the rest of the country. It was responsible for 11.9 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions covered in the study. And Texas had nothing at all to do with the Climate Alliance letter.\nCalifornia, one of our subjects, comes in at No. 2 with 358 million tons, or 6.6 percent of the total. New York is No. 9 with 170 million tons, or 3.1 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy comparison, New Hampshire is 46th on this list, with a measly 15 million tons that represent less than 0.3 percent of the total.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that California and New York have been effectively reducing their carbon dioxide emissions over time, according to the EIA study. Texas\u2019s annual emissions are 14 percent higher than they were in 1990, but California and New York each emitted lower amounts of carbon dioxide in 2014 than they did in 1990. New York\u2019s 2014 emissions were 21 percent lower than the state\u2019s 2004 peak.\nSo both the states we\u2019re investigating are near the top on this scale. But we reached out to a handful of researchers and professors in environmental science who urged us to consider the question in other ways.\n\"In general, California and New York are among the largest states, so the absolute numbers will be large for them,\" said Sergey Paltsev, a senior research scientist for the MIT Energy Initiative and MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.\nBrian Soden, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Miami, suggested analyzing carbon dioxide emissions per capita or per gross domestic product to equalize population and production differences between states.\nPer capita\nThe same Energy Information Administration study also breaks down the data on a per-capita basis, as the scientists recommended.\nIn this view, California and New York \u2013 the first and third most populous states \u2013 are at the complete other end of the spectrum. Of the 51 states, including Washington, D.C., California and New York have the second and third lowest per-capita energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.\nThe EIA study notes: \"Many factors contribute to variation in the amount of emissions per capita, including climate, the structure of the state economy, population density, energy sources, building standards and explicit state policies to reduce emissions.\"\nWyoming earns its No. 1 per-capita rank by being the least populous state and the second-largest energy producer, the EIA study says.\nNew York, on the other hand, had fewer than one-tenth the carbon dioxide emissions per-capita compared with Wyoming.\n\"A large portion of the population is located in the New York City metropolitan area where mass transit is readily available and most residences are multi-family units that provide efficiencies of scale in terms of energy for heating and cooling. The New York economy is oriented towards low-energy-consuming activities such as financial markets,\" the study says, adding, \"New York's energy prices are relatively high ... which in turn encourages energy savings.\"\nIn addition to being low carbon dioxide emitters per capita, California and New York are also among the lowest carbon dioxide emitters relative to gross domestic product.\nNew Hampshire, by comparison, is the 12th lowest emitter on a per-capita basis and 11th lowest relative to GDP.\nOur ruling\nSununu said California and New York are \"the two biggest polluting states in the country.\"\nHis press secretary tried to soften the claim, but no matter how you look at it, that\u2019s not accurate. In terms of absolute carbon dioxide emissions, California and New York rank No. 2 and No. 9. Texas is No. 1.\nAdjusting for population and GDP, California and New York are actually among the most effective states at reducing their impact on the atmosphere \u2013 beating even Sununu\u2019s home state of New Hampshire.\nIt turns out, Sununu was just blowing smoke. We rate his claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03051"}
