(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nClaims about this new \"law\" have been publicized by a group called the Republic of Kanata, which describes itself as \"a new society growing up within the shell of the old. Citizens are united within a new jurisdiction in local Republican Assemblies that replace the existing Canadian government structures.\"\nRepublic of Kanata says its law \"struck down and criminalized\" all COVID-19 measures, such as those requiring masks, social distancing or quarantining. The law also encourages people to \"actively resist\" coronavirus regulations.\nAccording to a Republic of Kanata press release, \"The law was issued by the National Council of Common Law Assemblies (NCCLA), which unites more than forty such Assemblies across Canada within the jurisdiction of the Republic of Kanata.\"\nAlthough a group of people want this to be law, it is not.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group has no legal authority in Canada.
