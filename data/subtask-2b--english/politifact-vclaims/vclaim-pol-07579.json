That\u2019s an indictable offense.\"\nGiven the winner of the runoff race Tuesday will serve out former Sheriff Tom Brown\u2019s term through 2016, the AJC Truth-O-Meter jumped quickly.\nFirst, know that Mann protested in the debate that he knew of no pending ethics complaints against him. He also denied any wrongdoing.\nSo has Jones, after a special grand jury last year recommended that he be investigated on allegations of bid rigging during his eight years as CEO.\nThe question of an ethics complaint, though, is easy to answer because DeKalb has a Board of Ethics.\nState law grants the board the power to examine complaints that elected officials or county workers have violated the code of ethics \u2013 and remove them from office or fire them if allegations are deemed flagrant enough.\nDeKalb reinvigorated the board last year, amid the ongoing scandals, but the body has yet to take such drastic action on any of 18 pending complaints.\nCounty records show two of those complaints relate to Mann. On June 25, the clerk to the County Commission forwarded both complaints from Rhonda Taylor, a former Sheriff\u2019s Department employee, to the ethics board\u2019s attorney.\nTaylor complains that Mann forced her to work on his campaign and that the department\u2019s human resources director, Xernia Fortson, abused her during that work.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before Joe Biden signed an order \u201cfor all federal vehicles\u201d to be electric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar allegations surfaced last month, but no ethics complaints were filed in that case. At the time, Mann released an email he sent in March to the department. It reads in part that working on campaigns at work is prohibited.\nThe ethics board attorney, and the board itself, have yet to review Taylor\u2019s complaints, Chairman John Ernst said. That\u2019s because the board last met June 24, the day before her complaints were filed.\nProcedure calls for the board attorney to review complaints for presentation to the board during meetings, to decide whether the body has jurisdiction to investigate and act.\nIn the sheriff\u2019s case, that jurisdiction is in doubt. The board is given authority over elected commissioners, the CEO and workers, as well as appointed county board members.\nBut it is specifically excluded from oversight over the district attorney, solicitor and most court officials, such as judges and clerks from State and Superior Court.\nThe question is whether the sheriff \u2013 like the DA and judges, an elected office enshrined in the state Constitution \u2013 falls in the first or second category.\n\"The (board) attorney is expected to tell us at our meeting if we have jurisdiction,\" Ernst said.\nOnly if the board has and accepts jurisdiction at that session, scheduled for Aug. 14, would the board send Mann and Fortson notice that it plans to investigate.\nThe question of an indictment is a criminal matter that would fall to the DA\u2019s office, not the ethics board, to pursue.\nDistrict Attorney Robert James would not comment on whether his office is looking into Taylor\u2019s allegations.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that James persuaded a grand jury to indict Ellis last year on similar charges, of having county employees do campaign work on taxpayer time.\nFar more clear is the fact that at least one ethics complaint has been lodged against Mann, as Jones claims.\nAnyone can file a complaint against most elected officials and county workers in DeKalb, though.\nThere is real uncertainty about whether the county\u2019s Board of Ethics has jurisdiction over the constitutionally elected sheriff.\nSo while the statement contains a lot of literal truth, it lacks a good deal of context to fully understand how ethics complaints work.
