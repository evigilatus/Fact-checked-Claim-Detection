Scott Walker attacked for spending more on corrections than colleges", "text": "The dais was crowded at a candidates\u2019 forum attended by 12 of the Wisconsin Democrats who are running for governor in 2018.\nOne of them joked that \"there's actually another blank name tag up here, so if anybody else wants to get in the race ...\"\nBut much of the event, in Eau Claire on Dec. 11, 2017, was serious, of course.\nCandidate Kelda Helen Roys used part of her time to attack Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who is running for a third term. Roys, a former state Assembly member from Madison, accused Walker of putting prisons ahead of the University of Wisconsin System, saying:\nI think in 2011, it was Walker\u2019s first budget, and we had the dubious distinction of spending -- for the first time in our state\u2019s history -- more on our prison system that we did on the entire UW System.\nIt\u2019s a claim likely to be repeated during the campaign, so let\u2019s check it out.\nJournal Sentinel report\nWalker was elected in 2010; his first state budget was for 2011-\u201913.\nAs the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in 2012, that two-year budget allotted, for the first time, more money for prisons and correctional facilities -- that is, for the Department of Corrections -- than for the UW System.\nThe tallies, after a $250 million cut to the UW System:\n$2.25 billion: Corrections\n$2.1 billion: UW System\nThe operations of the Department of Corrections include\u00a0running 36 adult prisons and correctional facilities, supervising adult offenders who are probation or parole, and managing the state\u2019s two juvenile correctional facilities and community services for juvenile offenders.\nThe UW System has 13 four-year campuses, including the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison, 13 two-year campuses (known as the UW Colleges) and a statewide extension with offices in each county.\nThe Journal Sentinel\u2019s report, which reviewed more than 20 years of Wisconsin state budgets, pointed out that the eclipse in funding between the two agencies was the culmination of years of policy changes made under both Republican and Democratic governors prior to Walker. Also, nationwide, public universities were seeing cuts while prison spending, sparked by sentencing changes put in motion in the 1980s, was going up.\nSo, the change did occur on Walker\u2019s watch, though it was the culmination of a shift over a period of years.\nMore numbers\nFor a little more context, we reviewed all four of the state budgets that have been adopted under Walker and the four adopted previously, all of which were under Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat. The figures are from the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. (We\u2019ve indicated in bold whether the UW System or Corrections got more in each budget.)\n\n\n\n\nState budget\n\n\nUW System\n\n\nCorrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2003-\u201905\n\n\n$1.91 billion\n\n\n$1.7 billion\n\n\n\n\n2005-\u201907\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$1.93 billion\n\n\n$1.8 billion\n\n\n\n\n2007-\u201909\n\n\n$2.24 billion\n\n\n$2.17 billion\n\n\n\n\n2009-\u201911\n\n\n$2.27 billion\n\n\n$2.25 billion\n\n\n\n\n2011-\u201913 (First Walker budget)\n\n\n$2.1 billion\n\n\n$2.25 billion\n\n\n\n\n2013-\u201915\n\n\n$2.25 billion\n\n\n$2.32 billion\n\n\n\n\n2015-\u201917\n\n\n$2.08 billion\n\n\n$2.35 billion*\n\n\n\n\n2017-\u201919\n\n\n$2.14 billion\n\n\n$2.43 billion*\n\n\n\n\n*Includes what is known as youth aids funding, to be consistent with prior budgets\nThe figures show that in the four budgets before Walker, the gap in funding between the UW System and Corrections got smaller in each biennium; and since Walker, Corrections has gotten more money than the UW System.\nTo be clear, those figures are for state tax dollars only. Corrections is essentially funded entirely with state tax dollars; in contrast, the UW System gets total funding of about $12 billion per year, much of it from federal grants and tuition payments.\nOne thing that has squeezed the UW System is that, although the increases in its state funding slowed under Doyle, tuition was increased. In contrast, state funding for the UW System has remained roughly the same under Walker, but he has frozen tuition.\nA spokesman in the governor\u2019s office didn\u2019t dispute Roys\u2019 claim directly, but said that under Walker the state is now\u00a0spending more state tax dollars on higher education overall\u00a0-- including the UW System, the technical college system and other funds\u00a0--\u00a0than it did in 2011.\u00a0\nOur rating\nRoys said that in 2011 under Walker, Wisconsin for the first time spent \"more on our prison system than we did\" on the University of Wisconsin System.\nShe\u2019s correct. That occurred with Walker\u2019s first state budget, for 2011-\u201913, when he directed more state taxpayer dollars to the Department of Corrections than the UW System.\nBut the eclipse was years in the making before Walker took office, and it\u2019s worth noting that the UW System, with tuition and federal grants, has a much larger total budget than Corrections.\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.\nEditor's note: We revised this item on Jan. 12, 2018 to indicate that the governor's office did respond to our request for information. The response had been inadvertently overlooked when this fact check was first posted.
