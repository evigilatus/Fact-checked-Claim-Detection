Tim Ryan says China and India outspend U.S. on infrastructure", "text": "As the House of Representatives discussed funding the nation\u2019s energy and water development projects last month, Niles Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan waded into the debate to tout the need for investment in high-speed rail, highways, bridges, dams, ports and sewers, as a way to preserve the nation\u2019s global competitiveness.\n\n\"This is the dirty little secret here in Washington, D.C.,\" Ryan said as he wrapped up his floor speech. \"We\u2019re only spending 2 percent of our GDP on our infrastructure, while China and India are spending 10 percent of their GDP reinvesting back into their country. We will lose the future if we do not make these investments.\"\n\nPolitiFact always wants to probe Washington\u2019s dirty little secrets, so we thought we\u2019d check the numbers behind Ryan\u2019s assertion that China and India spend disproportionately more on infrastructure than the United States does.\n\nWhen we asked Ryan\u2019s office where he got his statistics, his spokesman pointed us to a pair of articles that ran earlier this year in The Economist. The first, titled \"Life in the slow lane,\" claims the United States has grown stingier with infrastructure spending since the days when it funded transcontinental railroad construction and built the interstate highway system.\n.\n\"Total public spending on transport and water infrastructure has fallen steadily since the 1960s and now stands at 2.4% of GDP,\" the article says. \"Europe, by contrast, invests 5% of GDP in its infrastructure, while China is racing into the future at 9%.\"\n\nFor data on India, Ryan\u2019s office cited a July 21 Economist piece titled \"India\u2019s economy, the half-finished revolution.\" It quotes Morgan Stanley economist Chetan Ahya predicting that India\u2019s infrastructure spending will \"still be an adequate 8% of GDP this fiscal year.\" The article goes on to say that India\u2019s government wants that share to rise to 10 percent over the next five years.\n\nThe numbers in those articles don\u2019t precisely match Ryan\u2019s, though they bolster his contention that China and India emphasize infrastructure more than the United States does. We turned to other sources to see if we could confirm Ryan\u2019s statistics on the proportion of Gross Domestic Product that each country spends on infrastructure. All the statistics that we found backed up The Economist\u2019s reporting, although we were not able to find all three countries\u2019 data for a single year, so comparisons aren\u2019t \u00a0\"apples to apples.\"\n\nTo obtain U.S. figures, we consulted the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. According to a November 2010 report titled \"Public Spending on Transportation and Water Infrastructure,\" the United States spent $356 billion, or \u00a02.4 percent of its gross domestic product, on infrastructure in 2007, the last year for which statistics were available. That matches the number cited by The Economist, and is close to the 2 percent figure that Ryan cited, though it\u2019s not \u00a0exact.\n\nFor India\u2019s statistics, we found a January 2011 report from the Indian government\u2019s Secretariat for Infrastructure, which said that the India wants investment in its physical infrastructure to reach about 9 percent of GDP by 2011-2012. Tables in the report projected the number would actually be 8.37. The report estimated that India spent nearly 8 percent of its gross domestic product on infrastructure in 2010-2011, and 7.51 percent in 2009-2010. The number was 5.71 in 2006-2007 and 6.44 percent in 2007-2008. Those numbers approximate The Economist\u2019s statistics, though they don\u2019t reach the 10 percent cited by Ryan . All exceed the 2.4 percent ratio of GDP that CBO says the U.S. spent on infrastructure in 2007.\n\nTo get statistics on China, we examined a 2009 United Nations University research paper on infrastructure spending. It says that China spent 9 percent of its GDP on infrastructure in 2006 - \u00a0the most recent year for which it had statistics - and that India spent 3.6 percent. That number echoes The Economist\u2019s data, and falls somewhat short of Ryan\u2019s 10 percent figure.\n\nRyan\u2019s makes a solid point that China and India outspend the United States on infrastructure, though he inflated the amount that Asia spends, and slightly understated the U.S. amount. But his exaggeration wasn\u2019t enough to push him statement into false territory, so we rate his statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcy Kaptur\n\n\nstated on October 25, 2010 in testimony given at a public hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectric utility FirstEnergy's annual revenues are greater \"than the GDP of Haiti, Kyrgyzstan, Iceland, or 15 African nations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Sabrina Eaton \u2022 November 10, 2010", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12599"}
