Scott Walker was the first top-tier Republican contender to release a plan to replace Obamacare and has chastised GOP members of Congress who ran on repealing the Affordable Care Act only to delay a vote this year.\nHis comments included areas that are still relevant to the debate.\nFor example, in a Sept. 1, 2015 interview, CNBC Chief Washington Correspondent John Harwood pressed Walker \u00a0on what he would do as president if he couldn\u2019t garner enough votes to repeal Obamacare.\n\"What are you going to say when you\u2019re president of the United States and you can\u2019t get 60 votes in the Senate to repeal Obamacare and it\u2019s too hard and your people say \u2018Hey, Scott Walker you said you were gonna get rid of Obamacare\u2019?\"\n\"We are going to do it,\" Walker replied.\nThen he followed up with a claim worthy of the Truth-O-Meter:\n\"Day One, I\u2019m going to sign an executive order that gets rid of the special carve out that President Obama gave to the Congress that doesn\u2019t require them to abide by the same rules that all of the other Americans do in terms of Obamacare.\"\n(Walker made a similar pledge in the Sept. 16 presidential debate, days before he dropped out of the race.)\nSo, are member of Congress playing by different rules?\nCongress and Obamacare\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, suggested back in 2009 that members of Congress experience the effects of the Affordable Care Act and be put in the same position as other Americans.\nHe proposed an amendment, which was accepted by the Senate Finance Committee, that required members of Congress and their staffs to obtain health insurance through the exchanges established by the legislation.\nHere\u2019s what the law said:\n\"Notwithstanding any other provision of law \u2026 the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are -- (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act).\"\nSo, in a way, Congress does play by different rules -- but not in the way Walker suggests. They are required to use the Obamacare marketplaces while no one else is.\nMembers of Congress and their staffs were previously insured through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, which offers a range of plans with similar subsidies for premiums that nearly all large employers in the United States provide. That is, employees and their employers share in the cost.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe switch to using the Affordable Care Act exchanges was scheduled for 2014.\nBut vague language in the law left confusion about government (as the employer) contributions to health care plans.\nIf members of Congress, along with their staffs, used the exchanges, they would no longer receive any assistance in paying for health care.\nWhat\u2019s more, the salaries of staffers were too high to receive any level of the subsidies available to people in the insurance exchanges. So, congressional staffers would have paid full health care premiums out of pocket -- and Obamacare did not say employees were mandated to lose such benefits.\nWhat came next\nThe health care reforms also established a marketplace for small businesses to sponsor health care coverage for their employees.\nIn order to maintain the employer-sponsored coverage for Congress members and staffers, it was determined that the exchanges for small businesses would be a better fit.\nThis led to some asserting that Congress was exempt from Obamacare.\nIn August 2013, PolitiFact National rated False a claim by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that \"President Obama just granted all of Congress an exception\" to Obamacare. The claim was included in PolitiFact\u2019s list of the Top 16 myths about the health care law.\nWalker used similar logic in his claim that Obamacare doesn\u2019t require members of Congress \"to abide by the same rules that all of the other Americans do.\"\nWalker\u2019s team called the move to allow members of Congress and Congressional staffers to get care through the small business exchange \"legal gymnastics.\"\nBut Congressional offices do act like small businesses in many respects.\nMark Peterson, a professor of public policy at UCLA\u2019s Luskin School of Public Affairs, said the parallel between small businesses and congressional offices became the foundation for allowing Congress and staffers to use the small business exchanges.\n\"Yes, those employed by them are federal employees,\" Peterson said. \"But unlike non-congressional employees, they are hired and fired by their sole boss -- the senator or representative -- not the government per se.\"\nThe law says businesses with fewer than 100 employees are eligible to use the exchange. Beginning in 2017, states can also allow large businesses to also use those marketplaces.\nOur rating\nWalker said Obamacare doesn\u2019t require members of Congress \"to abide by the same rules that all of the other Americans do.\"\nMembers of Congress and their staffs use the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act just like their constituents would.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05924"}
