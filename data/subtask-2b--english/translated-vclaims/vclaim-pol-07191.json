It began when the Republican challenger Tom Thelis issued a television announcement accusing the current X, Kai Hagan, of the loss of major meetings of the Senate Armed Services Committee on terrorism. Then Hagan answered that Teal'c was too vague about how to respond to ISIS. One of Hagen's statements in October 3 said that Teal'c \"He's twitched and rugged,\" when he asked him how he'd respond, and he refused to say what we had to do to fight ISIS. We have already considered whether Hagen has missed the meetings of the Committee; we have assessed the Teal &apos; s statement as often correct. Here, we wanted to take a closer look at Teal'c's statements about his position on how to eliminate ISIS. We found Teal'c, spokesman for North Carolina House, who provided some details on how he responded. In his first discussion with Hagan, when asked whether the United States should \"batter ISIS in Syria,\" Telis said, \"I believe that the United States needs to take all measures to protect American citizens, and to protect freedom-loving people throughout the country.\" \"When asked whether the United States should launch air strikes against the Islamic State in Syria in the wake of the beheading of American journalists, Hagan or Teal'is did not respond directly to the question of yes or no.\" 10 September, air strikes continued: in a press statement, Teillis said: \"We need a strategy to destroy ISIL, and now is not the time to delete words. ISIS is an evil and dangerous terrorist organization that has proved to kill innocent Americans, and we need to continue air strikes until the President makes sure that the enemies of ISIS in the region will take them down on the ground. No option should be left out of the table.\" September 16th, open to options, but concerned about the arming of the rebels: The spokesman for the Teles Daniel Killin told Charlotte's observer that Teal'is believed that \"no options should be left to protect our national security.\" He added: \"Even the President was against their arming (Syrian rebels) a year ago, partly because of the risk that American weapons would end up in the hands of terrorists. This concern is still being felt today by garlic, who does not want American weapons to end up in the hands of ISIS terrorists.\" 18 September, vague about the arming of Syrian rebels: at a campaign event in Fayetteville, N.S., Thelis refused to say whether he was supporting the arming of Syrian rebels. \"We must know who these people are and if they go anywhere they don't get into unfriendly hands,\" Tillis said. \"I'm not convinced that these are what they call unfriendly rebels. There's a civil war going on there, and a lot of things to think about.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" :: By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, September 25, he remains uncertain about the arming of Syrian rebels: in a telephone interview with Rally News and an observer, Thelis said he was not sure what he thought was the best course of action with regard to arming Syrian rebels. \"In fact I don't know if it should or shouldn't,\" Tillis said. \"I must know that these weapons will not reach the hands of people who want to control the Middle East.\" 29 September, all the options on the table: in a statement on a new television announcement, Thelis said: \"As I support keeping all the options open for the total destruction of ISIS, President and Kai Hagan remain unstrategic and continue to drive from behind,\" Teal'is said. 30 September, still unclear: In an interview with Fox News.com on 30 September, Thelis reiterated that the destruction of ISIS was the ultimate goal, but did not give any indication of how this would be achieved. \"Anything less than a strategy calling for the total elimination of ISIS and any emerging threats is unacceptable,\" Tillis said. The Fox News article added that \"Tillis was unclear when he asked what he would do in Hagan's position. He merely said that his decision would be based on what the military officials had told him and that, as a \"private citizen,\" he could not comment on what he would do or how he would vote. Our Governor Hagen said that Teal'c refused to say what we had to do to fight ISIS. We have reviewed the general statements made by Thelis on this issue and found that little detail has been provided. The majority of his remarks do not indicate what action he will take to respond to the ISIS threat. More specifically, he supported the continuation of air strikes on ISIS in Syria, but later expanded to say that he supported all options. While he once said that the arming of Syrian rebels was reckless, he later said that all options were on the table. We appreciate that Hagan's statement is mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07191"}
