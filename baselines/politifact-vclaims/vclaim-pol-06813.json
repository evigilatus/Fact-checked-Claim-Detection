One of the metrics he used to make this claim was unemployment rate.\nDuring his address, Obama said that \"our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.\"\nWe decided to check whether that\u2019s correct.\nThe most recent\u00a0reported monthly unemployment rate was 5.6 percent for December 2014. The last time it was that low was in June 2008, when it was also 5.6 percent.\nThe financial crisis occurred after June 2008 -- it\u2019s generally dated to the implosion of the Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers in September 2008. So Obama clearly has a point.\nThat said, there are a few caveats.\nFirst, while we have no quarrel with Obama using the most basic version of the unemployment rate, it\u2019s worth mentioning that there\u2019s another version of the unemployment rate, known as U-6, that isn\u2019t as favorable to the president\u2019s case.\nThe U-6 statistic tries to capture a broader picture of labor-market weakness than the more familiar unemployment rate. It takes into account not just people who are unemployed but also people working part-time who would rather have full-time work, as well as people who have stopped looking for work but would begin to look again if labor-market conditions improved. Because it includes these additional factors, the U-6 rate tends to track the official unemployment rate but is usually a few points higher.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it happens, the U-6 rate -- unlike the more basic unemployment rate -- hasn\u2019t returned to its pre-financial-crisis level. The December 2014 U-6 rate was 11.2 percent, which is higher than the 11 percent rate in September 2008 and the 10.8 percent rate one month earlier in August 2008.\nSecond, while economists cheer the clear improvement in the basic unemployment rate, they also fret that a portion of that improvement stems from Americans leaving the labor market rather than finding jobs after experiencing joblessness. (The unemployment rate can improve either if someone goes back to work, or if they leave the labor market entirely.)\nA way to measure this is by looking at a statistic called the labor force participation rate, which measures the number of people in the labor force divided by the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The labor force shrinks whenever someone retires, voluntarily gives up working (such as when they become a full-time parent or go back to school full-time) or because they simply give up hope of finding a job.\nThe labor force participation rate has decreased markedly since 2008. In September 2008, it stood at 66.0 percent, but that fell to 62.7 percent by December 2014, the most recent month available. It\u2019s now at its lowest point since the late 1970s, a time when fewer women were working.\nPart of this is explained by the retirement of the large Baby Boom generation, but not all -- and the trendline worries many economists. So Obama has justification for celebrating the unemployment rate\u2019s decline, but it\u2019s worth remembering that that\u2019s not the only important labor-market statistic out there.\nOur ruling\nObama said \"our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.\" He\u2019s correct when using the basic unemployment rate -- the most commonly cited figure -- but it\u2019s worth noting that other measures of the labor market are not quite so rosy. The unemployment rate may be dropping, if only in part, because people have stopped looking for work.\nThe statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06813"}
