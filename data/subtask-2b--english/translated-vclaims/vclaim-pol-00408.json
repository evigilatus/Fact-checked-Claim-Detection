He says the U.S. lost 30% of its car work to its south neighbor. He said it on CNC. He said it on Twitter in May and again in June. He returned during his last visit to Wisconsin. \"Mexico, they took 30% of our jobs in cars, and I don't know if you know it or not,\" said Trump in a speech on June 12, 2019 in Dirko Aerospace where he replaced the pending agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada on trade. Trump said, \"They have plants you've never seen before.\" \"They took 30% - perhaps more - of our cars (our work). I don't blame them. I don't blame anyone. I blame our former leaders.\" Trump has led to a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA since he took office. Both countries have now approved a new charter, although it faces obstacles in Congress, particularly in the Democrat-dominated House of Representatives. But did the recent business environment really create 30% of Trump's swinging vehicle claims? The definition of claim given by Trump to 30% was somewhat vague in Wisconsin, referring only to \"self-employment.\" The White House did not respond to requests for clarification of the claim or to provide supporting evidence. However, on June 10, 2011, the Tramp reference to CBBC was more specific. \"They took 30% of our car companies,\" said Trump on the Squa Wake Box. \"Move to Mexico. Everybody's been fired. They will all retreat if they have to pay a 25% or tariff tax.\" So we'll start checking the facts there. No car production in the United States is closed for Mexico's Car Research Centre, an independent research group that gets some funding from car manufacturers, says no manufacturers left the United States for Mexico as described by Trump to NCBC. \"There are no cases that I can call where the automobile manufacturer shut down a factory in the United States, moved that work, opened a new factory in Mexico, and you can definitely call it an alternative,\" said Bernard Soysky, Assistant Director of the Industry and Economics Group at the Center. He said that shifts in production were \"almost impossible\" to track anyway, since car manufacturers regularly moved production between factories based on available energy. Soysky said that the major car manufacturers treat their American, Mexican and Canadian operations as one unit and move the vehicles around that print as they please. For example, Ford announced that she was transporting Ford Fox production from Michigan to Mexico (although later transferred to China instead), a movement that was exploded by Trump. But the Michigan factory wasn't closed, but it was producing new lines of guard and Bronco. The focus has now stopped. Soysky said: \"In fact, this factory made a great deal of time because it moved from one medium product to very successful producers.\" Although United States automobile manufacturers have not moved a direct operation to Mexico, it is clear that the industry prefers our southern neighbour when it comes to new plants. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u25cf January 26, 2012, of the 13 assembly plants declared in North America since 2009, 9 went to Mexico and only 4 to the United States, as Suski said. However, a broader measure of car-manufacturing expenditure shows that the United States retains its own strength. From 2012 to June, car manufacturers announced investments of $92 billion in North America, according to the Automobile Research Centre. The company traces announcements of new stations and infrastructure expansion and improvement processes (purchases are not included). The United States received 74 per cent of these investments, Mexico 19 per cent and Canada 7 per cent. No such investments have been announced in Mexico since 2017. The Mexican automobile industry has grown through other measures, so Trump's 30 per cent claim is limited if we focus on the CNBC version that refers to physical movement. But is there any element of car business that has experienced such a shift? We compared the two countries with respect to car sales, production and employment. Sales. The total sales of new passenger vehicles and light trucks were reported to be about $17.2 million in the United States in 2018. According to the United States Department of Commerce, Mexico exported about 2.7 million such cars to the United States, which means that Mexican production accounts for about 15% of United States sales. This number increased from about 12 percent five years ago. Our Associated Press colleagues relied on Mexican import data on June 11, 2019, checking the facts that Trump's 30% Twitter and CNBC claims were \"uncorrect.\" Production. Mexico has nearly doubled its car production in recent decades, from an average of about 1 million cars per year in the early 2000s to nearly 2 million in the past several years, according to the International Organization of Car Manufacturers. At the same time, United States annual production declined from about 5 million in the early 2000s to about 3 million in the past two years. If car production is combined in the United States and Mexico, Mexico accounted for 19% of this total in 2000 but now 36%. Employment. Both countries have experienced significant gains in the number of vehicle and spare parts manufacturing jobs in recent years. Since 2009, Mexico has increased from about 400,000 jobs in the automobile industry to over 800,000, according to Mexico Now, a commercial magazine. In the same period, the number of car jobs in the United States rose from about 650,000 in 2009 to about 1 million this year, according to the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics. The bulk of Mexican production is concentrated on parts. Soysky said that about 16 percent of the parts used by car manufacturers at U.S. assembly plants come from Mexico. The Governor Trump said that Mexico had taken 30% of our car business. Experts say that there is no single example of an automatic manufacturer shutting down a factory in the United States to open a factory in Mexico, which is much less so than a total of 30% of anything. The cars built by Mexico still account for only 15% of sales in the United States. It is worth noting that car production has declined in the United States while it has increased in Mexico in recent years, and that Mexico has landed in most of the new vehicle stations built in North America in the last decade. However, neither of these trends is consistent with the description of Trump in the more detailed NCBC claim, from closed plants and workers left in the United States as work moved to Mexico. We appreciate Trump's claim that it was wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00408"}
