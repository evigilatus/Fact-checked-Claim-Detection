Scott Walker's message that \"Wisconsin returns\" after the Great Recession. The Burke allies repeat this allegation. For example, from a Burke campaign television site that first aired in July 2014: \"It's Walker's agency that has granted tax exemptions to millions of companies that have moved jobs abroad. Another cause of the death of Wisconsin was the last time in career growth in the Middle West.\" The television spots are said to be run through a list of nine states before settling in Wisconsin at the bottom: North Dakota, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois. With a new announcement by Walker TV that we're in the Midwest in job growth, we thought it was time to consider both allegations. In both cases, as with many allegations in a campaign that any nerd would like in numbers, the assessment depends on two things: the time frame and the measuring stick. In the Burke Declaration, the novelist at the site does not mention what time frame was analyzed. However, the accurate edition of the Declaration refers to the data collected for the quarterly employment and wage census. The footnote states that the announcement compares the fourth quarter of 2010 -- the last before Walker took office -- to the fourth quarter of 2013. This remains the most recent quarterly data available. These data, reported by the United States Office of Labour Statistics, are the most comprehensive and credible data on employment trends. It is based on a census of 96 per cent of all non-agricultural American employers. Our examination of the three-year period mentioned by Burke shows the state of Wisconsin 10 of the 10 states -- \"The Last Dead\" -- right under Illinois when it comes to growth in private sector jobs. \"The low job growth in Wisconsin was offset by very low income growth and low levels of consumer spending,\" said the labour economist at Wisconsin-Milwake John Heywood University. \"The state was slower than its peers in recovering from stagnation.\" At the national level, Skinson is ranked 35th. This is the regional picture: State and West Central ranking in percentage of job growth, December 2010-December 2013 Northern Dakota 21.90% 1 2. Michigan 8.71% Indiana 6.8% 14% (Minnesota) 6,29% Nebraska 5.71 per cent On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski said: \"Not all women lost their jobs (in the December Job Report), most of them black and Latin women. \u2022 15 January, 2021 25 7. (South Dakota) 5.28% (Iowa) 5.20 percent of the 9.28 percent. == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man Wisconsin is 4.04% of the 35 Burke ranking states with a growth rate. This is what economists prefer for country-by-state comparisons because it shows performance regardless of the population of the State. By another measure -- an initial number of jobs created -- Wisconsin ranked sixth out of 10 states, we found. There are two statistical points to be considered. More importantly, the definition of \"Meadowest\" Both Burke and Walker use the 10 states we mentioned. There is a good case for this: the regional office of the Middle West Labour Statistics Office covers these 10 states. We found other cases where the Agency is adding Missouri and Kansas to the Middle West mix, for a total of 12 states. In that larger group, Wisconsin ends 11 out of 12, before Missouri. Previously we'd classified half of Burke's claim in January 2014 that Wisconsin was the last time in the Midwest. The numbers worked, but we made a mistake, Burke, mainly because of a very narrow comparison. She said the Midwest, but she only looked at the four neighboring states of Wisconsin. We noted that at that time, before the 2013 figures were completed, the growth rates in Ohio, Nebraska (of the Group of Ten) and Missouri (of the broader BLS group of 12) were slower than those in Wisconsin. Finally, since the reporting of quarterly job data is very comprehensive, it is delayed by at least six months, which means that the picture may be somewhat outdated when it comes out. The following quarterly post numbers, covering the first quarter of 2014, are scheduled to be issued in mid-September. More recent employment data are available from the monthly surveys of current employment statistics, but are based on a sample of only 3 per cent of employers. These figures are subject to large margins of error but are also a widely reported source of job trends. Walker called the quarterly \"Golden Standard,\" and criticized the monthly data. But he mentioned monthly data, and he did so in his new announcement. Burke used both at different times, too. In fact, she was using unreliable monthly data when we evaluated them earlier than the worst in Midwest. Our assessment of Mary Burke claims that Wisconsin was the last dead in the Midwest. In the new version of this claim, the most accurate job data are used for the longest period of the Walker era with which they can be analysed. And Wisconsin puts the background. However, due to the lateness of the time, it does not reflect current trends. We're assessing the claim right. The broken jobs claim that voters will hear a lot of job applications before the November 4 election. Here are five tips to separate the truth from fiction -- and publicity from physical evidence -- when it comes to the candidates and the numbers they use. Check the time frame: If the statement covers a short period, it can be a red flag of cherry selection data to find a good outcome. A longer time frame may be used to mask more recent changes. Check the data source: quarterly job numbers are more accurate than monthly, but also more outdated. There can be greater uncertainty about the recent announcement of monthly figures, as they are subject to revisions. Raw figures or percentages? If the claim is that the State will add more functions than State Y, the statement may have limited information value. Find growth figures for percentages that achieve equal opportunities among states of different sizes. Check the map: When the claim is \"best in the area,\" trust but verification. Are all relevant States covered? Audit of the sector: Most allegations focus only on the private sector, but sometimes biaseds will be added to public officials if they are appropriate for their purpose.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07366"}
