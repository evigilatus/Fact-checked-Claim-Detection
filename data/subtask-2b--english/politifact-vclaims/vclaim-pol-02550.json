Phil Berger, the Senate leader, and Tim Moore, the state House speaker, the state\u2019s top Democrats are standing in the way of the state serving justice to the prison employees who died in the October attacks.\nCapital punishment is on the law books in North Carolina and Berger says there are currently 143 inmates on death row. However, there hasn\u2019t been an execution since 2006.\nBerger and Moore contend that\u2019s because Gov. Roy Cooper, the former attorney general, and Josh Stein, who was elected attorney general in 2016, have failed to take legal action to counter court cases that are blocking executions. They released a joint statement on Dec. 8.\nBerger, specifically, was quoted as saying: \"For over a decade, death penalty opponents like Roy Cooper and Josh Stein have imposed a de-facto moratorium on capital punishment in North Carolina, using every legal trick possible \u2013 including inaction \u2013 to delay death sentences handed down by juries and deny justice to victims.\"\nHe continued: \"No matter what they say, Cooper\u2019s and Stein\u2019s indifference and failure to fight the moratorium endangers the lives of prison employees in close proximity to hardened murderers with nothing left to lose, who see no possibility they will face execution for killing again.\"\nDo Cooper and Stein oppose the death penalty? Are they using the legal system to block executions, as Berger and Moore imply?\nWhat\u2019s the holdup?\nThe last execution in North Carolina, in 2006, put to death Samuel Flippen, a 36-year-old who was convicted in the beating death of his 2-year-old stepdaughter 12 years prior to his execution.\nSince then, North Carolina has been one of several states that\u2019s in a holding pattern while the courts consider legal arguments against death penalty practices. Raleigh-based television station WRAL reported last year that that North Carolina is \"caught in morass of various state and federal court rulings.\"\nOne legal challenge relates to the protocol for lethal injections and whether they\u2019re cruel and unusual. While that lawsuit makes its way through the courts, Wake County Superior Court Judge Donald Stephens in 2014 blocked the use of lethal injection in the state. Stephens later retired, and the case remains unresolved.\n\"That litigation is in the trial court and the injunction remains in place until the Court approves a new protocol and all appeals are exhausted,\" said Laura Brewer, a Stein spokeswoman.\nThe other legal challenges stem from the Racial Justice Act, a short-lived law that allowed inmates to use local and statewide statistics in claims that racial bias played a role in their cases. The act was adopted in 2009, largely along party lines, and was rewritten in 2012 and then repealed in 2013 after Republicans won majorities in the General Assembly.\nSome of the cases are in active litigation, Brewer said. \"Some have been fully briefed by the parties (including by the AG\u2019s office for the State) and are awaiting argument at the North Carolina Supreme Court,\" she wrote in an email. \"The Supreme Court has not set an argument date.\"\nWhat Cooper, Stein say\nCooper served as attorney general for 16 years, from 2001 to 2016. We contacted Cooper\u2019s office about his stance on the death penalty. Despite the fact that much of his party\u2019s base opposes the death penalty, Cooper spokeswoman Noelle Talley pointed to his record as proof he supports it.\n\"As Attorney General, Gov. Cooper did his duty to uphold capital punishment sentences handed down by juries in accordance with the law, and 27 executions were carried out in North Carolina during his time as AG before court orders prevented executions,\" Talley wrote in an email.\nShe provided a link to the online list of the executions provided on the N.C. Department of Public Safety website.\nStein was elected last year and he doesn\u2019t have much of a record with death penalty cases, so we looked through news reports to see what he said on the campaign trail last year. Stein told WRAL in August 2016 that he backs the death penalty.\n\"I support the death penalty because I believe that certain crimes are so heinous that it is the appropriate punishment,\" Stein said. But he emphasized that \"the state needs to take care to avoid racial bias that has contributed to a de facto moratorium (on executions) in the state.\"\nStein took the same position during a debate in Asheboro last September, The News & Observer reported.\nTo conclude the first part of our fact check, Cooper has a record of enforcing the death penalty and Stein is on the record supporting it \u2013 despite the fact that it\u2019s unpopular with many Democrats. So at this point, it would seem like a stretch to describe them as death penalty opponents.\nBut what have they done?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBerger and Moore\u2019s statement suggests that Cooper and Stein have used their powers to further prolong the moratorium. Berger said Cooper and Stein used \"every trick possible\" to impose the moratorium.\nBrewer, Stein\u2019s spokeswoman, said the attorney general\u2019s office has opposed claims by Racial Justice Act defendants.\n\"Stein and then-Attorney General Cooper have made numerous pleadings on the state\u2019s behalf in these cases opposing the claims\" regarding both the Racial Justice Act and the lethal injection case.\n\"Neither Attorney General Stein nor then-Attorney General Cooper have filed pleadings supporting the claims,\" she said.\nAnd a WRAL story from 2007 quotes attorneys for Cooper, then the attorney general, arguing against attempts to block executions until the state resolved a case related to the presence of physicians at executions.\nCooper and Stein didn\u2019t file the lawsuits delaying executions or take the side of those who did. Have they used other, more subtle legal strategies for keeping the cases stuck in court?\n\u2018Not the roadblock\u2019\nTwo death penalty opponents said they\u2019re unaware of any action Cooper has taken at any point in his career to block executions.\nKristin Collins, associate director of public information at the Durham-based Center for Death Penalty Litigation, described Cooper as \"very aggressive in capital prosecutions\" when he was attorney general.\nCollins added that Cooper \"certainly opposed the stay when it was requested by the inmates\" in the cases that have halted executions. And with the Racial Justice Act, \"the attorney general is the only one actively involved in these lawsuits and they\u2019ve done nothing besides fight for the case of the state, which argues that these death sentences should be carried out.\"\nJames Coleman, a Duke University professor and director of the Center for Criminal Justice and Professional Responsibility, said neither Cooper nor Stein is in a position now to affect the outcome of the legal challenges.\n\"We\u2019re not at a place where the governor or attorney general could do anything even if they wanted to resume executions,\" Coleman said. \"They\u2019re not the roadblock.\"\nBob Orr, who served from 1995 to 2004 as a justice on the N.C. Supreme Court, said he\u2019s not familiar with Stein\u2019s position but said Cooper\u2019s staff fought to uphold the law.\n\"I was on the Supreme Court for 10 years. A number of executions took place. We handled a substantial number of death penalty appeals. It\u2019s the singular most difficult part of the job,\" Orr said.\n\"I never heard (Cooper) say that he\u2019s personally opposed to the death penalty and certainly members of his staff aggressively opposed appeals (of executions),\" Orr said.\nA \u2018back-door attempt\u2019\nPolitiFact asked Berger\u2019s office for proof that Cooper and Stein prolonged court reviews of the legal challenges.\nThey provided none. On the day we emailed to say we\u2019d found no evidence of Cooper or Stein supporting challenges to the court cases, Berger and Moore released a new statement once again criticizing Cooper and Stein for their inaction.\nAuth, Berger\u2019s spokesperson, also followed up with an email to PolitiFact. She said Cooper and Stein could use the attorney general\u2019s office to fight injunctions against state laws. She also argued that Stein, in 2009 as a state senator, contributed to the execution stoppage by voting for the Racial Justice Act.\nSupporters of the act said it was needed because statistics showed the death penalty was used disproportionately against black defendants. A Michigan State University study of capital cases in North Carolina between 1990 and 2010 shows that qualified black jurors were more than twice as likely as whites to be removed from juries by prosecutors.\nMany Republicans viewed the legislation as a \"back-door attempt to get rid of the death penalty,\" as former state Sen. Thom Goolsby said at the time. Goolsby later led the repeal of the act.\nFormer state Rep. Paul \"Skip\" Stam of Apex, an attorney, echoed that sentiment.\n\"Any knowledgeable public lawyer would have realized that the RJA would be an indefinite moratorium on the death penalty for first degree murderers,\" Stam said in a recent email.\n\"By 2012, it was clear as the nose on your face that the RJA was an indefinite moratorium on the death penalty and irrational to boot (all the white murderers on death row claimed racial discrimination and filed petitions to stop their executions - so far successfully),\" Stam continued. \"And yet, Sen. Josh Stein voted against the 2012 legislation to effectively do away with these aspects of the RJA.\"\nOur ruling\nIn the Dec. 8 joint statement with Moore, Berger said Cooper and Stein oppose the death penalty and have used \"every legal trick possible \u2013 including inaction \u2013 to delay death sentences.\" Berger\u2019s office provided no evidence showing that Cooper and Stein have sided with death penalty opponents in court. Rather, Berger pointed to Stein\u2019s vote on one bill and, in a vague claim, said the duo should\u2019ve pressured the courts to expedite their review of death penalty cases.\nIt\u2019s fair to criticize how Cooper and Stein spend their resources and tie Stein to the Racial Justice Act. But those arguments alone don\u2019t prove that they oppose the death penalty or have used legal \"tricks\" to delay executions.
