When you send a car to China from the U.S., there's a tariff you have to pay 25%, \"Trump tweeted 9 April. \"Does this look like free or fair trade? - No, it sounds like a stupid business. - It's been going on for years!\" When a car is sent from China to the United States, a tariff of 2/1/2 per cent is paid. When you send a car to China from the United States, there's a tariff you have to pay 25%. Does this look like a free or fair trade? No, it appears that Stubble Trading Company - continuing for years - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 9 April 2018 Trump corresponds to international trade data. But economists raised some important details that Trump deleted from his tweet, which put his claim in a slightly different light. The Trump numbers are correct, the Trump numbers are derived from the trade data of the United States and Chinese Government. Indeed, the US pays a 25 per cent tariff on cars sent to China, while China pays only 2.5 per cent on cars coming to the US. So the numerical portion of Trump's claim is true. But the experts said his statement was out of context. China accounts for a relatively small share of United States car imports at the outset, and it exports very few cars to the United States. China accounted for about 3 of every 10,000 cars sold in the United States last year, according to Michael Hicks, Director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Paul State University. \"For every car we import from China, we export six to China. None of these Chinese-produced cars are branded by a Chinese company (mostly Volvo), \" said Hicks. \"Our automobile industry works unusually well in China, while the production of Chinese cars limps along.\" To illustrate China &apos; s relatively low share of car exports to the United States, Chad Pawn, a senior colleague at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, referred to data on United States imports from Mexico and Canada. Under NAFTA, no tariffs are imposed by the United States, Mexico and Canada. Here we look at China side by side, and the United States trading partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA): the distinguished fact-checkers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Trump Rebel Act - General Flynn's appointment as Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman, January 11, 2012, \"China exports very few cars to the United States. So Trump's tweet is again some kind of red herring,\" said Brown, who noticed a similar discrepancy when comparing Chinese car exports to the European Union, Japan or South Korea. Choosing cherry? Some experts pointed out that Trump chose facts with \"cars\" rather than with a broader category of cars or parts of cars. For example, the United States tariff on light trucks from China is 25 percent. This import fee is an old tariff dating from a trade dispute in the 1960s between the United States and several European countries, according to Gary Bertellis, a senior colleague of the Brookings Institution. \"So by choosing \"cars\" rather than \"cars\" in his Twitter example, Trump picks up cherry products and doesn't tell the whole story,\" Ben said, from the Peterson Institute. Gary Hoffbauer, a colleague at the Peterson Institute, observed that Chinese definitions of U.S. car parts sent to China were well below 25 percent. For example, China has a 10% tariff on motor cars. This is important because \"US companies often ship car parts to China to gather there,\" added Hoffman. Hicks, from the Paul State University, noted that trade inequality stems in part from the Trump decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama deal to reduce trade barriers among 10 countries. \"So, if it wasn't TPP killing, whatever tariff distortions now exist could have been reduced,\" said Hicks. Our Governor Trump said, \"When you send a car to the United States from China, there's a tariff you have to pay 2/1/2%. When you send a car to China from the United States, there's a 25% tariff.\" The figures in the Trump statement are supported by United States and Chinese government trade data. However, Tramp's tweet ignored that China accounted for a relatively small share of automobile imports in the United States in general, and that he did not tell the whole story by singularizing cars rather than a broader category of related imports. One expert said that Trump &apos; s trade policies had contributed to the disparity in vehicle import tariffs. We're assessing this mostly right.
