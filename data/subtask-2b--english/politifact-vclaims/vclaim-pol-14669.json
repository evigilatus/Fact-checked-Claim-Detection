But is baseball\u2019s professional lineage so clearly rooted in the Buckeyes State? It was time to take a 7th inning stretch from serious politics and see if this claim was a hit or an error.\n\nIn a timeline for his acclaimed documentary on baseball, filmmaker Ken Burns asserts that the first professional baseball team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869, which finished its tour of the National Association of Base Ball Players matches with a sparkling 70-0 record.\n\nAn open and shut case? Not so fast.\n\nA history of the Red Stockings compiled by the Society for Cincinnati Sports Research suggests that the club\u2019s secretary John Joyce knew that \"all the top Eastern clubs were paying their star players\" but not admitting it when he set out in 1869 to pursue a team of the best players at every position. Clearly, there were professional baseball players prior to the Red Stockings season of 1869.\n\nGabriel Schecter, a researcher at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, said the key is that the Red Stockings were the first all-professional team where the players were openly paid \u2014 payroll records tally $9,400 for 10 players.\n\n\"That\u2019s the distinction that has to be made,\" Schecter said. \"Prior to the Red Stockings, there were players here or there who were paid or who were given jobs, but it wasn\u2019t a full team being paid above board.\"\n\nFor example, a powerhouse team from Washington that toured in the late 1860s prior to the Red Stockings turning pro was stocked with players on the federal payroll.\n\n\"All or most of the players had those jobs that basically subsidized them so they could play ball,\" he said. \"The question is how much work those federal employees actually were doing,\" he said.\n\nA timeless question no doubt, but it probably doesn\u2019t equate to professional in the sense we use it today. Still, was it possible that an entire team of players was being paid under the table prior to the Red Stockings?\n\n\"I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m 100 percent sure,\" Schecter said. \"I think that\u2019s very unlikely because it would have been uncovered by now.\"\n\nBecause it appears that no other team fielded a lineup of fully-professional players prior to the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869, we rule this claim to be True. If only all the calls made on the diamond were so clear-cut.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSherrod Brown\n\n\nstated on August 4, 2011 in an appearance on MSNBC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rooting for the Red Sox is like rooting for the drug companies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Feran \u2022 August 29, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14669"}
