Sometimes they just shout their corrections in real time.\nThis happened on March 13, during remarks on the steps of the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C.\nIt came when Kevin Downing, the attorney for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, addressed reporters and onlookers moments after his client had been sentenced by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson to an additional 43 months in prison for illegal lobbying and hiding the proceeds.\nThe sentencing by Jackson was Manafort\u2019s second in just a few days. U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis earlier handed down a 47-month sentence in a separate case tried in Virginia.\nIn his remarks outside the D.C. courthouse, Downing said, \"Judge Jackson conceded that there was absolutely no evidence of any Russian collusion in this case. So that makes two courts. Two courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with any Russians.\"\nObservers on the scene were having none of it.\n\"That\u2019s not what she said!\" said someone as Downing continued speaking. \"You guys aren\u2019t lawyers, man, you\u2019re liars!\"\nWow -- Manafort's attorney, Kevin Downing, is shouted down outside the courthouse after he falsely claims \"2 courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with any Russians.\"\"Liar! That's not what she said!\" someone yells. pic.twitter.com/gGqdrP2ihJ\u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 13, 2019\n\nReally?\nWe found that the hecklers were correct in saying that Downing misquoted and misinterpreted the judge\u2019s words. (We reached out to Downing but didn\u2019t hear back.)\nThe Jackson sentencing\nFirst, some background on why \"no collusion\" is an important point.\nOne of the biggest arguments President Donald Trump has made in defending himself against investigations by Special Counsel Robert Mueller is that there was \"no collusion\" between the Trump campaign and agents of Russia.\nTrump offered the \"no collusion\" mantra on Twitter 71 times through March 13. The Washington Post counted 226 times Trump had used the phrase in any context through March 8.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Donald Trump says collusion is not a crime. That\u2019s not right\nIf Trump could get a federal judge \u2014 or two \u2014 to give their imprimatur to that assertion, it would be a persuasive talking point.\nBut that\u2019s not what Jackson said. (We are awaiting an official court transcript of her remarks from the bench; until then, we\u2019re relying on media accounts of what she said.)\nIn her remarks from the bench, Jackson made a point of pushing back against the \"no collusion\" argument she read in the defense\u2019s sentencing memorandum.\n\"The \u2018no collusion\u2019 refrain that runs through the entire defense memorandum is unrelated to the matter at hand,\" she said, adding, \"The \u2018no collusion\u2019 mantra is simply a non sequitur.\"\nShe also said, \"The \u2018no collusion\u2019 mantra is also not accurate, because the investigation is still ongoing.\"\nSo, contrary to Downing\u2019s remarks, Jackson didn\u2019t give Manafort a clean bill of health on alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Instead, she said it wasn\u2019t at issue in the cases that reached her courtroom.\nTwo courts?\nSo what about Downing\u2019s assertion that another court had also given its stamp of approval to the \"no collusion\" argument? That\u2019s incorrect, too.\nHe was presumably referring to the earlier sentencing by Ellis in the Virginia case. In fact, Downing made that case in a statement to reporters on the courthouse steps after Ellis handed down Manafort\u2019s sentence.\n\"There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved in any collusion with any government official from Russia,\" Downing said.\nSoon after, Trump cited Ellis and Downing as support for the \"no collusion\" thesis in a tweet. \"Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia. But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House & Senate Intelligence & Senator Burr. So bad for our Country!\" Trump tweeted.\nBoth the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia. But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House & Senate Intelligence & Senator Burr. So bad for our Country!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 8, 2019\n\nBut that isn\u2019t what Ellis said, either.\nHere\u2019s the relevant portion of what Ellis said, according to the official court transcript: \"He is not before the court for any allegation that he or anybody at his direction colluded with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election.\"\nTo emphasize the point, Ellis repeated it shortly thereafter. \"He's not before the court for anything having to do with colluding with the Russian government to influence this election.\"\nOur ruling\nDowning said that Jackson \"conceded that there was absolutely no evidence of any Russian collusion in this case. So that makes two courts. Two courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with any Russians.\"\nNeither Jackson nor the judge in the other case, Ellis, said anything of the sort. To the contrary, they went out of their way to state the opposite. The street fact-checkers were right.
