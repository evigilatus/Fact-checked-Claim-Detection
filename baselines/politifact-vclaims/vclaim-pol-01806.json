Millions wasted in road closures and overtime. Jeff Greene will put a stop to that day one,\" said Greene\u2019s TV ad promoting his Democratic primary bid for governor.\nHere\u2019s where Greene has a point: The Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office has spent millions on security for Trump\u2019s visits.\nHere\u2019s what Greene left out: The federal government has already reimbursed local law enforcement agencies for protecting Trump. And while the next governor could send a bill to the federal government, it would likely end up in the shredder.\nFlorida\u2019s costs reimbursed\nGreene\u2019s spokeswoman pointed to a Palm Beach Post article that found local law enforcement agencies fronted more than $5.7 million to help protect Trump between November 2017 and April 2018.\nMost of that money was spent by the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office, while smaller amounts were spent by West Palm Beach and Palm Beach police departments.\nHowever, the federal government has already established a process for reimbursement.\nThe Presidential Residence Protection Assistance Grant provided $41 million to reimburse state and local law enforcement agencies for costs incurred between Jan. 21, 2017, and Sept. 30, 2017, while protecting Trump\u2019s residences in Florida, New York and New Jersey. The Federal Emergency Management Agency administers these funds.\nIn 2017, the largest grant recipient was the New York City Police Department, which helps guard Trump Tower. The department received about $36 million.\nIn Palm Beach County, the sheriff\u2019s office received $3.3 million, the full amount it sought for reimbursement, according to Therese Barbera, a sheriff spokeswoman.\nThe town of Palm Beach received $71,000 and West Palm Beach received $63,000. In a neighboring county, the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office also received money.\nLocal law enforcement agencies can submit their next requests for federal reimbursement in October. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHank Aaron\u2019s death was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Greene cited Trump\u2019s visits to play golf, Trump doesn\u2019t only play golf while in Palm Beach County. Trump has conducted some business while in South Florida, including hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-A-Lago.\nBut he is clearly a fan of golf. PolitiFact\u2019s Trump Golf Tracker showed that as of May 18, 2018, he had at least 56 confirmed golf outings, including some in Florida. (Our tabulation could be an undercount since it is based on confirmed golf outings. The New York Times has tracked how many times Trump has visited his properties, including golf courses, which adds up to 170 as of mid-July.)\nGovernor\u2019s power to bill the federal government limited\nGreene said he would put a stop to this. We can't fact-check whether he will, because that's a prediction. But we can analyze whether the governor has control.\nCampaign spokeswoman Claire VanSusteren pointed to a line in Article 7 Section 1 in the Florida Constitution that states, \"No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in pursuance of appropriation made by law.\"\nWe sent Greene\u2019s constitutional argument to a few Florida legal experts: Nova Southeastern University law professor Robert Jarvis; Talbot \"Sandy\" D\u2019Alemberte, a former president of the American Bar Association and former president of Florida State University; and Raoul Cantero, a former Florida Supreme Court judge and a partner at White and Case law firm.\nThe experts would essentially say to Greene: Good luck with that.\nThis portion of the Florida Constitution is about taxation \u2014 the state budget says nothing about relations with the federal government.\nThere is nothing in that section that would compel the federal government to comply with such a request from a governor.\nJarvis said that a state governor has no power over a president. \u00a0\n\"This is because of a legal doctrine known as the \u2018superior sovereign doctrine.\u2019 Under it, a lower government official cannot order a higher government official to do anything,\" he said. \"This stems from medieval times, when a king could order a prince to do things, but a prince could not order a king to do anything. In our country, this means that the states are subservient to the federal government.\"\nOur ruling\nGreene said, \"Every time Trump comes here to play golf, Florida taxpayers are paying for it. Millions wasted in road closures and overtime. Jeff Greene will put a stop to that day 1.\"\nLocal law enforcement in Palm Beach County have spent millions on security when Trump visits, but they have submitted their costs for reimbursement, and will continue to do so.\nGreene cites a portion of the Florida Constitution about taxation that he says he would use to submit a bill to the federal government. He could certainly try that, but the legal experts we talked to said that\u2019s not the purpose of that part of the Constitution.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c0f61358-8211-402d-8d8e-4de5feef5679", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01806"}
