Bob Casey said federal agents \u2018kidnapped\u2019 protesters in Portland. Is that true?", "text": "Democrats and civil libertarians have decried the Trump administration\u2019s response to unrest in Portland, Ore., in recent weeks. Federal agents have been criticized for beating and pepper spraying a peaceful Navy veteran and shooting another man in the face with a nonlethal munition, fracturing his skull.\nWhen President Donald Trump threatened to send federal agents to Philadelphia, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey (D., Pa.) accused the officers in Portland of \"kidnapping and holding citizens without charges.\"\nWe wondered whether Casey\u2019s description was accurate.\nOur analysis of this claim focuses on two detentions. A federal judge ruled one of them was unconstitutional, and a Trump administration official said agents lacked probable cause for the second. Legal experts say those seizures meet the common language definition of kidnapping, even as they stressed that the officers involved would never be charged.\nFederal agents don\u2019t typically patrol American cities. But in late June, Trump signed an executive order directing federal law enforcement agencies to send personnel to cities where monuments had become focal points for protests against systemic racism and police violence.\nA few days later, Homeland Security agents from Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 who didn\u2019t have proper training in riot control or mass demonstrations \u2014 arrived in Portland to support officers of the Federal Protective Service, the division responsible for protecting federal buildings such as the city\u2019s Mark O. Hatfield courthouse, which had been vandalized.\nWhen Casey said protesters in Portland had been kidnapped, he was relying on news reports and legal documents that described two protesters who were picked up under \"irregular\" circumstances early July 15, said Natalie Adams, Casey\u2019s spokesperson.\nOne is Mark Pettibone, who said he was seized near the courthouse by a group of armed agents traveling in an unmarked minivan. Pettibone told Oregon Public Broadcasting that as the van drove off, officers covered his eyes and restrained his hands.\nPettibone said he was taken to a building he later learned was the federal courthouse, loaded into a cell, and read his Miranda rights. He was patted down and photographed, and his belongings were searched. Officers didn\u2019t tell him why he was being arrested, he said, and when he declined to answer questions without a lawyer present, he was released without any record of an arrest.\nThe details are outlined in a sworn statement and were corroborated by Connor O\u2019Shea, a friend who was walking with Pettibone moments before he was picked up.\nThe other incident was captured in a now-viral video. It shows a team of federal agents dressed in combat gear surrounding a peaceful protester, removing him from the street, and carrying him away in an unmarked van\u00a0\u2014 just like Pettibone.\u00a0The protester in the video hasn\u2019t been identified.\nLegal experts said neither of these arrests was lawful because the officers lacked probable cause.\nWhen Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum sued the Trump administration, she argued that the agents who snatched Pettibone violated his Fourth and Fifth Amendments rights and that his detention constituted \"an unreasonable seizure.\" Michael Mosman, the federal judge who ruled on the case, agreed.\nMosman wrote: \"There is no video of this arrest and no evidence relating to its legality other than Mr. Pettibone\u2019s sworn statements. Defendants have not refuted the state\u2019s allegation that Mr. Pettibone\u2019s seizure lacked probable cause.\u00a0I therefore assume, only for the purposes of this opinion, that this seizure was unlawful and constituted a violation of Mr. Pettibone\u2019s rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\nRegarding the arrest depicted in the video, Mosman added:\n\"The video shows the seizure but does not show any context for what preceded it. It therefore does not speak to probable cause one way or another because it is equally plausible that the individual was an innocent bystander or that he had committed some criminal act just before officers seized him.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when a Trump administration official was asked to describe the probable cause, he admitted the officers had none. Rather, the agents wanted to question the man about a crime he might have observed \u2014 and believed they needed to move him to do so safely.\nRichard \"Kris\" Cline, deputy director of the Federal Protective Service, said at a news conference that as agents approached the man, \"they noticed that coming in their direction were violent demonstrators.\" This necessitated moving the man \"to an area that was safe for both the officers and the individual,\" Cline said.\nCline went on to argue that the officers\u2019 conduct was lawful because it was not actually an arrest, but rather a stop, which does not require probable cause.\nCline is wrong.\nForty years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in Dunaway v. New York that taking a suspect into custody, transporting him to a new location, and detaining him for questioning is \"indistinguishable from a traditional arrest.\" And for such an arrest to be lawful, probable cause is required.\nThe court drew similar conclusions in Davis v. Mississippi and Hayes v. Florida.\nHarvard Law professor Andrew Crespo described the case law this way:\n\"Any one of these cases, standing alone, resolves the question at hand. Taken together, the conclusion is inescapable: When the agents put the man in the van, took him off the street, and brought him inside for questioning, they arrested him. Cline says they did so without probable cause. That means they violated the Constitution.\"\nSo, can these two incidents be considered kidnapping?\nRosenblum used the word kidnap in her petition for an injunction against future arrests involving protesters.\n\"Ordinarily, a person exercising his right to walk through the streets of Portland who is confronted by anonymous men in military-type fatigues and ordered into an unmarked van can reasonably assume that he is being kidnapped and is the victim of a crime,\" Rosenblum wrote.\nSome legal experts didn\u2019t hesitate when asked if what happened was kidnapping.\n\"Apprehending a person by force and holding him or her in captivity without legal authority is the definition of kidnapping,\" said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert and the dean at Berkeley Law. \"That is exactly what was done to some who were apprehended in Portland.\"\nFormer federal prosecutor Ken White, an outspoken legal commentator on Twitter who goes by @popehat, said calling the detentions kidnapping is a mostly rhetorical question rather than a legal one because it\u2019s unlikely the agents responsible would ever be charged. But he didn\u2019t dispute that some elements of the crime of kidnapping match what happened to Pettibone and the other protester.\n\"The arrest could certainly be unlawful and in violation of the Fourth Amendment, which has consequences in any criminal case against the arrestee and potential civil consequences if the arrestee sues,\" he said. \"However, kidnapping is a different matter \u2014 that\u2019s a criminal allegation against the cop.\"\nHe continued: \"The crime of kidnapping usually has an element of wrongful intent \u2014 so you\u2019d have to prove not just that the arrest was unlawful, but that the cop knew and intended it to be unlawful, which is difficult.\"\nGeorge Washington University Law\u2019s Jonathan Turley said it was \"reckless\" for Casey to call the incidents kidnapping when the seizures were most likely false arrests, which can occur when an officer believes, even wrongly, that he had legal authority to detain someone.\nOur ruling\nCasey said federal agents in Portland have been \"kidnapping and holding citizens without charges.\" It\u2019s clear from Mosman\u2019s ruling and from Cline\u2019s remarks that the two detentions in question were unconstitutional or false, and it\u2019s not in dispute that the two men were briefly held without charges. The circumstances of these two detentions fit many elements of the crime of kidnapping. This is true even if the crime is never charged or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. For these reasons, we rate Casey\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17045"}
