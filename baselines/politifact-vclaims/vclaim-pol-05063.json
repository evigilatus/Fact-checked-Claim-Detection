In the ninth episode, Schmidt meets a drunk Bayden, who tells Schmidt her sleep cycle is erratic.\n\"You know who else doesn\u2019t sleep a lot?\" Schmidt replied. \"Dolphins. And they\u2019re always smiling.\"\nNot so fast, Bayden said: \"Dolphins are rapists. Look it up.\"\nYes, yes, this is a fictional show. But people wondered if the line was more than a joke. And quite honestly, so did we. (If you hate fun, we have plenty of fact-checks about tax policy you can read.)\nAs it turns out, this is somewhat of an urban legend. Research has shown that dolphins sometimes exhibit somewhat aggressive behavior in their mating practices, but it\u2019s not fair to call it rape.\nFemales are strong as hell\nThe myth largely emerged from research conducted on bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, said Janet Mann, vice provost for research and a biology professor at Georgetown University.\nMann, who worked on the Shark Bay research, said male bottlenose dolphins form alliances with two to four other males, and these groups will consort with a single female, and mating occurs. Often, the males will be aggressive toward the female and attack males outside of the alliance that attempt to get near or steal the female.\nBut the female can avoid mating with a particular male by turning away, or she can go belly up at the surface to avoid mating at all.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to show that the males force the females to mate, said Richard Connor, a biology professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth who has also worked on Shark Bay dolphin research. It\u2019s possible they intimidate the females, but that\u2019s unproven.\nConnor added that researchers think female dolphins try to mate with a number of different males, to confuse the issue of paternity and reduce the risk of infanticide. So they may actually want to mate with the males that herd them.\n\"Males force the females to stay with them, but (there\u2019s) no evidence of forced copulation,\" Connor said. \"People are making a leap, perhaps because they have not considered that females may want to mate with as many males as possible.\"\nIn a 2013 blog post debunking the dolphin-rape myth, dolphin behavior expert Justin Gregg noted that there are also rumors that dolphins rape humans. While there might be isolated incidents of dolphins with erections around humans or thrusting toward them, this is not rape. It\u2019s unclear whether the dolphins actually want to mate or if it\u2019s another form of social behavior, Gregg said.\n\"Calling any of this behavior rape trivializes the word rape,\" Gregg wrote. \"It either downplays the horrific human behavior of rape by jokingly misapplying it to quirky animal behavior, or unnecessarily vilifies what is, for dolphins, a diverse catalog of behaviors that might not cause the dolphins involved very much stress, and might even be consensual 100 percent of the time.\"\nGregg, a big Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u00a0fan, told PolitiFact he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Fey and the show\u2019s other writers know that the dolphins-as-rapists meme is not actually true.\n\"Either way, if it gets people Googling the concept and reading up on why it\u2019s not really accurate to describe dolphins as rapists, all the better,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nTina Fey\u2019s character on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt said, \"Dolphins are rapists. Look it up.\"\nWe did. It\u2019s just a myth. While research has shown some aggressive mating behavior among dolphin males, this isn\u2019t the same thing as \"rape.\" Importantly, there\u2019s no evidence to show that the females are forced to mate.\nWe looked it up and found that this claim is very much breakable. False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8057807-878d-4fca-b029-1f01fa7a7516", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05063"}
