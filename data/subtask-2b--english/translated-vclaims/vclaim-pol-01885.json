The Democrats are making a strong push to cancel the ACI, one of the smartest, most difficult and most powerful law enforcement groups of the men and women I've ever seen. I've seen ICS release cities from MS-13's grip and clean up the hardest cases. They're great!\" Trump tweeted on June 30th. \u2219 (Read more about the increasing calls for the abolition of immigration and customs law enforcement in the United States). Trump repeated the message in July 5, \"Every day, brave men and women in ICE free communities from brutal gangs like MS-13. We're not gonna support these vile democratic distortions in law enforcement. We will always stand proudly with the heroes of Brave from Ice and Border Patrol. We wondered: Did ABC free cities from MS 13 control, as Tramp claimed? The Trump tweet did not mention which cities were liberated or when. .............................................................................................................................................. The White House did not respond to repeated requests for clarification. We looked for facts to support the statement, but we didn't find any. MS-13 or Mara Salvatrucha operates in at least 40 states, with an estimated 10,000 members residing in the United States. The street gang \"has a big presence\" in New York, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., D.C., the U.S. Department of Justice said. The FBI has no breakdown in their presence by state or location, and FBI spokesman Nora Scheland said. The use of trumps for \"liberation\" indicates that cities were under MS-13 or under full control. But neither the White House nor IC called such cities. The experts in sociology and gang research told Bolivi Fuckett that they were not aware of the entire U.S.-controlled cities, and that Trump's formulation seemed to be a political exaggeration. \"This is an excessive and misleading language,\" said Joria Lip, Assistant Professor of Social Welfare and Director of the Health and Social Justice Partnership at the University of California Loskine School of Public Affairs. \"Emancipation is usually the term military forces - as in allies they freed France from Nazis.\" According to Fulton T. Armstrong, a research fellow at the Latin American and Latin American Studies Centre at the American University. \"MS-13 in some cities made progress, in some neighbourhoods and schools, but to say that all towns were under MS-13 control, which was simply never proven,\" added Armstrong. \"In the absence of any evidence, one has to say either it's too much if it's not a fabrication, because we never knew it.\" On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 3 February 2021 would be a major achievement if a town were to rid itself of the presence of MS-13, as stated by David S. Peroz, Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Colorado, Boulder. \"But most gang repressions or raids only temporarily improve the situation of communities by reducing crime and fear, since the factors underlying the emergence of gangs and violence do not change because of these police practices,\" said Peroz. MS-13 targets immigrant communities with news outlets that report brutal MS-13 violence, recruitment efforts, and the fear that its members spread largely in immigrant communities and minors who come to the United States illegally without a parent or guardian. The Ministry &apos; s main objective was the immigrant community, although there were cases in which non-migrants were also victims, and Joseph Kolp, Executive Director of the South-West Gang Information Centre, who collects and shares gang-related information and training with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. Members of the MS-13 gang were charged with the murder of the teenage New Yorker Kayla Kuevas and Nisa Mikens, who were walking together in their hometown. \"MS-13, they don't control cities, but they control centres in cities,\" said Colip. He said that MS-13, like any ethnic or racial gang, had higher levels of crime in certain regions and flourished in the societies in which they lived. Trump usually ignores the fact that MS-13's most important objectives are immigrants. Not only has the agency involved in MS-13 efforts arrested hundreds of MS-13 gang members and others in operations led by the Commission in recent years. It should be noted that the Institute is not necessarily the only law enforcement unit that pursues gang members. Operation Community Shield was established in 2005, the anti-gang enforcement initiative of the Institute, which works with other law enforcement agencies at the federal, state and local levels. The Institute's website said: \"The enforcement activity related to the Gang issue is much more effective in areas where the partnership between the Internal Security Investigation Commission and domestic law enforcement is stronger.\" A six-week operation led by the Institute, which ended in May 2017, resulted in the arrest of 1,378 persons (1,095 persons found to be gang members and affiliates). Most of the detainees were United States citizens. Of the 1,378 arrested, 104 were members of the MS-13 gang, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The Institute &apos; s Internal Security Investigation Division arrested approximately 800 MS-13 gang members in fiscal year 2017 and 405 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and had previously informed Politi Fact. Also at his October 2017 hearings, Prosecutor Jeff stated that he designated MS-13 as a priority for the drug law enforcement task forces in the area of organized crime. The Coalition includes the Immigration and Naturalization Authority, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Inspector General of the United States Department of Labor, and others. \"The efforts of large gangs, especially those involving violent gangs, often involving multiple agencies,\" said Peroz. \"It will be rare, though not necessarily impossible, to make a raid without the help of local police, Our Governor Trump tweet, \"I've watched ICE free cities from MS-13 grip.\" The Immigration and Naturalization Authority and the White House did not specify which cities were under MS-13 and were subsequently liberated by the Immigration and Naturalization Authority. Experts said that gangs targeted immigrant centres or communities within larger jurisdictions, and there were no entire cities in their violent grip. Attacks by law enforcement agencies temporarily improve the safety of communities, but they usually do not function as durable solutions because the underlying conditions for gang violence still exist. In the absence of evidence to support it, the Trump statement is wrong.
