Chris Christie\u2019s comments simply don\u2019t jibe with reality.\n\nTake, for instance, his claim at a transportation conference Wednesday that Democrats are opposed to any tax cuts this year.\n\nAs Christie continues pushing for an income tax cut, the Republican governor and Democratic legislators have been battling this week over differing state revenue projections.\n\nThe Christie administration is estimating a shortfall of $676 million through the end of the next fiscal year, while David Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, has estimated a shortfall of $1.3 billion.\n\nAfter blasting Rosen as the \"Dr. Kevorkian of the numbers,\" Christie in a speech Wednesday claimed that Democratic legislators \"don't want to cut your taxes under any circumstances.\"\n\n\"This year, when they don\u2019t want to cut your taxes under any circumstances, they have their handmaiden walk over across the street in front of the Assembly Budget Committee today and say...\u2019I was wrong. I was $1.6 billion wrong for this year, but trust me for next year. You\u2019re another $660 billion short for next year.\u2019 Why would anybody with a functioning brain believe this guy?\"\n\nWell, PolitiFact New Jersey has a question of its own: Why would anybody with a functioning brain believe Democrats don\u2019t want tax cuts when they released their own tax cut proposals a few months ago?\n\nThe debate over their proposals and the governor's has gripped Trenton since Christie\u2019s State of the State address in January, when the governor unveiled his plan for an across-the-board 10 percent cut in the state income tax. Democrats immediately pounced on the proposal for disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest residents.\n\nBut in early March, Democrats in the State Senate and the State Assembly each laid out their own tax cut proposals. After pointing out the Senate Democrats\u2019 plan during a town hall meeting in March, Christie offered this promise:\n\n\"Looks like we got some place to work here. Here\u2019s the one thing I know for sure: You\u2019re gonna get tax relief in 2012, because we\u2019re now agreeing on cutting taxes in Trenton.\"\n\nBoth Democratic proposals only would benefit households earning up to $250,000 by providing a tax credit based on their property taxes. The tax credits would be applied against their income taxes.\n\nSenate Democrats have proposed a 10 percent tax credit, while Assembly Democrats are pushing what they refer to as a 20 percent credit. According to Assembly Democrats, seniors and the disabled would receive a 25 percent credit. Unlike the Senate plan, the Assembly proposal includes increasing taxes on income exceeding $1 million.\n\nDespite the poor revenue projections, Senate President Stephen Sweeney has stood by the need to provide property tax relief, according to published reports. Citing recent revenue projections, Assembly Democrats have criticized Christie's tax cut proposal, claiming their plan is the better solution.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, one Assembly Democratic leader has left open the possibility that there may be no tax cut at all in the upcoming state budget.\n\nIn response to our findings, Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts provided this statement:\n\n\"Assembly Democrats specifically put forward a tax plan that raises taxes on some people. Theirs can be defined as much as a \u2018tax cut\u2019 as by a \u2018tax increase.\u2019 You guys are extraordinarily rigid on the use of language so I hope you make that note. Secondly, the Assembly plan is dead on arrival. It has zero chance of becoming law, which they know. Now, since the April revenue figures came out, Democrats have used those figures as an excuse to abandon a tax cut. Their statements indicate as much and we put out a release earlier today highlighting this fact.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a speech Wednesday, Christie claimed that Democratic legislators this year \"don't want to cut your taxes under any circumstances.\"\n\nThat claim is pure nonsense. The main topic in Trenton has been competing tax cut proposals made by Christie and the Democrats. Christie may disagree with them on how to cut taxes, but there\u2019s no doubt that many Democrats are willing to do just that.\n\nFor Christie to suggest otherwise is just ridiculous.
