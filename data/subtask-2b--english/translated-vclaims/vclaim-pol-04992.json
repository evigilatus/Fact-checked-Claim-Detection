Because Trump repeatedly complained that the initial process had been reformed, the host, Chuck Todd Trump, asked whether he supported policies that made it easier for people to vote. For example, voter registration on the same day allows voters to register or update their information in the ballot box on election day. \"No, no,\" Trump said for the proposal. \"I don't think people should sneak through cracks. And whether this is identity or any way you want to do it. But you have to be a citizen to vote.\" \"Well, of course,\" Todd responded. \"This is the law as it already exists.\" Trump disagreed: \"No, it's not. I mean, you have places where people come in and vote.\" In most states, people have to register to vote at least a few days before voting. However, 15 provinces and departments of Colombia have or are in the process of implementing voter registration on the same day. Is it really a case where non-citizens can only \"come in and vote\" in these states? The election experts told us that there is no growing risk of non-citizens voting in states that register on the same day, rather than in states that require voters to register in advance, because of state guarantees. Michael McDonald, Professor of Political Science at the University of Florida, said: \"Not only can you appear and vote -- you have to register and advance the necessary identity.\" In order to register for voting, the states must identify and reside in the electorate. In order to meet similar criteria when persons are registered on election day, registration mandates on the same day require voters to submit valid identification cards and proof of residence, such as the escort bill, to the ballot boxes. However, the details differ from the different states because each state sets its own electoral laws. So if there are problems with eligible voters using registration on the same day, it is likely to have more to do with how the State implements the program, rather than a problem inherent in the general concept of registration on the same day, as Barry Borden, Professor of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin, said. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" \u2022 On 19 January 2021, for example, some but not all States have an electronic database that can be used to verify the eligibility of the Registrar on the same day immediately. And others like Iowa and New Hampshire sent an e-mail to all those registered on the same day, and if the card is returned as undelivered, However, the bottom line is that States seek to subject everyone to the same level of scrutiny in terms of identity verification. \"For presidential elections, all states require voters to be citizens of the United States, and there is nothing inherent in registration on the same day that would make it easier for non-citizens to vote,\" said Joshua Douglas, an electoral law professor at the Law School of the University of Kentucky. Douglas pointed out that some local jurisdictions did allow non-citizens to vote in certain elections, but that it was still illegal for them to vote in federal elections. Every expert we asked told us that there are historical examples of non-citizens voting in federal elections, but they are rare. There is no evidence that it is more prevalent in the states that register election day. For a person to vote fraudulently using registration on the same day, he or she must lie about his or her eligibility to be present at polling staff and others, and create a paper trail by filling out papers. These factors act as a deterrent, in addition to the severe penalties to which a false voter may be subjected, such as deportation if the person is unlawfully present in the country. Birden referred to a recent case in Wisconsin of a man accused of fraud in the election to vote in the presidential election on April 5th. The man, who is not a citizen but is in the United States on a green card, was registered and voted in the ballot box on election day. But the state government arrested the man, and a spokesman for the Wisconsin Government Accountability Council told the local news that the agency had never faced a similar situation before, in 40 years of voter registration on election day. \"For a person who is not eligible to vote, access to the polling place and the use of registration on the same day is risky,\" Brden said, noting that there was a greater likelihood of electoral fraud in activities occurring outside the polling site, such as postcards. Our rule is, \"You must be a citizen to vote,\" but with voter registration on the same day, \"You have places where people come in and vote.\" In states that register voters on the same day, people do not enter and vote only. They must provide the same level of identification as they do at the time of pre-registration. The experts told us that there was no additional risk that non-citizens would vote in the states in which voters were registered on the same day, nor was there any evidence of that. We also appreciate Trump's false establishment. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0305fc92-e0e0-408d-9384-dab7b5d334be", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04992"}
