Bob McDonnell said there is a pox on both political parties for causing the federal government\u2019s partial shutdown. But he insisted the biggest welts are on the backs of President Barack Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate.\nMcDonnell, a Republican, noted that 49 states require the passage of balanced budgets each year. That includes Virginia.\n\"We\u2019re incredulous, at the state level, it\u2019s been four and a half years since the United States Senate has passed a budget, a spending blueprint for America,\" McDonnell said. \"You know, no business, no state, no local government, no church, no synagogue, or a family could ever run like that.\"\nLater in the interview, McDonnell repeated that the Senate has not passed a budget in 4-1/2 years. We asked for asked for elaboration and Tucker Martin, McDonnell\u2019s chief of communications, sent us a PolitiFact Tennessee article from September 2012. It gave Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn, a True rating for saying the Senate has failed to pass a budget in \"more than three years.\"\nThat Truth-O-Meter item said Senate hadn\u2019t passed a budget since April 29, 2009. \u00a0But things have changed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate, on March 23 this year, passed a $3.7 trillion budget on a 50-49 vote that maintained entitlements -- such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare -- and discretionary domestic programs. It differed from a $3.5 trillion House budget, passed three days earlier, that significantly cut entitlement programs and deficits over the coming decade.\nEfforts to send the competing budgets to a conference committee have been unsuccessful, however. A group of Tea Party senators has blocked motions -- which need unanimous consent -- to advance the Senate\u2019s spending plan. They have insisted on assurances that the budget negotiations would not lead to higher taxes and voiced concern that a conference committee could create momentum for procedures that thwart filibusters against increasing the nation's debt limit.\nOur ruling\nMcDonnell said the U.S. Senate hasn\u2019t passed a budget in four and a half years. His information is out of date. The Senate passed a budget in March. A group of Republican senators has \u00a0blocked efforts to begin budget negotiations with the House.\nWhat a difference a year makes for this claim. McDonnell\u2019s statement is False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08764"}
