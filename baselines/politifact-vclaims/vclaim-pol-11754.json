These measures normally circumvent merit-based or competitive allocation processes and appear in spending, authorization, tax and tariff bills.\"\n\nEarmarks, which Congress banned from its budgeting and appropriations process in 2011, draw fire in some quarters because they enabled individual lawmakers to carve out funding for pet projects without public scrutiny. Some advocacy organizations say they\u2019re still finding earmarks--sometimes called pork--in legislation.\n\nEarmark requests that raised some eyebrows include: the so-called Bridge to Nowhere project in Alaska--something for which Santorum voted, says a Perry ad (that\u2019s Mostly True, PolitiFact found); $522,000 for cranberry and blueberry disease and breeding in New Jersey, and $1 million for a Woodstock museum, honoring the 1969 music festival in upstate New York.\n\nSantorum\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t reply to our requests for his backup.\n\nIt would not be a shock, though, if Perry was involved in seeking earmarks. As noted in a Dec. 29, 2011, Austin American-Statesman blog post, headlined \u00a0\"Texas has sought its own earmarks under Perry\u2019s leadership,\" a July 2006 strategic plan for the Texas Office of State-Federal Relations, which then lobbied for the state in Washington, said that with the Texas Department of Transportation, it had secured \"over $669 million in highway earmarks for the state, $78 million in bus and bus facility earmarks, and $505 million in New Starts transit earmarks in the five-year surface transportation bill.\"\n\nAt the time, the blog post says, Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and then-House Speaker Tom Craddick, comprised the advisory board for the state-federal office.\n\nFor this article, we looked for signs of Perry seeking Santorum\u2019s proclaimed 1,200 earmarks.\n\nSteve Ellis, who studies earmarks as vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that says it works to advance government transparency and cut wasteful spending, told us that from October 2007 through September 2010, Texas received 1,342 earmarks valued at $1.7 billion. That money could have gone to projects anywhere in Texas, he said, from Fort Hood to county governments. \"It\u2019s the entire state of Texas so it could be Democrats, Republicans, whomever, asking,\" Ellis said. \"Whether Gov. Perry wanted them all, didn\u2019t want them all, I have no idea.\"\n\nEllis said that after October 2007, federal disclosure laws required Congress to list any earmarks in each piece of legislation. Staffers at Taxpayers for Common Sense would comb the legislation for additional earmarks and do their own calculations to determine things like the number of earmarks that went to each state.\n\nCitizens Against Government Waste, which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization that started when Ronald Reagan was president, also tracks earmarks. Its president, Tom Schatz, told us by email that between 2008 and 2010, Texas received 1,151 earmarks worth $1.4 billion, according to the organization\u2019s earmarks database. The database, also known as the \"Congressional Pig Book,\" is compiled by staffers at the organization who review legislation in search of earmarks, Schatz said. \u00a0\n\nBut there\u2019s no way of telling how many of the earmarks originated with any governor, Schatz said, because earmarks are requested by members of Congress. \"I\u2019ve never seen a letter from any governor asking for a specific earmark,\" Schatz said, adding: \"The only way to say that Gov. Perry \u2018requested\u2019 1,200 earmarks, or more than 1,000 earmarks, is to attribute all of the (Texas) earmarks over that three-year period to him.\"\n\nFull disclosure: In 2010, the group\u2019s political arm, the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, endorsed Perry for governor and, Schatz said, the council might endorse a presidential hopeful later this year. Schatz said he was speaking about earmarks on behalf of the group, not its PAC.\n\nThe figures Schatz gave us--1,151 earmarks worth $1.4 billion--differed some from those we received from Taxpayers for Common Sense: 1,342 earmarks valued at $1.7 billion. Ellis said the discrepancy is likely the result of slightly different definitions of earmarks. He said that everyone would have the same initial list of earmarks, provided through disclosure laws, but additional searching of legislation could yield findings that some groups would call an earmark and some wouldn\u2019t. Citizens Against Government Waste lists seven criteria for determining earmarks.\n\nAccording to news accounts, some Texas-tied requests for earmarks during Perry\u2019s time in office were claimed by Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. A Feb. 4, 2010 news article in The Houston Chronicle said that Hutchison, a \"senior Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, points with pride to the $2.3 billion in Texas earmarks she has obtained over the last two years. Among the projects delivered by the senator are highway construction, NASA funding and expansion of Fort Hood and other military installations in an era of base cutbacks.\"\n\nIn November 2010, PolitiFact Texas examined Hutchison\u2019s record on earmarks by citing a study by Taxpayers for Common Sense, which ranked Hutchison 19th out of the 100 U.S. senators for steering tax dollars to specific home-state projects. The state\u2019s junior senator, John Cornyn, ranked 54th.\n\nIn October 2009, The Dallas Morning News reported that by Hutchison's accounting, she had steered $8.7 billion to Texas over the previous five years. \"And as Congress finalizes the 2010 budget,\" the News' story says, \"the haul will probably exceed $10 billion \u2013 a staggering sum that has never been tallied before. It ranks her among the most successful earmarkers in congressional history.\"\n\nRay Sullivan, a Perry campaign spokesman, said the governor has a history of rejecting earmarks, something Perry noted when he faced off with Hutchison in the 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary. \"Perry has long been opposed to congressional earmarks and other irresponsible spending in Washington,\" Sullivan said in an email.\n\nWe asked Sullivan how many earmarks Perry sought. \"I was chief of staff for two years and recall no such requests from the Governor\u2019s Office during that time,\" Sullivan said in another email. \u00a0\"From time to time Gov. Perry asked the federal government to return Texas taxpayer money to Texas for priority needs, including disaster assistance and border security.\"\n\nUpshot: We failed to come up with a count of earmarks pursued or supported by Perry.\n\nPut another way, the only count we found that might potentially support Santorum\u2019s 1,200 figure was the total earmarks that went to all of Texas over a recent period.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState government may have played a role in requesting some of that funding.
