Without it and without our Bill of Rights, we would have lived in a communist country, which is what the Communist Democratic Party wants. They must disarm us first get the picture!\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The statement is not true and the Internet has been circulated for years. This quote came out of a comment made by Biden during an arms control forum in 2013, but it has changed considerably and out of context. A YouTube video published in 2015 entitled \"Biden: no ordinary American cares about his constitutional rights\" has more than 31,000 views. But at any time during the video, Biden doesn't say those words. In the video, he talks about \"roadblocks\" by those opposed to arms control: Facebook fact-finding articles mentioned on January 11, 2021 in Facebook by Nancy Belusi, no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. On January 12, 2021, \"They say that all they will do is deny citizens their rights under the Second Amendment. It's not true. They say that weapons such as AR-15 are required for self-protection and recreation. They're not. There are a lot of ways you can protect yourself and recreate you without AR-15. They say it's not about weapons. They're wrong; they're related to weapons. At the outset, let me say to all the press: no law-abiding citizen of the United States of America fears that his constitutional rights will be violated in any way. None, zero. The logical facts are that these offensive weapons are unnecessary and dangerous, which endanger law enforcement personnel. After a short while, Brettbart published a story entitled \"Biden: ordinary Americans don't care about their constitutional rights, Facebook questions are plants.\" Our Facebook judgment quotes Paiden as saying, \"No ordinary American cares about constitutional rights.\" This is a distortion. Biden already said that no citizen who respected the law feared that his constitutional rights would be violated without AR-15 protection. But he didn't say that \"normal Americans\" simply didn't care about their constitutional rights. The quote shared on social media has been changed, exaggerated and out of context. We're assessing this wrong.
