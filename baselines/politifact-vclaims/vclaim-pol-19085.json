According to Texas State Climatologist John Nielson-Gammon,\u00a0the amount of rainfall that fell during\u00a0a\u00a0five-day\u00a0period\u00a0across 10,000 square miles\u00a0of Texas and Louisiana\u00a0exceeded the previous record set in 1899 by 62%.\u00a0\nIn Harris County alone,\u00a0which contains the bulk of the city of Houston,\u00a0the storm dropped\u00a0an average 33.7 inches of rainfall across the county\u2019s 1,777 square mile area.\u00a0But is that\u00a0amount\u00a0of\u00a0rainfall more than\u00a0the volume of water that flows over Niagara Falls in a full year?\u00a0\nDoing the math\u00a0\nA spokesperson for the\u00a0U.S. Department of State said that Kerry\u2019s remark was based on a\u00a02017\u00a0Washington Post article\u00a0reporting that Harvey had dumped\u00a024.5\u00a0trillion gallons of water\u00a0on Southeast Texas and southern Louisiana.\u00a0\nThe article also mentions, for comparison\u00a0sake, that 1 trillion gallons of water flows over Niagara Falls\u00a0every\u00a015 days, and Kerry\u2019s office used that number to extrapolate the amount of water that flows over the falls in a year.\u00a0\n\"A trillion gallons falls over Niagara Falls every 15 days. So, in the course of 365 days, that is about 24.3 trillion gallons of water,\" said\u00a0state department\u00a0spokesperson James Dewey.\nThat back-of-the-envelope\u00a0calculation\u00a0is correct, and it closely lines up with\u00a0official estimates. Niagara Falls State Park estimates that\u00a0757,500 gallons flow over the falls each second, which is equivalent to 65.4 billion gallons per day, or\u00a023.8 trillion gallons per year.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn either case \u2014 be it Kerry\u2019s estimate of 24.3 trillion gallons\u00a0flowing over Niagara\u00a0per year or the state park\u2019s 23.8 billion\u00a0estimate\u00a0\u2014 both\u00a0figures\u00a0are less than the 24.5 trillion gallons of water Harvey\u00a0unleashed.\u00a0\nHowever, there\u2019s a\u00a0key\u00a0detail\u00a0that\u00a0Kerry gets wrong.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Bill Gates said \u201cat least 3 billion people need to die\u201d from the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it might be true that Hurricane Harvey\u00a0dropped more water within a week than flows over Niagara Falls in a year, not all of that Harvey water\u00a0fell on Houston or Harris County alone.\u00a0\u00a0\nHarvey made landfall near Rockport on Aug. 25, 2017, then drifted eastward over the next several days, dropping torrential rain on the Houston metro area.\u00a0Three days later, the storm\u2019s center moved back offshore and\u00a0restrengthened\u00a0over Matagorda Bay\u00a0where it\u00a0gained\u00a0its peak intensity. Then on Aug. 30,\u00a0the storm made landfall again in\u00a0southwestern\u00a0Louisiana\u00a0moving\u00a0northeastward over the\u00a0southern United States while continuing to produce\u00a0heavy rainfall.\u00a0\nThe majority of the\u00a0storm\u2019s total rainfall\u00a0fell over\u00a0Southeast Texas, where 60 counties were under a disaster declaration, and southern Louisiana, where 13 counties were under a disaster declaration.\u00a0The storm grew weaker as it moved over Tennessee\u00a0and Kentucky, where it\u00a0finally dissipated. Counties\u00a0in both states issued flash flood warnings as areas received up to 7 inches of rain. All told, the storm had unleashed a grand total of 33 trillion\u00a0gallons of water.\u00a0\u00a0\nKerry\u2019s statement would have\u00a0been\u00a0accurate if he had said Harvey dropped more water on Texas and Louisiana, or the southern U.S., over\u00a0five\u00a0days\u00a0\u2014 instead of just Houston \u2014\u00a0than the amount that flows over Niagara Falls in a year.\u00a0\nA 2018 report by the Harris County Flood Control District also made a\u00a0comparison between the amount of Harvey rainfall and the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"A total of 1 trillion gallons of water fell across Harris County over the 4 day period which would fill NRG Stadium 1,472 times and cover Harris County\u2019s 1,777 sq. miles with an average of 33.7 inches of water. This volume of water would also run Niagara Falls for 15 days,\" the report said.\u00a0\nAfter PolitiFact reached out to\u00a0Kerry\u2019s\u00a0office about the misstatement,\u00a0a spokesperson said\u00a0that the issue has been brought\u00a0up to staff and that Kerry would\u00a0be more careful with that statistic.\u00a0\n\"In a recent interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN, Secretary Kerry said Hurricane Harvey 'dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year,'\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"The statistic Secretary Kerry referenced is for water Hurricane Harvey dropped not just on Houston, but on southeast Texas and southern Louisiana.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nKerry said on CNN that Hurricane Harvey dropped more water on Houston in five days\u00a0than the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls in a year.\u00a0\u00a0\nBy the time Harvey dissipated it had dropped around 33 trillion gallons of water\u00a0primarily on\u00a0Texas, Louisiana\u00a0and, to a lesser extent,\u00a0Tennessee and Kentucky.\u00a0By comparison, about 23.8 trillion gallons of water flows over Niagara Falls per year.\u00a0\u00a0\nKerry\u2019s comment errs\u00a0in narrowing Harvey rainfall to Houston, and his office acknowledged the misstatement.\u00a0In fact, 1 trillion gallons were dumped on Harris County, which would be equivalent to the volume of water that spills over Niagara Falls in 15 days.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate this claim\u00a0False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19085"}
