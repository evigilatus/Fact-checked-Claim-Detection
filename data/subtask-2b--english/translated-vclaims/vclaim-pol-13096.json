This is the case with the allegation of many Republicans that the new Health Care Act is \"State control over health care.\" Paulette Fuck has repeatedly classified those phonies or pants on fire and selected them as our 2010 lie. But the line is still being repeated recently by presidential candidate Met Romney. In a speech in Ann Arbor, Mitch, on 12 May 2011, Romney sought to explain how his health-care plan as Governor of Massachusetts was different from the law signed by President Barack Obama. The Massachusetts Plan - approved with the support of the two parties in the legislature in 2006 - shares many features with the Obama Plan and is therefore a political problem for Romney. In the speech, Romney sought to distinguish between the Massachusetts Plan and the Obama Plan. He said, \"When I ask people what they hate most about the President's plan, what I usually hear is that they say, \"Obamakari represents government control over health care, and I don't like it. I think they're right.\" The same point was made in the accompanying PowerPoint slide, called \"Obamacare\" \"Government control over health care,\" instead of \"Mas-Care,\" which he said was designed to help people get and maintain their health insurance. We examined the allegation of government takeover in detail in our previous coverage, but since the line is being used by a potential presidential candidate for 2012 \"Government control\" is a European approach in which the government owns hospitals and doctors are public officials. However, Congress passed the law, parts of which have already entered into force, largely depending on the free market. Law critics are right that they significantly increase the government regulation of health insurance companies. In essence, it is a system based on private companies: employers continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies. \u2022 Unlike the prosecution, more people will receive special health coverage. The Act establishes \"exchanges\" where private insurance companies will compete to provide coverage to persons who do not own them. \u2022 The Government will not control hospitals or nationalize doctors. \u2022 The law does not include the general option, which is a government-run insurance scheme that competes with private insurance companies. \u2022 The law grants tax exemptions to persons who find it difficult to afford insurance costs, so that they can purchase their coverage from private service providers on the stock exchange. But here too, the approach depends on the free market with regulations, not social medicine. Critics have said to our conclusion that the significant increase in government regulation - which requires, inter alia, that adults have health insurance - justifies the use of the term. The Wall Street Journal responded in an editorial in response to our choice of year's lie that \"at the heart of Obama's care program is a significant expansion of federal control over how health care is funded in the United States, and thus provided. The Polette Vac regulations are designed to turn insurance companies into government contractors in meeting political demands, with enormous implications for the future of American medicine. All citizens will be required to pay under this system, regardless of their individual needs or preferences. The government seems to be taking over for us.\" Michael Cannon, a scientist at the Liberal Cato Institute, went so far as to announce that he was interrupting the Poletti Vak newspaper because of the problems he had with both the article \"Governance of government\" and the lie of last year - the former Alaskan government. Sarah Palin's argument that the Obama Health Care Bill guarantees the \"death panel.\" When we asked Camp Romney to explain their use of the term \"government takeover,\" the spokesman for Eric Vernstr\u00f6m said: \"It seems very clear that under Obama's care, the federal government plays a significantly expanded role in health care. Whether you call it \"take\" or \"take power,\" the effect is the same -- it transfers power and responsibility from the states to Washington and strangles the nation under a huge Byzantine bureaucracy fed by half a trillion dollars of higher taxes. However, we find ill-founded evidence of such a strong allegation. The Government &apos; s expanded role in the area of health is far less than government takeover. As we said in our Declaration of the Year &apos; s Lies, measurements about strict government regulation provide some useful examples. The Federal Aviation Administration imposes detailed rules on airlines. The laws of the State require drivers to have car insurance. The regulators tell the electrical facilities what they can charge. However, this strict regulation is not described as government takeover. There is no doubt that \"government control\" was a successful point of discussion. A survey in March 2010 found that the majority of the American people believe that to be true. But the facts simply do not support that. The Health Care Act continues to rely on private health insurance and private doctors. So Romney gets the same assessment as the others who made the false claim: pants on fire! On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13096"}
