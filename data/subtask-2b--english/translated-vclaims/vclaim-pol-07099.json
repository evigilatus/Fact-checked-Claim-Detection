That is, even Mary Burke's competitors made a remarkable statistical allegation on October 17, 2014, during their second and last discussion with the government. (Scott Walker) Burke said, \"We have reduced the common revenues of municipalities, whose budgets have really been compressed in terms of the provision of police, fire and local services.\" \"In fact, according to the latest reports of the FBI, we have seen an increase in violent crimes, which are the second in the Middle West. Therefore, out of 10 Western states, the second largest increase in violent crime. So, we're not doing enough.\" Is Burke right that reduced funding for local government units contributed to such an increase? Such an allegation earlier this month, we were mostly false of a similar but broader claim by the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. The union that supported Burke said Wisconsin was safer than it was when Walker took office. As Burke did, the trade union mentioned a drop in common revenue -- public government aid to local governments not tied to a specific target -- of $76 million, or 9 per cent. This step, taken in the first State budget of Walker, was the largest such reduction in at least a decade. Walker has also placed severe restrictions on the amount of property taxes that local governments can raise. At the same time, the Collective Bargain Reform Act No. 10 of Walker has helped many local governments to absorb at least some cuts in common revenues by forcing most public officials to pay more for their health benefits and pensions. The Walker campaign argued that the State had taken other measures to combat crime, such as increasing funding to combat domestic violence. In the end, local governments, using local funds as well as State funds, determine how much they spend on law enforcement. So, Burke's right that Walker's reduced the local government's combined revenue. However, it does not provide evidence that has led to significant reductions in law enforcement agencies. In fact, the size of the Milwaukee police force remained constant, as we found in a fact-finding exercise in August 2014. There were 1,362 officers in 2010, the year before Walker took office; he retreated to 1,348 in 2011 and rose to 1,384 in 2012. As for the statistical portion of Burke &apos; s allegation, the FBI includes four crimes in its charge of violent crimes: murder, manslaughter, forced rape, robbery and aggravated assault. The latest figures available relate to 2012. We checked the figures of the FBI and the other nine states cited by Burke when she made comparisons on how to arrange the state in the Midwest. We found that the rate of violent crime in Wisconsin in 2012 was higher than it was in 2010, the year before Walker took office, and higher than in 2011, his first year in office. Crimes of violence committed by the State in 2010 per 100,000 residents in 2011 Violence crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012 Violent crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012 \u2022 26 January 2021 454.5-7% 2% Minnesota 236 221-2 230.9% 4% Nebraska 279.5% - 2% North Dakota 225 247 244.7% - 1% Ohio 315.2 307.4% - 3% South Dakota 268% 254.55% 321% 27% Wisconsin 248,236.9% 13% 18% So, whether compared to 2012 to 2010, or 2012 to 2011, the increase in the violent crime rate in Wisconsin was the second highest among 10 states in the Middle West, behind South Dakota. Although this is not part of Burke's claim, we also found a slight increase in property offences - such as burglaries - in Wisconsin at that time. The rate was 2,453.8 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2012, the year in which Walker budget movements affecting local government began to take place, from 2,432.7 in 2011. As we have noted in the evaluation of the police union's claim, many factors - demographics, incarceration rates and even misreporting offences by the police - can contribute to fluctuations in the occurrence of crimes, which are usually seen as a domestic rather than a state-wide issue. At the same time, there is evidence that more police officers can be linked to the reduction of violent crime. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, Police and Crime Departments in Middle and Large Cities, 1960-2010. The data indicate that cities \"employ very few policemen\" and \"the controversial result from previous literature confirms that the police reduce violent crimes more than property offences.\" Our assessment, Burke, says Walker reduced funding to local governments in Wisconsin as a contributor to \"the second-largest increase in violent crime\" in the Midwest. Walker has significantly reduced common revenue for general purposes, which is used by local governments to help pay for a variety of jobs, including law enforcement. The increase in violent crime in Wisconsin in 2012 compared to the previous two years was higher than all but one of the States of the Middle West. However, Burke does not provide evidence that joint revenues have significantly reduced domestic law enforcement funding, nor does it show that funding reductions necessarily lead to an increase in violent crime. For a partially accurate statement but needs more information, our assessment is half correct. To comment on this item, go to the biennial Malawi web page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07099"}
