But it is not one that was predicted by the 1988 Japanese thriller \"Akira.\"\nA viral post circulating on Facebook claims that a conspiracy theory surrounds Katsuhiro Otomo\u2019s 32-year-old animated film.\u00a0\n\"\u2018Akira\u2019 is a 1988 movie about an apocalyptic event taking place months before Tokyo 2020 Olympics, showing the WHO advising Japan to postpone the Olympics because of a pandemic risk,\" reads the first panel of the image.\nThe post, which had been shared more than 32,000 times as of March 11, makes it seem as though \"Akira\" predicted an outbreak like that of the coronavirus decades ago. But almost none of its claims are true.\nYes, in \"Akira\" the city of Neo Tokyo is scheduled to host the 2020 Olympic games. Neo Tokyo is the name of the city built after Tokyo was destroyed by a massive bomb in 1988 at the very beginning of the film.\nAt one point, a scene identifies that the Olympics\u2019 Opening Ceremonies are 147 days away, but the Olympics are only mentioned a handful of times throughout the movie. In fact, the final battle takes place at the Olympic stadium, but the Olympics are not central to the plot of the film.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film, which is available to watch on Hulu in both an English-dubbed version and a Japanese version with English subtitles, is an adaptation of Otomo\u2019s popular comic book series. It tells the story of a teenage biker gang that roams the streets looking for trouble, until the group accidentally gets caught up in a secret government experiment that involves children with psychic abilities.\u00a0\nThe plot is complex and culminates in an epic battle against an overwhelming energy force, but there is no outbreak of disease. The WHO was not present and not mentioned at any point in the film. The topic of canceling the Olympics was never discussed on screen, though when Mashable Southeast Asia looked into this conspiracy, they reported that some of the graffiti on the sign that counts down to the opening ceremonies reads, \"Just cancel it,\" in Japanese.\nFurthermore, the \"apocalyptic event\" the post seems to refer to occurs within the first two minutes of the film. A massive explosion destroys Tokyo, but this takes place in 1988 before the film jumps in time to 2019.\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA social media post claims that the film \"Akira\" shows \"the WHO advising Japan to postpone the Olympics because of a pandemic risk.\"\nIn the film, there is no outbreak of disease, the WHO never makes an appearance, and the Olympics aren\u2019t canceled due to a pandemic risk. (It is also worth noting that the WHO has not advised Japan to cancel the 2020 Tokyo Olympics at this point.)\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18123"}
