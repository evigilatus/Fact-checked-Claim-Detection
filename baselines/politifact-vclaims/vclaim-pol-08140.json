The 25-year-old facility has been described as a \"senior citizen\" among NBA arenas.\nThere\u2019s a growing sense of urgency. The lease for the Milwaukee Bucks expires in 2017, the NBA is applying pressure, and the team\u2019s owner, former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, is seeking additional investors in the team. Two panels of civic leaders are exploring options for the arena.\nSo we took notice when Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett seemed to rule out one funding option -- an expansion of the cigarette tax -- that has been used in other cities to help pay for new facilities.\n\"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s feasible under state law,\" the mayor said in a March 3, 2014 interview with Wisconsin Eye.\nHe added: \"No one has talked about that at all. I\u2019ve never heard anybody mention that.\"\nThe two panels -- a large group led by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce that's studying the region's cultural funding needs and a smaller one focused on the Bradley Center -- have just begun their work. In theory, at least, all funding options are still on the table, although some surrounding counties are on record opposing any public funding for a downtown Milwaukee arena.\nSo is Barrett right? Does state law block an expansion of the cigarette tax?\nWhen we asked Barrett\u2019s office for backup for his statement, spokeswoman Jodie Tabak said:\n\"Mayor Barrett\u2019s answer was referring to the fact that we can\u2019t have a local cigarette tax because of state law.\"\nHow it works now\nThe state now levies a tax of $2.52 per pack of cigarettes. The tax has been around since 1939, and has been increased by the Legislature 17 times, most recently in 2009.\nThe tax raised about $587 million in fiscal year 2011-\u201912, and raised as much as $644 million in fiscal year 2009-\u201910. (Increasing the tax, as was the case in 2009, often convinces some smokers to smoke less.) Money raised from the tax goes into general state coffers.\nAs it stands now, Wisconsin\u2019s cigarette tax is levied uniformly statewide. There are no local surcharges, and no means for the money to be directed to local projects.\nThat could change, but it would take the approval of the Legislature and governor, said Sean Moran, of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Moran wrote an issue paper about the state\u2019s alcohol and tobacco taxes last year.\n\"There\u2019s really no reason it couldn\u2019t be done,\" he said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat has been discussed\nThe Public Policy Forum\u00a0 was commissioned to study a variety of funding tools, including the cigarette tax, as part of a report that will be issued March 14, 2014.\nForum president Rob Henken said in an interview that the tool was being considered because of the experience in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland. Voters there approved a 30-cent county tax on cigarettes that started in 2006 and gave it a 10-year lifespan. The tax generated about $15.6 million for local arts and culture groups. (Another 4.5 cent tax on cigarettes, part of a \"sin tax\" enacted in 1990 that also includes taxes on alcohol, is dedicated to funding sports facilities. Voters will decide in May whether or not to extend that tax for 20 years.)\nA local cigarette tax is also in place in other areas, including Cook County, Ill. Smokers there pay $2 a pack in a county tax; the city of Chicago tacks on another 68 cents. In New York state, the tax is a whopping $4.35, tops in the country.\nHenken said there were pluses and minuses behind using a cigarette tax for a Bradley Center replacement.\nOn the plus side, of course, are the dollars. The report will say that if a 30-cent cigarette tax -- the same size as Cuyahoga County -- were levied in Milwaukee County, it would generate about $11.7 million a year. Obviously, that\u2019s not enough to pay for a new stadium on its own, but it could factor into a package of revenue tools.\nThe downside includes the argument that such a tax \u00a0would penalize lower income people, because studies show they tend to smoke in greater numbers than higher income people.\nAlso, the state\u2019s cigarette tax is already high -- we\u2019re No. 8 -- \u00a0compared with the other 49 states, according to the Fiscal Bureau. The list is topped by New York at $4.35 a pack.\nThen there\u2019s the \"island\" issue. Some Milwaukee County smokers would simply go elsewhere to buy their cigarettes and avoid the higher tax.\nIn a meeting in February 2014, members of the task force looking at cultural funding needs -- not just the arena issue \u00a0-- discussed the various tax options.\nA Journal Sentinel report on the meeting noted that panel members meeting in small groups \"seemed to agree that a property-tax model or a sin tax to generate revenue would not be workable in Milwaukee County.\"\nOur rating\nBarrett said that using a surcharge on the cigarette tax to help pay for a new downtown sports arena \"is not feasible under state law.\" A spokeswoman said meant that the tax wasn\u2019t allowed under state law as it presently exists.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that state law can\u2019t be changed.\nIndeed, state approval is likely going to be needed for any mix of higher taxes that could be used to fund an arena expansion or renovation. In that respect, there is nothing different about the approval required for a cigarette tax increase, a funding option that\u2019s used in other parts of the country.\nOur definition for Half True is a statement that's partially accurate but leaves out important details. That fits here.\nNote: An earlier version of this item incorrectly stated that the Public Policy Forum was leading a task force studying the area's cultural needs. The organization is only conducting research into the matter.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08140"}
