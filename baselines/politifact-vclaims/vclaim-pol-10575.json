A lot of that has helped drive up costs. So the capital construction to expand access for New Jersey residents is critically important. If you think about 100,000 kids in this country leave their home state and go to another state to be educated. Out of that 100,000 young people, 30,000 of them are from New Jersey, by far the largest amount.\"\n\nDo New Jerseyans really represent nearly a third of all students across the country who go to an out-of-state school?\n\nStatistics from the National Center for Education Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Education, highlight a major flaw in Greenwald\u2019s statement: far more than 100,000 students nationwide pursue a postsecondary education at an out-of-state institution.\n\nIn fall 2010 -- the most recent data available -- more than 515,000 freshmen across the country started college at an out-of-state school. Nearly 393,000 of those students finished high school in the previous year.\n\nSo Greenwald scores no points for accuracy there.\n\nBrian McGinnis, Greenwald\u2019s communications director, said we were \"missing the forest for the trees.\"\n\n\"There\u2019s a serious brain drain that\u2019s disproportionately happening in New Jersey,\" he said, adding that Greenwald\u2019s overall point -- that New Jersey \"sends more homegrown students out of state than any other state\" -- was correct.\n\nNearly 35,000 New Jerseyans left home to attend college for the first time in fall 2010. Of those students, more than 31,000 finished high school the previous year.\n\nNo other state had a larger amount of students in either group attend out-of-state schools, but California and New York -- two states with significantly larger populations -- weren\u2019t far behind.\n\nMore than 34,500 students -- nearly 28,300 of whom recently finished high school -- \u00a0left California for college in fall 2010. In New York, more than 33,900 students left the state for school in fall 2010. Of those students, more than 28,600 were graduated from high school in the previous year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nGreenwald was comparing the amount of New Jerseyans who leave the state for college to a nationwide figure, but \u00a0it\u2019s worth nothing that as a percentage -- a \"more accurate barometer\" for comparing states according to Joseph Stetar, a professor of education at Seton Hall University -- four other states send more students out-of-state for college.\n\nA larger percentage of all first-time freshman students in Alaska, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont attended college outside of their home state than New Jersey in fall 2010. \u00a0\n\nOur ruling\n\nGreenwald said \"about 100,000 kids in this country leave their home state and go to another state to be educated. Out of that 100,000 young people, 30,000 of them are from New Jersey, by far the largest amount.\"\n\nRoughly 30,000 recent high school graduates left New Jersey to attend an out-of-state college, according to federal data. That part of Greenwald\u2019s claim is true.\n\nBut far more than 100,000 students attend out-of-state schools and though New Jersey students represented the largest portion of that group, California and New York followed closely behind.\n\nSo we rate this statement Half True.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10575"}
