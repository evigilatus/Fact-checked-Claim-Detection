The truth is they don't respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on the first flight, there was no leader, no one, to greet -- perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and solemn history of the first air force. This was not the first time Trump had raised this concern. This tweet was sent on the same day that Obama landed in Cuba: Is Trump right that this is unprecedentedly shaky? Having investigated diplomatic and presidential historians, we have found that Trump has a point of view, but his claim is far from firm. The airport salute is not only from the heads of State on 20 March at Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport near Havana, the President, \"Hello by a delegation of American and Cuban officials, including... Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla, Cuban Foreign Minister,\" reported The New York Times. So Fidel Castro, the founding leader of the Communist government, or Ra\u00fal Castro, his brother and his successor, was not at the airport to greet Obama. Fidel Castro is in poor health, but Ra\u00fal Castro met Pope Francis at the airport in February. He also met the Russian Orthodox Patriarch at the airport when he arrived that month. Trump has \"a legitimate point,\" said Paul Kengore, biographer of Ronald Reagan. \"He made Obama look bad, especially since the Castro brothers must be very grateful\" that the President of the United States would agree to start warming up relations between the two countries. However, Trump's formulation in his speech -- that \"there was no leader, no one, to greet him\" -- wasn't really accurate. Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs, high-level official of the Cuban Government. Also, the Cuban Ambassador to the United States, Jos\u00e9 Cabbanas, who was also there. In fact, the White House said at the time that it was never expected that a member of the Castro family would come to the airport to receive the first air force. \"The White House says that it takes no offense that Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro did not receive President Barack Obama when he arrived in Havana,\" stated Associated Press. The Deputy National Security Adviser, Obama, Ben Rhodes, says, \"It was never envisaged or discussed,\" that Castro would be at the airport. He said that the Cubans considered the ceremony of Monday morning with Obama and Castro to be an official welcoming occasion.\" The White House spokesman, Ned Price, told Paulette Fuckett that there was no standard recipe for how to deal with a protocol of this kind. \"If the official arrival ceremony is separate from the arrival of the airport, as was the case in Cuba, it is certainly not unusual for someone other than the head of State to greet the air force one,\" said Price. The independent experts agreed. Nick Colather, a diplomat at Indiana University, said that he suspected that he would feel any chill when Obama had recently travelled to the United Kingdom and met him at Stanstead Airport by Lord Essex Lord John Peter, a designer from Queen Elizabeth II. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Butterman (January 11, 2021) and many factors that can play a role in those who come out to greet the President, Alan K. Henrikson, a diplomat at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at the University of Tufts, said. \"The time of day may be important, depending in part on the itinerary of the journey and destination,\" he said, \"If the President travels to several places on one trip, he may arrive at an odd hour, late in the evening or early in the morning. There are regional, cultural and constitutional differences. The fact that there had been no recent visits to Cuba might have made the Protocol more flexible. \"There is no precedent for the landing of the Air Force One in Cuba,\" said Price of the White House. The fact that the President was welcomed to an official arrival ceremony, an unprecedented press conference, and full State dinner, among other elements, There is at least one precedent: when Nixon went to China, there was no single clearing house on the Internet that tracked the President's arrival abroad, and we could not find an expert who was familiar with all these historical events. However, we found one precedent: President Richard Nixon's first trip to China in 1972. Like Obama's trip to Cuba, Nixon's trip was the first time that the US President had visited an enemy for decades. Both States were communist countries, and the founding leader was still alive at the time. Both were highly anticipated media events. So how was China's arrival handled? It was Chinese Foreign Minister Cho Inlai -- not Mao Zedong, China's Supreme Commander -- who welcomed Nixon into the Air Force One Step Base. This is the official White House photo of Byron Schumacher. Henry Kissinger, Special Assistant to the National Security Adviser at Nixon, was instrumental in planning the trip. He shared the memories of the visit with a diplomatic oral history project and described the arrival ceremony as disappointing. \"I remember that when we landed at Beijing airport, perhaps naively, I was somewhat disappointed by what I considered to be the tense nature of Chinese reception. We expected thousands of people to encourage crowds after 22 years of hostilities. There was a very small crowd, including an honorary guard in the Chinese army. I looked out the window at the welcoming ceremony, and I thought it was a little gray day, too. This wasn't a big event, as it should have been. \"Of course, everyone was wondering what the first meeting would be between President Cho Inlai, who was at the airport to meet him. Please all recall that Foreign Minister John Foster Dolas had hugged Zhou Enlai in Geneva in the 1950s when he refused to shake his hand. That initial handshake this time was clearly gonna be important. Nixon left the plane, walked down the stairs, went over and shook Zhou Lai's hand. This was a famous picture. Then there was a restricted reception at the airport, with the toy band, the national anthem, the honor guard review, and so on. There weren't many people there. The reception was so wonderful.\" Our Governor Trump said, \"When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force 1, there was no leader, no one, to greet him -- perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and solemn history of Air Force 1.\" While there appears to be some variation in the protocol for presidential arrivals, it is credible to see the absence of a Castro brother at the airport as humiliating, especially since Ra\u00fal Castro met two visiting religious leaders there just months ago. However, Trump is exaggerating here when he says, \"There has been no leader, no one, to salute,\" since the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba and other senior government officials were present. There is at least one \"ex\" of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to greet the Visiting President -- Nixon's trip to China in 1972, which is actually a good comparison of the type of trip Obama made. We evaluate the statement half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a79dfbcd-f7c-42e2-a9a7-15bd38ad58b7", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05036"}
