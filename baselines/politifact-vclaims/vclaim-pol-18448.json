But it\u2019s not clear by whom.\u00a0\nThe woman claims she witnessed inside her polling place election workers forcing some voters to use Sharpie permanent markers to mark their ballots \u2014 and that those ballots were not being read by the voting machines.\nThe suggestion from the man questioning the woman was that this was an effort to block the votes of people supporting President Donald Trump \u2014 since people voting in person on Election Day have been considered more likely to support Trump over Joe Biden.\n\n(The Associated Press called Arizona for Biden early on Nov. 4, reporting that he sealed his victory in the state due to his performance in Maricopa County. Other media outlets have yet to call the race.)\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Maricopa County Voters can use a Sharpie to Mark their Ballot.\" By Nov. 4, it had more than 1,000 views.\nAn animated figure named Phil the Ballot introduces the video. The narrator says:\u00a0\n\"Did you know you can use a black or blue pen or Sharpie to fill out your ballot in Maricopa County? The new tabulation equipment only reads the oval, so bleed-throughs are not a problem\u2026.\n\"At the vote center, you may notice fine-tip Sharpies are used. That\u2019s because it\u2019s the fastest-drying ink and works best on the tabulation equipment. If you\u2019re filling out your ballot at home, you can use blue or black ink with ball-point pen or Sharpie. Just don\u2019t use red ink. The tabulation equipment cannot read red.\"\nIn other words, the Sharpie is actually the preferred pen for filling out ballots in Maricopa County.\nThis claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections\u00a0FactChat\u00a0#Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18448"}
