Democratic Party candidate\u00a0Rita Hart\u00a0and Republican Party candidate\u00a0Mariannette Miller-Meeks\u00a0were in a\u00a0tight battle\u00a0for the seat.\nMcCarthy said:\n\"I don\u2019t have all the facts but I (sic) was just reported that they have allowed a little over 300 people to re-vote and now we\u2019re behind.\"\n\"What?\" Ingraham responded as McCarthy continued: \"Why would all those people vote different? Yes, I don\u2019t have all the facts. Our attorneys are rushing there, but this is what\u2019s transforming out across America.\"\nNo one got to re-vote, election officials in Iowa said. A problem existed but it was in how one Iowa county\u2019s elections office registered votes from one of its precincts onto a spreadsheet, said Jasper County Auditor and Elections Commissioner Dennis Parrott and Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate.\n\"We reported wrong results on Election Night,\" Parrott said, a Democrat, at a Nov. 6 news conference in Newton, Iowa. \"It was human error, like a lot of things that happen.\"\nThe corrected unofficial numbers showed Hart leading by 162 votes. The totals were unofficial because individual county canvassing boards make the official counts and certification of votes the week after the election.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParrott said his office called Pate\u2019s when the error was discovered and that Pate\u2019s office walked Jasper County staff through re-checking to make sure the corrected unofficial vote count was, indeed, accurate. Additionally,\u00a0Pate ordered\u00a0a hand-count audit of the votes before the canvasses. He said every county in the district is conducting post-election audits in randomly selected precincts to ensure accurate vote counts.\nInterest in Iowa\u2019s 2nd Congressional District race between Hart and Miller-Meeks is understandable. The seat, one of several for which the Associated Press did not call an immediate winner, had been held by a retiring Democrat, Dave Loebsack, and Republicans\nwere eager to flip it. Miller-Meeks held a 280-vote edge on election night in the 24 counties that the district covers. But two days later, Jasper County discovered its reporting error, Pate said at the news conference where he and Parrott appeared.\n\"That would be the difference you\u2019re seeing,\" Pate, a Republican, said. McCarthy\u2019s offices in California and Washington, D.C., did not return calls from PolitiFact seeking comment or clarification on what he said on national television or if he had heard from Iowa elections officials.\nPate said more votes still could be eligible for the scheduled vote canvasses because they might arrive in the mail but sent on time. Or, he said, they could have been cast provisionally, which means they were made by voters knowing that their eligibility could be questioned and\nruled upon later. He said votes are verified by matching them with affidavits voters who cast them signed and whether or not the voters were registered.\n\"The key thing here is transparency, so you can see what happened,\" Pate said. The vote count is still going on, and the audit Pate ordered was to begin immediately and be done by Tuesday afternoon, when Jasper County canvasses its votes, he said.\nOur rating\nMcCarthy said that 300 voters in Iowa were allowed to re-vote to change an election outcome. That is wrong. Pate and Parrott laid out in their news conference how the state first reported votes in Miller-Meeks\u2019 favor swung to being in Hart\u2019s favor. No one was allowed to re-vote, Pate\u2019s office said. And even though McCarthy couched his televised statement by saying he didn\u2019t know all the facts, he said it anyway, and Ingraham picked up on it as though it were fact.\nWe rate the claim of 300 Iowans allowed to re-vote as Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18482"}
