Rick Perry opposes a hike in the federal minimum wage. Many Republicans do.\nOur curiosity was stirred by another claim in a May 29, 2014, email to reporters from the Democratic National Committee: \"Perry not only opposes raising the minimum wage\u2026 he doesn\u2019t think there should be one.\"\nNone whatsoever?\nThe current Texas minimum wage, tied by law to the federal minimum, is $7.25 an hour. Nationally, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 21 states had minimum wages exceeding the federal minimum as of January 2014, while Delaware\u2019s minimum was set to pass the federal minimum as of June 2014.\nPerry said in a Feb. 21, 2014, appearance on CNN\u2019s Crossfire: \"I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s the government\u2019s business to be setting the minimum wage out there.\"\nA week later, Perry elaborated on Iowa Press, a program on Iowa Public Television.\nAsked if he would repeal the minimum wage law if it were up to him, Perry said: \"I think you leave that to the small businessmen and women. I mean, the competitive nature of the free market works really well.\"\nPressed to air a repeal position, Perry replied: \"I don\u2019t know whether I would repeal it or not. But I don\u2019t think that the federal government in Washington, D.C., needs to be\u2026 setting... the standard out there. I think\" if \" it\u2019s left to the small businessmen and women of the country, it makes a lot more sense to me.\"\nHe added: \"If a state wants to set a minimum wage, that should be that state\u2019s prerogative, but not out of Washington, D.C.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerry, asked if he would repeal the state minimum wage in Texas if federal law didn\u2019t impose a minimum, said: \"I would leave it up to the Legislature to have a conversation on it and have a good debate about it. You know, is this a job creation or is it a job killer? If it\u2019s killing jobs, I\u2019m not going to be for it.\"\nAfter we tracked down these appearances, DNC spokeswoman Kiara Pesante offered them up by email as the basis of the group\u2019s claim.\nFootnote: Perry may not have entertained the prospect of government not setting a minimum wage in the past. According to an Oct. 22, 2006, Houston Chronicle news story on the Texas governor\u2019s race that fall, Perry declined to say if he favored raising the state minimum wage (then $5.15) above the federal level; the story said Perry \"reiterated his support\" for the state\u2019s minimum-wage law as written.\nWe contacted Perry's office about where he stands on this topic and didn't hear back.\nOur ruling\nThe Democratic committee said Perry doesn\u2019t think there should be a federal minimum wage.\nHe\u2019s said that lately. We rate this claim as True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07805"}
