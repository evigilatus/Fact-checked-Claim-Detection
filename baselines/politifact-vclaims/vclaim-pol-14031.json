We decided to check.\n\nFirst, a word of background. The tax cuts, enacted by Congress in 2001 and 2003, lowered rates on income, capital gains and dividends and:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neventually eliminated the estate tax;\n\neased burdens on married couples, parents and the working poor;\n\nincreased tax credits for retirement savings and education.\n\n\n\n\nThe cuts are set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends them.\n\nA spokesman for the Democratic National Committee said Kaine based on his statement on a CBO report released in September.\n\nWe dug up the study and found Kaine was correct. \"A permanent extension of all those tax cuts without future increases in taxes or reductions in federal spending would roughly double the projected budget deficit in 2020,\" the report said.\n\nThe CBO projects the 2020 deficit -- based on an assumption that the tax cuts will not be extended -- at $685 billion.\n\nRepublican congressional leaders want to make the tax cuts permanent. \"This is from a Republican Party that\u2019s been griping about deficits,\" Kaine said on CNN.\n\nBut by bringing up deficits, Kaine also sawed at the branch President Obama and many other Democrats have perched on during the tax debate. They\u2019ve wanted to eliminate that tax cuts for the \"wealthy,\" defined as families with annual incomes exceeding $250,000 and individuals who make more than $200,000. Democrats have supported extending the reductions to families and individuals beneath those thresholds.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: Eliminating tax cuts for the wealthy and keeping them for everyone else doesn\u2019t save big money. The Democratic tax plan would leave a projected deficit in 2020 that would be \"roughly three-quarters to four-fifths\" as high as that caused by the GOP plan to eliminate all the levies, according to the same CBO report cited by Kaine.\n\nKaine didn\u2019t mention this on CNN.\n\n\"What he said is factually correct,\" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center in Washington. \"What he didn\u2019t say is that the Democratic plan to extend taxes for 98 percent of the population shoots almost as big a hole in the budget as the Republican plan.\"\n\nWe agree that the buyer must beware when browsing political statements. Kaine is correct in saying that the CBO estimates the Republican tax plan would double deficit in 2020. But he omits an important fact: The Democratic plan would would increase the deficit by almost as much.\n\nAs a result, we rate Kaine\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14031"}
