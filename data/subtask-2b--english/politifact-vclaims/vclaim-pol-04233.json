Supporters say it would boost the U.S. economy. Critics counter that it would lower wages, cost jobs and hurt American workers.\nIn a joint press conference held Sept. 16 with Ohio Gov. John Kasich at the White House, Reed said: \"The bottom line is, if you look at any real analysis, this bill is going to generate better-paying jobs that are more stable.\"\nWe can\u2019t check whether the trade deal will create jobs and economic stability, but we can check whether Reed is accurate when he states that \"any real analysis\" projects that specific outcome.\nPolitiFact decided to take a look and found that some studies back up the mayor\u2019s assertion, while others paint a different picture.\nThe TPP, which still needs to be passed by Congress, would lower tariffs and reduce regulations between 12 countries \u2014 the United States, Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.\nReed\u2019s role in advocating for the TPP puts him in a delicate political position. He is a major supporter and surrogate for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who now opposes the agreement. PolitiFact rated her position on the issue a Flip Flop.\n\"I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages \u2014 including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\" Clinton said at a recent Ohio campaign stop, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nPolitiFact Georgia reached out to Reed to find out how he came to his conclusion.\nReed\u2019s director of communications, Anne Torres, said the mayor was alluding to a Commerce Department blog post on the effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement around 2014:\n\"At the same time that we were experiencing the longest streak of job growth, we also experienced a record year when it came to export-supported jobs: more than 11.7 million. This number includes the 2.8 million jobs supported by the exports to our North American Free Trade Agreement partners Canada and Mexico. And we know those export supported jobs pay 13 to 18% higher wages than non-export supported jobs.\"\nThe blog post says similar, positive effects could be felt by TPP countries by 2030.\nPolitiFact looked at six studies on the impact the agreement could have on jobs. Like politicians, research institutions are divided on the issue.\nClinton said she changed her stance on the issue because the current agreement wasn\u2019t the original version she supported as secretary of state.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHank Johnson\n\n\nstated on July 28, 2010 in a statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExporters are using a federal loophole to \"deceptively sell products made from cat and dog fur\" to U.S. consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Stirgus \u2022 August 11, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 800-page report by the U.S. International Trade Commission estimates an increase in wages and 128,000 new jobs.\nThe Brookings Institution, which has argued in favor of the TPP, says the agreement will increase service-sector jobs. Much of the pushback, including from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, centers on the loss of manufacturing jobs to other countries through free trade. U.S. manufacturing accounts for about 9 percent of jobs in America. Since Obama took office, there\u2019s been a net loss of about 95,000 manufacturing jobs.\nThe conservative group Americans for Tax Reform\u2019s analysis found \"more than 1 in 5 American jobs are tied to trade, and these workers earn 16 percent more than jobs in industries not tied to trade.\" The group has said the TPP is a step in the right direction but needs work.\nTo further address the \"better paying\" part of Reed\u2019s quote, a study by Johns Hopkins University and the East-West Center estimated the agreement would raise U.S. real incomes by 0.5 percent by 2030. Median household income grew 5.2 percent in 2015 in the U.S., an upward swing that hadn\u2019t been seen in years.\nFinally, the labor-supporting Economic Policy Institute says, \"this deal will lead to more job loss and downward pressures on the wages of most working Americans.\" This analysis is neither stable nor high-paying.\nMeasuring stability\nThe stability of jobs that could be created by the TPP is another issue. Some studies, including one cited by Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, predict a loss of jobs.\nThis loss of half a million jobs is a notable number cited in the TPP debate. A study by Tufts University found 448,000 jobs could be lost under the agreement, though this is the largest number of job losses reported. PolitiFact rated this half-a-million job loss Half True when it was cited by Sanders.\nDean Baker, co-director at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the near-half-a-million figure \"wouldn\u2019t be my best guess, but it\u2019s not an obviously ridiculous number.\"\nBut Baker notes the gains and losses go both ways. While trade deals open markets, the U.S. imports more than it exports.\nOur ruling\nReed said, \"If you look at any real analysis,\" the Trans-Pacific Partnership is \"going to generate better-paying jobs that are more stable.\"\nThe mayor is cherry-picking studies on this issue. Of the numerous studies conducted on the possible outcomes of the TPP, some predict a loss of jobs, while others say higher-paying jobs will receive a boost. Overall, it\u2019s difficult to calculate the stability of the jobs that may be lost or may be created as a result of the TPP.\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.\nWe rate Reed\u2019s comments Half True. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/23d9e56d-0279-4beb-b7ba-d978df6a8367", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04233"}
