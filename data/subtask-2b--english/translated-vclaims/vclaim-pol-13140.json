Is it true that this small proportion of secondary schools in the country have a significant impact on the problem of school dropouts in the country? We directed Scott &apos; s office to a 2007 report by Robert Palvans, co-director of the Center for All Graduates at Johns Hopkins University, and a large-scale expert on the issue of school dropout. Based on 2006 data, the report classified 1,999 secondary schools throughout the country as \"low performance.\" ==History==Balfans said that these schools, which account for about 14 per cent of the country's regular and vocational secondary schools, which record 100 or more students, have reliably produced 50 per cent of those who drop out of American schools. They're called leak plants. More minority dropouts in the country came from these schools: 81 per cent of Native Americans; 73 per cent of Afro-Americans; and 66 per cent of Latin Americans. Thirty-four per cent of those who dropped out of school were white. Scott accurately described the figures in the report. But the study was many years old and we wanted to take an up-to-date look. The case was re-examined by Palvans with other researchers in the 2010 report entitled \"Building the Grad Nation.\" Using U.S. Department of Education figures, authors found that the number of most performing schools in the country had decreased from 2,007 in 2002 to 1,746 in 2008. This study was co-sponsored by the American Promise Alliance. Founded jointly by retired General and Secretary of State Colin Powell, the non-profit group proposed a \"Marshall Sevik Plan\" to increase the number of students completing high school. In March 2011, an update of the \"Construction of the Grad Nation\" study found that the latest public statistics were available, the number of plants dropped out of school was again reduced to 1,634. These 1,634 low-performing schools account for about 10 to 12 per cent of the country &apos; s secondary schools and continue to produce about half of the country &apos; s school dropouts, as stated by Colin Wilber, spokesman for the American Promise Alliance. Each state has at least one \"exit factory,\" known as Vance as a school where at least 40% of juniors fail to reach their last year. For secondary schools with only grades 10-12, their reports examine the extent to which enrolment in the second year is compared to the last year. Reports do not specify which school is disturbed by name. The largest number is in the South. Virginia had 29 in 2009, 25 in 2008 and 26 in 2002. The Scott Bill - which was also introduced by Tom Harken in the Democratic Senate of Iowa State - would strengthen regulations established in 2008 that require states to use the same formula in reporting secondary school graduation rates. This would set a national graduation rate of 90 per cent. National graduation from secondary schools was 74.9 per cent in 2008, and last year &apos; s data were available. To sum up, Scott said that about 2,000 high schools, about 12 percent of schools in the United States, produce half of school dropouts. A report based on 2006 data was accurately cited. An updated study found that the number of low-performing schools fell to 1,634 in 2009. This does not reduce the point of silence that a small percentage of secondary schools have an enormous impact on the problem of school dropout in the country. We're assessing Scott's claim that it's true. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech.
