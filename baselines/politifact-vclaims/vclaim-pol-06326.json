But the candidate will have many defenders, including Correct the Record, a super PAC created to support Clinton.\nCorrect the Record president Brad Woodhouse, a long-time Democratic operative, dismissed the entire email matter during an interview recently on CNN.\n\"Every federal employer has to consider what they archive as work-related and what they consider personal, and she did what every other federal official did, what every other previous secretaries of state did,\" Woodhouse told New Day co-hosts Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota on June 5, 2015. \"Look, nobody has found -- you know, the New York Times \u00a0wrote a story that some type of laws had been broken. Turns out they had to retract that. People had to back off that, and it's totally not true.\"\nIn the news business, retractions don\u2019t come lightly and we wondered if in fact, the newspaper of record had taken back part of what it reported on Clinton.\nIn reality, the New York Times hasn\u2019t retracted a word. The closest it came was in a column from public editor Margaret Sullivan, who wrote that the article that broke the story \"was not without fault.\" But the lapse, Sullivan continued, was a failure to list exactly which regulations Clinton might have ignored.\nThat lack of specificity, Sullivan wrote, allowed Clinton supporters to score political points. \"Not because it highlighted a factual error \u2014 the story was accurate \u2014 but because it kicked up enough dust to obscure the facts.\"\nSullivan, we should note, doesn\u2019t speak for the newspaper. Her job is to serve as an internal but independent critic of the paper\u2019s work, something akin to an inspector general in government.\nFormal retractions or corrections come from the editors themselves, and as we noted, that has not happened.\nAdrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for Correct the Record, said Woodhouse was not using the word retraction in an official sense. Rather, he was speaking of the gradual fade in New York Times coverage that insinuated that Clinton had broken some law.\n\"Ultimately the charge was retracted, even if the New York Times never issued a correction,\" Watson said. \"Their own experts changed their minds.\"\nLet\u2019s unpack that.\nWhat the \u2018New York Times\u2019 said\nThe newspaper broke the story under the headline \"Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept., Possibly Breaking Rules.\" It\u2019s opening lines were \"Hillary Rodham Clinton exclusively used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state, State Department officials said, and may have violated federal requirements that officials\u2019 correspondence be retained as part of the agency\u2019s record.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the top of the story suggested a possible violation, which falls short of charging outright that she broke a law, as Woodhouse said.\nBut the article does lay the groundwork to add weight to the idea of a potential violation.\n\"Under federal law, however, letters and emails written and received by federal officials, such as the secretary of state, are considered government records and are supposed to be retained so that congressional committees, historians and members of the news media can find them.\"\nAnd:\n\"Regulations from the National Archives and Records Administration at the time required that any emails sent or received from personal accounts be preserved as part of the agency\u2019s records.\nBut Mrs. Clinton and her aides failed to do so.\"\nAbout week and half after the initial story, the New York Times wrote that the regulations on preserving emails were vague.\n\"Although the White House has strict requirements dating back two decades that every email must be saved, there is no such requirement for federal agencies. Instead they are in charge of setting their own policies for determining which emails constitute government records worthy of preservation and which ones may be discarded.\"\nWhile, as the story noted, President Barack Obama signed a 2014 bill that required government officials who use personal email accounts to hand over those records in 20 days, that law took effect after Clinton left the State Department. According to Thomas Blanton, a government disclosure expert cited in the story, this gave Clinton \"wiggle room.\"\nBlanton was also cited in the original article. However, it is not accurate to say he changed his mind from one week to the next. In the first New York Times story, Blanton said \"it was a shame\" that the emails from Clinton\u2019s personal account had not been turned over automatically.\nThe New York Times also cited in its first story Jason Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and Reath, who is a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration. At the time, Baron said he could not think of another instance when a high-ranking official used a private email account for all government business. Baron\u00a0described Clinton\u2019s email scenario as a serious breach.\nHowever, Baron did not say the practice was illegal. In the weeks that followed, he consistently said it was a bad practice.\nOur ruling\nWoodhouse said that the New York Times retracted the charge that Clinton\u2019s handling of her email broke a law. That's wrong on two points. The newspaper never accused Clinton of breaking a law. Also,\u00a0while the newspaper\u2019s public editor said the original story should have included more details, the paper never issued a retraction or a correction. A spokeswoman for Woodhouse\u2019s organization agreed with that point.\nThe claim is not accurate, and we rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06326"}
