We didn't separate families. We didn't do all these things, number one.\" We have noted that Obama did not have a policy of separating families that illegally reach the border, and that separations under Trump occur regularly as a result of his administration's policy of prosecuting all adults who cross the border illegally. But Paden specifically mentioned the \"cage,\" and told him since the Vice President described an attachment to migrant children with that word. The use of the term \"cloth\" in a controversial manner has been consistently used by Democrats in attacks against Trump and the detention of migrants who reach the border. The Trump Department says that the facilities it uses are not cages. This description was used to refer to links to the chain holding migrants in border processing facilities both during the Obama and Trump administrations. It should be noted that the critics of Trump's \"non-tolerance\" policy, which resulted in the separation of the family, circulated a picture that allegedly showed the children's face down on the ground behind the attachment to the chain during the term of Trump. However, the picture was from 2014 when Obama was president. Our examination of the facts showed that the photo of Associated Press was taken in 2014 at the Customs and Border Protection Facility in Nogales, Ares. The picture was used in an article in the Republic of Arizona focusing on the flow of children who reach the border without accompanying a parent or guardian. The article of the Republic of Arizona, in part, said: \"They are undocumented. They've entered the country illegally. When they were arrested by United States Customs and Border Protection, they were shipped to Nogales from submerged treatment facilities in Texas. \"But they are still children in cages, not gangsters, not delinquents. Just kids, 900 of them, in a temporary border treatment center in the city, which is bigger than a football field.\" The article adds that \"children live behind an 18-foot fence tied to a chain of barbed wire.\" On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u25cf On February 3, 2012, an additional description of the enclosure was given: \u2219 Naylon cloth, linked to the fence, provides little privacy among the communities. They share the type of portable toilets used in exhibitions and construction sites, placed in cages and vented with drying hoses.\" A report from The Los Angeles Times in 2014 referred to the inclusions that keep migrant children as \"temporary cages.\" These are other 2014 photographs of children kept in the consciences of the chain from Jetty. For comparison purposes, there is a 2018 portrait provided by Customs and Border Protection to migrants in a similar attachment related to chains. J. Johnson, a former Secretary of Internal Security during the Obama administration, was asked in media interviews and in other forums about the use of cages during the Obama administration. In an interview with Aspen Foundation in June 2019, Johnson was asked to talk about his image, \"walking through what appears to be children in cages.\" \"It's very clear, the chain, the barriers, the partitions, the fences, the cages, whatever you want to call them, were not invented in January 2017, well,\" Johnson said, adding that the picture was taken during a rise in the arrival of immigrant children, and that under the law, children must be transferred within 72 hours to the Department of Health and Human Services. \"But within that 72-hour period, when you have a multiple thing, like four times, from what you used to in the existing infrastructure, you must quickly find places to put children. You can't get rid of seven-year-olds on the streets of Macallan or El Paso. And so these facilities were built, which I think was a big warehouse, and they put those chains so that they could separate young women from young people from, you know, adult children, so that they could either be released or transferred to HHS. Is it perfect? Of course not.\" Johnson addressed the picture from 2014 again next month on the face of the nation CBS. In part, Johnson said, \"The divisions you see, some call them cages, are meant to separate women from men, girls from boys. But this was temporary.\" The governor said Obama's administration didn't lock people up in cages. The immigration policies of Obama and Trump are very different. The Trump Administration has implemented a policy that has led to the separation of thousands of children from their parents. Obama didn't have that policy. But to say that the Obama administration did not put people in cages is inaccurate. In 2014, Obama and Bid\u00e9n witnessed an influx of children who reached the border without parents or guardians, and reports submitted by the Republic of Arizona in 2014 indicate an attachment to chains that carry children as \"monkeys.\" The former Minister of Homeland Security, under Obama's administration, admitted in the interviews that some described the \"cloth\" used during Obama's term. There is discussion as to whether the attachment to the \"cage\" chains and whether the application of this term to those structures is subjective. However, the term was certainly used in 2014 to describe the enclosures used by the Obama administration. We value Baiden's claim as false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00165"}
