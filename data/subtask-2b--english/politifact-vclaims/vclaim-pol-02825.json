Chris Taylor made a claim about a bill that\u2019s advancing in the Wisconsin Legislature.\nThe Madison Democrat said on Oct. 4, 2017, three days after the shooting:\nUnfortunately, the other thing that we see after these horrible massacres is a loosening of gun laws, allowing dangerous individuals to get firearms more easily. That seems to be the trend in this country. Right here, in our own state, we have a bill that would allow hidden, deadly weapons -- every single person to carry one -- no training, no background check, even around schools -- even around schools.\nLet\u2019s see if that\u2019s what the bill would do.\nThe bill\u2019s history and status\nTaylor was referring to Senate Bill 169, which was introduced by two GOP lawmakers in April 2017. In September 2017, 11 days before a gunman killed 58 people and wounded 489 in Las Vegas, the bill was approved by a Senate committee. The three Republicans voted yes and the two Democrats no.\nThe full Senate could take up the bill later in 2017 or in 2018.\nBoth the state Senate and the Assembly are controlled by Republicans. But GOP Gov. Scott Walker has cast some doubt on the legislation, saying in June 2017 it was \"appropriate\" for the state to require people to get permits to carry hidden weapons.\nThe bill vs. current law\nTo be clear, under current state law, certain people, such as felons, are prohibited from possessing a gun.\nGenerally speaking, it is legal in Wisconsin to openly carry a firearm without any training or license to carry.\u00a0But a state license is needed to carry a concealed firearm.\nNow let\u2019s get to how concealed carry would change under the bill, according a memo by the nonpartisan Legislative Council and Larry Konopacki, the state attorney who wrote it:\nLicensing: Currently, it is generally illegal in Wisconsin to carry a concealed weapon unless you have a concealed carry weapon (CCW) license issued by the state. A background check and training are required to get a license. The bill would do away with the licensing requirement -- which means no training or background check would be required to carry a concealed weapon.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the \"no training, no background check\" part of Taylor\u2019s claim is correct.\nSchools: Currently, guns are generally prohibited on school grounds. The bill would do away with that blanket prohibition. Instead, individual schools could ban guns on their grounds. But people with a CCW license would still be able to bring their guns on the grounds, as long as the guns stayed in their vehicle or within five feet of their vehicle. (The provision was included so that parents who carry weapons aren\u2019t breaking the law when they pick up and drop off their children at school, supporters say.)\nThose with licenses would also be free to bring guns onto any school grounds when there were no school activities.\nBut Taylor\u2019s claim was \"around schools,\" so let\u2019s be clear on that. Currently, only CCW license holders are generally allowed to possess firearms within 1,000 feet of school grounds. Under the bill, anyone who legally possesses a firearm could generally carry within 1,000 feet of school grounds. \u00a0\nIt's worth noting that while carrying within 1,000 feet of school would be made legal under state law, generally speaking, people would still be in violation of federal law if carrying a concealed weapon within 1,000 feet from a school if they don't have a concealed carry license.\nProhibitions: Currently, it is generally illegal for certain persons -- such as people convicted of any felony, or of a misdemeanor involving domestic violence -- to possess a gun at all. The bill would not change that general prohibition. However, it would allow even those people who are generally prohibited to be able to legally carry, open or concealed, antique, replica and muzzleloading firearms.\nSo, to Taylor\u2019s claim, even felons could concealed carry those certain types of firearms and they could do so within 1,000 feet of a school.\nOur rating\nTaylor said in Wisconsin, \"we have a bill that would allow hidden, deadly weapons -- every single person to carry one -- no training, no background check, even around schools.\"\nThe \"every single person\" part of the claim needs clarification, in that not every person, particularly felons, can legally possess any type of weapon.\nBut Taylor is correct that if the bill becomes law, people could generally carry concealed weapons without getting a license -- which would mean no background check or training would be required, either. And even felons could conceal carry certain weapons, such as antique or replica guns.\nAs for around schools, anyone who can legally possess a firearm could generally carry it concealed within 1,000 feet of a school, under the bill.\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.\nNote: This item was updated on Oct. 6, 2017 to make reference to the federal law on carrying a weapon near a school. This does not change the rating.\ndiv class='artembed'> Share the Facts 2017-10-06 18:11:39 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  In Wisconsin, \"we have a bill that would allow hidden, deadly weapons -- every single person to carry one -- no training, no background check, even around schools.\"     Chris Taylor Wisconsin state representative, D-Madison https://www.wiseye.org/Video-Archive/Event-Detail/evhdid/11885   In a news conference Wednesday, October 4, 2017 2017-10-04    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02825"}
