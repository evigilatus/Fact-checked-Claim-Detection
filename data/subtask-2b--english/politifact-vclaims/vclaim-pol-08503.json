Obama pledged to sign a health care bill into law that would \"cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year.\" \u00a0\nPolitiFact National rated that a Promise Broken.\nNow let's see what happened to premiums.\nUp $2,500\nIn saying the annual premium has gone up $2,500, Johnson\u2019s office cited figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research group.\nMore specifically, we\u2019re looking at the size of the premium for an employer-sponsored family plan -- that is, the total premium paid by the employer and the employee.\nAbout 60 percent of Americans under the age of 65 get their health insurance from their employer.\nHere are the national averages from Kaiser for the past 10 years.\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nAnnual family health insurance premium \n\n\nPercentage increase\n\n\n\n\n2004\n\n\n$9,950\n\n\n--\n\n\n\n\n2005\n\n\n$10,880\n\n\n9.34\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\n\n$11,480\n\n\n5.51\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$12,106\n\n\n5.45\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n$12,680\n\n\n4.74\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n$13,375\n\n\n5.48\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n$13,770\n\n\n2.95\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n$15,073\n\n\n9.46\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n$15,745\n\n\n4.46\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n$16,351\n\n\n3.85\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Kaiser says that based on the way its survey of employers is done, it rounds when referring to percentages. For example, Kaiser would say the increase from 2004 to 2005 was 9 percent.)\nSo, as Johnson indicated, the average annual premium was $2,581 higher in 2013 than when the Affordable Care Act was adopted in 2010.\nBut premiums rose each year before Obamacare, too.\nWhy up $2,500?\nJohnson policy advisor Patrick McIlheran told us the senator was merely observing in the radio interview that premiums had risen in spite of Obama's promise.\nBut implicit in Johnsons' claim is that Obamacare, to some extent, is responsible.\nThe Kaiser figures show a premium increase of 9 percent in 2011, about a year after the health reform law was adopted. But one could argue that the longer the law has been in effect, the lower the premium increases have been (under 5 percent in 2012 and under 4 percent in 2013).\nExperts say, however, that a number of factors -- including the recession and the sluggish economic recovery -- affect premiums. Moreover, there is no consensus that enough time has passed to determine what effect the Affordable Care Act -- much of which doesn\u2019t even take effect until 2014 -- has had on premiums, particularly for employer-sponsored plans.\nThe president\u2019s Council on Economic Advisers, in a November 2013 report, argues there is a connection between the law and a slowdown in health care costs overall. But the report also notes \"the causes of the slowdown are not yet fully understood.\"\nHealth economist Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, told us increases in premiums have slowed, \"but I\u2019m one of those people who thinks that has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act.\"\nAnd when The Fact Checker, Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post, did a factcheck in September 2013 about Obamacare and premiums, he said the law\u2019s impact \"is just now being calculated, adding: \"Trust us -- no one really knows yet.\"\nSo, whether Obamacare has helped raise, or kept a lid, on premiums remains largely unknown.\nOur rating\nJohnson said that under Obama\u2019s health-care law, the premium for \"an average plan for a family didn't go down by $2,500 per year, it's gone up about $2,500 per year.\"\nJohnson is correct that by 2013, three years after the Affordable Care Act became law, the total average premium for employer-provided family insurance had risen by $2,500 per year. But experts say there is little or no evidence that Obamacare is responsible.\nWe rate Johnson\u2019s statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08503"}
