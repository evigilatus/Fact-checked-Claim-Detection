S., to reiterate his call for African-Americans to turn against the Democratic Party, arguing that the party had served the interests of black Americans badly for decades. Our African-American societies are certainly in the worst form ever. Never. Never. Never, \"Trump said. \"Take a look at the inner cities. You don't have any education. You don't have jobs. \"You're shot walking down the street.\" The commentary soon criticized social media, as many accused Trump of having no sense of American history. We analysed Trump's comment that black American societies are \"in the worst form\" at all, using history and data. We will note here that African Americans continue to track white Americans in many important measures of quality of life, including economic, health and criminal justice. \"A very low bar,\" said Bruce Levin, a historian at the University of Illinois-Champagne Urbana, who wrote about slavery and civil war. Not only do African-Americans track whites in many economic measures, but they \"still face significant discrimination in employment, access to housing, mortgages and decent schools - as evidenced by the weekly headlines from almost all over the country - death, while unarmed, by the police.\" Joseph Borelli, a member of the New York City Council, a substitute for Trump, said something similar on CNN. \"I don't think he's talking about the days of Jim Crow, even the days of the Civil Rights Movement in '60s and it's clearly not slavery,\" said Borelli. \"But he says that African-American society is sometimes superior to other societies.\" If Trump had simply referred to persistent differences between black and white in economic, health and educational data, he would have a point of view. But this is very different from what he actually said. (His campaign did not respond to a request for clarification of this article.) The most obvious points corresponding to the Trump statement are more than two centuries of slavery for Americans of African descent, followed by another century of discrimination, denial of rights and aggression in the South, the region where most black people lived at the time. \"African-American societies suffer from many social diseases, including poor schools and high unemployment rates, and it is important that candidates address these problems and offer specific ways to improve the situation,\" said Eric Funner, historian of Columbia University, who wrote many books on slavery and reconstruction after the civil war. \"Anyway, it's ridiculous to say they're in the worst shape they've ever been. Put slavery aside, return to the Great Depression, or the Crack epidemic in the 1970s and 1980s.\" Herbert S. Klein, historian at the Hoover Foundation at Stanford University, who wrote several books on slavery in the Western Hemisphere, agreed. He said: \"I do not say that color is not today a basic sign of comparative health and well-being - Americans of African descent are still the poorest and least healthy inhabitants of the United States.\" \"but it's still much better than it was in previous decades.\" Trump \"needs a desperate history lesson - or two lessons -,\" added Harold Holzer, a historian at Hunter College who specializes in slavery and civil war. There is also strong statistical evidence that the black experience in America has been on an upward path over the past half century or more. The following are some examples: unemployment rates among black workers rose upwards and downwards with recessions and recoverys, just as among whites. But historically, today is a relatively strong period for black employment. In August 2016, the unemployment rate among African Americans was 8.1 per cent. While this is almost twice the rate for whites -- 4.4 per cent -- this decline was only for black Americans in 5 per cent of the months since 1972, when the Bureau of Labour Statistics began to account for monthly black unemployment. Here is a complete scheme showing the unemployment rate month after month: Ryan Fornier stated on Twitter on January 31, 2021 \"Biden's administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\" But that's still less than it was in the past. The annual black poverty rate never fell below 30 per cent between 1966, the first year in which it was consistently tracked, and 1994. They were no less than they were in four previous years, from 1999 to 2002. This is the graph showing data from the late 1970s to 2014. The Green Line shows the rate for Afro-Americans. \u2022 Life expectancy shortly after 1900, black men can expect to live from birth until early 30s, and black women can expect to live until mid-30s. Since then, the average life expectancy of African-Americans has essentially doubled. Today, black men have life expectancy since birth in the low 1970s, and for black women it is in the high 1970s. The following is a chart from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing life expectancy trends from 1900 to 2000. It appears that whites have outlived blacks in their extended lives, but it also shows that both black and white have risen significantly: the figures from 1970 to 2013 show a similar pattern. \u2022 The rates of graduation from secondary schools and colleges of African-American descent have increased over time. The following graph shows black rates of graduation from secondary schools (higher lines) and black rates of graduation from universities (lower lines). And they've both been climbing since the mid-1970s, when the data series began. \u2022 Crime on many occasions, Trump said that crime was on the increase. There is evidence of a rise in growth levels in 2015 and 2016 - neither of which is a year when final federal data are available - at least in some cities, such as Chicago and Baltimore. However, as we have noted before, the rate of homicide and violent crime has fallen significantly over the past quarter century - both in large cities and in the country as a whole - so that it will take many years of significant increases to return to \"registration levels\" in the early 1990s. African Americans also experienced a decrease in the number of crime victims, at least until the end of 2014, which is the final data available last year. In 2005, for example, 32.7 per 1,000 Afro-Americans aged 12 years and over were victims of a violent crime. In 2013, the rate fell to 25.1 per cent, and by 2014 it had fallen to 22.5 per cent. Rates peaked in the early 1980s at about 40 per 1,000. Our Governor Trump said, \"Our African-American societies are certainly in the worst shape they've ever been. Never. Never. Never.\" Trump's aggravated statement lacked any scrutiny. There is no comparison between today &apos; s situation and slavery, or today &apos; s situation and the Jim Crow era. In the meantime, over the past half century, African Americans have made significant strides in life expectancy, educational attainment and other measures, although they continue to lag behind whites, and are currently experiencing unemployment and poverty rates that are approaching historical decline. We evaluate his statement with pants on fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/24e837e9-f924-4bfd-8798-7947f6df726", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04283"}
