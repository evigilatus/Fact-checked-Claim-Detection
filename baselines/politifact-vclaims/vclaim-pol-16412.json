It's clear he is referring to an annual survey done by\n\nOverdrive\n\nmagazine (\"The voice of the American trucker\"), which asks truck drivers to name the best and worst highways.\n\n\nWhen Huckabee took office in 1996,\n\nOverdrive's\n\nsurvey said Arkansas' roads were fifth worst in the United States. The state kept slipping in the rankings and by 2000 it was indeed the worst in the nation.\n\n\nThe shoddy highways persuaded the Arkansas Legislature to raise gasoline and diesel taxes in 1999, which paid for major repairs to the state's road network.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Interstate 30 in Arkansas was No. 4 on the list.\n\n\nYet despite the improvement that occurred under Huckabee, the state's roads still rate near the bottom overall.\n\n\nIn the January 2008 issue, Arkansas is rated fifth worst \u2013 the same as when Huckabee took office.\n\n\n\"They have done a lot of work,\" said Andy Duncan, a senior editor for the magazine. \"Nevertheless, the consensus is that they have a ways to go.\"\n\n\nAnd so while Huckabee is right that the state earned the honor for the most improved roads at one point in his term, it's a stretch to say that was the case when he left office. And Arkansas still lags behind other states. So we rate Huckabee's claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16412"}
