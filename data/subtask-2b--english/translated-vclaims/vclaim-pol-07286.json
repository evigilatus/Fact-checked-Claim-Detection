This is not the first time that Obama has been sniffing at this: the reporter of Associated Press Juliebes recently asked White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest about \"the irony in using your legal justification for these air strikes to authorize the military force that the President himself called for to abolish.\" So we wanted to check: does Obama justify his air strikes using the African Financial Union (AU) forces 2001 and 2002, while arguing that he wants to abolish the same AU force? When will the President wage a war? Under the War Powers Act 1973, the President has the power to wage war for 60 days before Congress requests the African Union or a declaration of war. Obama authorized air strikes in Iraq against ISIS on 7 August, until he implements what Obama called a \"sustainable counter-terrorism strategy\" against the Islamic State, and will need Congressional legislation. This is what Bush did in the immediate aftermath of the attacks of 11 September 2001. The Congress authorized the Federal Defence Forces (FDF), which gave Bush the power to use \"appropriate force\" against anyone behind the attacks. This was understood to mean Al-Qaida, and while the Islamic State was part of Al-Qaida, it has since been divided into ideological differences and spit on the leadership. In 2002, Congress approved another authorization from the African Finance Union to fight the Iraq war. However, in his address on the Islamic State on 10 September, Obama said: \"I have the authority to address the threat posed by ISIL,\" in the sense that he believes that the attack on ISIL is permitted under the African Union peacekeeping force, either from 2001 or 2002. Obama made a similar statement during a press interview on 7 September, but in both cases Obama did not explicitly state that he was using the AU forces in 2001 or 2002 to justify his actions. Others in the White House were more visible in its administration, though they were specifically named the African Finance Union 2001. When Bess Ernest dug on \"AUMF wanted Obama cancelled,\" Ernest responded by calling it \"AUFM which Obama believes still applies to this terrorist organization operating in Iraq and Syria.\" Various sources, including The New York Times and Time, cited a statement by a senior management to the media that specifically referred to the African Union peacekeeping force in 2001 as a justification for United States air attacks against ISIL. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. :: By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, despite the formal division of Al-Qaida and the Islamic State, the Administration &apos; s statement refers to \"a long history of attacks... on the people and interests of the United States, the extensive history of United States combat operations against ISIL and the position of ISIL. Although Obama himself was not publicly named the United Federal Armed Forces in 2001, others in his administration made it clear that he was the legal justification for his air strikes against the Islamic State. All that has been said, there is no doubt that Obama said that he wanted to abolish the African Finance Union in 2001. On May 23, 2013, a speech at the National Defense University -- from which Stuart got his slice -- Obama said that he looked \"to involve Congress and the American people in efforts to eventually refine and abolish the African Union mandate. Earlier, \"AUMF is now nearly 12 years old, so it clearly refers to the Federation in 2001. However, Obama's attitude is oversimplified. The Bess formula -- Obama called for the abolition of the African Finance Union and that \"African Finance Union wants to cancel\" -- means that Obama wants to cancel the African Finance Union immediately. That's not the case. In the statement to which Bass referred, Obama said that he wanted \"to refine the mandate of the African Union of Armed Forces and eventually abolish it.\" So refining comes first, canceling somewhere down the road. In fact, in the same speech, Obama referred to his administration's campaign against Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, which his administration justified using the African Union peacekeeping force in 2001. About a year after Obama &apos; s 2013 statement on the Unified Financial Force, a senior management (not named in the White House version) set a more specific timetable for refining and eliminating the African Union &apos; s financial power. The Obama administration said that the official would \"want to talk to Congress about the African Finance Union as we approach the end of the year (2014).\" On September 12, Ernest said that there were \"discussions between senior officials of the White House and members of Congress\" in response to a question about \"the revision, refinement or abolition of the African Finance Union 2001.\" In fact, there have been more than mere talks: since Obama &apos; s 2013 speech, the House of Representatives voted against two separate amendments to the Republic amendment. Adam Schiff, D-Calif, would have abolished the African Finance Union in 2001. However, as far as we know, the Obama administration has not commented on these amendments. Therefore, abolition may be somewhere below the line, and the Obama administration has consistently announced that it plans to change the African Finance Union 2001, but saying Obama wants to cancel the 2001 African Finance Union is a bit of a simplification. Our ruling is that the Obama administration uses \"a legal justification for these air strikes (on the Islamic State), and a statement of the military force that the President himself called for their abolition,\" and several other publications reiterate its view that Obama wanted the 2001 decision of the African Union on the Armed Forces to be rescinded. There is no doubt that the Obama administration is using the AU Force 2001 as a \"legal justification.\" Obama was not publicly named the Federal Armed Forces in 2001, but his press secretary and a statement by a senior administrative officer. However, to say that Obama \"calls for the abolition\" of the African Finance Union in 2001 is an excessive simplification. Obama said he wanted to work with Congress \"stick and, ultimately, cancel\" the 2001 African Finance Union, which means he wants to cancel it eventually, but not now. The other statements made by his Department were consistent with that view. The Pace statement could have used some additional clarifications or details, so we often evaluate its claim correctly.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07286"}
