With my good supporter, (Republican Gov.) Terry Branstad, we have implemented strong economic policy here in Iowa -- lower taxes, reduced job-killing regulations, and a balanced budget, and we are putting more of our hard-working Iowans back to work with new, good-paying jobs. Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States, while nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years that Congressman Braley has been there by 2.7 percent.\"\nBut we wondered: Is her statistical comparison between Iowa and the United States valid? We took a closer look. (Ernst\u2019s campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)\n'Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States.'\nOn the first part of the claim, Ernst has a point, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the federal government\u2019s official source of data about personal income.\nIn the most recent quarter for which data is currently available -- the second quarter of 2014 -- personal income in Iowa increased by 2.4 percent over the previous quarter in Iowa. Only three states had faster growth -- Nebraska (2.7 percent), North Dakota (2.7 percent) and Idaho (2.5 percent).\nBut some context serves to undercut the significance of this achievement.\nThe statistics for such short periods of time tend to be \"noisy\" -- that is, the numbers bounce around a lot. As an illustration, let\u2019s look at the statistics for the couple of quarters before the 2.4 percent increase. Moving backward one quarter at a time, personal income growth in Iowa clocked in at -0.6 percent, -0.5 percent, 1.0 percent, 0.0 percent, and -0.2 percent. This paints a very different picture of personal income growth in Iowa.\nTo effectively detect genuine trends, you need to study a longer period of time. Let\u2019s take a look at how Iowa did for full-year periods rather than quarters.\nBetween full-year 2012 and full-year 2013, Iowa had the 18th-highest percentage change in personal income among the 50 states, which is quite a bit weaker than the fourth-place finish Ernst cited.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa fared even more poorly between 2011 and 2012, when the state ranked 43rd nationally. This, too, is quite a different picture than the one she painted in the debate.\n'Nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years \u2026 by 2.7 percent.'\nNot if you look at median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly wage nationally in 2013 -- the most recent full year available -- was $776, up from $671 in 2008. Once you adjust the 2006 figure for inflation in 2013 dollars, it works out to be $775.37 -- meaning there was basically no change at all between 2006 and 2013. It\u2019s virtually the same if you inflation-adjust the data for 2005 -- there\u2019s no significant change in median weekly earnings between 2005 and 2013.\n\"What I always say when writing about wage developments, at least after the number of employed Americans started rising again in 2010, is that real wages are basically flat,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.\nMeanwhile, the comparison Ernst offered -- of strong Iowa growth amid national stagnation -- is flawed, for two reasons.\n\u2022 She\u2019s comparing two different statistics. Personal income and real wages aren\u2019t the same thing. Real wages are a component of personal income, but not the only one. They are derived from separate data sources, and they use very different methodologies.\n\u2022 She\u2019s comparing two different periods of time. You can\u2019t simply compare the most recent quarter with the past eight years and get a meaningful contrast. It\u2019s comparing apples and oranges.\nAll this said, Ernst does have a point: Real wages have grown faster in Iowa over the past eight years then they have nationally. If you start the clock in 2005, real wages in Iowa increased by 1.6 percent by 2013, and if you start the clock in 2006, they increased by 1.8 percent by 2013. And she also has a point that stagnant real earnings growth over eight years is nothing to be proud of, even if she exaggerates by blaming this situation on Braley. (Lots of factors shape the economy beyond just one minority-party member of Congress.)\nOur ruling\nErnst said that \"Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States, while nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years that Congressman Braley has been there by 2.7 percent.\"\nIowa did rank fourth nationally in personal income growth, but only for the most recent quarter, and when compared to earlier quarters, this high rate seems like a statistical anomaly. Meanwhile, she\u2019s wrong that real wages declined by 2.7 percent over the past eight years, although she does have a point that Iowa did somewhat better on this score than did the nation as a whole.\nEqually problematic, Ernst\u2019s comparison between Iowa\u2019s economy and the nation\u2019s is questionable because it appears to compare quarterly data for one statistic to eight years of a different statistic. Economists say this isn\u2019t a sound method. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07141"}
