We now need to stop saying that. In the U.S. 38% of those hospitalized are under 35. In France half of those in the ICU are under 65.\"\nWe only have 3 months of information on #Covid_19We have created the perception that younger people have nothing to worry about.

But his U.S. number is wrong.\nFor the record, his numbers on France were correct. The head of France\u2019s national health agency said March 15 that 50% of people in intensive care are under 60 or under age 65. But we wanted to focus on the U.S. numbers.\nExperts warn that U.S. hospitalization data is preliminary, which means the numbers could change in the coming weeks as testing becomes more widespread.\nData shows younger people hospitalized, but older groups more frequently\nOne day before Rubio\u2019s tweet, the CDC reported there were 508 patients known to have been hospitalized as a result of coronavirus. The hospitalizations represented 12% of U.S. cases between Feb. 12 and March 16.\nThe data did not include an age group breakdown specific to those under 35. What the CDC did report was that 20% of those hospitalized were ages 20-44, and 18% were 45-54. If we add up those two age groups, we get a total of 38%. We asked Rubio\u2019s spokespersons if that was the 38% he was referencing, but we did not get a response.\n\nMajor news outlets including the New York Times and NPR used that 38% statistic to point out that younger populations are also vulnerable to coronavirus. That\u2019s an important message amid spring break, as some college students have ignored the recommendations to avoid large gatherings and have poured onto beaches in Florida, leading many counties or cities to close beaches.\u00a0\nThe CDC data shows that the elderly have the highest fatality rate.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe March 18 report by the CDC states that the figures are based on preliminary data and include several limitations, including that data on age and outcomes, including hospitalization, were missing for between 9% and 53% of the cases. Also, further follow-up is needed to determine the outcomes among active cases and data on other risk factors, including if patients had underlying health conditions.\n\"At the current point, the data is too fluid to have confidence in the accuracy of any statement regarding how COVID-19 affects different age groups,\" said Volker Mai, a University of Florida epidemiologist.\nHowever, Mai said, it\u2019s important to clear up any misperception that young people are immune from the disease. Younger populations are at risk of contracting COVID-19, especially young people with underlying conditions.\n\"Since we are just at the start of the epidemic here, we don\u2019t have enough data to make strong conclusions about age-specific risk of serious illness and/or death in the U.S. yet,\" said Cindy Prins, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, in an email.\nThe reason, Prins said, is a lack or lag in testing\nOur ruling\nRubio tweeted \"in the U.S. 38% of those hospitalized are under 35.\"\nWe could not find any current data that matches Rubio\u2019s tweet. It is possible that he was citing widely reported data that included people up to age 54.\nThe CDC reported that 20% of the hospitalizations were ages 20-44 and 18% were 45-54. But the data is preliminary, so it\u2019s challenging to draw conclusions at this stage about the ages of people hospitalized.\u00a0\nRubio\u2019s office didn\u2019t get back to us but we have to wonder if the mistake in his tweet amounted to a simple transcription error.\nRubio does have a point that younger people are vulnerable to coronavirus \u2014 it\u2019s not only older people who have been hospitalized. But because the data point is wrong, we rate this statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18179"}
