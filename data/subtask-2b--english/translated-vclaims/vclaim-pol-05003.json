Since then, readers have contacted us to consider further evidence of the fund-raising operations of the Democratic Party, in particular the government parties that return the funds to the National Democratic Commission. We updated and reassessed this fact-finding based on new information, changing the classification from mostly correct to half correct. You can read an archival version of the original report here. You had to pay - or collect - up to $353,000 per couple to attend recent fund-raising meetings for the hopeful democratic Hillary Clinton, including a reception hosted at the home of Representative George Clooney. After the relationship attracted protestors supporting Bernie Sanders, Chuck Todd, NBC's host to the press, Clooney asked what happened when he confronted them. Clooney said he's accused of being a company, which is one of the funny things you can say about me. And Todd said, \"The huge amount of money we make, and that's a lot, but the huge amount of money we make isn't going to Hillary to run for president, \"He's going to Congress and senators to try to get Congress back. And the important reason is that we have to get the Senate back because we need to confirm the justice of the Supreme Court because the fifth vote on the Supreme Court That's why I'm doing it.\" Here, we're checking Clooney's claim, \"The huge amount of money we make, and that's a lot, but the huge amount of money we make is not going to Hillary to run for president... What we found was that Clooney is technically accurate about most of the money not going to Clinton's campaign, but not necessarily going to Congress and Senator. Clooney is right about direct support for Clinton's presidential campaign. Federal law provides that individuals cannot give more than $2,700 to the main campaign of a presidential candidate. A further $2,700 could be raised for the general elections. It doesn't matter whether you give it directly or a friend collect it from you on behalf of the candidate, the limit is there. Where the rest of those big dollar donations end up a little labyrinth. We'll try to get you to her. In this case, fund-raising events were organized in Clinton, California, on behalf of the Hillary Victoria Fund, which distributes money to the Clinton Campaign Committee, Hillary America. But it also distributes money to the National Democratic Commission and the State Party. The donor may also relinquish up to $33,400 per year for the National Democratic Council and $10,000 per year for each State party to be used to obtain the election of its candidates for federal office. If you do the calculation, with 32 States Parties included in the Victory Fund, this is $100,356. State parties are generally mandated to assist in the election of state-level Democrats, and the National Democratic Council does the same at the national level. The method of splitting donations is explained at the bottom of Hillary's Victory Fund page on Clinton's website. The first $2,700 goes to Clinton and the next $33,400 goes to the National Self-Defense Council and the rest goes to the States Parties. How does this translate into total donations for each group? If you look at the money that comes out, which is available through campaign financing reports, Clinton seems to be getting most of the money. According to the Centre for Responsive Policy by the end of 2015, Hillary Al-Nusri provided $4.4 million to Clinton, $2.3 million to the National Democratic Congress and $2.2 million to state political parties. This makes Clinton &apos; s share up to 2015 exactly about 50 percent. In the first quarter of this year, Clinton accounted for 63 per cent of the funds officially spent on campaigns. Polytecco stated that the Fund also spent $6.7 million on \"Internet advertising, which often looks like Clinton campaign announcements, as well as $5.5 million on direct marketing.\" Clinton's campaign gets the lion's share of the money raised by the Victory Fund, and Clinton's spokesman, Josh Shoreen, says, because most donors give much less, and everything up to $2,700 per person dedicated to going to Hillary for America first. When the donor exceeds that limit, the surplus leaks for the benefit of the National and State Democratic Committees. Or - in the case of States Parties - this is how it appears on paper. Facebook was published on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook video showing the man upset because he was added to the no-fly list to break into the Capitol. \u2022 On 11 January 2021, the records of the Federal Electoral Commission show that in most cases the funds provided to the parties in the states were immediately redirected to the National Democratic Council. Money won't stay with the states at all. On May 2, Politico published a story that 88 percent of the state's funds were immediately transferred to DNA. In some cases, the parties in the State did not even know that the money had entered and exited their accounts even after the incident. The Hillary Al-Nusri box sent $214,100 to Minnesota, for example, and that State party did not keep one dime. It was directed to DNA, which otherwise would not have been able to accept the money \"because it came from donors, most of whom had already reached the limit of the National Party Commission,\" as reported by the Politico newspaper. We contacted the National Democratic Party and Clinton's campaign to try to understand what was forcing the states to send money immediately to the National Democratic Party. We couldn't get straight answers. The Clinton campaign provided a copy of the agreement with States parties, but does not contain any language that requires such a transfer. Although NDP spokesman Luis Miranda said that the terms of the agreement called on the states to send funds to NCD for electoral infrastructure, the spokesman for Clinton Schorin confirmed that state committees were free to keep any money they wanted. However, on 20 February, the Washington Post newspaper story of Clinton's fund-raising efforts says the Executive Director of the Utah Democratic Party said that State party officials understood that they were supposed to return the funds to National Command headquarters. So if the money belongs to the DNA, what is it spent on? The comprehensive response of both the Clinton campaign and the National Democratic Congress Party was that the funds being transferred to the National Democratic Congress Party were in fact being used to help local Democrats obtain the election. These candidates need voter information, research, media monitoring, organizational capacity and other infrastructure services provided by the National Commission for the Defence of the People to run a successful campaign, and this is how funds are used. However, these services also benefit the Clinton campaign. \"The process used by Hillary Victoria was a common practice for many years,\" said Bob Persack, a senior colleague at the Centre for Responsive Policy. \"The states always agree because they have no choice. The transfer of funds to the National Party is a condition for participation. They're doing it in the hope of getting some good intentions from the National Party down the road.\" As to the degree to which the system really helps candidates from the House of Representatives and the Senate, Persack said that there was no precise answer. Note that the Congressional Committees of the Party are not party to the transaction. \"If the aim is to support such campaigns, it is certain that the most responsible national organizations will be involved. The positions of the National Democratic Party and the National Assembly Party are traditionally held by their presidential candidates during the electoral year, and the first priority of each spending decision is how it relates to the presidential race.\" \"If that campaign becomes markedly less competitive, then the National Party may move to other races, but this will happen in that sequence and under those circumstances.\" There is one important last observation: the spokespersons for the Clinton Campaign and the National Democratic Congress Party have said that the many millions collected for the benefit of States parties have not yet been distributed, but will soon be distributed. The governor Clooney said, \"The huge amount of money we make, he's not going to Hillary to run for president. .................................................................................... He'll go to Congressmen and senators to try to get Congress back.\" Clooney is right that most of the large dollar donations will not go to Clinton's presidential campaign. Under the law, they can't. Whether money is \"to go to Congressmen and senators to try to restore Congress\" is a much different story. Most of the funds appear to have ended at the National Commission for the Defence of the People, not in States parties, as expected from individual donors. According to the National Party, the funds are used in the electoral campaign infrastructure, which will benefit candidates from the House of Representatives and the Senate. But it's gonna help Clinton, too. The claim of Clooney is partially accurate but omits important details. We value it half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4b455cd6-50e1-47a5-9314-36a64b25cdc6", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05003"}
