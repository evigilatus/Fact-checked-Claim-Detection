Nathan Deal said. He could either trim the popular college scholarship program or let it go bust, he wrote in an op-ed published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \n\nLetting HOPE die was not an option. He signed cuts into law March 15. \u00a0\n\n\"This program has helped turn our University System into one of the best in the Southeast, with two institutions ranked in the top 20 of public universities in the country,\" he wrote March 21. \n\nThis claim made PolitiFact Georgia reporters curious. HOPE has been credited with a lot of things. But improving the University System of Georgia? That was news to us. We checked this claim out. \n\nHOPE awarded its first scholarship in 1993. Until recently, it gave full tuition at Georgia\u2019s public colleges to students who graduated from high school with at least a 3.0 grade-point average -- so long as they maintained that average in college. \u00a0\n\nUnder \"Enduring HOPE,\" the revamped program, only the state\u2019s top students will receive full tuition, and they must maintain a 3.3 in college to keep the award. Students with at least a 3.0 will still get HOPE, but the amount will vary each year. \n\nA Deal spokeswoman told us that the governor\u2019s op-ed referred to U.S. News and World Report rankings for the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Georgia. Sure enough, Georgia Tech ranks seventh among public universities. UGA is 18th. \n\nIn 1997, Georgia Tech ranked ninth. The University of Georgia didn\u2019t crack the top 25. \n\nBut has HOPE helped that happen? And does a rankings jump really mean HOPE helped turned Georgia\u2019s University System into one of the \"best in the Southeast\"? \n\nCollege rankings, such as the ones from U.S. News, are regularly criticized by educators who think they are a poor measure of a school\u2019s quality. They argue that the numbers say little about how well colleges educate their students and put pressure on administrators to game their numbers. \n\nStill, if UGA\u2019s and Georgia Tech\u2019s rankings are rising, something good is going on, right? \n\nWe reviewed studies on the topic and talked to experts on merit-based scholarship programs such as HOPE. They agreed that Georgia\u2019s program encouraged better-performing high school students who might have left the state to stay. \u00a0\n\nFor instance, a study found that in 1993, only 23 percent of Georgia\u2019s high school graduates with SAT scores that topped 1500 stayed in state. By April 2002, 76 percent stayed.\n\nAnd while Georgia high school seniors\u2019 SAT scores grew by only 30 points from HOPE\u2019s start through 2005, the scores of the state\u2019s college freshmen jumped by 60 points.\n\nThis dramatic change helped rankings at top Georgia schools, especially UGA, rise. \"Student selectivity\" makes up 15 percent of a school\u2019s U.S. News ranking. This measure includes students\u2019 SAT and ACT scores, class rank and what proportion of applicants a university turns away. \u00a0\n\nOther factors have boosted the rankings of Georgia\u2019s top schools as well. \n\nNationwide, research shows that the cost of higher education has climbed so high that high-performing students who would have only considered private schools are looking at top state schools, said Donald E. Heller, a professor of education at Pennsylvania State University who has studied HOPE. Also, flagship schools are working harder to recruit talent from other states. Those students tend to have higher scores and class rankings than in-state students. \n\nIn addition, researchers have found that HOPE has negative effects. \n\nBecause HOPE puts Georgia on the hook for college tuition, University System leaders have raised tuition rates at a much slower pace than schools in surrounding states, said David B. Mustard, a UGA economist who has been involved in a half-dozen studies that analyze the program\u2019s effects. \n\nThis helps state coffers, but over time, it hurts a university\u2019s ability to retain high-quality staff and keep low student-to-teacher ratios, Mustard and other researchers have found. Between 1993 and 2002, the number of faculty focusing on teaching fell in Georgia\u2019s research universities by 3.2 percent and at two-year colleges by 23.2 percent. Meanwhile, enrollment grew. \n\nAnd while HOPE may help students pay for school, it did not make them more diligent. \u00a0Research comparing recipients with out-of-state students found that to maintain the required 3.0 GPA, HOPE scholars took easier course loads, withdrew from more classes or enrolled more frequently in summer school, where it\u2019s easier to get higher grades. \n\nTo sum up: \n\nRankings aren\u2019t complete measures of a school\u2019s quality. But as Deal said, HOPE did help Georgia\u2019s top schools improve their rankings because it encouraged higher-caliber students to stay in state. \n\nThe downside is fewer faculty are teaching more students, and HOPE students are taking easier or fewer courses. \n\nDeal is correct, but his statement could use more context. We rate his claim Mostly True. \n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13366"}
