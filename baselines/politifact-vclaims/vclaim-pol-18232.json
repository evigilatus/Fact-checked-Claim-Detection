Bernie Sanders, who tweeted on April 29 that if Trump can sell $100 coins, he can use his power to manufacture more supplies for medical workers.\u00a0\nIf the White House Gift Shop is going to produce $100 COVID-19 coins, Trump can sure as hell utilize the Defense Production Act to manufacture the gloves, gowns, and masks our medical workers desperately need. https://t.co/Wr6Y1uwG0i\u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) April 29, 2020 \nThe White House Gift Shop is a private company that is no longer affiliated with the U.S. government.\u00a0\nThe coins are listed at $125, and the company says it will donate the proceeds to COVID-19 medical research.\nThe shop has sold other commemorative coins in the past, such as a D-Day memorial coin and one for the anniversary of the U.S. embassy moving to Jerusalem.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, the website started selling a commemorative coin celebrating a summit meeting between Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un that ended up getting canceled.\u00a0\nThe shop says the new COVID-19 coins are part of its \"Historic Moments in History Series,\" which includes a coin for the creation of the U.S. Space Force.\n\"White House Gift Shop\" and \"White House Gift Shop, Est. 1946\" are trademarks registered to Giannini Strategic Enterprises, a limited liability company based in Lititz, Pa., according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database.\nAnthony Giannini is listed as the CEO on the company\u2019s website. Giannini did not respond to a request for comment, but he told fact-checking website Snopes that the shop is \"not affiliated with the White House, nor is the White House involved in any of our decisions, products, or operations.\"\nWhile the operation isn\u2019t connected to the White House now, it once was and dates back to the Truman administration.\u00a0\nAccording to a LancasterOnline.com report, the gift shop started as a fund to benefit the family of a slain officer of the White House police, now the U.S. Secret Service. It was originally set up in the basement of the White House before it relocated to the nearby executive mansion.\u00a0\nThe now-defunct Secret Service Uniformed Division Benefit Fund ran the gift shop before running into financial trouble. Giannini told Snopes that the ownership of the gift shop was officially transferred to his corporation in 2012, and he was awarded a trademark for the name in 2016.
