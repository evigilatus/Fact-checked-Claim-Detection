They are now under scrutiny for lack of respect for science. \"This is Kelly O'Hara,\" an article started on Facebook on July 8, with a photo of one of Rabino's teammates. \"She's a female football player who rushed to save the American flag after throwing it on the field and crushing it by her stupid colleagues. Kelly O'Hara is the true face of true femaleism. Let's make it famous instead of haters with the functions of bad dyes that distort science for attention.\" The reference to poor dye jobs is clear drilling in Rabino, whose blonde hair was purple during the World Cup. This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Your video assistant at the Politic Fact is here to help a real fantasy. The article echoed a tweet by former Marine Jonathan Gilliam, who on July 7 published a video of Rapino and Allie Long and Alex Morgan celebrating the World Cup. (You can see a video here.) \"You must be disturbed by this non-national narcissistic behavior\" books. @mpinoe is not a hero or an example. I came back and watched the whole celebration in the field. Rabino didn't want to have anything to do with American science before she stepped on it. @represive \"Fattered Instagram Publics on January 12, 2021 at Instagram says that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 January 16, 2012, this non-national narcissistic behavior should bother you. @mpinoe is not a hero or an example. I came back and watched the whole celebration in the field. Rabino didn't want to have anything to do with American science before she stepped on it. ==See also===========The obnoxious picture.twitter.com/Kevbe7jjYt - Jonathan Te Gilliam (@JGiliam_SEAL) 7 July 2019 when the clip begins, Long holds the cup in one hand and an American mark in the other. You hand over the Cup to Rapino and then you take the flag while she and Rapino and Morgan start what looks like a choreographer's move that ends up throwing their hands in the air. Rapino's foot appears to be touching with science as the players begin to jam forward but O'Hara throws in the frame and lifts the flag again and delivers it to her. The incident received some news coverage, including from Fox News, which stated that \"Long was shot down briefly by the American flag during her celebration with the winner of gold boots and naked cash, Trump Megan Rabino.\" Fox doesn't say that any of the players are trampling on the flag. Here, we believe that words are important. It is true that Long dropped the flag on the ground for a few seconds during the team's celebration, but saying that the players are trampling on it points to something worse than what happened. But more than that, no one seems to have stepped on the flag. After Rapino takes a step forward, Long can pick it up. In Facebook commentary, some Facebook users encouraged O'Hara to do so. But the others were skeptical about how to put the account in the context of what happened in the field after the U.S. team defeated the Netherlands 2-0. \"Thanks for picking up our flag,\" one man said. \"I've seen that video several times. I've never seen any of these girls step on the flag. Kelly got it before they could. I'm not pretending to see something that makes liberals look bad. I don't have much (as is the case). They do enough obvious things.\" We're categorizing this article on Facebook as wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00399"}
