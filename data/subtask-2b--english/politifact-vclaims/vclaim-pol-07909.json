U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., asked Holder about requested grants to \"encourage development of innovative gun safety technology.\" Holder explained the grant request stems from a White House-driven meeting amid talk of gun regulation reforms.\n\"We talked about how guns can be made more safe by making them either through fingerprint identification, the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you might wear, how guns can be used only by the person who is lawfully in possession of the weapon.\n\"It\u2019s those kinds of things that I think we want to try to explore so that we can make sure that people have the ability to enjoy their Second Amendment rights, while at the same time decreasing the misuse of weapons that lead to the kinds of things that we see on a daily basis, you know, where people, kids especially, are struck down by ...\"\nHarris cut him off, saying \"sure, no one wants that to occur,\" and moved on.\nHolder\u2019s comment about new gun technology was picked up a few days later in an April 7 Washington Free Beacon story under the headline, \"Holder: We Want to Explore Gun Tracking Bracelets.\" From there, it was picked up by Fox News, InfoWars, Townhall.com and the National Rifle Association, among others. In each case, the coverage focused on the idea of \"gun tracking bracelets.\"\nBut the technology doesn\u2019t track gun owners, and it doesn\u2019t always require a bracelet.\nSmart guns and the Department of Justice\nHolder had smart guns on his mind because of President Barack Obama and reforms he sought after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings.\nObama directed Holder, via one of 23 executive orders, to release a report on gun safety technology \"and challenge the private sector to develop innovative technologies.\" As he mentioned in his testimony, the department\u2019s National Institute of Justice released a report in June 2013 assessing the marketplace, and Holder chaired a meeting with industry leaders and experts at the White House.\nSmart guns are also called \"owner-authorized guns,\" \"childproof guns\" and \"personalized guns.\" Basically, these are firearms made with electronic chips and sensors that can discern an authorized user from an unauthorized user. The gun will fire if it recognizes the owner and won\u2019t if the owner is not recognized.\nSome high-tech models include a fingerprint reader that works kind of like the one in new iPhones (or James Bond\u2019s personalized gun in Skyfall). Other models include the capability to read a radio signal from a transmitter embedded into a bracelet, ring, watch or pin worn by the gun owner, or even a chip implanted in the hand.\n\"If that is within a certain programmed distance to the gun, the gun mechanically makes itself operable,\" said Stephen Teret, a smart-gun proponent,\u00a0professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and director of the Center for Law and the Public\u2019s Health. \"If it\u2019s not within a certain distance, the gun won't work.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the short signals emitted in smart-gun technology do not function like GPS on mobile phones and other devices. The lack of GPS technology would prevent the government from identifying and tracking gun owners, should the government try, said Mike Bazinet, spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a\u00a0firearm and ammunition trade group. Bazinet noted that doesn't mean the group isn't concerned about that prospect.\nThe technology could require a bracelet. It could also require a watch, a ring, a pin, or even just a fingerprint, experts say.\nThe point is there is no plan to identify gun owners with a \"scarlet letter\" bracelet.\nOrigins and controversies\nTeret says the earliest smart gun was developed by Smith & Wesson in the 1880s. The manufacturer added a metal lever to the back of its handguns, requiring a person to press the the lever and the trigger at the same time to fire the weapon. A child\u2019s hand would be too small to do that, thus preventing accidental injuries and deaths.\nManufacturers started thinking about incorporating electronics into guns in the early 1990s to make them safer. The concept had support from the Bill Clinton administration, lost steam during the George W. Bush years, and then re-emerged after the Newtown, Conn., school shootings under Obama, Teret said.\nInternational companies, such as Armatix in Germany and TriggerSmart in Ireland, are ahead of the curve, thanks in part to less political resistance, Teret said. But there is technology emerging in the United States. Utah-based Kodiak Industries is offering the Intelligun, a fingerprint-locking system installed onto a 1911-style, .45 caliber pistol, for $399.\nThis year, a California gun retailer told the Washington Post he planned to sell the Armatix iP1 .22 caliber pistol, an $1,800 product that works with a black stopwatch and PIN code that emits radio signals to the gun when worn by the right user. It was supposed to be the first smart gun sold in the United States, but the owner and Armatix representative received backlash from gun rights activists, and the plans were scrapped.\nHere\u2019s what the iP1 looks like:\n\nIt\u2019s not the development of smart guns that concerns the firearms industry,\u00a0Bazinet said.\u00a0It\u2019s government\u2019s embrace of them. A New Jersey law, the only one of its kind, requires after three years from the first smart gun being sold in the United States that all new guns sold in the state be built with this technology.\nTo Bazinet, smart guns won\u2019t be ready for mass use until police forces are using them. His group has warned about defective guns and dead batteries while saying consumers should be able to buy them if they want.\nOf course, none of this information changes the veracity of Palin\u2019s comments about ID bracelets for gun owners. It just shows how wrong she was.\nEmails to Palin\u2019s political action committee were not returned.\nOur ruling\nAccording to Palin, Holder recently revealed \"this idea to have government have gun owners wear bracelets, special bracelets, that would identify you as a gun owner.\"\nThat\u2019s far from the truth.\nHolder said\u00a0he wants the federal government to explore gun safety measures, including smart-gun technology that would prevent weapons from being fired by anyone except their rightful owner.\nThe comment in question came as he explained why his agency is seeking federal money for grants to spur research into safer guns. He listed fingerprint identification and the gun talking \"to a bracelet or something that you might wear\" as tools that could prevent a gun owner\u2019s firearm from being used by someone else.\u00a0Some smart guns are powered by bracelets with embedded radio signal transmitters, but that\u2019s just one way this could work.\nThe purpose of accessories worn in order to fire a smart gun is not to help the government track owners or identify them (again, Holder is pursuing no such policy). The goal of the emerging technology is to minimize shootings caused by suicides, children or stolen guns.\nWe rate Palin\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07909"}
