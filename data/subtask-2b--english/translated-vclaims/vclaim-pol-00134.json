Her first attempt got in trouble. She said in a TV commercial broadcast on September 4th. However, the citations to Benom Coleman, which were used in the declaration to support the claim, were inaccurate. She cited Cox for voting in 2013 against the State budget with an increase in the number of teachers when he was actually in favour of it. Another delegate was John Cox, who opposed the budget. Bjonom Coleman stopped the announcement, and placed a new version the following day with the same allegation and video, but modified sources. The Cox campaign says that commercials are still inaccurate. So we checked the second ad to see if Cox was a former teacher, associated with special interest in denying teacher growth. Cox joined the General Assembly in 1990. We traced his vote on the teacher's allowances from 2005, the first year that Benom Coleman claimed that Cox was opposed to wage increases. Cox, a retired teacher, was in a strong position to influence teachers &apos; wages. From 2005 to 2017, he was a member of the Budget Writing Appropriations Committee, a subcommittee of which oversees funds going to public schools, and he was a member of a small group of negotiators in the Chamber of Deputies who worked on final spending deals with the Senate. He became a speaker in 2018. Teachers &apos; allowances are not allocated to vote in the General Assembly. As items appear in thick government budgets hundreds of pages long. Since 2005, the Legislature has approved seven budgets with permanent increases in teachers &apos; wages, and Cox voted for each budget. These are increases: *2005, 3%; *2006, 3%; *2007. 3%;*2013, 2%;*2015, 1.5%;*2018, 3%;*2019, 2%. The State paid half the amount of each increase and the municipalities were responsible for the remainder of the increase, and there were also two times when Cox voted before the General Assembly to approve the increase in teachers &apos; wages and subsequently supported its abolition before its entry into force because of the decline in State revenues. In 2008, Cox supported a 2 per cent increase to begin on 1 July 2009. In early 2009, as the State slipped into the Great Recession, Cox voted before the General Assembly to abolish wage increases. In 2016, 2% supported the start of July 1, 2017 if the expected State revenue did not fall above 1% below expectations. Income did not achieve that goal, and in early 2017 Cox voted before the General Assembly to cancel the increase. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On 20 January 2021 in general, Cox voted tirelessly every year to obtain progressive copies of the State budget approved by the Appropriations Committee, the House of Representatives and the General Assembly as a whole. Don't forget that it has an influential role to play in every step. In its second amended declaration, Beyonom Coleman's sources offered three citations in support of her claim that Cox \"acceded to the special interests of denying the increase of teachers.\" They're all at least eight years old. The spokesman for Cox, Parker Slaiboh, said that the speaker didn't remember any of the incidents. An example of this is a 2005 bill that would have set a policy objective of raising the salaries of teachers in Virginia to the national average. The bill was approved by the Senate, which did not set a target date for reaching the target or seeking money. :: He died in the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee, on which Cox sat without being put to a vote. There is no record of any action taken by Cox on the draft law. Rob Silverstein, director of the Benium Coleman campaign, said that this was equivalent to Cox's opposition to raising teachers' salaries to the national average. Silverstein said, \"He could have moved the bill forward, but he let her die.\" Slaiboh stated that in 2005 Cox was a small member of the 22-person committee and did not have the capacity to present the bill. He noted that this summer Cox called for the national average wage to be paid in four years. Silverstein rejected this procedure as an election year trick. Phnom Coleman also quotes a failed 2011 bill as evidence of Cox's opposition to teacher education. This would have allowed local school boards to use unspent funds to receive a non-recurrent allowance from teachers of up to 3 per cent of their salaries. The legislation was passed by an unregistered vote on the seven-member Subcommittee of Cox. The third citation of Bjonom Coleman is a confusing editorial published in the Virginia-Pelut newspaper on 31 August 2008. He said that Cox and other delegates had supported a change in the formula for funding public schools \"that would put an end to the State's obligation to bear a share of the supplementary increases granted by cities and districts.\" Surprisingly, the State has no obligation - now or later - to pay part of the teachers who grow up in towns. And vice versa. We found nothing to support in our search for state newspapers. We asked Silverstein whether he knew the details of the editorial statement. \"The story speaks for itself,\" he said. The key to the Benom Coleman Declaration is her claim that Cox \"acceded to private interests\" in \"banning\" teachers from paying salaries. Our legislative memory, dating back to 1986, does not mention any systematic pressure against increasing the number of teachers. The economy has been the driving force: in good times, teachers usually receive allowances; in difficult times, they do not receive such allowances. We asked Silverstein to identify special interests. He said he was driving and he'd come back with an answer. We're still waiting. Our television announcement, Governor Benom Coleman, says that Cox joined private interests to deny teachers the promotion. She had to withdraw the announcement temporarily because she claimed that Cox had voted against the state budget for 2013 with an increase in the number of teachers when, in fact, he supported it. The corrected Bjonom Coleman declaration offers three citations in support of its claim, all of which are at least seven years old. Two cases concerned the death of invoices in the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee, where Cox was a member, one in 2005, and would have set an open target for raising teachers &apos; salaries to the national average; the other would have allowed school boards to spend surpluses in 2013 for a one-time bonus. The third source is two confusing sentences at an opening in 2008. Cox says he doesn't remember any of these events and it would be nice to remember them. There is no evidence of a recorded vote in Phnom Penh, although Cox, if followed in the form, was likely to be in line with the republican majority in the Committee. None of its evidence revolves around Cox's behavior when there's money on the table for salary increases. Since 2005, there have been seven budgets raising teachers &apos; salaries and the voice of Cox for each budget. On two other occasions, he supported budgets with wage increases, and a year later he voted before the General Assembly to abolish them before they came into effect because of the higher level of State revenue. All that has been said is that Cox's record has been identical to that of the legislature since 2005. I voted for nine trips for the teachers and twice to cancel them later. Pinum Coleman doesn't provide evidence that Cox joined the private interests to stop the teacher's promotion. When this combined with the wrong source on her first announcement, which is still posted on her Twitter page - the complete claim of Benom Coleman is unsubstantiated. We evaluate it with pants on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00134"}
