During the announcement, Brady compared the United States tax code to other countries\u2019 and made one notable claim about United States exporters.\n\"No longer will we be the only major country that taxes its own exports,\" Brady said. He wrote something similar in a Wall Street Journal editorial.\nThis caught our eye, given a clause in the Constitution \u2014 Article I, Section 9 \u2014 \u00a0stating \"No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\"\nSo what was Brady referring to? A spokesperson for Brady referred us to the GOP\u2019s \"Our Better Way\" tax plan. So we dug in.\n\u2018Our Better Way\u2019\nThe plan points to one aspect of the current tax code: the use of a federal corporate income tax rather than a federal consumption tax.\nLet\u2019s explain.\nMany countries beside the United States use a \"value-added\" consumption tax in addition to an income tax. The VAT is complicated to explain, but in essence applies taxes throughout the production chain and not just at the end like a normal sales tax.\nOne aspect of the VAT is \"border adjustability,\" which means the country removes the \"value-added\" tax when it\u2019s applied to exports, said Richard Schmalbeck, a professor of law at Duke University.\n\"VATs are consumption taxes, and it wouldn't be appropriate for the French to tax consumption by residents of other countries,\" Schmalbeck said. \"The border adjustments assure that the tax will be borne only by French consumers.\"\nPoint being, other countries\u2019 national consumption taxes (which the United States\u00a0does not have) do not tax exports. But Brady is missing something in his comparison.\nIncome taxes\nOther countries\u2019 income taxes do capture exports under their umbrella, experts told us.\nSome of the income from exported goods is still made from domestic manufacturing, said H. David Rosenbloom, a professor of taxation at New York University, who called Brady\u2019s claim \"incomplete.\"\n\"When BMW manufactures an automobile in Germany, I would doubt very much that the income attributable to the manufacturing activity is exempt from German income taxation,\" Rosenbloom said.\nExempting foreign export sales from income tax is also not an easy task, said Peter Barnes, a senior lecturing fellow at Duke University. Companies would have to keep separate books on domestic and foreign sales.\nHe added that some countries in the past, China and India notably, have done this. However, such exemptions are not standard practice, Barnes said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, agreed. He said other countries\u2019 income taxes would impose some burden on exports, even if exports are exempted from their consumption taxes.\n\"The \u2018territorial\u2019 corporate income taxes that most countries have are still origin-based taxes (i.e., not border adjusted),\" Rosenberg said. \"The base is essentially domestic production and those taxes apply to domestically produced goods whether they are sold at home or abroad.\"\nA new system\nAmong other measures designed to promote international competitiveness, the GOP plan wants to transform the United States\u2019 current corporate income tax system, which currently lacks border adjustments, into what is called a \"destination, cash-flow based\" income tax.\nThis new system would tax net cash flow, deduct exported sales and impose the income tax on imports. Thus, the new tax protocol provides for income taxes on the \"border adjustments\" other countries use for VAT consumption taxes.\nTo deduct exports, companies would subtract sales abroad from revenue otherwise taxed, Rosenberg said.\nHowever, Rosenberg and other economists are also not sold on how problematic the current state of affairs actually is.\n\"Most economists would not expect any significant change in the terms of trade from this tax swap,\" he said.\nBarnes also suggested that the new tax system could compel other countries to move to a destination-based system, hurting U.S. businesses.\n\"Imagine if Boeing owed income tax to every country where it sold a plane,\" Barnes said. \"Or Apple.\"\nIt is also unclear that border adjustments under the new approach would be allowed by current international tax law, Rosenberg said. Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, also wrote the World Trade Organization might not approve this new plan.\nA few exceptions\nEven if you believe Brady broadly has something of a point comparing the U.S. system to VAT countries, he\u2019s wrong on the specifics.\nOther countries do apply a direct export tax on goods. Most of these are in developing countries and are imposed only on select agricultural goods, according to a WTO report.\nBut a few countries that impose export taxes are countries belonging to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (a typical benchmark for a major country). Norway, Turkey and Mexico have export taxes for a few select goods. Brazil has an export tax on all goods, up to 30 percent, although officials say these taxes are typically not applied.\nOur ruling\nBrady said that the United States is the only country that taxes its own exports, a problem the GOP tax plan intends to fix.\nOther countries do exempt exports from their consumption taxes using \"border-adjustments.\" However, experts told us that Brady\u2019s statement ignores the income taxes of other countries, which do end up taxing export income, at least in part.\nFor that reason, we rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/232eaee9-6d5f-4e86-863e-162ba667e2af", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04770"}
