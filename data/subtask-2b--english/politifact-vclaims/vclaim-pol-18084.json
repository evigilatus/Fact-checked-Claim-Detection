Cheri Toalson Reisch, R-Hallsville, said.\n\n\nAmidst a low employment rate, Reisch claimed small-to-medium sized retail stores in Boone County have lost their employees to larger businesses new or expanding in the county.\n\n\n\"In Boone County, with a 1.7 percent unemployment rate, we can\u2019t find enough people, we can\u2019t fill all the job openings,\" she said during a House Special Committee hearing on criminal justice reform on Feb. 1.\n\n\nReisch is pushing a bill that would make it easier for stores selling liquor or lottery tickets to hire ex-felons who committed certain non-violent crimes.\n\n\nWe delved into several government-issued data and spoke with a couple of business leaders in Boone County to see whether she made accurate points in the statement.\n\n\nShe\u2019s pretty close. Here\u2019s why.\n\n\nUnemployment rate\n\n\nReisch found the county\u2019s 1.7% unemployment rate from\u00a0homefacts.com. The website says as of September, Boone County\u2019s unemployment rate is 1.7%. It doesn\u2019t list a recent rate.\n\n\nBecky Dunn, of the Missouri Department of Higher Education & Workforce Development, confirmed the unemployment number through September. In December,the rate rose to 2.4\u00a0%, according to a department report.\n\n\nSo, Reisch\u2019s number was outdated. But the 2.4% rate is still notably low.\u00a0The Federal Reserve\u00a0calls a range of 3.5% to 4.5% to be a \"natural rate.\"\u00a0\n\n\nLaw of the jungle\n\n\nCasey\u2019s General Stores and other small-to-medium sized retail stores have lost their employees to new or expanding larger businesses in Boone County, Reisch claimed.\n\n\"There are businesses losing their valuable employees because, say, Veterans United can pay more or have better benefits,\" she said.\n\nAn ongoing trend of employee shortfall among small-to-medium sized businesses is due to a rising wage competition with larger businesses, said Bernie Andrews, executive vice president at the Regional Economic Development Inc.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen incentivizing larger companies like Aurora Organic Dairy, the county government requires them to pay at least its average hourly wage of $18.83, or $39,196 an year, to most employees \u2014 and not many retail stores could afford paying that rate, Andrews said.\n\n\nThis employee\u2019s migration to large companies and shorfall for small businesses isn\u2019t a trend just for Boone County, he said.\u00a0\n\n\n\"There are more jobs open than there are people to fill them\" locally and nationally, he said.\n\n\nAn average annual salary for a retail salesperson in mid-Missouri is $27,737, according to\u00a0a January report\u00a0by the Department of Higher Education & Workforce Development. Here are the area job openings that month that required short-term, on-the-job training and little to no work experience:\n\n\n\n\n713: retail sales\u00a0\n\n\n281: customer services\n\n\n156: food services\n\n\n142: laborers and movers\n\n\n129: personal care aides\n\n\n\n\nWe also contacted both Aurora Organic Dairy and another large employer, Veterans United Home Loan.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSonja Tuitele, spokesperson for Aurora Organic Dairy, said her company hired 50 to 60 people for its new Columbia Milk Plant that opened in early 2019. When hiring them, she said the company gave preference to those with specific food manufacturing experience.\u00a0\n\n\nChris Cline of Veterans United Home Loans told us his company hired about 1,000 new employees in 2019 for its branch in Boone County. Those employees were hired for positions ranging from customer-facing production to information technology.\n\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s a business law of the jungle \u2014 large businesses with better pay and benefits get employees they need whereas small businesses lose employees to the large.\u00a0\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nReisch said, \"In Boone County, with a 1.7 percent unemployment rate, we can\u2019t find enough people, we can\u2019t fill all the job openings.\"\n\n\nShe used an outdated number that has since grown, but it\u2019s not that much different.\u00a0\n\n\nThe second part, verifying that Boone County retail businesses can\u2019t find people to hire, is supported by open jobs numbers and a local expert. The big companies can pay more, leaving that quick store down the street scrambling for employees.\n\n\nBecause the statement is correct but needs clarification, we rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18084"}
