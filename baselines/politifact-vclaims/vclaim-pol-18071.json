Bernie Sanders.\nText above the photo says, \"This is Bernie Sanders home, one of three in fact, in Vermont. How does a public servant afford opulence like this. This needs to be shared far and wide!!!!\nThe photo is mislabeled. Sanders doesn\u2019t own the property.\nThe image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nA reverse-image search shows that the estate is located in Stowe, Vt, which is about 25 miles away from Burlington, where Sanders served as mayor until 1989.\nThe Democratic presidential candidate does own three properties, as the post states, but this is not one of them.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estate in the image was last sold for almost $3 million in 2017, and Sanders is not listed as the owner.\nWe reached out to Sanders\u2019 campaign about the photo but did not hear back in time of publication.\nAs other news outlets have reported, the Sanders family owns two homes in Vermont and one residence in Washington D.C.\nThe family owns a home in Burlington that was purchased for $405,000 in 2009; a summer residence in North Hero, Vt, that was bought for $575,000 in 2016 and a townhouse in Washington D.C., that Sanders purchased after he was elected to the United States Senate in 2007 for $488,999.\u00a0\nSanders earns a $174,000 salary as a senator and has made around $1.7 million in book royalties since 2016.\nBut he doesn\u2019t own the $3 million estate in the image.
