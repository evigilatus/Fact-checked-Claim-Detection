They said it also would become the largest university in Georgia.\nBut in a mass email to former students, the school\u2019s alumni association suggested the merger will put GSU in an even more exclusive class. With a student enrollment of more than 54,000, the consolidated university also will be one of the largest in the nation, the email said.\nPolitiFact Georgia decided to check the facts and the numbers.\nWe looked first at the claim that a merged Georgia State and Georgia Perimeter College would be No. 1 among the state\u2019s colleges and universities, based on enrollment.\nThe University of Georgia currently holds that rank, with 35,197 students enrolled last fall, followed closely by GSU with 32,556 students.\nBut a consolidated school would have 53,927 students, if the 21,371 students who attended Georgia Perimeter last fall were put on GSU\u2019s rolls.\nThat would put GSU\u2019s enrollment well above UGA\u2019s and No. 1 in the state by more than 20,000 students, based on current data. Enrollment is forecast to exceed 54,000 by 2016, assuming normal growth..\nNow, what about that national claim?\nWe found a couple of organizations that rank colleges and universities by enrollment. But for our purposes we had to discount the most widely known of those, U.S. News & World Report. The magazine, which grades colleges and universities on several standards, bases the ranking we saw on undergraduate enrollment. Georgia State\u2019s claim is based on total enrollment.\nThe website Matchcollege.com identified the largest 300 colleges and universities in the U.S, -- and only 17 of them had 50,000-plus students. Several of the highest-ranking schools were largely on-line, although Ohio State University and the University of Central Florida were high on the list with 56,387 students and 59,601 students, respectively.\nWe discounted the schools that are largely online, including Phoenix University, with its 300,000-plus students. We did not see how to make apples-to-apples comparisons between the largely online and traditional brick and mortar colleges and universities, and a data expert we consulted agreed.\nBragging rights are also hard to determine since a lot depends on how the numbers are counted, and who is counted? We found where Central Florida calls itself the second-largest university in the U.S.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Indiana, we found that Ivy Tech College, which is the state's system of community colleges at multiple locations, is considered one college. It calls itself the nation\u2019s largest single accredited statewide community college.\nWe looked at federal government data and went to websites to get more recent enrollment numbers. From that we found: Arizona State University with a first-day 2014 fall enrollment topping 82,000; Lone Star College hitting an all-time high enrollment last fall of 82,818; University of Minnesota reported system-wide enrollment this fall of 67,477; The University of Texas at Austin in fall 2013 had 52,076 students enrolled; and Tarrant County College (another community college in Texas) with a fall 2014 enrollment of 50,628.\nRichard Vedder, director of the not-for-profit Center for College Affordability and Productivity in Washington D.C., said he was confident that Georgia State will qualify as one of the nation\u2019s largest universities, once the merger is complete.\nHe said it was \u00a0\"a little unusual to have a two-year merge into a four-year\" university.\n\"Schools like Georgia State take on thousands of marginally qualified students who don\u2019t go on to graduate and tend to hurt their rankings. Now, they\u2019re going to add Georgia Perimeter students,\" he said.\n\"It might be good to save an institution. It might be a way to improve access. But I can\u2019t see any reputation gains from it,\" he said.\nVedder also cautioned that \"getting big doesn\u2019t necessarily mean getting better.\"\nHank Huckaby, chancellor of the University System, has never said the goal was to boost Georgia State\u2019s size.\nHe has said the merger will play to GSU\u2019s strength as \"a recognized national leader in improving student retention and graduation rates.\"\n\"Combining these attributes with Georgia Perimeter College\u2019s leadership in providing access to students across the metro area presents a major opportunity to improve student success,\" Huckaby said after the merger was approved.\nGSU officials also have stressed that the university\u2019s rankings as a top-tier public research university will not be impuned and that Georgia Perimeter\u2019s academic enterprise will be evaluated and measured separately from Georgia State\u2019s bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s and doctoral degree programs by organizations that rank institutions.\nStudents and faculty at GSU and Georgia Perimeter have been voicing concern about how the schools\u2019 two missions will be blended and about staff layoffs forecast for Georgia Perimeter\n\u00a0A student earning a 4-year degree from Georgia State can expect to earn $44,200 starting out and $72,900 at mid-career, according to payscale.com. By comparison, a student with two-year degree from Georgia Perimeter can expect to make $37,200 starting out and $48,200 at mid-career.\n\u00a0Georgia Perimeter has been without a permanent president since 2012 when President Anthony Tricoli resigned after an audit revealed a budget shortfall at the college of about $25 million. Tricoli has since filed suit, alleging he was made the fall guy and misled about the finances.\nRevelations about the shortfall initially hurt the college\u2019s credit rating. But it has since bounced back and recently been upgraded.\nOur conclusion: The merger of Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College will make the state\u2019s largest university, as plans exist now. It also would make the combined university one of the largest in the nation.\nWe rate the alumni association\u2019s statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06805"}
