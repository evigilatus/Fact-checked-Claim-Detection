The National Rifle Association continues to portray him as a relentless threat to the Second Amendment who wants to take your guns away.\n\nThe NRA has a website called \"Gun Ban Obama\" that warns he \"would be the most anti-gun president in American history.\" \u00a0One article is headlined \"Hillary was right: You can't trust Obama with your guns.\"\n\nIn the mail comes a flier that offers \"10 reasons why Obama is bad news for the Second Amendment.\"\n\nThis week, we plan to focus on several of those top 10 reasons as part of an effort to triangulate Obama\u2019s positions on guns and whether the NRA attacks are accurate.\n\nHere we\u2019ll examine what the NRA listed as reason No. 2 -- \"Obama supported Ted Kennedy\u2019s ammo ban to outlaw all deer-hunting ammunition.\"\n\nIt's an oldie, but a goodie. The NRA used the same general attack against John Kerry in 2004 and against Obama in 2008.\n\nThe attack against Obama is rooted in a vote he took while serving in the U.S. Senate. It has to do with what the federal government considers armor-piercing ammunition (not, as the statement says, ammo for deer hunting).\n\nThe sale, manufacture or import of armor-piercing ammunition in handguns was banned by Congress and President Ronald Reagan in 1986. The measure, which applied only to civilians and did not outlaw the use or possession of armor-piercing rounds, passed the House 400-21 and the Senate 97-1.\n\nAs part of the 1986 law, Congress defined armor-piercing ammunition as:\n\u00a0\n\n(i) a projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or\n\n(ii) a full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile.\n\n\nIn 2005 -- as he had in years past -- \u00a0former Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy offered an amendment to a gun bill that would have broadened the definition of armor-piercing ammunition -- moving away from specific metals and weights to include ammunition capable of penetrating body armor.\n\nSpecifically, Kennedy proposed to add:\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) a projectile that may be used in a handgun and that the Attorney General determines, under section 926(d), to be capable of penetrating body armor; or\n\n(iv) a projectile for a center-fire rifle, designed or marketed as having armor piercing capability, that the Attorney General determines, under section 926(d), to be more likely to penetrate body armor than standard ammunition of the same caliber.''.\n\n\nKennedy\u2019s amendment was defeated 64-31. Obama voted in favor of the amendment.\n\nTo be clear, Kennedy wasn\u2019t proposing to outlaw deer-hunting ammunition (and so it\u2019s even a bigger stretch to say Obama supported it). Kennedy\u2019s amendment changed the definition of what is considered armor-piercing ammunition. It had nothing to do with deer hunting.\n\nIt\u2019s the NRA that interpreted the deer-hunting connection. The gun rights group did not respond to us for this fact-check, but the group previously explained its thinking to FactCheck.org during the 2008 campaign. Specifically, the NRA said it was worried about Kennedy\u2019s (iii) definition of armor piercing, because:\n\n1.) There are a few (uncommon) models of handguns that can shoot rifle rounds, and;\n2.) Most rifle rounds are considered armor piercing.\n\nTherefore, the NRA concluded, the government can ban the rifle rounds used to hunt deer.\n\nThat reasoning ignores the latitude the amendment gives to the attorney general and Kennedy\u2019s own words when asked about the intent of the change. \"This is not about hunting. We know duck and geese and deer do not wear armor vests; police officers do,\" Kennedy said during debate about the amendment.\n\nStill, David B. Kopel, research director of the Independence Institute, a libertarian-leaning group that generally opposes government regulation, says Kennedy\u2019s bill language is broad enough to allow for the banning of almost any ammunition and that his intent may be irrelevant. (Kopel\u2019s writings have appeared on the NRA website.)\n\n\"Sen. Kennedy, the sponsor of the bill, said that he did not want to ban hunting ammunition,\" Kopel said. \"Nevertheless, the plain language of the bill, and not Sen. Kennedy\u2019s floor statements, were what would be enacted into law. If there were ever a judicial challenge to ban particular rifle ammunition, a court might well find that the language of the statute, along with judicial deference to agency interpretation of the statute, meant there was no need to look to legislative history.\"\n\nWilliam Vizzard, a criminal justice professor at California State University-Sacramento and a former Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms agent, sees this differently.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that almost all rifle ammunition will penetrate body armor worn by police, \"it is absolutely ludicrous to believe that a Democratic administration would have risked the political fallout of trying to use this section to prohibit rifle ammunition.\n\n\"The Democrats have avoided all gun control controversies assiduously,\" Vizzard said, adding that the attempts to ban armor piercing ammunition is \"as phoney as the typical NRA issue.\"\n\n\"This is an example of both sides pushing symbolism over substance,\" he said.\n\nThere are other problems with the NRA claim.\n\nIn its 2008 attack, the NRA -- using the same evidence -- claimed Obama wanted to \u00a0\"ban virtually all deer hunting ammunition,\" arguing that \"many\" bullets designed and intended for use in rifles (including hunting rifles) have, over the years, been used in special-purpose hunting and target handguns, thus they \u2018may be used in a handgun.\u2019\"\n\nThe 2012 version of the attack drops the qualifier \"virtually\" but ignores that the NRA\u2019s own research found that \"many\" -- not all -- bullets designed for rifles can be used in special-purpose handguns.\n\nMoreover, the proposed changes would not have outlawed any ammunition completely. Federal law does not prohibit the use or possession of armor-piercing rounds, and Kennedy\u2019s amendment wouldn\u2019t have changed that. Point being, you could keep the ammo you have. You can do a quick Google search and find plenty of people in chat rooms discussing the \"AP\" rounds they acquired or own.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s claim was found to be misleading in 2008 by fact-checkers working for the Washington Post, CNN and Factcheck.org.\n\nSaid Factcheck.org in 2008: \"We grant that it is a theoretical possibility that some future administration could interpret Kennedy\u2019s language as banning common hunting ammunition, despite Kennedy\u2019s clear statement of intent to the contrary. But we judge the likelihood of that to be vanishingly small, given the outcry that would surely follow.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn its best light, the NRA claim is cherry-picking an extreme, worst-case interpretation of an amendment proposed by Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy. But even if you accept the NRA\u2019s rationale -- which we do not -- the group fails to prove that Obama supports a ban on \"all deer-hunting ammunition.\"\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible Obama voted for Kennedy\u2019s amendment and still would have opposed a ban on deer-hunting ammunition. (For the record, there\u2019s no evidence of Obama acting on a deer-hunting ammunition ban during his first term as president.)\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s worth noting that the use and possession of armor-piercing ammunition for handguns is not a federal crime. That would not have changed if Kennedy\u2019s amendment passed.\n\nThe NRA says Barack Obama \"supported Ted Kennedy\u2019s ammo ban to outlaw all deer-hunting ammunition.\" We rate that claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10931"}
