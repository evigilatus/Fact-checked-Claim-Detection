We didn\u2019t remember \"vicious\" attack ads from Obama during the 2008 campaign, either.\nSo what\u2019s going on? There are commercials out there showing Michelle Obama, but it\u2019s not at all clear if she\u2019s talking about Hillary Clinton. And the ads were made by a pro-Trump super PAC.\nWhat Michelle Obama said\nThe Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry for this article, but he appears to be referring to comments made by Michelle Obama on Aug. 12, 2007, at a Women for Obama South Side Community Kickoff gathering at the Grand Ballroom, a historic venue in the Obamas\u2019 hometown of Chicago.\nAt the event, which took place during the 2008 primary contest, Michelle Obama said:\n\"One of the things, the important aspects of this race, is role modeling what good families should look like. And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. Can't do it.\"\nInitially, these comments didn\u2019t attract much attention, though a clip of the event was aired on a local Chicago television newscast.\nHowever, Michelle Obama made a similar comment on the stump during a visit to Atlantic, Iowa. Here\u2019s what she said:\n\"One of the most important things that we need to know about the next president of the United States is, is he somebody that shares our values? Is he somebody that respects family? Is (he) a good and decent person? So our view was that, if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. So, so we've adjusted our schedules to make sure that our girls are first, so while he's traveling around, I do day trips. That means I get up in the morning, I get the girls ready, I get them off, I go and do trips, I'm home before bedtime. So the girls know that I was gone somewhere, but they don't care. They just know that I was at home to tuck them in at night, and it keeps them grounded, and, and children, the children in our country have to know that they come first. And our girls do and that's why we're doing this. We're in this race for not just our children, but all of our children.\"\nMichelle Obama\u2019s comments in Iowa first attracted attention in an Aug. 23, 2007, dispatch by Chicago Sun-Times reporter Jennifer Hunter, who wrote that the comment \"could be interpreted as a swipe at the Clintons.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHunter\u2019s article was then picked up by the conservative Drudge Report, and from there various television networks and other news outlets followed up. Most reports mentioned the possibility that Michelle Obama was taking a veiled shot at the Clintons\u2019 well-documented marital tribulations.\nBarack Obama rejected that interpretation, saying in a conference call with reporters that \"there was no reference beyond her point that we have had an administration that talks a lot about family values but doesn\u2019t follow through.\" He added that his wife often spoke about children and families in her remarks on the trail.\nIt\u2019s possible to see her words as a veiled shot at the Clinton\u2019s marriage. It\u2019s also possible that she was simply expressing pride in how her own family had arranged its affairs to make sure their young children weren\u2019t left out.\nWe will leave it to readers to decide which interpretation is closest to the mark. However, we are confident that Trump\u2019s framing of Obama\u2019s comments is incorrect.\nWhat ad is Trump referring to?\nHearing Trump\u2019s comments from the debate -- \"I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you\" -- it sounds as if he intends \"they\" to mean the Obamas. That would be a nice bit of opposition research for the Trump campaign.\nHowever, the Obamas never aired such commercials. Rather, an ad along those lines has been made by a pro-Donald Trump super PAC.\nThe 30-second spot, titled, \"Can\u2019t Run Your House,\" airs footage taken by a local television station from Obama\u2019s 2007 appearance in Chicago. That was the event in which she said, \"One of the things, the important aspects of this race, is role modeling what good families should look like. And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. Can't do it.\"\nThe ad was created by Make America Number 1, a group currently headed by Rebekah Mercer, whose father, hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, initially supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz during the GOP primaries and then switched his support to Trump. Rebekah Mercer took over the top position at Make America Number 1 after veteran Republican strategist David Bossie left to join Trump\u2019s campaign.\nBy phrasing it the way he did, Trump implies that the Obamas ran ads against Clinton attacking their family life. In reality, it was a pro-Trump group that aired the ad in question -- and that makes a big difference in how powerful a point this is.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.\"\nTrump is wrong to imply that Michelle Obama\u2019s criticism came in an ad her husband ran against Hillary Clinton. Instead, it came from an ad made\u00a0by a pro-Trump super PAC. And, the comments from Michelle Obama are somewhat oblique. They might be about Hillary Clinton, but they also might be simple pro-family sentiments. We rate Trump\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04153"}
