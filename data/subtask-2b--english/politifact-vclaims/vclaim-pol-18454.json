He\u2019s also suing for access to locations where ballots are being counted in Michigan. There, the president is running slightly behind Biden, according to the AP.\u00a0\nOnline, his supporters are casting even more doubt on the election results in these states by sharing FiveThirtyEight graphs illustrating vote counts in Wisconsin and Michigan.\u00a0\n\"Look at 4am,\" wrote DeAnna Lorraine, a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in California. \"Straight up spikes. 99% of votes went to Biden. WHAT!?\"\n\"Did someone order some voter fraud?\" another user said.\n\nThey, among other social media users, shared screenshots of the FiveThirtyEight graphs. One shows Democratic and Republican votes counted by 6:23 a.m. on Nov. 4 in Wisconsin. The other shows the total votes counted for each party by 7:17 a.m. on Nov. 4 in Michigan.\u00a0\nThese posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

A spokesperson for FiveThirtyEight told us that they can be found on the site\u2019s 2020 election blog, where reporters have been posting live results and election coverage.\nThe charts do show an uptick in Democratic votes in Wisconsin before 6 a.m., and a bump in Democratic votes in Michigan after 6 a.m.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on February 5, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNewly discovered video shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Clara Hendrickson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s because counties in those states released a large batch of results all at once, FiveThirtyEight told us.\u00a0\n\"And these batches were NOT 100% Biden votes,\" a FiveThirtyEight spokesperson. \"Behind the blue line, there is also a red line representing thousands of votes Trump gained. There are also counter examples where Trump\u2019s line shoots up suddenly when a favorable batch of results are reported.\"\u00a0\nFiveThirtyEight writer Maggie Koerth wrote a blog update about Wisconsin at 8:27 a.m., saying that Biden had been down in Wisconsin before absentee results from Milwaukee came in early that morning.\u00a0\n\"The boost pushed him up past Trump, but the race in this state is still very, very tight,\" she wrote. \"Biden and Trump are both at 49 percent, with only about 20,000 votes separating them.\"\nGeoffrey Skelley, an elections analyst at FiveThirtyEight, wrote an update about Michigan around the same time, saying that with 86% of the expected vote reporting there, Trump had \"only a slight edge over Biden\" and that Biden still had a good chance of winning the state once all the votes were counted.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve separately checked claims that Biden received a suspicious surge of votes in these states: One post falsely said Wisconsin found 112,000 votes at 3 a.m. and a tweet got it wrong when it alleged that Biden had received a sudden influx of 138,339 votes in Michigan while Trump received none.\u00a0\nThese FiveThirtyEight graphs are also being misleadingly cast as evidence that Biden is benefiting from an illegal ballot boon.\u00a0\nWe rate that suggestion False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18454"}
