Dan Malloy", "text": "Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, whose state is still mourning the massacre of 20 first-graders and six adults at an elementary school, is pushing for a federal expansion of background checks on gun purchases.\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC, Malloy cited strong public support for expanded checks and claimed that another, more pedestrian area of American life is more tightly controlled than weapon transfers.\n\n\"I\u2019m a governor. I can\u2019t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check on me, but I could go places in this country and buy a weapon and not have that done. It makes no sense to anybody, quite frankly,\" he said.\n\nWe wondered if that\u2019s true -- that air travelers are subject to background checks, and how it compares with the requirements on gun purchases.\n\nFirst, guns. Federal law requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks before selling a firearm. There is no federal law that requires private gun dealers -- such as those selling at gun shows -- to do such background checks. Gun control advocates want the background check requirement expanded to cover those and other private purchases.\n\nAccording to federal figures, applicants who are denied a firearm through the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System are rejected for having a prior criminal conviction or restraining order, being a fugitive from justice or in the United States illegally, being under indictment or having been dishonorably discharged from the military. Others are denied because they failed to acknowledge their record on the initial form.\n\nSo what\u2019s required of air travelers?\n\nMalloy\u2019s spokeswoman, Juliet Manalan, told us that Malloy was referring to the Secure Flight program, created in response to the 9/11 Commission\u2019s recommendation of uniform pre-screening of passenger information against government watch lists.\n\nThe program, run by the Transportation Security Administration, requires airline passengers to provide their name, date of birth and gender to be matched against watch lists including the \"no fly\" list. That list, which is classified, contains the names of suspected terrorists who are barred from boarding planes flying in or out of the United States. It does not bar felons or other convicted criminals from flying.\n\n\"In short: there is a list that prevents people from boarding a plane, but no list that prevents people who shouldn\u2019t have firearms from purchasing them,\" Manalan said.\n\nSo there\u2019s a list, but is there a background check?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

I believe that is what (Malloy) is trying to say,\" said Clifford Winston, an economist with the centrist Brookings Institution. \"I don\u2019t think it is the case that before you can buy a ticket, you have to undergo a background check.\"\n\nHenry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with the advisory firm Hudson Crossing, added, \"It may not be a true \u2018background check,\u2019 but passenger data is passed through a database (possibly more than one) to detect possible terrorists.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nMalloy said he \"can\u2019t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check on me,\" while less oversight exists for gun purchases.\n\nBackground checks on gun purchases -- which assess a person\u2019s criminal history -- do not apply to the private transfer of weapons, only to purchases from licensed gun dealers. And it\u2019s true that many guns are bought legally with no background check.\n\nBut the Secure Flight program does not check people\u2019s legal history in the same way. It compares passenger information with lists of suspected terrorists. It\u2019s a security measure, but not a true background check. Though unlike with guns, it applies to everyone.\n\nMalloy\u2019s statement is only partially accurate. We rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09492"}
