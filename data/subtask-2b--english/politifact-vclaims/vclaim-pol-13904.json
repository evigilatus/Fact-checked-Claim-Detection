Feinberg has been criticized by politicians at the state and national level for months for what some politicians have called a much too slow response.\n\nSink spokesman Kevin Cate pointed us to the Gulf Coast Claims Facility's own analysis as evidence of the slow claims process.\n\nCate used the latest statistics available for Dec. 7.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKendrick Meek\n\n\nstated on April 29, 2010 in an interview on CNN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The governor switched his position once again on offshore oil drilling.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 April 30, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaim figures\n\n\n\n\nClaims\n\nNumber\n\nPercent\n\n\n\nTotal filed\n\n153,360\n\n100\n\n\n\nPaid or approved for payment\n\n65,676\n\n42.8\n\n\n\nDenied\n\n59,799\n\n39\n\n\n\nUnder review or needing more documentation\n\n27,885\n\n18.2\n\n\n\n\n\nWe should note that as of Dec. 7, Feinberg has awarded more than $900 million to Floridians and Florida business owners.

She's just about right on. So far, about 43 percent of claims submitted by Floridians or Florida business owners have been paid, another 39 percent have been denied and a little more than 18 percent are still under some type of review.
