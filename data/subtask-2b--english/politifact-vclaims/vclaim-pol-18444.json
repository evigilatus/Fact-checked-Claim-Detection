Either he or Biden need at least 270 electoral votes to win.\u00a0\nAccording to the Associated Press, and Fox News, as of about 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Nov. 4, Biden had 238 electoral votes and Trump had 213.\u00a0\nDifferent news organizations showed similar results at that time; they aren\u2019t all identical because these are preliminary results as votes continue to be counted even in states where the Associated Press has declared a winner. While the Associated Press and Fox have called Arizona for Biden, for example, other organizations have not declared a winner in that race.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.
