David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"America could learn a lot from a drug addict,\" says Addicted Dude. \"Even though this country\u2019s $14 \u00a0trillion in debt, Washington raised the debt ceiling 10 times in the last 10 years. Each time \u2013 it\u2019s like another hit \u2013 another spending hit. But you\u2019re the junkies.\n\n\"41 cents out of every dollar you spend is borrowed from places like China. So China is like your dealer, and your addiction and your dealer control your life. To borrow less, you need to spend less. Yeah \u2026 Washington could learn a lot from a drug addict.\"\n\nThe ad was paid for by the Public Notice Research & Education Fund, a sister organization to Public Notice. In a press release, Public Notice said it was airing the ads in hopes that the \"super committee\" in Congress working on a new budget would adopt more spending cuts.\n\nPublic Notice says its mission is \"to increase the public\u2019s awareness and understanding of the economic issues that affect their daily lives, communities, and children and grandchildren.\" That sounded rather generic to us, and we wanted to know more about Public Notice. However, as a 501(c)(4), Public Notice is not required to disclose its donors. Public Notice\u2019s executive director, Gretchen Hamel, is a former spokesman for the \u00a0House Republican Conference.\n\nWe decided to fact-check the ad\u2019s claim that \"41 cents out of every dollar you spend is borrowed from places like China.\"\n\nTo check this item, we turned to two government agencies that monitor the economy.\n\nWe consulted the most recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to see if 41 cents of every dollar is borrowed.\n\nThe numbers show that for fiscal year 2011 (which ended Sept. 30, 2011), the federal government took in $2.3 trillion and spent $3.6 trillion. So the shortfall between receipts and outlays was about $1.3 trillion. That means about 36 cents of every dollar spent was borrowed.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty close to the 41 percent the ad cited. When we contacted Public Notice, they told us they took their numbers from an earlier report published in June 2011 that included numbers for fiscal year 2010. The numbers we used were for fiscal year 2011 and published Nov. 7, 2011.\n\nNext, for the sake of thoroughness, we checked how much U.S. debt is held by China. China is the number one foreign country holding U.S. debt, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nChina holds $1.15 trillion in U.S. debt, followed by Japan with $957 billion; the United Kingdom with $422 billion; and a group of oil-exporting countries that collectively hold $230 billion. (See the entire list.)\n\nSo is Addicted Dude a good analogy for our budget situation? If China is our drug dealer, China\u2019s offering us the good stuff at an extremely low mark-up -- interest rates on U.S. Treasuries are near rock-bottom right now. On the other hand ... that\u2019s how they get you hooked.\n\nSo we\u2019ll leave it up to you to decide whether the metaphor is apt.\n\nThe ad from Public Notice says, \"41 cents out of every dollar you spend is borrowed from places like China.\" China is indeed the country that holds the most U.S. debt. But the most recent numbers on U.S. debt put the borrowed amount slightly lower, at 36 cents on the dollar. So we rate this statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12081"}
