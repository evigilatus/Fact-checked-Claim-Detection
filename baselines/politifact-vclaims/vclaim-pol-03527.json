In a press release announcing the hiring, Trump praised Manafort as \"a great asset and an important addition\" in consolidating the support Trump won during the primary season.\n\"Paul Manafort, and the team I am building, bring the needed skill sets to ensure that the will of the Republican voters, not the Washington political establishment, determines who will be the nominee for the Republican Party,\" Trump said in a statement that highlighted Manafort\u2019s extensive political experience in \"dozens of international political campaigns.\"\nAbout a week later, Trump expanded Manafort\u2019s portfolio to include all functions related to the nomination process, as well as additional roles coordinating outreach efforts and establishing a new office in Washington, D.C.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am organizing these responsibilities under someone who has done this job successfully in many campaigns,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Paul is a well-respected expert in this regard and we are pleased to have him join the efforts to Make America Great Again.\"\nManafort also began appearing on\u00a0national television to represent the campaign. Manafort\u2019s April 24 appearance on Fox News Sunday was posted on the Trump campaign\u2019s official website, for example. (The post has since been removed, but can be seen here.) In his Sunday show interview, Manafort defended Trump\u2019s campaign style and evolving strategy, and went on offense against then-Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, calling Trump\u2019s most formidable rival for the Republican nomination a \"liar.\"\nManafort\u2019s promotion to Trump campaign chairman and chief strategist\nOn May 19, Trump promoted Manafort to campaign chairman and chief strategist.\nTrump campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks said that Corey Lewandowski, who had been managing the Trump campaign, would \"continue overseeing day-to-day operations and will work with Manafort on political strategy and communications, among other things, through the general election.\"\nIn weeks leading up to the July Republican National Convention, the Trump campaign announced it had hired veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway to \"serve as senior advisor to the campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.\"\nRoughly one month after the July GOP convention, with Trump\u2019s poll numbers in decline and the campaign dealing with ongoing controversy, Trump announced Manafort\u2019s resignation, concluding Manafort\u2019s 20-week tenure with the campaign.\n\"This morning Paul Manafort offered, and I accepted, his resignation from the campaign,\" Trump said in an August 19 statement.\" I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process. Paul is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success.\"\nOur ruling\nSpicer said Manafort had a \"limited\" role with the Trump campaign, but even Spicer admitted himself that characterization wasn\u2019t correct. Not only did Manafort work to consolidate \u00a0Trump's support ahead of the Republican National Convention, but he was later promoted to campaign chairman and chief strategist. He made multiple media appearances on behalf of Trump and worked alongside Trump\u2019s closest advisers.\nWe rate Spicer\u2019s statement False.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    5 7  Politifact Rating: False  Says Paul Manafort \"played a very limited role\" in the Trump presidential campaign.
