Phil Gingrey thinks states need financial wiggle room in these tight times, and is offering health care legislation to give them room to stretch.\n\nGingrey\u2019s 2011 State Flexibility Act would nix a lesser-known requirement of last year\u2019s health care reform bill that critics think would make Medicaid, the federal government\u2019s health care program for the poor, too costly for states.\n\n\"With an extra 8 million Americans projected to join state Medicaid programs in the next few years, state governments need the flexibility to make cost-saving reforms to Medicaid in order to balance their budgets,\" Gingrey, a Marietta Republican, said in a Sept. 15 press release. \u00a0\n\nWe know Medicaid is supposed to grow because of health care overhaul, but what\u2019s this about an \"extra\" 8 million people?\n\nGingrey\u2019s point was that updated estimates published after the passage of last year\u2019s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act show that there will be millions more people eligible for Medicaid than legislators were originally told, Gingrey spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said.\n\nThis means health care reform will be even more costly than lawmakers anticipated, and states need the help that Gingrey\u2019s bill provides. \u00a0\n\nIs that true?\n\nBefore we delve into Gingrey\u2019s claim, here\u2019s more on the 2011 State Flexibility Act, which repeals certain federal restrictions on Medcaid funds.\n\nThe federal government generally pays half or more of the Medicaid bill. The remainder falls to the states, which administer the program and set some of its rules.\n\nThe federal dollars come with strings attached. The state has to distribute the Medicaid money; State rules have to meet basic federal requirements.\n\nHealth care reform expands Medicaid in 2014 to give coverage to people with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. This change could be costly, so some states want to drop some federal requirements to ease their budget troubles.\n\nBackers of the State Flexibility Act want to give these states the leeway they want. Bill opponents say allowing these changes could leave hundreds of thousands of people, most of them children, uninsured.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at Gingrey\u2019s claim. \u00a0As you\u2019ll recall, his point is that 8 million more people are projected to sign up for the program than legislators were originally told.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that health care reform will increase the overall number of people on Medicaid. But Gingrey\u2019s take on the facts is flawed.\n\nWhile legislators battled over the reforms in 2009 and 2010, the Congressional Budget Office, which reviews legislation that could impact the federal budget, issued cost projections. They also estimated how much Medicaid enrollment would grow.\n\nAbout five months after the legislation passed, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which helps administer Medicaid, issued its own estimates. Its numbers were higher than the CBO\u2019s.\n\nBy 2014, the CBO expects that Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which covers low-income kids who aren\u2019t qualified for Medicaid, will cover 9 million more Americans than it would have without reforms. It would be 16 million in 2016, then 17 million in 2021.\n\nBy 2014, CMS expects rolls for Medicaid and CHIP will be 23.3 million higher in 2014, then drop to slightly more than 20 million in 2018 and 2019. CMS published its estimate Oct. 2010 in Health Affairs, a peer-reviewed health policy journal. \u00a0\n\nThere is a big gap between the CMS and CBO estimates, though Gingrey\u2019s number is a bit off. The difference varies from about 4 million to more than 14 million, not 8 million, depending on the year.\n\nBut the higher CMS estimate is not an update of the CBO figure. Instead, they are two separate projections based on different data and assumptions. \u00a0They\u2019re not comparable.\n\nMedicaid is such a complicated program that calculating enrollment is tougher than you\u2019d think. CBO bases its enrollment numbers on the Survey of Income and Program Participation, which is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. CMS\u2019 projections use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which is conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \u00a0\n\nAlso, the CBO predicts that the percent of eligible people who join Medicaid will remain roughly the same under health care reform, said Benjamin Sommers, a Harvard University professor who has studied Medicaid enrollment. CMS assumes that a far greater percentage will sign up.\n\nAnother difference is that CMS expects enrollment will spike immediately after Medicaid expands in 2014. But the CBO thinks enrollment will take place gradually, their charts show. The estimates become more similar over time, Sommers noted.\n\nProjections by independent groups also vary, but those we reviewed are in line with CBO and CMS estimates. \u00a0\n\nFor example, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured said that enrollment would be between 15.9 million and 22.8 million higher, depending on how eager people are to join, and the success of the outreach effort.\n\nThe Urban Institute estimated that 16.8 million more people would be covered by Medicaid if health care reform took effect in 2010.\n\nHow do we rule?\n\nThe fact that CBO estimates released in March 2010 were lower than CMS estimates released later that year is not proof that \"extra people\" will join Medicaid, as Gingrey said.\n\nDifferent government agencies simply arrived at different results, based on different data and assumptions. Since they\u2019re making projections for an unprecedented overhaul in the country\u2019s health care system, it\u2019s reasonable for their results to vary.\n\nAll projections foresee a major increase in Medicaid rolls, and Gingrey rightly noted a significant difference between two federal estimates. But he made a mistake when he understood CMS\u2019 estimate as an update of the CBO figures.\n\nGingrey\u2019s statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We therefore rate his claim Half True.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12089"}
