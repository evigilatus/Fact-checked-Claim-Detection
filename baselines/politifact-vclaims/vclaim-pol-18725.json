Charlie Kirk, Turning Point USA founder, also tweeted the misinformation, which led to his account being locked for violating Twitter rules.\u00a0\nProPublica and the Inquirer reported that Pennsylvania rejected 372,000 requests for mail-in ballots, not actual ballots. (The Blaze later added an update making that distinction clear.)\n\"More than 90% of those applications, or about 336,000, were denied as duplicates, primarily because people who had requested mail-in ballots for the state\u2019s June 2 primary did not realize that they had checked a box to be sent ballots for the general election, too,\" ProPublica/Inquirer stated.

The number of rejected ballots could make a difference in the state that Trump won by about 44,000 votes, or less than 1%, in 2016.\nRELATED: How to make sure your ballot is counted this fall\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said Pennsylvania rejected 372,000 mail-in ballots.\nThat\u2019s wrong.
