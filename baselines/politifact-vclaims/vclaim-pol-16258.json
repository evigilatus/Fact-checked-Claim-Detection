And that's change we can believe in.\"\n\n\nObama has stated he has a policy of not accepting campaign contributions from political action committees or lobbyists. There's\n\na bit of fine print on this, however, as we've reported previously\n\n. Obama does not take money from registered federal lobbyists, but he does take money from state lobbyists, retired lobbyists and spouses of lobbyists.\n\n\nThe nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics has a broad definition of lobbyist money that includes contributions from spouses of lobbyists.
