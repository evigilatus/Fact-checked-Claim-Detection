Upon completion of the study, it was found that 80% of the black men in Atlanta, Georgia are homosexual,\" said the Jan. 7, 2016 post.\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat online hoaxes.\nThe post also claimed that the percentage of gay black men in Atlanta is expected to be much higher \"due to the large amount of men unwilling to openly admit to being anything other than straight in our society.\"\nWe did not find a Georgia State University study concluding that 80 percent of black men in Atlanta are gay. We did find social media accounts linked to viralactions.com that made it clear that its information is not factual.\nViralactions.com\u2019s website doesn\u2019t feature a page describing its mission or who\u2019s behind it, and to anyone visiting the site, there\u2019s no easy way to tell if it\u2019s stories are real or not.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoy Barnes\n\n\nstated on May 21, 2010 in a campaign commercial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Roy Barnes was governor, \"Georgia created 235,000 jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 June 4, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it does link to Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook accounts that suggest its content is fake.\nThe website linked to an Instagram page for the username \"folksrtalking,\" with a biographical description claiming to have \"3 BILLION satire article views shared & counting from over 50 blogs! You may not know my name but you definitely seen my work if your on the Net! #IZM.\"\nIts Twitter page, also for the username @FolksRtalking, said \"Folks don't want to be INFORMED they want to be ENTERTAINED. #InfoTainment News at its Finest! #NYC.\" The Twitter account links to another website, celebtricity.com, which describes itself as \"the most notorious fauxtire & satire entertainment website in the world. If it's trending on social media you'll find it here!\"\nViralactions.com\u2019s Facebook page appears to have been called TmzWorldstar, but is no longer available on the social media network.\nTmzWorldstar appears to be part of a web of hoax websites recycling and cross-posting fabricated information. Fellow fact-checkers at Snopes.com in February 2016 deemed as false claims that a study found that 80 percent of black men in Georgia were gay. The story debunked by Snopes in 2016 is the same one that has resurfaced on Viralactions.com.\nViralactions.com published a story claiming 80 percent of black men in Atlanta are gay, citing a nonexistent Georgia State University study. The claim has circulated for years on websites sharing fake news.\nWe rate viralactions.com\u2019s post Pants on Fire.\n' Share the Facts 2018-03-27 16:02:02 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"80% of black men in Atlanta are Homosexuals, study says\"    viralactions.com Bloggers https://viralactions.com/80-of-black-men-in-atlanta-are-homosexuals-study-says/   in a blog post Thursday, January 7, 2016 2016-01-07    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02262"}
