Biden used McCain's assessment to nip at the Republican on his decisionmaking compared to Barack Obama's.\n\n\n\"Should you trust the judgment of John McCain, when he said only three years ago, 'Afghanistan \u2014 we don't read about it anymore in papers because it succeeded?' \" Biden said.\n\n\nThe McCain comment stems from an Oct. 31, 2005, appearance on the Charlie Rose talk show on PBS. He was asked about winning in Iraq. After discussing issues confronting that country, McCain concluded: \"Afghanistan, we don't read about anymore, because it's succeeded. And by the way, there's several reasons, including NATO participation and other reasons, why Afghanistan is doing as well as it is.\"\n\n\nIt wasn't the first time that year McCain lauded \"success\" in Afghanistan \u2014 but it was more unqualified than other assessments.\n\n\nA couple of weeks later, on Nov. 10, 2005, McCain told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute, \"One of the reasons why we don't see a lot about Afghanistan is because many of the successes \u2014 although we still have a long way to go through \u2014 that we have.\" He added he would \"love to see more troops there.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
