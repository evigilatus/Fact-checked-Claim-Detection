Chris Christie to big business and paints him as an enemy of education. A meme is an idea or concept shared via social media.\n\nThe meme declares, \"New Jersey's governor cut $1.6 billion from public education while handing out $2.1 billion in corporate tax breaks, more than the entire previous decade,\" with a prominent picture of a dazed-looking Christie in the middle.\n\nThe picture may not be the most flattering, but the claims in it are hard facts: New Jersey\u2019s governor did cut education by a significant amount, and his actions have resulted in tax break largesse for businesses.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by reviewing the education funding claim.\n\nChristie cut education funding, but not by $1.6 billion.\n\nThe governor made two cuts to education in 2010 totaling about $1 billion to help close significant budget gaps. The New Jersey Education Law Center, a Newark-based school advocacy group, sued, claiming the cuts violated the law for giving aid to school districts, and put at-risk and poor students at an increased disadvantage.\n\nUltimately, a judge agreed with the Education Law Center\u2019s challenge. The judge also found that New Jersey would have needed $1.6 billion to fully fund education in New Jersey in accordance with the state\u2019s funding law, and ordered the state to spend an additional $500 million on public education in poor districts the next year.\n\nBottom line? Christie\u2019s cuts totaled $1 billion.\n\nNext, let\u2019s review the claim about corporate tax breaks.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal think tank, released a report in April that the state has given $2.1 billion in tax breaks and grants to companies during the past three years that Christie\u2019s been in office. That exceeds the $1.2 billion in corporate tax breaks given the entire previous decade, according to figures from the state Economic Development Authority.\n\nAt the time of the report\u2019s release, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said the group is \"simply not credible,\" and that figures from the EDA show that incentives have created more than 100,000 jobs since 1996.\n\nWhat Drewniak didn\u2019t do, however, was question the accuracy of the numbers in the report.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that a month before the report came out, Christie told a commercial real estate group that his administration was on target to deliver $2.3 billion in business tax breaks and supports legislation reauthorizing corporate incentives.\n\nNJPP used EDA numbers for its study, Deputy Director Jon Whiten said in an e-mail..\n\nNeither Drewniak nor Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts responded to requests for comment.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA meme on the state AFL-CIO Facebook page claims, \"New Jersey's governor cut $1.6 billion from public education while handing out $2.1 billion in corporate tax breaks, more than the entire previous decade.\"\n\nChristie actually cut $1 billion in state aid from education, not $1.6 billion.\n\nAs for corporate tax breaks, Christie himself has said his administration is on target to deliver $2.3 billion in benefits for business \u2013 and that\u2019s nearly double what was handed out in tax breaks in the decade before he took office.\n\nWe rate the meme\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09300"}
