It is the signal of REVOLUTION from our President! The time is here. The storm is upon us. Rise-up, America.

Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, posted it on Instagram on June 1, 2019.\nWe didn\u2019t find any media coverage about the White House flying the 13-star flag around that time, and it was in the news. Nike pulled Fourth of July sneakers featuring the flag over concerns that it was a symbol for racism.\u00a0\nWe also found no evidence that such a flag is currently flying over the White House.\u00a0\nBut in any case, the image that purportedly shows an older flag that Trump raised to rally an uprising is more than a year old.\u00a0\nWe rate this blog post False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19112"}
