Text overlaid atop the photo says:\n\"Up until 1913 Americans kept all of their earnings. Despite this, America still had schools, roads, colleges, vast railroads, subways and an Army & Navy. (Tell me again why taxes are necessary?)\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on\u00a0its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis claim contains some accurate information, but it needs some additional context and details.\nThe year 1913 is often cited because that\u2019s when the 16th Amendment was ratified, which allowed Congress to collect tax on individual incomes. Congress later enacted legislation that imposed a 1% tax on incomes over $3,000 with a graduated surtax on incomes above $20,000.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile 1913 marks the birth of the 1040 tax form, it wasn\u2019t the first time Americans paid a tax on their earnings.\nIn 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed a revised measure into law that enacted the nation\u2019s first income tax to help pay for the Civil War. It created a Commissioner of Internal Revenue and levied a 3% tax on incomes between $600 and $10,000, and a 5% tax on incomes higher than that. Congress repealed the measure 10 years later in 1872.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1894, Congress passed a new income tax \u2013\u2013 but it never took effect. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional a year later because it was not apportioned according to each state\u2019s population, as the Constitution then required. That meant, for example, that if 5% of the U.S. population lived in Virginia, no more than 5% of the tax\u2019s total revenue could come from Virginia.\nBut in 1913, the 16th Amendment removed the constitutional hurdle by authorizing Congress to collect taxes on incomes, \"without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\"\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that the Facebook post doesn\u2019t limit itself to federal taxes. States could, and in multiple cases did, tax earnings before 1913.\u00a0\nSo how did the U.S. government generate revenue prior to income taxes?\nBefore the Civil War, government funds were primarily obtained from tariffs on imports, the selling of public land and temporary excise taxes. During the decades following the war, when the income tax lapsed, the IRS says about 90% of the country\u2019s revenues came from taxes on liquor, beer, wine and tobacco.\u00a0\nWhile the modern tax structure wasn\u2019t in place before 1913 and the U.S. did have things like schools, roads, subways, etc., citizens still helped pay for them.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says Americans kept \"all of their earnings\" up until 1913.\nThe modern income tax structure, including Form 1040, was, indeed, adopted in 1913.\u00a0\nBut the post disregards pre-1913 efforts to impose an income tax, one of which was in place for a decade, and it ignores early state income taxes.
