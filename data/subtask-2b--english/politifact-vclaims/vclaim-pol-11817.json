Supporters and critics sparred over the question of whether Bain, a private-equity firm, was a job creator or a corporate carnivore.\n\nSo the notion that Romney not only fired people while at Bain but enjoyed it was catnip for news outlets in full New Hampshire primary mode.\n\nBut did the critics take into account the quote\u2019s context? Not necessarily.\n\nFor instance, one of Romney\u2019s primary opponents, Jon Huntsman, took a shot at Romney in Concord later that day.\n\n\"It\u2019s become abundantly clear over the last couple of days what differentiates Gov. Romney and me,\" he said, according to the New York Times. \"I will always put my country first. It seems that Gov. Romney believes in putting politics first. Gov. Romney enjoys firing people; I enjoy creating jobs. It may be that he\u2019s slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America right now, and that\u2019s a dangerous place to be.\"\n\nWe wondered whether Huntsman was accurately portraying Romney\u2019s remark.\n\nOnce you look at the full context of Romney\u2019s quote, it becomes clear that he was talking about the ability to get rid of a health insurance provider if its services are inadequate.\n\n\"I want individuals to have their own insurance,\" Romney said. \"That means the insurance company will have an incentive to keep you healthy. It also means if you don\u2019t like what they do, you can fire them. I like being able to fire people who provide services to me. You know, if someone doesn\u2019t give me a good service that I need, I want to say I\u2019m going to go get someone else to provide that service to me.\"\n\nSo Romney wasn't referring to his work at Bain Capital -- or being a boss who relishes firing employees -- but rather the notion of switching service providers. He might as well have been talking about switching cell phone carriers or cable TV companies.\n\nRomney himself said as much later in the day: \"Things can always be taken out of context. And I understand that that's what the Obama people will do. But, as you know, I was speaking about insurance companies and the need to be able to make a choice. And my comments entirely reflected that discussion, which is we should be able to choose the insurance company of our choice.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nRomney certainly phrased his comment awkwardly enough to give Huntsman support for his attack. But Huntsman distorted the comment by making it sound like Romney was heartlessly firing employees. Huntsman zeroed in on the \"firing people\" part of Romney\u2019s quote while ignoring the fact that Romney was talking about switching insurance companies. Worse, Huntsman said it\u2019s \"clear\" that Romney feels that way. In fact, it\u2019s not clear at all. We rate Huntsman\u2019s statement Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
