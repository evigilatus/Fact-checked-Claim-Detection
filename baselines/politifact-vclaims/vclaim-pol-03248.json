Like Kushner, they say, Obama went around the existing administration to forge his own diplomatic path with a foreign adversary.\n\"Let me set the scene for you. It's 2008, we are having an election, and candidate Obama, he's not even president-elect, sends William Miller over to Iran to establish a back channel and let the Iranians know that should he win the election, they will have friendlier terms,\" Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on May 28.\nCandidate Obama faced criticism for saying he would talk to Iranian leaders as president. And after he took office, his administration pursued back-channel communications \u2014 meaning secret dialogue outside normal diplomatic processes \u2014 with Iran as part of achieving the nuclear deal. Journalists reported on those processes extensively.\nWe were intrigued by the claim that Obama sought secret communication channels with Iran before he even won the 2008 election. When we started to dig into it, we were surprised to find that the evidence supporting that narrative is slim and ultimately insufficient.\nAs far as we can tell, this allegation stems solely from the commentary of Michael Ledeen, a conservative Iran and Iraq expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a critic of Obama\u2019s foreign policy.\nLedeen was also a national security consultant to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration. He recently co-authored a book with Trump\u2019s ousted National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies.\nStrassel hasn\u2019t replied to our requests for comment, but she defended her comment on Twitter by citing Ledeen\u2019s work.\nBy Ledeen\u2019s account, Miller told him that Obama sent him to Tehran in 2008. Ledeen has made this claim a number of times since at least 2013, in blog posts, on conservative talk radio, on Twitter in prepared remarks, and in a phone interview with PolitiFact June 1.\n\"During his first presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama used a secret back channel to Tehran to assure the mullahs that he was a friend of the Islamic Republic, and that they would be very happy with his policies,\" Ledeen wrote in 2014 for conservative website PJ Media. \"The secret channel was Ambassador William G. Miller, who served in Iran during the shah's rule, as chief of staff for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as ambassador to Ukraine. Ambassador Miller has confirmed to me his conversations with Iranian leaders during the 2008 campaign.\"\nWe called up Miller. He said Ledeen\u2019s claims are \"totally untrue.\"\nMiller told us that he supported Obama\u2019s 2008 candidacy and knew some of the campaign\u2019s foreign policy staff from his decades-long public service career, but he had no role in the campaign or the subsequent administration.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiller does have extensive experience with Iran, starting out as a diplomat there in the 1950s and 1960s. President Jimmy Carter chose Miller to be a lead negotiator during the 1979 hostage crisis, while Miller was serving as staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. And as a private citizen, he played a role in the release of American hikers who were imprisoned in Iran from 2009-11.\nBut \"the assertion that Obama sent me as an envoy is totally false,\" he said, adding that he\u2019s met Ledeen a few times but doesn\u2019t really know him. Miller said he travels frequently to Iran but didn\u2019t in 2008.\nWhen we told Ledeen that Miller was telling a different story, Ledeen stood by his account.\n\"(Miller has) changed his mind,\" Ledeen said. \"He\u2019s decided he didn\u2019t go to Tehran.\"\nSo either Ledeen or Miller isn\u2019t telling the truth.\nWe\u2019re sensitive to the idea that someone who was involved in secret communications might not be forthcoming with us about those communications. But it\u2019s also telling that there have been no independent news reports to corroborate Ledeen\u2019s claims, given the extensive reporting on the Obama administration\u2019s relations with Iran and negotiations over the nuclear deal.\nMarie Harf, who headed the State Department\u2019s Iran nuclear negotiations communications strategy during Obama\u2019s second term, said she hadn\u2019t heard of these allegations until we called her.\n\"Never in my time at the State Department or working on Iran negotiations did any back channel prior to when we were in office come up,\" she said.\nWall Street Journal foreign affairs reporter Jay Solomon, author of The Iran Wars, said he \"could never prove\" that Obama sought a back channel to Iran as a presidential candidate, but he can\u2019t definitively say it didn\u2019t happen.\nLike Solomon, National Iranian American Council President Trita Parsi never came across any evidence for the alleged back channel while researching either of his two books\u00a0about the Obama administration\u2019s relationship with Iran, including the upcoming\u00a0Losing an Enemy:\u00a0Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy.\nParsi questioned Ledeen\u2019s credibility and said, \"At this point, I'm completely convinced this is all B.S.\"\nOur ruling\nStrassel said that in 2008, Obama\u2019s presidential campaign secretly sent former Ambassador William Miller to Iran to talk with Iranian leaders.\nThis is a case of he-said-she-said. A single conservative scholar says Miller told him about his secret \u201808 campaign mission to Iran. Independent journalists who have covered U.S.-Iran relations extensively haven\u2019t been able to confirm the account. There is no corroborating evidence, and Miller says it\u2019s not true; he says he never worked on behalf of the Obama campaign, and he didn\u2019t travel to Iran in 2008.\nAt PolitiFact, we believe the burden is on the speaker to back up their claim with evidence. The evidence here is insufficient, so we rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2017-06-02 15:44:03 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  In 2008, \"candidate Obama, he's not even president-elect, sends William Miller over to Iran to establish a back channel and let the Iranians know that should he win the election, they will have friendlier terms.\"    Kimberley Strassel Wall Street Journal columnist   on Meet the Press Sunday, May 28, 2017 2017-05-28    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03248"}
