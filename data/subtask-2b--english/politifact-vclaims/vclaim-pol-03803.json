It was that it was so easy,\" he said. \"I mean, John Podesta\u2019s password into his system -- do you know what his password was? Password.\"\nPriebus didn\u2019t offer any evidence to host John Dickerson and we didn\u2019t hear back from Trump\u2019s transition team or the Republican National Committee on our requests for information to back Priebus\u2019 claim.\nBut there doesn\u2019t appear to be any evidence to support what he said.\nThe hacking\nHere\u2019s how the New York Times reported on what happened to Podesta:\nRussian hackers sent a \"phishing\" email -- which aims to get the recipient to click on a deceptive link that gives hackers access to their information -- to Podesta\u2019s personal Google mail account in March 2016. The email said Podesta needed to change his password immediately in order to protect his account.\nPodesta correctly perceived that the email might be a hoax and sought advice from other campaign staffers. In a\u00a0response, one campaign staffer meant to tell Podesta that the email was illegitimate, but wrote legitimate --\u00a0prompting Podesta to change his password.\n\"With another click,\" as the Times put it, \"a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account \u2014 a total of about 60,000 \u2014 were unlocked for the Russian hackers.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly one person died on that day\u201d during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 9, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trove amounted to what The Guardian called \"an unprecedented window into a presidential run.\" Trump used the emails as fodder for attacks on Clinton -- a number of which PolitiFact National found to need context or misinterpreted what the emails actually showed.\nPodesta would later say that WikiLeaks began publishing his emails about an hour after the October 2016 release of an \"Access Hollywood\" tape that showed Trump making lewd comments about women during a 2005 interview. His claim was rated True by PolitiFact National.\nNow back to Priebus.\nPrevious claim\nTwo days before the Priebus interview, our partners at PunditFact rated as False a claim by Jesse Watters. He has a \"Watters World\" a segment that appears on Fox News Channel\u2019s \"The O\u2019Reilly Factor,\" which is hosted by conservative talk show host Bill O\u2019Reilly.\nWatters\u2019 claim was essentially the same as Priebus'. He said Podesta\u2019s email password was password, a claim that originated with WikiLeaks\u2019 Julian Assange.\nOur colleagues found:\n\u2192 None of the emails published on WikiLeaks show Podesta\u2019s email password.\n\u2192 Among the cyber analysts examining the phishing emails used to infiltrate Podesta\u2019s and others\u2019 accounts, none have made similar claims.\n\n\u2192 Podesta was using a Gmail account, and Google doesn\u2019t allow users to make their passwords password.\nOur rating\nRepeating a claim that originated with WikiLeaks\u2019 Julian Assange, Priebus said the email password of Podesta, Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign chairman, was password.\nHis claim is catchy, but we\u2019ve seen no material evidence to back it.\nOur rating is False.
