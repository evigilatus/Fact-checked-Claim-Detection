Education Week uses several measures, including finance, achievement and chance for success.\nArizona Department of Education spokesman Charles Tack said the numbers were accurate based on the sources cited.\nFor the dead last in funding per student part of the claim, the ad cites the Arizona School Boards Association, a statewide nonprofit.\nClinton campaign spokesman Tim Hogan noted that both claims were from the Education Week report.\nEducation Week uses data from several federal agencies, including the U.S. Education Department, U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Commerce Department.\nAccording to the data, Arizona spends $7,733 per student, almost 35 percent less than the national average of $11,841 per student.

The data includes all 50 states and Washington, D.C.\nHowever, the actual text of the advertisement does mention that Arizona is 50th in per student funding though, which is correct. They\u2019re just not dead last.\nOur ruling\nClinton\u2019s campaign said, \"Arizona schools rank 45th in the nation, dead last in funding per student.\"\nEducation Week data vets the first claim, but the advertisement is off by one in its claim that the Grand Canyon State is dead last.
