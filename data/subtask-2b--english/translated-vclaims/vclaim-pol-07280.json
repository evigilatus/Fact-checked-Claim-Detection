The Ruff Group, an American crossroads group, is issuing a new announcement alleging that the Democratic Senate candidate there, the Republic of Bruce Braley, is bidding on Steer to vote against the Keystone XL pipeline. \"Now, California's billionaire who stands for profit by blocking Keystone spends a lot to help the Berley campaign,\" says the ad. \"Bruce Braley, is on the side of the private interests of the billionaire, not the Iowa workers.\" Steer was identified in the ad as a billionaire California. He ran ads to help Brady and his Republican opponent, Johnny Ernest. The Ruff Group is a super group supported by millions of dollars in unknown donors, so American bandits warn voters of \"special interest\" in the race seem a little bit like, \"Butt, meet the boiler.\" But regardless of that, we wanted to review the American Crossroads attack against Styre. Is he gonna win if Keston gets killed? We've reviewed the evidence. For those who do not know Styre, it is the billionaire behind the upcoming climate change that promised the Democrats $100 million in the midterm elections. Some called him the Democratic Koch Brothers in the electoral cycle. How, exactly, can an ecologist earn money through the Keystone XL Dam, a pipeline that will carry oil from Alberta's sand through Nebraska to the refineries in the Gulf of Mexico? The American crossroads sent us many news stories that showed that Styre wasn't always the hard-core environmental factor he's shooting at right now. Styre made his fortune in managing Faralon's capital, an investment group he started in the 1980s. According to the Washington Post summary and other reports, Faralon Capital has invested heavily in energy throughout the period there, including fossil fuels. Styre left the company in the fall of 2012. \"Investments involving BP and mining companies in the United States and around the world,\" Post. The second largest contract for Faralon in September 2012, a month before Styre announced his departure, was an investment of $220 million in the giant oil and gas company Nixon. Kinder Morgan, a company that owns a pipeline linking Alberta's sand to the Pacific coast, was also included in the Faralon investment portfolio. The pipeline is a competitor to Keystone XL. In his interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \"drops more water on Houston in five days than Niagara Falls in one year.\" Not so fast. As we said, Styre left Faralon Capital in 2012. But it wasn't just that he left, it was how he left. When he resigned as a management partner, Styre Faralon ordered capital to withdraw his investment in the company from any of its holdings of tar sand and coal. That would have included Morgan's Kender pipeline. Later in 2013, Styre invited the company to withdraw its money entirely from fossil fuels. In June, a speaker on behalf of Styre &apos; s post office said that the process would conclude that month. At about the same time, Styre took heat from the Republicans to invest in an energy source he was abusing at the same time. In response, Styre pledged to donate all of his profits from the Kender Morgan pipeline to a charity. In June, he announced that he was contributing $2 million to the case. We do not know whether this is the full amount of Steer's profit from investing in the competing pipeline. But the announcement from the American crossroads is a possibility anyway, claiming that Styre is \"stopping for profit\" from preventing Keystone. Styre no longer has any way to make money directly from the Kinder Morgan pipeline. Here's the kick: As of today, Faralon no longer has any investment holdings in Kinder Morgan. The files of the Faralon Security and Exchange Commission show investments of $45 million in Kinder Morgan until the end of 2013. However, Kinder Morgan does not appear in the investment group portfolio for the first or second quarter of 2014. The American crossroads says Governor Styre \"stands for profit by blocking Keystone\" and \"spends a lot of help\" the Braley Senate campaign. At some point, this may be an accurate declaration. The former Styre Precautionary Fund, Farallon Capital Management, had significant assets in a company that owned a pipeline that was a rival to Keystone XL, and under the supervision of Styre, its investment group had a large share of fossil fuels. However, he has since left his investment group and asked his company to withdraw any of his fossil fuel holdings, including tar sand. He also donated his profits from the Morgan pipeline to a charity. Furthermore, as of 2014, Faralon no longer invests in the Keystone competition, according to the SEC files. As far as we know, Styre will not benefit directly from the demise of Keystone. Therefore, the evidence from the American crossroads is still incomplete. We assess the claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07280"}
