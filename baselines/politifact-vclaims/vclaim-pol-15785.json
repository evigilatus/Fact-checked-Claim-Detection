And most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for American forces.\"\n\n\nWe wondered if that was true and checked the latest\n\nPentagon statistics\n\n. Indeed, U.S. military deaths numbered 155 in 2008, which is the highest since the war began in 2001.\n\n\nThe number of U.S. deaths has increased almost every year, with two exceptions. The year-to-year fatality count, from 2001 to 2008, is: 11, 48, 45, 52, 98, 98, 117, 155.\n\n\nIn the first two months of 2009, there were 30 U.S. military deaths, putting this year on pace to be the deadliest yet.\n\n\nWe looked for any indication that this statistic was unrepresentative of the conditions in Afghanistan. Quite the contrary \u2014 it is one of several measures by which the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of U.S. military personnel wounded in action has also increased every year, from 33 in 2001 to 790 in 2008, totaling 2,713.\n\n\nMilitary deaths of personnel from the 21 other outside countries involved in the conflict have increased every year since 2004, to a peak so far of 139 in 2008 (and 2009 is on pace to surpass that).\n\n\nAfghan civilian casualties hit a high mark too last year, with 2,118 civilians killed, up from 1,523 in 2007, according to the United Nations.\n\n\nIn testimony to the House Armed Services Committee in September, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Taliban and al-Qaida fighters are coordinating better from safe havens in Pakistan and launching \"ever more sophisticated, even infantry-like attacks against fixed coalition positions.\"\n\n\n\"I'm not convinced we're winning it in Afghanistan,\" Mullen said.\n\n\nDefense Secretary Robert Gates told the committee Afghanistan was in some ways a more complex challenge than Iraq. \"We don't have a single adversary,\" he said. \"We have the Taliban, we have the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar group, we have the Haqqani network, we have narco-thugs, we have al-Qaida, we have foreign fighters.\"\n\n\nSo Obama's claim is not only technically correct, but also accurately reflects the deteriorating security conditions in Afghanistan. We find his claim to be True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15785"}
