Some of the companies deal with industry regulators that Thompson oversaw as Secretary of Health and Human Services during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nIn January 2012, \u00a0the Journal Sentinel reported Thompson\u2019s net worth has reached roughly $13 million, much of in the seven years since he left government and began a career as corporate consultant and advisor, executive, investor and speaker.\n\nThompson says the \"corporate lobbyist\" label is flat out false.\n\nBut Hovde, in a July 26, 2012 interview with Jerry Bader on WTAQ-AM in Green Bay, pressed the claim, even saying Thompson was \"lobbying during the middle of the campaign.\"\n\nIs Hovde right? Even during the campaign?\n\nHovde makes three points in support of his statement: Thompson\u2019s employment at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in Washington, D.C.; a media report on Thompson contacting a North Carolina lawmaker; and a campaign-donation report that listed Thompson\u2019s occupation as \"lobbyist.\"\n\nWashington firm\n\nHovde correctly calls Akin Gump a \"lobbying firm\" -- it\u2019s considered a Washington lobbying powerhouse. But it\u2019s also an international law firm, and Thompson, an attorney, was listed as a partner before he left in January 2012 to campaign for U.S. Senate.\n\nSome Akin Gump partners are registered lobbyists while others, such as Thompson, are not registered to lobby, according to public databases of federal lobbyists.\n\nThompson points to his unregistered status as proof he\u2019s not a lobbyist.\n\nBut does that mean Thompson doesn\u2019t lobby federal officials? Not by itself.\n\nFederal law requires individuals to register as lobbyists if they have more than one lobbying contact in a three-month period while representing a client. The work must make up at least 20 percent of the lobbyist\u2019s work for a client.\n\nThompson, then, could limit such contacts, put his influence to work, and still fly beneath the rules.\n\n\"We have at least 3,000 unregistered lobbyists, and the number is probably far higher than that,\" said Howard Marlowe, a lobbying firm president and head of the American League of Lobbyists, who spoke in general and not specifically about Thompson.\n\nSo, Hovde proves nothing by pointing to Thompson\u2019s employer and didn\u2019t point to a single lobbying incident. Thompson\u2019s defense, meanwhile, is a point in his favor but does not close the case.\n\nTelephone call\n\nHovde referred us to a May 2012 Bloomberg news account -- confirmed by Thompson -- in which the former governor called the speaker of the North Carolina state House of Representatives about a state bill toughening regulations on controversial dental management companies.\n\nPrivate-equity firms have invested heavily in such firms, and Thompson has consulted with several private-equity firms, leading to speculation he was lobbying against the bill -- and right in the midst of the Senate race.\n\nBut the North Carolina lawmaker, Thom Tillis, says he and Thompson never connected. Thompson told us he called not on behalf of a paying client, but a \"friend of a friend\" -- whose name he could not recall -- who wanted to know when the bill would be considered.\n\nSo, at best that part of the claim is murky.\n\nCampaign report\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the matter of U.S. Sen. John Hoeven (R-North Dakota) listing Thompson as a \"lobbyist\" on a 2010 campaign report showing a $1,000 donation from Thompson. There is a document showing that in Federal Election Commission records.\n\nThompson\u2019s campaign says Thompson didn\u2019t list himself that way, suggesting that Hoeven\u2019s campaign erroneously wrote in that occupation. Hoeven\u2019s campaign did not get back to us.\n\nThe big picture\n\nWe could not find any media references that labeled Thompson a lobbyist.\n\nOne Thompson affiliation that drew our attention was his role as chairman of an advisory board at Constella Group, a North Carolina medical research firm.\n\nConstella\u2019s CEO has said Thompson was brought on to \"connect\" the company with U.S. and foreign governments and advise it on growth strategies. Constella then agreed to hire Akin Gump -- but not Thompson specifically -- as its lobbyist, the Journal Sentinel reported in 2007.\n\nThat\u2019s getting closer to what a lobbyist does, but Thompson told us nothing he did for Constella constituted lobbying, and we found no evidence otherwise.\n\nIn Washington, the kind of work Thompson does is often described as either a \"strategic advice\" consultant or a \"rainmaker\" whose influence and connections bring work to his firm.\n\nBill Broydrick, a veteran lobbyist in Wisconsin and Washington, put it this way: \"A consultant\u2019s responsibility is to give his or her client their best professional advice, and that is not lobbying. That\u2019s telling people how they should lobby.\"\n\nIndeed, Thompson has told reporters that he does work with a lobbyist at Akin Gump who lobbies for health care clients. An Akin Gump spokesman told us: \"Gov. Thompson was a strategic adviser in Akin Gump\u2019s health care practice, and did not engage in any activity that required him to register as a lobbyist.\"\n\nThompson\u2019s situation reminds us somewhat of the debate during the GOP presidential primary over Newt Gingrich\u2019s statement that he \"never lobbied under any circumstance\" for Freddie Mac, a mortgage company giant connected to the federal government.\n\nGingrich acknowledged that Freddie Mac hired his consulting group but he said it was only for strategic advice and broadening contacts among conservatives, not lobbying.\n\nIn rating Gingrich\u2019s claim Half True, PolitiFact National said he was technically correct but took pains to avoid being subject to the lobbying rules and use his influence as an adviser.\n\nThompson appears to have taken similar pains. He told us Akin Gump wanted him to register as a lobbyist, but he refused.\n\nHe is far less definitive when asked directly if he has ever contacted a legislator on behalf of any corporate client to urge action on a bill. He first told us he didn\u2019t think he had, but then said couched it to say he couldn\u2019t say for sure.\n\nNot exactly a denial.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nHovde claims Thompson was a corporate lobbyist and has even lobbied during the current campaign.\n\nBy the official definition, Hovde is off. Thompson is not a registered lobbyist and the the only significant evidence of direct contact with an elected official is the North Carolina example.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s clear that Thompson has sold his influence and connections to firms to whom it would benefit on Capitol Hill, but did so in a way -- as a consultant -- to avoid having to register.\n\nAs with the Gingrich claim, we rate this one Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10605"}
