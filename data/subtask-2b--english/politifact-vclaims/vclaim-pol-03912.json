The president-elect also said he would have won the popular vote if not for \"the millions of people who voted illegally.\" PolitiFact national examined that claim and rated it Pants on Fire.\nWe decided to fact-check Trump\u2019s eye-opening claim about \"serious voter fraud\" in California.\nOur research\nTrump offered no evidence about California voter fraud in his series of tweets.\nOn Monday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller cited a national study done by the Pew Research Center showing that approximately 24 million voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or inaccurate. However, no one from Trump\u2019s office has shown evidence of \"serious voter fraud\" in California.\nTrump may be drawing on an unsupported claim that 3 million \"illegal aliens\" cast votes in this year\u2019s election. That allegation was made on Twitter by Gregg Phillips, who has worked for the Republican Party and has a voter fraud reporting app.\nPolitiFact reported that Phillips has not released any corroborating evidence and noted that public information undermines his statement. It rated his claim False.\nOn Nov. 8 in California, there were reports of election glitches, such as the wrong names being placed on some absentee ballots and long lines at some polling places.\nBut state and local election officials, along with independent observers, say there have been no reports of widespread voter fraud in the state.\n\"His allegations are completely unfounded,\" California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in an interview. \"I think it\u2019s a big disservice to our country and to our democracy to continue to raise these doubts. If anything, a message back to Mr. Trump is, if you have proof, if you have evidence, please bring it forward. Procedures are in place to investigate any real voter fraud. But as the evidence has shown, the cases of voter fraud across the country are statistically minimal if you go back decades.\"\nPadilla\u2019s office could not immediately say how many voter fraud complaints it\u2019s received for this and past general elections.\nHillary Clinton held a 3.9 million vote lead over Trump as of Nov. 28, a margin that\u2019s grown substantially as California continues to count the state\u2019s many absentee ballots.\n'Broad brush allegations'\nDean Logan, president of the California Association of Clerks and Election Officials and the top elections official in Los Angeles County, said in a statement responding to Trump\u2019s tweets, that the state has \"a history of accurate and accountable elections.\"\nLogan described Trump\u2019s voter fraud claims as \"broad brush allegations.\"\nLogan added in an email to PolitiFact California that: \"Quantifying complaints or allegations of voter fraud is not a specific data set that we track. \u00a0That alone probably gives you a sense of the frequency, but there is no indication that the rate of concern on this issue was higher in this election cycle than in any other.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that there are legal avenues for challenging a voter\u2019s eligibility. But none were used before or after the election, he said.\n\"And I think that sort of goes to the point that there\u2019s nothing to back up those allegations,\" Logan said.\nSacramento County\u2019s Assistant Registrar of Voters Alice Jarboe said of the more than 530,000 county voters that turned out on Election Day, none has made a complaint about voter fraud.\nJarboe, who\u2019s worked at the department for 18 years, said no complaints are \"the norm\" for elections in her county.\n\"I\u2019ve never seen anything (related to voter fraud) that would affect the outcome of an election -- ever,\" she added.\nKim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit voter advocacy group, said she\u2019s not seen evidence of serious voter fraud.\n\"No system is perfect -- people do make mistakes,\" Alexander said.\nShe added, however, that California\u2019s voter verification laws are among the most robust in the country. Each county, she noted, is automatically required to perform a recount a fraction of its ballots by hand.\nThe state also prohibits paperless electronic voting, a type of voting that makes audits nearly impossible, she said.\nTrump\u2019s unsupported claim about voter fraud in California may also draw on misinformation about two recent state laws: AB 60, which allows undocumented immigrants to obtain state driver\u2019s licenses; and the New Motor Voter Act, which by mid-2017 will automatically register citizens to vote when they obtain or renew a driver\u2019s license.\nThe automatic registration only applies to citizens who are already eligible to vote, not to undocumented immigrants. Padilla, California\u2019s secretary of state, has said the new system would require potential voters to show identification such as a birth certificate or passport to reflect their citizenship before they are registered.\nCalifornia voters, in most cases, are not required to show identification at their polling places.\nOur ruling\nDonald Trump claimed \"serious voter fraud\" took place on Election Day in California. He offered no evidence backing up his statement and his press team did not respond specifically to a request about fraud in the state.\nElections officials and nonpartisan observers in California said there were no widespread reports of voter fraud. The state has some of the most stringent voter verification laws in the country. Allegations of fraud are so rare that Los Angeles County, the state\u2019s largest county, does not track them.\nPolitiFact New Hampshire examined Trump\u2019s claim that the Granite State also experienced\u00a0\"serious voter fraud.\" It described Trump\u2019s statement as \"reckless claim with zero evidence,\" and rated it Pants On Fire after finding \u00a0there were \"no complaints of voter fraud filed in an election in which more than 728,000 ballots were cast.\"\nTrump\u2019s claim about California voter fraud is equally reckless and without substantiation.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire.\n\nPANTS ON FIRE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/212609ba-7a41-42a0-bb8a-2368e2b5121e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03912"}
