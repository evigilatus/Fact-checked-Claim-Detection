The Democratic Party came to power, and the Democrats took over the Governor &apos; s office as well as control of the Senate and the Assembly. That election should have happened. Our country faces challenges that we simply cannot ignore.\" Fitzgerald said to hundreds of conference participants at a resort in Wisconsin Dills. \"Our government is growing very fast, becoming very expensive. One in five people in Wisconsin on Medicaid or medical care. One in two on some kind of government charity.\" One out of every two people in Wisconsin -- half of the state's population -- gets \"government charity?\" This is a large population of Wisconsin. We asked Fitzgerald's spokesman, Andrew Wilhouse, to provide evidence to support the statement. At first, Wilhouse said that his boss's claim \"was wrong, but the biggest conversation about government benefits and spending was long overdue.\" This isn't a big defense. This passage was cited by Welhouse from an analysis of federal data conducted by the United States of America today in April 2011: \"18.3 per cent of the nation's total personal income was a payment by the Government for social security, medical care, food stamps, unemployment benefits and other programmes in 2010. The wages represented the lowest share of income - 51 per cent - since the Government began to follow its course in 1929.\" This whole thing could be true. But that's out of the question. The article refers to the percentage of total income of Americans from the government. But it says nothing about the percentage of people in Wisconsin -- or Americans, in this matter -- who receive government assistance. We still want to know what Fitzgerald knew about government charity. When he called again, he told him Fitzgerald was meant to say that one out of every six people in Wisconsin -- not one out of two -- gets government charity. Wilhouse did not mention what Fitzgerald Sadiqat considered, but he provided the United States today with another article from August 2010. In an analysis of State data, the newspaper found that government anti-poverty programmes such as social welfare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance provided a record of one in six Americans. But the article didn't mention Wisconsin. We contacted government agencies to see how many people in Wisconsin receive government assistance from the four major programs mentioned in the second article presented by Wilhouse. Here's what we found: Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aids - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021 Medeked: 1,174,874 people, including more than 465,000 children, have access to Medeked, according to the Ministry of Health Services in Wisconsin. Medicaid, including the State Badger Care Programs, pays for health care for low-income people. Food stamps: 802,979 people, including 353,310 children, were on the food-sharing programme in March 2011, according to the same section. Unemployment insurance: 140,055 unemployed persons, according to the Ministry of Labour Development in Wisconsin. Wisconsin Works (W-2), which replaced traditional social welfare: 43,093 people, including 27,614 children, were receiving cash assistance from W-2 in April 2011, according to the Children and Families Department in Wisconsin. Since Wisconsin has about 5.65 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, that means that almost one in five state residents is on Medicked alone. If recipients are added to all four programmes, the total will represent 2.16 million people, or more than one in three of the Wisconsin population. This is still far less than one of the two that Fitzgerald claimed in the Convention. But the real figure is less than 2.16 million because some people get help from more than one program. On the basis of the information available, we have not been able to identify a precise number - nor have we been able to identify Fitzgerald. We also contacted experts in four private organizations in Wisconsin following government programmes. No one said that they were aware of any study that attempted to determine the proportion of the population of Wisconsin receiving government assistance or \"government charity.\" All of this puts aside the question of what constitutes charity, which is a subjective term. The article cited by Fitzgerald's assistant in support of claim 1 in 2 includes social security and medical care, both of which are paid to workers through salary taxes. Many people do not consider these programs as charity. Here's the point: Fitzgerald made a bold statement at the GoP state conference -- that one in two Wisconsin residents \"is on some kind of government charity. He was not able to provide any evidence to support the prosecution, but one of his assistants basically admitted that it was wrong. Subsequently, the leader of the Senate presented a different number, but the statements on which he relied were not specific in Wisconsin. We appreciate that Fitzgerald's statement is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13038"}
