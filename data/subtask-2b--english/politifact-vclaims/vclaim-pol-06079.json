He chose a colder route. Sanders and his\u00a0wife, Jane Sanders, spent their first days as newlyweds in the Soviet Union, claims George Will in a recent Washington Post column.\nWill\u2019s Aug. 7 column focused mostly on the legacy of Robert Conquest, who died Aug. 3 at age 98, and whose writings on Soviet prisons documented the atrocities of the\u00a0Stalin\u00a0regime. A reader asked us to look into the accuracy of the final paragraph of Will\u2019s column, which invoked Sanders\u2019 \"honeymoon.\"\nIt reads:\n\"Conquest lived to see a current U.S. presidential candidate, a senator, who had chosen, surely as an ideological gesture, to spend his honeymoon in the Soviet Union in 1988. Gulags still functioned, probably including some of the \u2018cold Auschwitzes\u2019 in Siberia, described in Conquest\u2019s \u2018Kolyma.\u2019 The honeymooner did not mind that in 1988 political prisoners were \u2014 as may still be the case \u2014 being tortured in psychiatric \u2018hospitals.\u2019 Thanks to the unblinking honesty of people like Conquest, the Soviet Union now is such a receding memory that Bernie Sanders\u2019s moral obtuseness \u2014 the obverse of Conquest\u2019s character \u2014 is considered an amusing eccentricity.\"\nWe wanted to see if Sanders actually honeymooned on the turf of the United States\u2019 former adversary during the final years of the Cold War.\nSister cities\nThe trip took place while Sanders was mayor of Burlington, Vt., from 1981 to 1989. Toward the end of his mayoral tenure, the small city on Lake Champlain launched a sister-city program with Yaroslavl, located 160 miles northeast of Moscow.\nThe program, which is still operating today, has facilitated exchanges between the two cities involving \"mayors, business people, firefighters, jazz musicians, youth orchestras, mural painters, high school students, medical students, nurses, librarians and the (Yaroslavl)\u00a0ice-hockey team,\" according to its website.\nAlong with sister-city relationships with Bethlehem in the West Bank and Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, the Yaroslavl program was part of Sanders\u2019\u00a0unorthodox attempt to take on international issues from a small city in New England. Sanders also actively pursued his agenda outside of the country, writing letters to world leaders and even traveling to Cuba to meet with the mayor of Havana.\n\"Burlington had a foreign policy,\" he wrote in his 1997 book Outsider in the House, \"because, as progressives, we understood that we all live in one world.\"\nThe bond between Burlington and Yaroslavl solidified when Sanders and his wife, as members of a 12-person delegation from Burlington, paid their Soviet counterparts a visit in 1988.\nThe timing of the trip was unusual. Bernie and Jane were married May 28, 1988.\u00a0The delegation left Burlington the next day.\n\"Trust me,\" Sanders writes in the book. \"It was a very strange honeymoon.\"\nWhen reached for comment, Sanders\u2019\u00a0campaign said that the dates for the trip had already been set, and the couple \"set their wedding date to coincide with that trip because they didn't want to take more time off.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2007 interview, Jane Sanders also recalled the peculiar timing: \"The day after we got married, we marched in a Memorial Day parade, and then we took off in a plane to start the sister city project with Yaroslavl with 10 other people on my honeymoon.\"\nBernie Sanders also refers to the trip sarcastically as \"quiet and romantic\" in his book.\nThe \"honeymoon\" was dotted with meetings, interviews and diplomatic functions. A June 2015 profile\u00a0in The Guardian described the former mayor\u2019s meeting with Yaroslavl city officials:\n\"After receiving a rundown of central planning, Soviet-style, from Yaroslavl\u2019s mayor, Alexander Riabkov, Sanders notes how the quality of both housing and health care in America appeared to be \u2018significantly better\u2019 than in the communist state. \u2018However,\u2019 he added, \u2018the cost of both services is much, much, higher in the United States.\u2019 \"\nAn education in central planning probably\u00a0wasn\u2019t the only item on Sanders\u2019 itinerary. Yaroslavl is home to historic churches and buildings, and the Sanderses would have been in for some good sightseeing, said Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\nWill made it sound as if Sanders was visiting to condone\u00a0Soviet\u00a0torture practices, but the Burlington trip was more of a\u00a0dialogue-building\u00a0exchange program.\u00a0The Vermont weekly newspaper\u00a0Seven Days\u00a0reported in 2009 that the sister-city\u00a0relationship \"helped local residents who sought to ease tensions between the United States and Soviet Union by initiating citizen-to-citizen exchanges with a Russian city.\"\u00a0\nAlso, the Soviet Union was barely intact at the time of the trip.\u00a0\nNegotiations had opened up between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev a few years earlier. \"It was at the beginning of perestroika,\" said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for the Sanders campaign, referring to the restructuring policy Gorbachev instituted in the mid 1980s.\nGulags still existed and political prisoners were still held in 1988, said Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. But a watershed moment came when Gorbachev allowed physicist Andrei Sakharov to return from internal exile two years earlier.\n\"The power of the Communist Party was being questioned and the confrontation with the West was winding down through negotiations,\" Cohen said.\nIn 1987, Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and in 1988, Reagan himself spoke in Moscow\u2019s Red Square. One year later brought the fall of the Berlin Wall. Three years later, the Soviet Union collapsed.\nParticipation in the Burlington-Yaroslavl\u00a0program has waned over the years, though it was viewed as a \"glamorous endeavor\" by many in Burlington at the time, program leader Howard Seaver\u00a0said in 2009.\nWill could not be reached for comment through his researcher.\nOur ruling\nWill wrote that Sanders chose \"to spend his honeymoon in the Soviet Union in 1988.\"\nSanders and his wife did travel to Yaroslavl, a city in the Soviet Union, after their wedding in 1988. In the sense that the trip came after the couple were married, the trip was a honeymoon. The two\u00a0have also referred to the trip that way, albeit sarcastically at times.\nBut it was an unusual honeymoon, to say the least. The trip\u2019s primary purpose was diplomacy, not leisure, and included about 10 extra guests.\nWill\u2019s claim is accurate but is missing context about the trip\u2019s underlying purpose.
