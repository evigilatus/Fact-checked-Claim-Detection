Barack Obama laid down the challenge for a duel.\n\nHis eyes weren't exactly squinting. And theme music to\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\n\ncould not be heard. But the gauntlet was dropped.\n\n\n\"I'm ready to duel John McCain on taxes,\" Obama said. \"Right here. Right now.\"\n\n\nThen Obama surprised the crowd.\n\"I don't know if people are aware of the fact,\" Obama said, \"but the family legend is that Wild Bill Hickok, he's a distant cousin of mine.\"\n\n\n\nThe crowd roared with laughter. It seemed that perhaps the sun had gotten to him.\n\n\n\"I'm serious, I'm serious,\" Obama said. \"I don't know if it's true, but that's the family legend. But we're going to research that.\"\n\n\nNo need, Sen. Obama. We called the New England Historic Genealogical Society. These are the folks who back in March released the study that found that Obama is a distant relative of actor Brad Pitt (ninth cousins, to be exact).\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Child, a staff genealogist, compared geneological charts for Obama and Hickok and...bang...there it was. The two trees intersected with one Thomas Blossom of Holland, who arrived in Plymouth, Mass., in 1629.\n\n\nThe two are sixth cousins\n\nsix\n\ntimes removed, Child said. Whatever that means.\n\n\nSeems quite a length for Obama to go to support a metaphor about dueling with your opponent over taxes, but then Hickok was also a noted gambler.\n\n\nObama also said that Hickok, the legendary frontier lawman, had his first duel in Springfield, Mo. While we were digging we looked that up, too. And Obama is right again. While it's hard for many historians to separate fact from legend, it is documented that James Butler Hickok (his name wasn't even William) got the better of former Confederate Army soldier Davis Tutt in a 1865 \"quick draw\" duel after a dispute involving gambling debts and, you guessed it, a woman.\n\n\nIn the ensuing years, Hickok boasted of killing more than 100 men. Though in his defense, he said they all had it coming.\n\n\nHickok got his in 1876 after he apparently broke the cardinal rule of gunfighters: He sat with his back to the door and was shot from behind while playing poker at a saloon in Deadwood, S.D. The story was that he was holding two pairs, aces and eights \u2014 hence the term \"dead man's hand\" still used today.\n\n\nThe relation to \"Wild Bill\" Hickok is way cooler than the revelations earlier this year that Obama is distantly related to none other than vice president Dick Cheney. Undoubtedly, Obama took a lot of ribbing over that. Maybe those jokesters ought to sleep with one eye open because Obama's \"family legend\" is correct.
