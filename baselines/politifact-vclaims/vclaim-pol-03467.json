Sims: Martina White wants to deport all immigrants; she never said that", "text": "Not long after squaring off against Pa. Rep. Martina White in a Fox 29 debate over sanctuary cities last week, Rep. Brian Sims sent a fundraising message attacking her further.\n\"Finally,\" the message read, \"I will continue to fight against Republicans like Martina White, who like Trump, wants to deport all of our hard working immigrant brothers and sisters and white wash America.\"\n\"All\" immigrants? Has White ever suggested she wanted to deport every immigrant?\nThis is a quick fact-check. In short, White has not suggested this, something Sims spokesperson Dan Siegel acknowledged in a phone conversation, admitting that White had never said it. She hasn\u2019t introduced or supported any legislation that would lead to the deportation of all immigrants, either.\nWhite\u2019s discussion of any policy involving immigration has mostly been limited to sanctuary cities. Last week, she reintroduced a bill that would strip hundreds of millions in state funding from Philadelphia if it continues to not fully cooperate with federal immigration officials as part of its sanctuary city status.\nShe emphasized in a statement responding to Sims\u2019 fundraising message she supports legal immigration and has never suggested all immigrants be deported.\n\"I find it disgusting that Rep. Sims would try to raise money by blatantly lying about me and using such derogatory terms about a fellow legislator,\" she said. \"The fact is that I fully support and welcome legal immigration, and - as a state Representative - I do not weigh in on federal government policy regarding undocumented immigrants presently in our country.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My concern is rogue public officials who violate federal law to further their own agendas. Perhaps Rep. Sims should spend more time focusing on protecting the people of Philadelphia and upholding the law he took an oath to follow instead of lying and playing politics.\"\nSiegel compared White to Trump, pointing out the similarities of her sanctuary cities bill and the president\u2019s executive order threatening to slash federal funding from sanctuary cities. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"I think it\u2019s fair to say that she views an America that is very homogeneous,\" Siegel said, \"and I think her actions have shown that she doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of respect for folks who have come to this country and tried to build a life here.\"\nOur ruling \nRep. Brian Sims claimed in a fundraising message fellow state Rep. Martina White \"wants to deport all of our hard working immigrant brothers and sisters and white wash America.\" White has never said anything like this or supported legislation that could lead to the deportation of all immigrants. A spokesperson for Sims acknowledged White had not said this, and White said she supported legal immigration. \u00a0\u00a0\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Sims stretched the truth in a fundraising message. Last spring, while asking for donations, he claimed \"right-wing extremists\" were trying to take his seat, though no Republicans were running for his seat and his Democratic competitors were similarly progressive.\nWe rule the claim Pants On Fire.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    6 7  Politifact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Finally, I will continue to fight against Republicans like Martina White, who like Trump, wants to deport all of our hard working immigrant brothers and sisters and white wash America.\"    Brian Sims State Rep.
