Illinois House Speaker and Democratic Party Chairman Michael Madigan is one of those Democrats. Madigan has compared Rauner to Trump several times and said he feels fully justified grouping the two together.\nIn an interview with WSIU and WBBM radio stations published Aug. 1, Madigan said:\n\"Bruce Rauner is of record that he will fully support the Trump candidacy. It's documented. It\u2019s available.\"\u00a0\nWe wondered if Madigan was right. Does Rauner fully support Trump? What\u2019s Rauner\u2019s take on the Republican presidential nominee? We looked into Madigan\u2019s claim to find out.\nSupporting the presidential nominee \nWhen we asked where Madigan found the information backing his claim, Madigan spokesman Steve Brown simply said, \"It\u2019s everywhere online. Google it, and it will come up in 9 seconds.\"\nBrown didn\u2019t point to any specific articles, so we took his recommendation and Googled our question. For the record, it only took Google .45 seconds to find articles relating to Rauner and Trump.\nIn March, Rauner told reporters he would support the Republican presidential nominee, even if it turned out to be Trump. When asked why, Rauner explained, \"I\u2019m the leader of the Republican party in Illinois.\" He added, \"I will do everything I can to support that nominee.\"\nThat same month, he told students in Wilmette he was \"horrified\" by the presidential campaign rhetoric. \"Democracy is hard, you know, and this presidential election, oh my goodness, I'm appalled by the rhetoric, it's appalling,\" Rauner said. \"And it's ugly and it's nasty and it's weird, and just some of the statements that get made, I'm just, I'm horrified.\"\nSince those public comments, Rauner\u2019s been asked repeatedly about his actions related to the presidential election. Rauner hasn\u2019t said much and doesn\u2019t answer questions about Trump.\nOn July 12, Rauner did not join Trump during a campaign fundraiser even though the two were both in Chicago that day. A week later, Rauner skipped the Republican National Convention in Cleveland when Trump formally became the party\u2019s presidential nominee. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRauner\u2019s aides told the Chicago Tribune the governor wouldn\u2019t formally endorse Trump, and did not explain why not. The Tribune reported, \"Rauner repeatedly had sought to stay out of the presidential race, though he did say that as leader of the GOP in Illinois, he would back the eventual nominee. But Rauner aides stressed there are various levels of \"support,\" and that the governor would not be giving Trump a formal endorsement.\"\nBrian Gaines, a political science professor at the University of Illinois, said because\u00a0Rauner isn\u2019t up for election this year, there\u2019s really no reason for him make any more comments about his relationship with Trump.\n\"There\u2019s no law saying that a politician needs to endorse their party\u2019s candidate,\" Gaines said.\n\"(Sen.) Mark Kirk is the more interesting example. Since he would have more interaction with the president and he\u2019s up for election, he really needs to comment. Rauner\u2019s interaction is somewhat fabricated.\"\nIn June, Kirk said publicly he would no longer support Trump. Gaines said Rauner\u2019s language regarding Trump is much more nuanced and purposefully vague.\n\"(Rauner) could say voting for Trump is a form of support and he wouldn\u2019t have to say another word,\" Gaines explained. \"And as the Trump campaign looks weaker and weaker, Rauner can point back and say \u2018I never said I would endorse Trump.\u2019\" \u00a0\nRauner continues to refuse to answer questions from reporters about the presidential election, and his office did not return multiple requests for comment from PolitiFact Illinois for this story. \u00a0\nOur ruling\n\"Bruce Rauner is of record that he will fully support the Trump candidacy. It's documented. It\u2019s available.\"\u00a0\nMadigan is correct. In March, Rauner said he would fully support the Republican presidential nominee. When asked by a reporter if he would still support the nominee if it\u2019s Trump, Rauner reiterated his earlier statement, saying: \"I will support the Republican Party\u2019s nominee.\"\nBut Madigan does not reference any of Rauner\u2019s subsequent comments, including Rauner\u2019s refusal to formally endorse Trump.\nWe rate this claim Mostly\u00a0True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8a7c3a9c-5eb5-4591-a6dc-7f29f5a7ad3c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04498"}
