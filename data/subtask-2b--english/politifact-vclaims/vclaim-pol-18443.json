First they take forever to even start counting, and now that it\u2019s even, Nevada decides to stop counting and is now not going to count anything until TOMORROW! What?!\" said a Nov. 4 Facebook post by Trapt, a band that posted many pro-Trump messages or messages critical of Democrats on social media.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe Facebook post falsely characterized the status of counting ballots in Nevada as of Nov. 4 when the margin between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden was too close to call.\u00a0\nState announced it would hold off posting additional results until Nov. 5\nThe Facebook post included a screengrab of a headline from Breitbart: \"Nevada: No more election results expected until Thursday.\"\nIn that story, Breitbart cited a tweet by the Elections Division of the Nevada Secretary of State posted 2:45 a.m. PST Nov. 4.\n\"That\u2019s it for election results updates until 9:00 am on Nov. 5,\" the tweet stated.\nThat\u2019s it for election results updates until 9:00 am on Nov. 5. Here\u2019s what has been counted so far:All in person early votesAll in person Election Day votesAll mail ballots through Nov. 21/2\u2014 Nevada Elections (@NVElect) November 4, 2020 \n'\nBy that point, all in-person ballots had been counted as well as mail ballots received through Nov. 2. However, election officials still had to count mail ballots received on Election Day as well as those received over the next several days and provisional ballots.\n\"Ballots outstanding is difficult to estimate in Nevada because every voter was sent a mail ballot. Obviously, not all will vote,\" the state elections office tweeted.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the state elections office announced it would not post another update until Nov. 5, the counting of ballots still continued, said Jennifer Russell, a spokesperson for the Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske. Russell told PolitiFact the afternoon of Nov. 4 that it was possible that the state would post an update on that day.\nCounting of ballots continued after the state\u2019s tweet\nThe responsibility for processing ballots lies with the counties, so we went in search of a county elections official to explain the status of their count.\nWashoe County, home to Reno and evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, has about 300,000 voters, the second highest in the state. Washoe elections officials stopped counting around 12:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time Nov. 4. By that point, elections workers had completed counting all of the in person ballots as well as mail ballots received through Nov. 2, said county spokesperson Bethany Drysdale.\nElection workers resumed work at 8 a.m. PST Nov. 4 with processing the mail-in ballots and dropbox ballots from Election Day, which adds up to about 9,000 ballots. The county expects to post results after that process is completed, expected at 10 a.m. Thursday\n\"Processing means sorting, scanning, verifying signatures, and eventually counting. They can't tally the ballots until they've gone through all the prep steps,\" Drysdale said.\nIt was never the intention of the state to announce the final result on election night, Russell said. State law says that election officials have until Nov. 10 to receive mail ballots postmarked by Nov. 3. Voters have until Nov. 12 to \"cure\" their ballots if they forgot to sign them or if there was a signature mismatch. Nevada will certify results on Nov. 16.\nTrump lost Nevada in 2016. This fall he lobbed misleading attacks on mail in voting in the battleground state.\nRELATED: Trump\u2019s misleading claim about ballot signatures in Nevada\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post on Nov. 4 said \"Now that it\u2019s even, Nevada decides to stop counting and is now not going to count anything until TOMORROW! What?!\"\nThe post is wrong. First, elections officials didn\u2019t stop counting ballots, and they didn\u2019t make decisions based on the closeness of the presidential race.\nEarly in the morning of Nov. 4, the state elections office tweeted that it would next announce results on the morning of Nov. 5. But a spokesperson for the Secretary of State and in Washoe County told us that the counting of ballots continued on Nov. 4.\u00a0\nWe rate this statement False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18443"}
