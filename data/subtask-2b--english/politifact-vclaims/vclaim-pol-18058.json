Moore on target with prescription drug cost claim", "text": "If there\u2019s one issue many Democrats and Republicans agree on, it\u2019s that prescription drug costs are too high.\u00a0That point becomes particularly striking when U.S. costs are compared with drug prices in other developed nations.\nBut just how much more expensive are prescriptions here than elsewhere?\nU.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a Wisconsin Democrat, made this claim in a Dec. 11, 2019 tweet:\u00a0\"Prescription drug companies are charging Americans prices that are on average 4x higher than what's charged in other countries.\"\u00a0\nDoes that comparison check out?\nThe source\nWhen asked for backup, Moore\u2019s press secretary Samara Sheff pointed us to findings from the U.S. House\u2019s Ways and Means Committee as well as an editorial from The Hill.\u00a0\nThe committee compared drug prices in the U.S. with 11 countries using 79 drugs that were sold across 2017 and 2018.\u00a0\nThe U.S. was compared alongside the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Australia, Portugal, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland.\u00a0Individual drug prices in the U.S. ranged from 708% to 4,833% higher than the combined mean price of the other 11 countries measured. On average, U.S. drug costs were 3.7 times higher than the combined average of the other 11.\nSo that conclusion essentially matches Moore\u2019s claim.\nOther comparisons\nA 2017 report by the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund, which specializes in health care research, compared six top selling drugs between the U.S. and six other countries: Canada, the U.K., Germany, France, Australia and Norway.\nThe study examined Advair which is often used to treat asthma, Humira, commonly used for arthritis and Crestor, a cholesterol prescription.\nOn average, Advair was about four times higher in the U.S. than the compared countries. Humira was about twice as much and Crestor was also four times more.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another study, conducted by the London-based International Federation of Health Plans, overall prescription drug costs were found to be about three times higher than the U.S. compared to the six countries of the U.K., United Arab Emirates, Germany, Switzerland, South Africa and the Netherlands.\u00a0\nDriving the dollars\nMatthew Fiedler, a fellow with the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, says there can be difficulties in accurately measuring global drug price comparisons.\n\"The broad qualitative conclusion that drug prices are much higher in the United States than in other countries is surely correct,\" Fiedler said in an e-mail to PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"But measuring drug prices \u2014 both in the US and abroad \u2014 is challenging because manufacturers often pay confidential rebates to purchasers.\"\nSimon Haeder, assistant professor of public policy at Penn State University, said there are a few factors that make U.S. drug prices higher than other countries.\u00a0\nThe primary reason cited by most scholars is a lack of competition in the U.S. For most medications, there is a lack of generic drug options available that could be cost efficient alternatives to more expensive brands.\u00a0\nHaeder argues that the path from the pharmaceutical company to the hands of the consumer is also full of middlemen who take a cut of profit of the drug, such as manufacturers, wholesalers and insurers.\u00a0\n\"There\u2019s a bunch of different entities that want to make money,\" Haeder said.\u00a0\nThat ultimately drives up the cost of the drug once it is ready to be sold.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the federal government does little compared to other countries when it comes to negotiating drug prices.\nOur rating\nIn a tweet, Moore said \"Prescription drug companies are charging Americans prices that are on average 4x higher than what's charged in other countries.\"\nWe found studies that support this claim, though at least one pouts the gap somewhat smaller. Other factors, of course, include which drugs and which companies are included in the comparison.\nOur definition of Mostly True is \"the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\"\nThat fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18058"}
