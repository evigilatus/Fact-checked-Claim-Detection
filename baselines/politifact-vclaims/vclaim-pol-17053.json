The voiceover claims that Seattle is planning to defund its police department by 50%, as well as remove some 9-1-1 dispatchers. Then, the voice of Sean Hannity of Fox News is heard:\u00a0\n\n\"Joe Biden is absolutely on board with defunding the police.\"\u00a0\nImmediately following that, Biden\u2019s voice can be heard saying: \"Yes. Absolutely.\"\u00a0\nTrump has also made the same charge against Biden over and over again.\nA June 7, 2020 tweet on stated that Biden and Democrats want to defund police and another tweet made the same claim on July 17, 2020. He also repeated the claim during a July 19, 2020 interview with Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\nBut repeating -- and repeating -- a falsehood does not make it true.\u00a0\nBiden is clear on police reform\nWhile some argue police departments should be eliminated entirely, as PolitiFact National detailed in a June 9, 2020 article, the use of the phrase \"defund the police\" more typically means to revisit the functions of police departments and shift funding toward, for instance, mental health and social services.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

In order to get a grant, the departments would have to hire officers that reflect the racial diversity of the community they serve.\u00a0\nSo, Trump flatly misrepresents Biden\u2019s position.\nOur ruling\nA Trump campaign ad running in Wisconsin claimed that Biden \"absolutely wants to defund police.\"\u00a0\nBut Biden himself has said several times in interviews and op-eds that he does not support defunding the police. And his campaign platform actually includes hiring more officers, focused on community policing.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17053"}
