At the same time, advertising manufacturers, the conservative group, the spending-out fund, told us that advertising is \"100 percent accurate.\" Seems like a work for PoliticFact. The announcement, a 60-second spot, claims that New Hampshire families are struggling, but \"the fortune of Shahin has increased during her tenure.\" The announcement says that \"the news raises questions about the Shahin family that benefit from their voices in Congress, a suspicious stock deal and a conflict of interest.\" The Declaration concludes: \"The Shahin family becomes richer. The New Hampshire family gets the bill.\" The Shahin Republican discount will be determined at the primary level on 9 September, and the odds are the former San. Scott Brown. Was Christian Christian Christian Christian Christian Christian? Brian Baker, head of the end-of-spend company, sent us a backup version of the announcement. He also told us that despite Shaheen's protests, the announcement was still taking place in New Hampshire, although it had been amended to add a signal at the request of a television station. Evidence of this allegation comes from OpenSecrets.org, a web site managed by the Campaign Funding Monitoring Group Centre for Responsive Policies. The OpenSecrets.org estimates the net value of the candidate using the financial disclosure reports. But this isn't an exact science. The forms do not require candidates to list their actual holdings, but to ascertain a set of values for each job, bank account, investment or asset they own, as well as their debts. For example, in 2008, Shahin indicated that it had between $15,001 and $50,000 in a cheque account at Ocean National Bank. According to OpenSecrets.org, in 2008, when Shaheen was elected to the United States Senate, it was $3.4 million net. This is calculated by creating an average of its total assets, ranging from $2.94 million to $6.08 million, and by deducting its average total liabilities, ranging from $650,000 to $1.5 million. Many of its assets are listed as common to her husband, Bill Shahin, with whom she provides joint taxes. Using the same methodology, OpenSecrets.org estimated the net value of the sheep in 2012 at $5.4 million. The end of expenditure compared to 2008 figures with 2012 resulted in an increase of $2 million. This is already problematic. In May, Shahin submitted its disclosure forms for 2013. Therefore, the end of expenditure does not use the latest figures. These figures show that the net value of Shahin is $2.7 million, or $700,000 less than in 2008. How did we get that? The Shahin 2013 form indicates that the low and high limits of its total assets increased from 2008, ranging from $3.75 million to $7.89 million. But their commitments were also high: between $2.03 million and $4.2 million. Many of the added obligations are for mortgages. In 2008, Shahin had four mortgages and a promissory note. By 2013, it had 10 mortgages and two promissory notes. It is important to emphasize that we do not know where its origins are in this area. The 2013 values overlap considerably with the figures reported in 2008. In this regard, its assets are likely not to have risen at all. Donald Trump's second presidential isolation was \"the most isolated of the two parties in American history.\" In the history of Louis Jacobson on January 13, 2021, it is fair to say, however, that the Shahis have gained shares in many commercial and residential properties since 2008, and that the number of investments and financial projects on the list has increased. When the average voter &apos; s net value falls, this is not usually due to the fact that they take multiple loans and buy more real estate while their investments expand. Baker said only Shahin's assets must be taken into account, not their debts. However, wealth is traditionally measured in view of both assets and liabilities to calculate net value. There's another way we can look at Shaheen's financial resources. In June, her campaign provided members of the media with access to eight years of tax returns. They paint a mixed picture, according to the news reports, showing Shaheen's income since assuming office is flat and linked to her Senate salary, while her husband's projects are rising and falling. According to the newspaper Telegraph in Nashua, N.H., the highest year of income for the couple was in 2012, when Shaheen received $580,000 between her Senate salary and her husband &apos; s law firm. But Bill Shahin &apos; s business partnerships have also lost nearly $1 million over the past five years, as the telegraph machine has found. For example, in 2010, the Shahin people reported income of $522,000, but also losses of $300,000 resulting in a total income of $186,000, according to the Concord Observatory. In 2013, the spouses received approximately $505,000, a sum reported by the Observatory, which is close to their previous average annual tax salary of $474,000 during the eight years released. The profit from the votes? The Declaration also indicates that Shahin &apos; s wealth is somehow linked to the work of Congress. All the evidence from the end of the spending goes back to an article in June in Boston Globe that focuses largely on her husband's stock options in UV labs -- stock options that the campaign says were never exercised. According to The Globe, in 2009, Shaheen &apos; s husband had stock options of between $1,000 and $15,000 in the company. At about the same time, UV laboratories - the company \"Development of new mammography technology for breast cancer detection,\" according to the article - received approximately $78,000 in incentive funds. Shahin voted in favour of motivation, along with all the other Democrats (with the exception of ill-aged Ted Kennedy). The funds of the UV came through the National Science Foundation, and were not specifically allocated by Shaheen, as they noted in their analysis of the Declaration. The ad says Shaheen \"failed to report correctly\" the shares. What he's not telling you is that the stock options were \"wrong\" only because Shahin failed to show that he was already out of reach, as her campaign said. According to the forms, the value of inventories in 2013 was estimated at between US$ 0 and US$ 1,000. The Globes also notes that UV laboratories have pressured Congress and the Ministry of Defence to allocate more money to breast cancer research. During its term in Congress, Shahin pushed legislation to do the same, and at some point supported a programme that would fund breast cancer research through the army (Shaheen sits on the Armed Services Commission). Shahin's husband also sought to help clients obtain motivational funds through the creation of the \"Stimulation Opportunity Team,\" according to the Globe. The company told the Globe that she didn't have customers and that she was short-lived. The Glob newspaper quoted a good government group critical of Shahin's commercial practices, and voters should certainly look at these results in the polls. However, the points raised in the story do not seem to prove the central premise of the announcement that Shahin's wealth has risen as a result of its work in Congress. Our referee, \"The Finishing Fund,\" says Shaheen's wealth increased while she was in public office. According to one measure, the value of two fats has declined since assuming office. Although she and her husband recorded more assets, investments and financial projects than they did in 2008, their debts are much higher than the mortgages. Her tax revenues, which were provided jointly with her husband, have shown significant fluctuations in income since 2006, making it difficult to discern whether her wealth \"has increased.\" Its income for 2013 was slightly higher than its average for the past eight years. The end of the spending indicates a story that raised questions about Shahin's husband's business practices and her relationship to her congressional votes. However, the results of the story do not indicate a surge in wealth on the part of the family. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.
