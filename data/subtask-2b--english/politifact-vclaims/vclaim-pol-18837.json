The report is based on a video taken by a bystander, which shows several people running in the street, before about 15 officers swarm the vehicle, yelling for the driver to get out. The video shows at least two officers smashing the windows, before pulling out the driver and beating her with a baton.\n\"Officers then pull a second adult out of the vehicle, and then seconds later appeared to remove the child from the backseat,\" the newspaper reported. \"An Inquirer photographer captured an image of police holding a young boy at the scene at the same time, and a freelance photographer captured another image of police pulling that child out of the vehicle that was bashed.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, 28-year-old Rickia Young borrowed her sister\u2019s car, put her 2-year-old son in the back seat, and drove across town to pick up her nephew from a friend\u2019s house. The incident happened when they were on their way back home and had turned onto a street where protesters and police had clashed.\u00a0\nPolice officers told Young to turn around, according to one of the lawyers representing her, and as she tried to make a three-point turn, they surrounded the car.\nYoung was arrested and later released without charges. The police department told the Inquirer that its internal affairs unit had opened an investigation into the officers\u2019 actions.\nThe National Fraternal Order of Police, the country\u2019s largest police union, posted the image of the police officer holding the toddler on social media.\n\"This child was lost during the violent riots in Philadelphia,\" the union said in a tweet and Facebook post that have since been deleted, \"wandering around barefoot in an area that was experiencing complete lawlessness. The only thing this Philadelphia police officer cared about in that moment was protecting this child.\"\nThe Inquirer reached out to the Fraternal Order of Police about its post. The union didn\u2019t respond but the newspaper said the post was deleted about 30 minutes later.\nRiley H. Ross III, one of the attorneys representing Young in a civil rights case stemming from the clash, denounced the union\u2019s post on Twitter, calling it \"a lie.\"\u00a0\n1/ This post by @GLFOP is a lie.

The boy was not found wandering the streets. He was pulled from the backseat of an SUV after police swarmed the vehicle and arrested his mother.\nWe rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18837"}
