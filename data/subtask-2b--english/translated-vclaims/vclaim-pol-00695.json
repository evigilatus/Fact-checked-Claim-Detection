His 27 April event in Green Bay and Weiss followed his pattern of deviating the actual practice and circumstances of the rare event. Trump said he was shocked because the Democratic Governor of Wisconsin said he would reject a bill that would punish doctors who did not try to save the life of a live child after attempting to abort. \"Baby Boy,\" said Trump. \"The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby and wrap the baby nicely. The doctor and the mother then decide whether or not to execute the child.\" This is a distortion. Late abortions, which are not common, involve either a pregnancy that poses a direct threat to the life of the mother, or children with severe abnormalities who are unlikely to live more than a few days. In the most rare cases when the child appears alive, the parents will decide whether to ask their doctors to make every effort to keep breathing. Medical researchers describe this as a decision to revive the child. Trump said that as a decision to implement it. In practice and legally, live children are cared for. \"This is a clear concept on which we can all agree,\" said Gretchen Lee, assistant professor at the Faculty of Social Work at Buffalo University and member of the Council of Social Workers for Reproductive Justice in February. \"The idea that anyone who supports the birth of children after birth is preposterous.\" Among the federal and other state laws that already provide for the duty to provide care, the Protection of Living Infants Act 2002 provides that federal legal protections applicable to \"persons\" also cover children born at any stage of development, including after abortion. Trump has referred to the death penalty - a word referring to the legal death penalty - since his State of the Union address in early February. He said it again a few days later in El Paso, Texas. In March in Grand Rapids, Mitch, Democrats attacked \"to allow the children to be ripped from their mother's womb, until the moment of birth.\" The usual pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. Data on abortions performed at the end of that period are limited. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report only late abortions after 21 weeks. This represented 1.4 per cent of all abortions. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers mentioned in a story written by General David H. Berger, the commander of the US Navy, who rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security purposes, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, in Wisconsin, government health officials found that 1% of abortions in 2017, a total of 53%, took place after the 20th week. But Trump was talking about cases that were too late for that. Less than 1 per cent of abortions occur in the third quarter, or 28 weeks later, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Many of those abortions, written by the College, involve problems \"not compatible with life,\" such as a child without a brain or organs formed outside the body. \"In such cases, where death is likely to occur shortly before or shortly after birth, patients may decide whether to continue pregnancy and to give birth to a lifeless foetus or to have an abortion,\" wrote the College. The usually more difficult moral option, in the face of a severely distorted child, ends up with parents and doctors deciding to revive the dying child. Arthur Kaplan, a bioethical scientist at the Langon Medical Center at New York University, said. \"Children born after abortion, spontaneous or induced, with appalling and painful conditions that are not compatible with life, will not be routinely revived or treated in an aggressive manner by most medical teams. In fact, some do not even know how to try, or lack the technology to do so, especially in rural areas.\" Kaplan said that he was not aware of the examples of \"medically active killing\" and that while \"permit death\" happens, it happens \"very rarely -- say, a child born without his lungs in 20 weeks.\" Both sides agree that the active killing of newborns breathing is illegal and should be so. \"There is broad consensus that a child who takes his first breath has crossed a bright line from Jenin to a child and should be protected by law,\" said Theresa S. Colette, Professor of Law at St. Thomas University and Director of the University Promotion Centre. These types of cases have been prosecuted: in 2013, the abortion doctor in Philadelphia Kermit Gusenel was sentenced to three life sentences for murdering a series of newborns in a heinous manner. The letter of Trump in the Green Gulf was based on the words of another ruler, Ralph Northam, in Virginia. Northam, a pediatric neurologist in a radio interview in January said that when embryos are not viable, doctors deliver the baby, keep it comfortable, greet it if the mother wishes, and then \"discuss\" with the mother. Our verdict, Trump, said, with a late abortion, \"The mother meets the doctor. They take care of the baby and wrap the baby nicely. The doctor and the mother then decide whether or not to execute the child.\" Trump is too much to inflate one of the most difficult choices that parents face. We value this allegation wrong.
