Among them was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who \"vetoed legislation to extend early voting,\" according to Clinton.\nChristie called Clinton\u2019s accusation \"ridiculous,\" on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation a few days later.\n\"She doesn't know what she's talking about,\" he said. \"The fact is that folks in New Jersey have plenty of an opportunity to vote.\"\nChristie has a point that voters in New Jersey could vote before Election Day. But Clinton is right that Christie nixed a plan to \"extend\" early voting. We\u2019ll explain.\nUnder New Jersey election law, you can vote early through absentee ballot, but that\u2019s not the same thing as early voting, which experts told us typically means casting your ballot in-person at a limited number of polling locations before election day. With absentee voting, Garden State voters can send their ballots via mail or drop it off in person at an election official\u2019s office as early as 45 days before polls open.\nAfter Hurricane Sandy in 2012, New Jersey witnessed several logistical polling issues around the state on Election Day. So Democratic lawmakers proposed adding the typical in-person early voting option. Under their bill, S2364, a limited amount of polling locations would open for 14 days leading up to Election Day.\nThe New Jersey Legislature passed the bill in March 2013 and sent it to Christie, who threw it out. Christie\u2019s spokesman referred us to his veto message.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

And while there\u2019s no legally or universally recognized definition for the term, experts say Clinton\u2019s is more widely used.\n\"Technically, New Jersey voters can vote early, but it's not what early voting systems look like around the country. It looks like the absentee ballot system,\" said Wendy Weiser, an election law expert at the Brennan Center for Justice.\nHans von Spakovsky, an election law expert at the Heritage Foundation, agreed but noted that, in his opinion, \"Absentee balloting is actually easier than early voting, since you can do everything from your home.\"\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"In New Jersey, Gov. Christie vetoed legislation to extend early voting.\"\nIn 2012, state legislators passed a bill that would have added early, in-person voting to New Jersey\u2019s existing absentee ballot mail-in system. While the legislation wouldn\u2019t have extended the time period for early voting, it would have given voters more ways to vote before Election Day. Christie rejected the bill, saying the existing system worked fine.\nWe\u2019re not weighing in here on whether the new system was better, but we do find that Clinton was careful in how she worded her claim. The proposal would have extended early voting, and Christie vetoed it. We rate her statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06333"}
