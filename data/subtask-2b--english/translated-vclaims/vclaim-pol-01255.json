Of course not.", "text": "President Donald Trump put high eyebrows with a metaphor he used to explain the election procedure in an interview on November 14 with Daily Caller. Specifically, he said that you needed a more detailed definition to buy a box of pills rather than a ballot. Here's what Trump told the conservative media director: \"The Republicans don't win, because of potential illegal votes, which I've been saying for a long time. I have no doubt about that. And I've seen it, I have friends who talk about it when people stand in line and don't vote at all and turn around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, wear a different hat, wear a different shirt, come and vote again. No one takes anything. It's really a shame what's going on. \"The shame is that -- the identity of the voters. If you buy, you know, a box of pills, you have the identity of the voters. Well, here, the only thing you don't do is if you're a voter to the United States. Voters in the United States of America I think it's a shame what's happening. \"Really a shame.\" If this claim sounds ridiculous to you, it is. You do not need an identity card to buy a box of cereals, and in many states you need an identity card to vote. (The White House did not respond to a query about this article.) The purchase of a box of grains there with easy tips for anyone who does not want to show an identity - either a \"sound identity card,\" as Tramp said, or just a simple old driver's license - to buy a Fruit Loops. Use the money. Almost any retailer would take it off your hands without asking questions. Low on dollar bills? He simply used a credit card or a discount card. An estimate by the Federal Reserve in Boston in 2017 found that approximately 76 per cent of consumers had at least one credit card. According to another study by Toll System Services, Inc., about 71 per cent of consumers had one discount card. Combining these numbers with the vast majority of consumers can pay for sugar bombs with plastics. In many cases, if not in most cases, credit cards are verified electronically at the point of sale, without the need for a separate identity check. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" By Daniel Vanky: January 19, 2021, neither the National Retailer Association nor the National Retailer Association - a commercial group of retailers, independent wholesalers and private owners - said that they tracked the percentage of retail outlets that required an identity card with an image above the electronic confirmation of the purchase of credit and discount. However, there are only \"two cases in which identification is required, for example, the purchase of age-restricted products,\" such as alcohol or cigarettes, Laura S. String, Vice-President of Industrial Relations, and communications and marketing with the National Association of Gros. In other words, you can feel safe keeping that identity card if you only buy pills. The voting identities of the interview, making Trump sound like the election system is a wild west where anyone can vote. He's wrong. Ten states have a \"restrictive\" law for the identification of voters, which means that voters without an acceptable identification must vote in a provisional ballot and also take additional steps after the election day for them, in accordance with the National Congress of State Legislatures. Of these, seven require an identity card with a photograph; three accept certain forms of identity cards without photographs. Another 24 states have an \"unrestricted\" electoral identity law, which means that at least some voters without an acceptable identification have an option to vote that will be counted without any further action on their part. Ten of these states specifically require photo identification. This leaves only 16 states with no documentation at the polling place - California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Wyoming and Columbia Province. Trump specifically mentioned one of those states, California, in his remarks to Daily Caler. He also mentioned Florida and New Hampshire, which required identities in opinion polls. (We have already evaluated Pants' claim on fire, repeated by Trump to the Daily Caller newspaper, that Democrats were moving to New Hampshire to vote there in Massachusetts voters. Our Governor Trump said, \"If you buy, you know, a box of pills, if you do anything, you have the identity of the voters. The only thing you don't do is if you're a voter to the United States.\" Any person can buy a grain box with cash, without an identity card, and in most cases can pay for it on a credit card or discount card without having to disclose an identity, either. At the same time, many voters throughout the country have to show identity in the ballot boxes, contrary to the Trump proposal. The statement is ridiculous, so we evaluate it with pants on fire.
