There were two Madison-based guests: Scot Ross, executive director of the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, which revealed Bradley\u2019s college writings; and political consultant Bill McCoshen, a former Republican state official who said Bradley\u2019s commentaries were written too long ago to be relevant. \u00a0\nRoss said Bradley had written that \"women have a legitimate role in date rape. I mean, these are ugly things to say. They're out of touch ...\"\nMcCoshen then interjected, saying:\n\"By the way, that last comment -- Bernie Sanders said something very similar when he was in college, and he just won the Michigan Democratic primary. So, let\u2019s have the same standard for all candidates for public office.\"\nSanders\u2019 comments about rape also were viewed by some as demeaning to women.\nIt\u2019s fair to say up front: Both Bradley\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 comments are open to interpretation.\nWhat Bradley wrote\nThe 1992 student magazine column in question by Bradley (her maiden name was Grassl), who was 21 at the time, was an opinion piece against feminism, which she said \"has adopted an agenda that no longer articulates the feelings of the average American woman; instead, it advocates the extremist platform of the issues advanced by the political left.\"\nThe portion of the column highlighted by One Wisconsin Now referenced author Camille Paglia, a professor at University of the Arts in Philadelphia. Bradley wrote that Paglia had been \"prevented from speaking at several colleges\" after Paglia \"legitimately suggested that women play a role in date rape.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In a column of her own published the previous year, Paglia had written: \"A girl who lets herself get dead drunk at a fraternity party is a fool. A girl who goes upstairs alone with a brother at a fraternity party is an idiot. Feminists call this perspective \u2018blaming the victim.\u2019 I call it common sense.\")\nOf Bradley\u2019s column, One Wisconsin Now said: \"It is abhorrent to blame the victim of a sexual assault, whatever the circumstances.\"\nSo, in an anti-feminism column, Bradley stated that in her opinion, another writer \"legitimately\" suggested that women play a role in date rape.\nWhat Sanders wrote\nSanders\u2019 comments about rape were also in written in a newspaper column and also drew criticism -- although he made them at age 30, eight years after he graduated from the University of Chicago.\nThe column generated news in the presidential campaign after it was referenced in a May 2015 profile about Sanders by the magazine Mother Jones.\nSanders\u2019 column was published in the Vermont Freeman alternative newspaper in 1972, the year he began running for public office. The column was about gender stereotypes and changing gender roles. But it started with what Sanders -- when the issue came up in the presidential campaign -- described as \"bad fiction\":\n\"A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees. A woman tied up. A woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man \u2014 as she fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously \u2026. Do you know why the newspapers with the articles like \u2018Girl, 12, raped by 14 men\u2019 sell so well? To what in us are they appealing?\u2019\u2019\nNew York Post columnist Andrea Peyser, who McCoshen cited to back his claim, wrote in June 2015 that the column \"disgusted\" her, adding: \"Did Sanders confess that he finds real-life instances of sexual violence against children titillating?\"\nSo, in a column about changing gender roles, Sanders made reference to a woman fantasizing about being gang raped.\nOur rating\nMcCoshen says that when Sanders was in college, he said \"something very similar\" to what Bradley had written -- that \"women have a legitimate role in date rape.\"\nBradley was in college when, in an anti-feminism column, she wrote that a professor had \"legitimately suggested that women play a role in date rape.\"\nSanders was eight years out of college when he wrote in a column about gender roles: \"A woman enjoys intercourse with her man \u2014 as she fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously.\u2019\u2019\nSo, both Sanders and Bradley wrote about rape in ways that were offensive to some women, although their columns were about different and broader topics.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, we give McCoshen a Half True", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05259"}
