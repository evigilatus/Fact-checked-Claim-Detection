Bob Kincaid, a liberal radio host and co-founder of Appalachian Community Health Emergency, said in West Virginia \"everything has been for sale to the highest bidder,\" with the toll taken out on the health of the people who live there.\n\"We have sacrificed everything in order to enhance those corporate profits for people who are outside this state,\" Kincaid said on MSNBC\u2019s Melissa Harris-Perry. \"Let's understand that most of West Virginia is still owned, in excess of 90 percent, by out-of-state interests.\"\nThat number jumped out at us and when we got in touch with Kincaid, he was quick to say he had made a mistake.\n\"The number is lower,\" he said. But whatever the number, Kincaid said it wasn\u2019t central to his point. \"The germane fact remains that 300,000 human beings are involuntarily participating in an unconscionable experiment on them, and that is a terrifying reality.\"\nWest Virginia has been rich in coal and timber and the trade-off of who benefits the most from mining and logging is a topic that has simmered for many decades in the state. A landmark 1974 study by a local investigative journalist found that absentee landlords owned or controlled two-thirds of the state\u2019s private land. (That\u2019s obviously well short of 90 percent.)\nIn 2013, a follow-up report from the West Virginia Center for Budget and Policy, a group that focuses on the needs of the moderate and low-income people, and the American Friends Service Committee, found that the fraction of land concentrated in the hands of relatively few owners is much less today.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 10 largest landowners are all headquartered out of state and they hold title to about 12 percent of the state\u2019s private acreage.\nLaying claim to what\u2019s on the surface misses a big piece of West Virginia\u2019s wealth picture. A huge sum of money lies in the mineral rights, mainly the coal and gas. Owning the land doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you own what\u2019s underneath it. But Ted Boettner, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, is reluctant to make hard and fast claims as to who owns that part of the state.\n\"All you can say is that a large fraction of the mineral rights are held by out-of-state interests, but beyond that, we just don\u2019t have the data,\" Boettner said.\nOur ruling\nKincaid said during the broadcast that more than 90 percent of West Virginia is owned by out-of-state interests. He told us he realized his mistake after the show and apologized for his error.\nKincaid gets credit for his readiness to correct his original statement, but we fact-check what he said on air. His claim was wrong. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08375"}
