They would automatically be enrolled. That\u2019s a big difference. Because Barack Obama\u2019s vision was not to leave 10 million uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.\"\nBIDEN: \"They do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in.\"\u00a0\nCASTRO: \"You just said that! You just said that two minutes ago!\"\u00a0\nBIDEN: \"No.\"\u00a0\nCASTRO: \"You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in!\"\u00a0\nBIDEN: \"I said if they cannot afford it!\"\nCASTRO: \"You said they would have to buy in!\"\u00a0\nBIDEN: \"They would not have to buy in. If you qualified for Medicaid, they would automatically be enrolled.\"\u00a0\nCASTRO: \"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said two minutes ago? I mean, I can\u2019t believe you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t have to buy in. You\u2019re forgetting that!\"\nBIDEN: \"I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money, you\u2019re automatically enrolled.\"\nCASTRO: \"It automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not. If you lose your job, for instance, his health care plan would not automatically enroll you. You would have to opt in. My health care plan would. That's a big difference. I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nBIDEN: \"That'll be a surprise to him.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCastro\u2019s criticism falls into two categories. We\u2019ll look at them both.\nDoes Biden\u2019s plan require people who want the public option to \"opt in\"?\nBiden does require those who want Medicare coverage to \"opt in,\" but this requirement is not nearly as significant as Castro makes it seem.\nAs described on his campaign website, Biden\u2019s health care plan advocates \"giving Americans a new choice, a public health insurance option like Medicare. If your insurance company isn\u2019t doing right by you, you should have another, better choice. Whether you\u2019re covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, the Biden Plan will give you the choice to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare.\"\nBiden\u2019s plan would \"ensure people making below 138% of the federal poverty level get covered. He\u2019ll do this by automatically enrolling these individuals when they interact with certain institutions, such as public schools, or other programs for low-income populations, such as SNAP,\" or food stamps.\nThis tracks with what Biden said at one point in the debate \u2014 that \"anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have.\"\nOn the surface, this is a difference with Castro\u2019s plan. Castro\u2019s proposal would \"strengthen Medicare for those who have it, and expand it to achieve universal healthcare coverage by including all Americans within the program.\" Castro would \"allow individuals to obtain supplementary private insurance or opt out of Medicare if they have a high-standard private insurance plan through an employer or organization that is regulated under the Affordable Care Act.\"\nBut Castro\u2019s opt-out plan and Biden\u2019s opt-in plan don\u2019t seem significantly different.\nCastro makes it sound like Biden\u2019s opting-in process would be a noteworthy barrier. More likely, it would amount to a formality. Anyone who wanted the public option would have to request it and, presumably, sign forms like every other person seeking health insurance. But the important part is that they could not be rejected after they fill out those forms.\u00a0\nThe distinction between filling out the paperwork to become part of the public option (as Biden would have it) and automatically becoming enrolled unless you actively reject it (which would, at some point, also require different paperwork) does not strike us as the \"big difference\" Castro touted.\nDid Biden contradict himself?\nCastro\u2019s second line of attack was that Biden initially said people would have to opt in to Medicare and then later changed his tune and said they wouldn\u2019t have to opt in.\nBiden did say at several points before Castro challenged him that enrollment would be automatic \u2014 essentially a formality.\nBiden said that \"anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have.\"\u00a0\nHe also said, \"If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance \u2014 from your employer \u2014 you automatically can buy into this. No pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered, period.\"\nAnd Biden also said, \"Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately.\"\nThese are consistent with Biden\u2019s response to Castro\u2019s attack, that Americans who need the Medicare option would \"automatically be enrolled.\"\nOur ruling\nCastro said, \"The difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in (to a Medicare public option), and I would not require them to opt in. \u2026 They would automatically be enrolled. That\u2019s a big difference.\" He also suggested Biden was contradicting what he\u2019d said moments before.\nCastro\u2019s plan is an opt-out plan while Biden\u2019s is an opt-in plan, but the differences between those are much less than Castro suggests. Biden\u2019s plan would guarantee Americans who are in need access to Medicare coverage, just like Castro\u2019s would. The differences would likely amount to the nature or timing of paperwork, rather than being significant barriers to access.\nCastro used this questionable distinction to charge that Biden had said opposing things within two minutes, but that\u2019s an exaggeration at best.\u00a0\nThe statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00167"}
