But when you look at that word \u2018socialist,\u2019 the Gallup poll did an analysis of what are the characteristics that people would vote for in a president. 'Would you vote for a Mormon?' 'Would you vote for a Jew?' 'Would you vote for a Catholic?' When they get to the question on would you vote for an atheist, it is -- or, excuse me, a socialist, it is even less popular than voting for atheists,\" Granholm said. \"That is why it's an issue.\"\nBecause the polls say that Sanders is giving Clinton a run for her money, we wondered whether calling yourself a socialist really carries the type of stigma that Granholm described.\nWe contacted Granholm's office but didn't hear back.\nThe Gallup poll in question is a survey of 1,527 adults in June 2015.\nThe survey found 47 percent of respondents would vote for a socialist presidential candidate nominated by their party even if the candidate was \"generally well-qualified.\" Fifty percent would not.\nAn atheist candidate would be tolerable to only 58 percent, with 40 percent saying they would not vote for any atheist candidate.

He often calls himself a democratic socialist who talks about the type of socialism seen in the Scandinavian countries, where the political system is democratic. His socialism is often in line with what would be considered strong liberal beliefs. PolitiFact explored the issue in detail in August 2015.\nScott Clifford, a political scientist as the University of Houston, said it's important to remember that each person surveyed was \"asked not about support for atheists/socialists in general, but in the context of their own party nominating one.\"\nSo Democrats will be more open to socialist ideas because the party tends to be liberal, \"home to secular Americans,\" he said.\nThe Republican Party tends to be home to more evangelicals and other religious traditionalists, Clifford said by email, so Republicans would be naturally wary of a nominee who is a socialist.\n\"After all, a Republican socialist is effectively an oxymoron in modern American politics,\" he said.\nThat was clear when Gallup broke the results into party lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nWillingness to vote for\n\n\nDemocrats\n\n\nRepublicans\n\n\nDifference\n\n\n\n\nAn evangelical Christian\n\n\n66%\n\n\n84%\n\n\n18 points\n\n\n\n\nAn atheist\n\n\n64%\n\n\n45%\n\n\n19 points\n\n\n\n\nA gay or lesbian\n\n\n85%\n\n\n61%\n\n\n24 points\n\n\n\n\nA Muslim\n\n\n73%\n\n\n45%\n\n\n28 points\n\n\n\n\nA socialist\n\n\n59%\n\n\n26%\n\n\n33 points\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Geer, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University, said there are a lot of misunderstandings about the term socialist, \"so the survey questions you have in Gallup are probably not very indicative of the amount of support socialists might have.\"\nThe term \"socialist\" may lose some of its sting because Sanders offers it as a solution to voters\u2019 concerns, such as income inequality, he said.\nHe is also highlighting the idea that other industrialized countries that have embraced socialism are doing better on matters such as health care, \"and people are giving him high marks for dealing with the (socialist) question directly and not trying to hedge,\" Geer said.\nWhether Sanders can change the country's aversion to actually voting for a socialist remains to be seen.\nOur ruling\nGranholm said a Gallup survey found that the idea of voting for a socialist for president is even less popular than voting for an atheist.\nThat's precisely what was found in the poll, the first time Gallup has asked about socialist presidential candidates.\u00a0We rate the claim as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05494"}
