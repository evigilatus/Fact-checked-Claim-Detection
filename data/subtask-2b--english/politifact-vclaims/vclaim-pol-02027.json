It hadn't.", "text": "Democrats are mad that Republicans plan to change state government spending without their direct input.\nRepublicans, who hold a supermajority in the North Carolina Legislature, are mostly negotiating budget changes amongst themselves and intend to block any proposed amendments to their bill.\nBut, if voters were to read one Democrat\u2019s newsletter, they\u2019d get an entirely different picture of the situation.\nA May 23 newsletter distributed by Sydney Batch, a Democratic candidate for NC House, overstates what has happened so far.\n\"Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly used the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget,\" the newsletter said.\nIt adds: \"For the first time in (the) history of our great state, they are not allowing any debate or input on our budget.\"\nBatch is running for a House seat representing Raleigh\u2019s southern suburbs. That district's incumbent, a Republican, isn't running for re-election so Batch will face Republican candidate John Adcock.\nThe problem with Batch\u2019s statements is that they aren\u2019t accurate.\n\u00a0\n\nAs we write this fact-check, legislative Republicans have yet to vote on or even reveal their full budget plans. And her statement about the lack of debate is also misleading.\nRepublican leaders plan to gut an\u00a0old bill\u00a0and amend it as a \"conference report\" to include their budget plans, meaning state lawmakers will have no method for amending the legislation. But it remains to be seen whether Republicans will allow debate on the floor of the House and Senate chambers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the historical precedent of blocking amendments, The News & Observer story, which Batch linked to in her newsletter, says amendments won\u2019t be allowed for the first time in \"modern history.\" Gerry Cohen, former head of the bill-drafting division in the Legislature, told the\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0that legislators haven\u2019t completely skipped the amendment process since at least the early 1970s.\u00a0\nWhen contacted by PolitiFact, Batch referred to the claim as \"an inadvertent typo.\"\nAn apology\n\"I meant to type, \u2018Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly decided that they are going to use the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget,\u2019\" Batch wrote in an email\n(Whether or not the process Republicans are using can be referred to as \"the nuclear option\" is another debate altogether.)\n\"I will retract and edit the statement with the email list shortly. Thanks for bringing it to my attention,\" Batch wrote. And retract the statement, she did.\n\nOn May 24, Batch distributed a newsletter apologizing for her mistake.\n\"Friends and supporters, yesterday, there was an error in oversight,\" she wrote.\nIn using a conference report, \"the leadership does not have to allow debate or input on the bill. This enables leadership to stop any changes to their bill, that has become NC's budget. This bill is expected to pass immediately in both chambers when properly introduced. It is a secretive and unethical way to govern,\" she said, concluding: \"I apologize for the mistake in the language used in yesterday's title and if you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact the campaign.\"\nOur ruling\nBatch said, \"Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly used the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget.\" In fact, the budget hasn\u2019t been approved yet. It hasn\u2019t even been put up for a vote.\nBatch apologized for the mistake and retracted her statement in a new email \u2013 which PolitiFact applauds. But that doesn\u2019t protect her first statement from our Truth-O-Meter. We rate her claim False.\nCORRECTION:\u00a0An earlier version of this story misquoted Gerry Cohen, former had of the bill-drafting division in the legislature, saying that a state budget had previously been approved without going through the amendment process. To clarify, Cohen isn\u2019t sure whether it has happened before. This error doesn\u2019t affect PolitiFact\u2019s rating.\n Share the Facts 2018-05-25 20:24:34 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly used the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget\"    Sydney Batch candidate for NC House https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article211901849.html   North Carolina Wednesday, May 23, 2018 2018-05-23    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02027"}
