Most of the words are from another actor", "text": "A blog post going around social media falsely claims that actor Tom Selleck, best known for his starring role in the 1980s television series \"Magnum, P.I.\" praised President Donald Trump during a Breitbart interview and used expletives for people who criticize the president.\nThe article, which was posted by a conservative blog that routinely shares fabricated stories, claims that Selleck said of President Trump:\u00a0\n\"Donald is funny, playful, and colorful, but most of all, he is honest. When he decided to run for president, I know he did it with a true conviction to bring this country back to prosperity. He is the only one who can do it. No frills, no fuss, only candid truths \u2026 I am very disappointed at the talk show hosts, also spewing out lies and propaganda against Donald. Why, I wonder? The only thing I can think of is he represents a form of freedom none of them ever saw before, and they are bewildered about it, and frightened about it. I would say \u2018f*ck you\u2019 to all of them. To all that are criticizing him for no reason and want him to resign for no reason. Just go to hell all of you!\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Most of the words are from a Breitbart interview with another actor \u2014 Jon Voight.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn March 9, 2016, Breitbart published an article with the headline: \"EXCLUSIVE: Jon Voight Endorses Donald Trump for President.\" The bulk of Voight\u2019s statement, excluding the expletives, was lifted and misattributed to Selleck.\u00a0\nSelleck has publicly supported conservative presidential candidates in the past, such as Sen.
