Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says the military is shrinking.\nOn CNN\u2019s State of the Union Sunday morning, Graham criticized President Barack Obama for what he said are \"half-measures\" in thwarting terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. While Obama has focused on avoiding sending in combat troops to the Middle East, Graham said up to 4,000 troops may be necessary.\nThe issue of military size resurfaced when host Candy Crowley asked Graham what his plans are if Republicans take control of the Senate in November. He said replacing sequestration-style budgets is priority No. 1.\n\"You just heard a segment about the spread of Ebola throughout Africa,\" he said. \"We're cutting the CDC's budget, the NIH budget. We're taking the military budget under sequestration cuts down to the smallest Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1915. We're destroying the Intelligence Committee.\"\nThere\u2019s a lot in there, but the idea that the U.S. military -- by far the largest in the world in terms of spending -- is as small as it was nearly a century ago caught our attention.\nWe found that Graham has accurate numbers regarding the Army and Navy. However, comparing today\u2019s military to that of decades ago is comparing apples to oranges because of massive growth in technology and overall capabilities.\nThe numbers\nGraham was referring to the number of ground forces and the number of ships, which is the traditional way of measuring the size of the Army and Navy, respectively, said Alex Roland, a professor of military history at Duke University.\nGraham\u2019s staff pointed us to a letter written by former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2011.\nGraham and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- both supporters of robust funding for the Defense Department -- requested the letter amid Congress\u2019 budget talks in fall 2011 that led to sequestration legislation.\nIn the letter, Panetta said, \"Facing such large reductions, we would have to reduce the size of the military sharply. Rough estimates suggest after 10 years of these cuts, we would have the smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest number of ships since 1915, and the smallest Air Force in its history.\"\nAs far as we can tell, Panetta\u2019s assessment is accurate.\nThe Army already is reducing the number of soldiers to 440,000-450,000 -- down from its recent war-time high of 570,000, according to the Defense Department\u2019s 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review. (Those reductions are the result of the ending of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, not mandated budget cuts as part of the sequestration.)\nGoing forward, if sequestration-style cuts go into effect for fiscal year 2016, the number of soldiers will likely have to drop to 420,000.\nThis is the lowest number of soldiers since 1940. Before the draft went into effect later that year, there were about 264,000 troops in the Army.\nTurning to the Navy, there are currently 289 deployable battle force ships. According to the quadrennial review, there will be an estimated fleet of 234 ships in Fiscal Year 2019.\nThat is the lowest number of ships since 1915 -- two years before the United States got involved in World War I. \u00a0That year, the Navy had 231 deployable ships. In 2016, it jumped up to 245 ships.\nTo summarize:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmy\n\n\n1940\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019 (est.)\n\n\n\n\nNumber of troops\n\n\n264,000\n\n\n440,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNavy\n\n\n1915\n\n\n2019 (est.)\n\n\n\n\nNumber of ships\n\n\n231\n\n\n234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Graham was trying to make the point that the budget cuts have weakened the military to points not seen in decades. However, we learned from experts that comparing the number of troops and ships doesn\u2019t say much about military might.\nThe context\nWe took Graham\u2019s claim to several experts, who told us that comparing the American military of 2014 to that of the early 20th century is irrelevant. Because of technological advances, the ships and troops of today\u2019s military have greater capabilities than they did in the world wars.\n\"One of the reasons for the decrease in size -- both Army and Navy -- is that we now rely far more on technology than on sheer numbers,\" said Roland, the military history expert from Duke. \"The question is not how we compare to our Army in 1940 or our Navy in 1915, but how we compare with our potential enemies in 2014. We are head and shoulders above them.\"\nFor example, the Navy did not have any aircraft carriers in 1915, but now it has an active fleet of 10. David E. Johnson, a political scientist at the Rand Corporation, estimated that just four modern aircraft carriers would have capabilities equal to that of the entire Navy before World War I.\nAt that time, the military also did not have radar, satellites, computers, virtually undetectable ballistic missile submarines, drones and other advanced technology that allow the military to do more with fewer soldiers.\nAlso, in terms of military spending relative to other countries, the United States accounts for 37 percent of the world\u2019s total military spending. China follows, at 11 percent of the world\u2019s spending, as of 2013, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. (Put another way, the United States spends as much on its military as the next 8-12 biggest defense-spending countries combined.)\nWarfare also has changed, Johnson said. It\u2019s been decades since the United States has been involved in a war, like the world wars, where the country lost numerous ships and hundreds of thousands of soldiers. While the military should continue have a robust number of ships and soldiers, it does not necessarily need as many as it did in previous conflicts.\nThat being said, Johnson said sequestration has hindered military capabilities -- particularly in light of recent developments in Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon has had to make cuts to its day-to-day operations, while carrying out missions in the Middle East that were not budgeted for.\nOur ruling\nGraham said that under sequestration, the military was cut \"down to the smallest Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1915.\"\nGraham was counting the number of ground troops in the Army and the number of ships in the Navy. He\u2019s got the numbers right, but it\u2019s not a fair comparison because technology and capabilities have grown so much in the past century. The Army and Navy of today are much more capable than they were decades ago, even with fewer soldiers and ships. A better comparison is to look at how the U.S. military stands up relative to other nations.\nGraham\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07200"}
