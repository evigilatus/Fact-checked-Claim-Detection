There's no tobacco on the roof of D.C.", "text": "U.S. Gardens. Tim Kane and Mitch McConnell have submitted a bill raising the age for the purchase of tobacco products from 18 to 21 years. Members of the Senate say that they are disturbed by the sudden increase in tobacco use by young people, due to electronic segarit. Members of the Senate represent two of the largest tobacco-growing states: Maconel, leader of the Republican majority, from Kentucky; and Ken is a democratic Virginia. Kane acknowledged the enormous historical role of tobacco in Virginia, while the bill was presented in a speech on May 20. \"Tupaco was such a place in our history that at the roof of both legislatures in Virginia Capital, designed by Thomas Jefferson, In Virginia, it is known that the ceiling in the legislative chambers is decorated with a tobacco brush. But is that true? We've checked the allegation that Cain and many others have published and smoked. Two experts told us that there are no tobacco photographs on the roof - or anywhere - in the rooms. \"I can't think of anything that can be reasonable in the House of Representatives and the Senate,\" said Mark Greenoff, a historian of Capitol since 2002. Although there are gypsy leaves in the rooms, \"It's not tobacco,\" Suzanne Char, State Senate writer since 1990. Let's do a tour: the height of the ceilings is rows of shrapnel leaves and berries. To the untrained eye, they can go through like tobacco. But Char, who grew up on a tobacco farm, knows better. She said, \"Tobaku doesn't have berries.\" A large, oval ceiling, each room's ceiling, firmly framed in a rectangular plate. In the deep corners of the plate not reached by the curved upper lamp are the letters of VA, painted in blue and gold surrounded by carved leaves. But again, they have berries. What are these frunds with berries? \"The Laurel produces fruit or small round berries that look like what we see here,\" said Grenoff. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On January 20, 2012, at least half of the papers in the rooms do not contain berries. It's painted on a cloth in the restrooms where the walls and ceiling meet. It's curly on the roofboards. It's all painted gold. Closer to Earth, paperless berries produce plaster work around doors and windows, and on structures similar to the column that are cut off from the walls. Char and Grinov say these are Kanthus' papers, a paper that's decorated Greek and Roman classical architecture since ancient times. Thomas Jefferson relied on this method when he designed the state capital in 1780. However, Jefferson did not design the house and the Senate rooms that roam the original Capitol building. It was built in the early 19th century. Greenoff said the architect did his best to design the rooms exactly the Greek-Roman way of the ionosystem that Jefferson used. The rooms were opened in 1906, but there was no time to decorate them before the General Assembly session began. So everything, including drawings, was painted in bright white. Thus was the shape of caves until 1908, when the First Lady of Virginia, Elizabeth Swanson, was responsible for the decoration. In the early part of this century, the rooms were carefully restored to Swanson's design. In his speech, Cain twice described the roof leaves as gold. But this needs to be clarified. Grenov said there's no gold on the roof. What was originally used during the restoration was much cheaper Dutch metal paint. To sum up, \"It's not gold paint, it's not tobacco,\" said Greenoff. But those who are determined to find tobacco in the capital may be able to declare a small victory. You must leave the room and go to Rutonda, designed by Jefferson. Given the angles of the third floor ceiling, you can see long, brown, rusty leaves. Grinov said, \"There's no berries,\" referring to leaves. \"So, you know, at least creates a hole for those who really want to find tobacco leaves in Rutonda. I won't swear.\" We sent an e-mail containing our findings to Katie Stonez, Karen's press secretary. \"We learn something new every day.\" I've responded. \"Thanks to the historian of the capital and the senate clerk for making things right.\" Our Governor Caine said that the roof of the Senate and the House of Representatives in Virginia was surrounded by gold-filled tobacco leaves. Experts say there's no tobacco engraved on ceilings and room walls. And what you're probably seeing is Laurel, remember that tobacco does not contain berries and canthos, leaves that have been used since ancient times to decorate Roman Greek architecture like the Capitol. And there's no acid in the gold, just Dutch metal paint. Ken was repeating a myth that must be wrong by definition. So this is what we're going to evaluate: wrong.
