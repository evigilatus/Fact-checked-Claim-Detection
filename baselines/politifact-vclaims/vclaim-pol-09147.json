Ed Lindsey of Buckhead, one of the four major announced candidates for Georgia\u2019s 11th Congressional District seat, accused fellow Republican candidate Bob Barr of waffling in his position on DOMA over the years. The 11th Congressional District seat is currently held by Marietta Republican Phil Gingrey, who\u2019s running for the U.S. Senate. \n\n\n\"Bob must have been so busy working for the ACLU that he missed that protecting traditional marriage was on the ballot in Georgia in 2004,\" Lindsey, R-Atlanta, said in a campaign email last week. \"... Given Bob\u2019s gymnastic changes in his position on DOMA over the years, we do not know what his position was on traditional marriage in 2004, but I campaigned for it then and I will stay the course for my constituents now.\"\n\n\nHas Barr changed his position on DOMA over the years? PolitiFact Georgia \u00a0wondered whether Lindsey\u2019s claim had any merit, so we decided to investigate.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s DOMA ruling came on a 5-4 vote. On the day of the ruling, Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens made it clear that Georgia\u2019s definition of marriage, as that between a man and woman, would stand. (In 2004, about 76 percent of Georgia voters approved a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.)\n\n\nOn the same day as the court decision, Barr -- a former federal prosecutor and a former member of Georgia\u2019s congressional delegation -- released his own statement about the DOMA ruling on his Facebook page:\n\n\n\"I personally believe marriage should be defined as between one man and one woman and, if it were on the ballot in Georgia, I'd vote that way. However, I have come to believe that it's yet one more example of the federal government's delving into areas that throughout our history have been best left to the states. I trust the judgement of the people of Georgia more than that of Washington, D.C.\"\n\n\nWe checked with Lindsey\u2019s campaign spokesman, who said his candidate\u2019s criticism of Barr was a reference to Barr\u2019s Facebook statement. Lindsey\u2019s statement also seems to play to the 11th District\u2019s conservative base by making a pointed jab at Barr and reminding voters of Barr\u2019s past consulting work with the liberal-leaning American Civil Liberties Union. (The group brought Barr on back in 2002 to consult on informational and data privacy issues.) \n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudy Manning\n\n\nstated on January 4, 2012 in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When [Mitt Romney] was the governor of Massachusetts, he performed 100 \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure this number is right, but my mind says it\u2019s about 180 gay marriages.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Stirgus \u2022 January 18, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarr\u2019s history with DOMA spans several decades.\n\n\nBarr -- who was the 2008 Libertarian Party presidential candidate -- actually introduced DOMA in the U.S. House of Representatives in May 1996. Barr, then a Republican, was still fresh in his congressional tenure, which stretched from 1995 to 2003. Then-President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law in September 1996.\n\n\nYears later, after leaving Washington and switching his party affiliation, Barr apologized for his role in DOMA\u2019s passage. At the May 2008 Libertarian National Convention, Barr said to the audience: \"Standing before you, looking you in the eye, the Defense of Marriage Act -- in so far as it provided the federal government a club to club down the rights of law-abiding American citizens -- has been abused, misused and should be repealed, and I will work to repeal that.\"\n\n\nIn 2009, Barr called for DOMA to be repealed. In a Los Angeles Times editorial, Barr said, \"I have concluded that DOMA is neither meeting the principles of federalism it was supposed to, nor is its impact limited to federal law.\"\n\n\nTwo years later, in an interview posted on the national gay and lesbian news magazine website Advocate.com, Barr said DOMA had become \"the tail wagging the dog\" and that the eventual goal was to \"get the government out of the marriage business.\" \n\n\nWhen he announced his congressional candidacy this time around, Barr told an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter in March: \"The federal government has become so big, so intrusive ... we really need to start pulling that back.\"\n\n\nBarr has not directly commented on the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling to us or other media outlets. Through a spokesman, Barr said he stands by his Facebook post on the issue. \"Some believe in a top-down approach from Washington on every issue that faces this country. The conservative approach, Bob\u2019s approach, is to let the people of the states decide these issues for themselves,\" Barr\u2019s spokesman told us in an email message.\n\n\nSo does Lindsey\u2019s claim live happily ever after?\n\n\nCongressional candidate Ed Lindsey said former congressman and DOMA author Bob Barr has changed his position on DOMA over the years. \n\n\nBarr guided DOMA to passage as a Republican in the mid-1990s. But then Barr became a Libertarian and apologized for his role in getting the bill passed. As a Libertarian, Barr has said DOMA has been used by the government to overstep its authority. \n\n\nNow, seeking office as a Republican, Barr says he has come to understand that this is a matter for states to handle.\n\n\nBarr has refused to directly comment on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last week striking down a part of DOMA. But his silence doesn\u2019t dismiss his past. We rated Lindsey\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09147"}
