While this supports Clinton\u2019s point that the financial sector has spent money against her, it doesn\u2019t back the notion that Wall Street has only attacked her.\nWe consulted with Robert Maguire of the Center for Responsive Politics and Nancy Watzman of the Political TV Ad Archive. Their data shows that Clinton\u2019s statement is inaccurate.\nThe trouble with her claim is Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers aren\u2019t a monolithic group. Some have even expressed their support for Clinton and Sanders, and their donations are dispersed among Republican and Democratic groups.\nWhile Clinton has been the target of more attack ads than Sanders, more money from the financial industry has been spent hitting each of the remaining Republicans. In fact, the candidate subject to the most Wall Street-funded hits is actually Donald Trump.\nAd blitzes against Clinton primarily come from three conservative groups. In addition to the ad we fact-checked, Future45 has run six others against Clinton. Wall Street donations account for half of the group\u2019s funding.\nAmerican Crossroads, founded by Karl Rove, has sponsored eight anti-Clinton ads and the Mitt Romney-affiliated group America Rising has released 10 ads attacking her, two of which also target Sanders. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the financial industry is responsible for roughly half of the Rove\u2019s group total donations and two-thirds of the Romney group\u2019s.\nFuture45 has also sponsored one ad against Sanders. ESA Fund, a conservative super PAC, is 56 percent funded by the financial sector and has aired one anti-Sanders ad in Iowa. And last summer, Generation Forward, a pro-Martin O\u2019Malley super PAC, went after Sanders\u2019 record on guns. A fifth of its donations come from Wall Street. \u00a0\nClinton\u2019s own affiliated super PAC, Priorities USA Action, took a third of its donations from the financial sector. It has aired 11 ads against Trump and spent more than\u00a0$61,000 targeting the Republican frontrunner. (Update: Priorities USA Action said that the 11 videos it produced only appeared on the Internet.)\nBut that pales in comparison to the amount of money and airtime Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans have devoted to slamming him. Conservative groups have spent more than $28 million opposing Trump.\nOur Principles PAC, launched by a former Romney aide, has spent more than $14 million against Trump and sponsored at least 27 ads attacking him. A third of the group\u2019s funding comes from Wall Street.\nMarco Rubio\u2019s affiliated super PAC, Conservative Solutions, aired seven anti-Trump ads and received about 40 percent of its funding from the financial sector. Rubio himself was the subject of 11 attack ads by Ted Cruz\u2019s Keep the Promise I super PAC (hedge fund manager Robert Mercer was responsible for $11 million of its $11,036,250 total donations), and 12 by Jeb Bush\u2019s Right to Rise, which is half funded by Wall Street.\nHere are the 10 groups with the largest share of Wall Street donations and their opposition opponents, compiled with help from Maguire and Watzman:\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nWall Street support*\n\n\nOpposition ads**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep the Promise I\n\n\n99.7 percent\n\n\n11 against Rubio, 7 against Trump, 6 against Clinton\n\n\n\n\nAmerica\u00a0Rising\n\n\n68.2 percent\n\n\n10 against Clinton, 2 against Sanders\n\n\n\n\nCitizen Super PAC\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Some of these ads are clearly ads attacking a candidate, while others compare one candidate favorably against others.\n\u00a0\nAs you\u2019ll notice, Sanders \u2014 who rails against Wall Street daily \u2014 has been largely spared by the attack ads. That\u2019s because the finance sector takes Clinton seriously and Sanders less so, according to John G. Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University who wrote the book In Defense of Negativity: Attack Advertising in Presidential Campaigns.\n\"Sanders has an important message that is resonating with many. But that is not enough to win the nomination,\" Geer said. \"Why spend money that will have little return on the investment?\"\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or actually on either side, who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against.\"\nWall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are running ads against Clinton.
