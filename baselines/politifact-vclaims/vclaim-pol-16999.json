Marco Rubio, R-Fla., casts some blame on China for the U.S. struggle to obtain crucial medical supplies amid COVID-19.\nWriting in the New York Times, Rubio accused China of using the world\u2019s supply chain of medical gear to benefit itself during the coronavirus outbreak:\n\"Having monopolized those critical supply chains, the Chinese Communist Party pointed them inward. It ensured that face masks being manufactured in China, for example, went to domestic consumption and their own fight against the virus. Largely unable to import supplies from China, America has been left scrambling because we by and large lack the ability to make things, as well as the state capacity needed for reorienting production to do so. As a result, doctors are forced to ration supplies and, in some cases, cease using necessary protective equipment.\"\nThere are clear problems in the U.S. medical supply chain. A mad dash for masks and other supplies has created logistical hurdles and frenzied dealmaking in the global market, including in China.\u00a0\nAnd Rubio\u2019s concerns about the U.S. relying on China for supplies are not new. He raised them more than a year ago.\n\"Although American pharmaceutical firms face short-term commercial opportunities in China, the U.S. runs the risk of losing important components of its medical supply chain to China\u2019s government-backed industry,\" Rubio wrote in a report in February 2019.\nBut in his op-ed, Rubio overstates the problem with Chinese imports and ignores some key factors \u2014 including that imports were declining before COVID-19 as a result of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\"Sen. Rubio\u2019s comment is typical of \u2018bash China\u2019 remarks, but inaccurate,\" said Gary Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"China is exporting millions of masks.\"\nWe reached out to spokespersons for Rubio and did not receive a response.\nImports from China dropped in January and February\nThere were fears that China would not export critical medical supplies to the U.S. as COVID-19 cases ramped up. China produces much of the world\u2019s protective medical equipment.\nThere was a dip, but the exports did continue.\nChina\u2019s exports of protective medical equipment to the U.S. declined by 19% in January and February, compared with the same period last year. All other products fell by a far greater amount: 28%, according to an analysis by Chad Bown at the Peterson Institute.\n\"We imported less from them for these products than we did last year, but some of that is economics: They have more demand for these things internally, so they had less of an ability to export them to the world,\" Bown told PolitiFact.\nNew export restrictions by China also created logjams. Officials in China said the restrictions were imposed to ensure quality, but U.S. companies said they were facing bottlenecks, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February, the United States was focused on exporting supplies to China to fight the crisis.\u00a0\nTrump administration tariffs impacted imports\nThe drop in imports of masks from China is not related only to COVID-19. Rubio\u2019s op-ed did not mention the Trump administration\u2019s increase on tariffs for various goods from China in 2018-19. That also affects imports of medical supplies.\nIn 2018, Matt Rowan, president of the Health Industry Distributors Association, warned that proposed tariffs would drive up health care costs. The products \"are used widely throughout health care settings and are a critical component of our nation's response to public health emergencies, such as Ebola,\" he said at a federal government hearing.\nThe tariff hikes for personal protective equipment and other supplies went through in September 2019 despite such warnings. U.S. imports of masks, respirators and gloves from China fell following the tariff increases. In March 2020, the federal government established a temporary exclusion for masks.\u00a0\n\"In other words, the fall in imports from China is largely a self-imposed wound,\" said Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economist and trade expert who is also a Peterson fellow.\nThe decrease in imports followed the shutdown of manufacturing regions in China in the country, she said.\nThe U.S. government has tried to increase the flow of supplies from China, including authorizing the use of a Chinese version of N95 masks.\nFeds, states have imported supplies from China\nOne more point: The U.S. has imported masks and other supplies from China in recent weeks.\nOn March 29, Trump announced an operation called Project Air Bridge to bring medical supplies from overseas. The project\u2019s first flight came from China on March 29 and brought millions of supplies, including 130,000 N95 masks.\u00a0\nProject Air Bridge has delivered more than 760,000 N95 masks, 600 million gloves, 52 million surgical masks in addition to other supplies including surgical gowns, thermometers and face shields, a Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesperson said. Those supplies came from China, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, India, Honduras and Mexico.\u00a0\nFrom China alone, there have been over 133 million units of imported N95 masks, gloves, surgical masks, surgical gowns, thermometers and face shields, FEMA said.\nSome states have arranged their own imported masks or other supplies from China.\nOur ruling\nRubio said \"face masks being manufactured in China, for example, went to domestic consumption and their own fight against the virus\" while the U.S. was \"largely unable to import supplies from China.\"\nChina did have a greater need for its domestically manufactured masks in February as the virus ravaged the country, but Rubio greatly overstates the situation. Imports of masks from China to the U.S. did drop in January and February, but imports of other products dropped even more. Imports to the U.S. did occur in April through the federal government\u2019s Project Air Bridge, and a few states arranged their own imports with the help of other entities.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16999"}
