Jack Kingston of Savannah and millionaire businessman David Perdue are stepping up their attacks as decision day rapidly approaches in the GOP primary runoff for the U.S. Senate.\nKingston and Perdue are locked in what\u2019s arguably the most contentious and closely watched Georgia contest on the July 22 primary runoff ballot. Charges and countercharges are flying.\nOne of the charges being leveled by Perdue, the front-runner in the May primary, is that Kingston has wasted tax dollars on earmarks \"all while voting to raise his own pay seven times.\"\nPolitiFact has already examined the claim about Kingston\u2019s record on earmarks. Now, we\u2019ll delve into the second part of the claim that\u2019s currently airing on television and radio and answer the question: Did Kingston, a member of Congress since 1993, vote to raise his own congressional pay seven times?\nWith public opinion of Congress in the tank, House and Senate members have been loath to raise their own pay. That\u2019s likely why congressional raises are a campaign issue, not just this year and not just in Kingston\u2019s race. That also may explain why fact-checking the claim is more complicated than simply pulling legislation and checking individual House and Senate members\u2019 votes.\nFirst, a little history.\nArticle I, Section 6, of the Constitution requires members of Congress to set their own pay. From 1789 to 1968, members of Congress passed specific bills that raised their pay 22 times, according to a June 2014 report by the Congressional Research Service.\nMembers of Congress were initially paid a daily rate -- $6 a day in 1789 -- and drew their first annual salary -- $1,500 -- in 1815. Forty years later, they were drawing $3,000 a year.\nBut since passage of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, members of the House and Senate have been eligible for annual raises without having to be on-record voting for them.\nThe raises are calculated by a formula that involves changes in private-sector wages and salaries. They are automatic each Jan. 1 unless Congress votes to reject the adjustment or votes to change the amount.\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, lawmakers have let their pay be increased automatically 13 times.\nThey\u2019ve also voted to decline or delay their raises during 11 years, including in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Kingston voted with the majority eight times. That is, Kingston voted to limit his pay, not increase it.\nIn January 2009, congressional salaries went from $169,300 to their current $174,000. (And unless they vote again to decline a raise, lawmakers\u2019 pay is set to increase 1.6 percent, or $2,800, in January, according to recent estimates.)\nSo how can Perdue say that Kingston voted to raise his own pay seven times when automatic pay raises were established in 1989 and Kingston\u2019s only been in Congress since Jan. 3, 1993?\nHere\u2019s the simple answer: Perdue\u2019s not counting Kingston\u2019s votes in favor of raising congressional salaries. Instead, Perdue\u2019s counting procedural votes Kingston cast. Those votes blocked efforts to nix the automatic pay raises.\nPolitiFact checked a similar claim in 2011 when U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV came under attack by Republican rival George LeMieux in Florida\u2019s U.S. Senate race. That was rated a Half True.\nPerdue\u2019s claim, like LeMieux\u2019s, is based largely on procedural votes. The votes by Kingston took place in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007, Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said.\nWe'll try to explain a complicated process as simply as we can.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA member of Congress -- for years it was U.S. Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah -- pushes for an up-or-down vote on continuing the automatic pay raises. In most years, a procedural vote is used to effectively block that effort.\nAlyson Heyrend, Matheson's then-spokeswoman, explained the procedural move to PolitiFact in 2011.\n\"Matheson each year sought a 'no' vote on a procedural vote on Ordering the Previous Question,\" she told Politifact in an email. \"Had a majority voted 'no' he would have then offered the amendment to deny the annual congressional pay raise.\"\nMatheson was concerned \"that the public isn't able to see Congress take an open, up-or-down vote on whether or not to raise their salaries,\" Heyrend said.\nPete Sepp, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union and Foundation, said it\u2019s important to understand that any efforts on the pay raises are always tied to larger bills dealing with appropriations. \"People of varying ideologies and causes would have numerous reasons for supporting or opposing the bill,\" Sepp said, meaning that votes for or against a bill could have something or nothing to do with the pay raise.\nIn 1999, for instance, Rep. Ernie Fletcher, R, Ky., argued that lawmakers shouldn\u2019t take a $3,800 raise, boosting their pay to $145,000 a year, saying: \"I have a hard time voting to increase my pay when people in my district are earning an average income of $25,000 a year.\"\nAccording to press reports from the time, Fletcher\u2019s move was defeated on a procedural vote, 250-173. House journals show Kingston voting with the majority. The journals also show Kingston voting \"Yes\" with the majority on similar procedural votes in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. Those votes blocked efforts by Matheson, Fletcher and others to put forth an amendment to stop the pay raise.\nAnd even if they had not been blocked, a majority would have still had to go along with their amendment, several congressional experts told us.\nSo, did Kingston vote seven times to give himself a raise? No. He didn\u2019t have to because the raises are automatic unless Congress votes to turn them down as they have for five years.\nDid he vote to stop a push for an up-or-down vote on accepting or rejecting the raises? Yes. He did that seven times. But he also voted with the majority to deny or delay the raises eight times.\nGreg Dolan, Kingston\u2019s congressional spokesman, said: \"Representative Kingston was not \u2018voting to increase his pay\u2019 any more than he was voting against renaming the moon.\"\n\"Just because a potential amendment may have been introduced, voting to get on with the work of the House is not equivalent to voting against any and all other extraneous issues,\" he said.\nDickey, Perdue\u2019s spokesman, said the pay raises were inappropriate and Kingston knew that as far back as 1992 when he told a Savannah paper that congressional raises should be tied to passage of a balanced budget\nOur ruling\nCongress has created a system that allows its members to receive annual raises without having to vote on them.\nPerdue is off base to say Kingston voted to raise his pay seven times. Kingston cast procedural votes -- with the majority -- that effectively allowed Congress\u2019 automatic pay raises to stand in some years. Kingston did not cast direct votes to raise his pay as Perdue\u2019s ads imply.\nWhen there was a direct vote to decline pay increases, Kingston voted with the majority to do just that eight times.\nThere\u2019s a bit of truth to Perdue\u2019s claim. But there\u2019s even more context missing.\nWe rate Perdue\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07622"}
