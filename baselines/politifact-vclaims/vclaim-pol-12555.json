Bob McDonnell\u2019s jobs record.\n\nTheir latest salvo is a web video attacking McDonnell\u2019s performance.\n\n\"Despite the governor\u2019s slick photo-ops and self congratulatory press releases, the reality is we have made no progress on jobs since he took office,\" the Virginia Democratic Party said in an August 5 statement about the video.\n\nSo the commonwealth\u2019s jobs picture hasn\u2019t brightened at all since McDonnell took over? We wanted to see if that was true.\n\nTo back up that assertion, Democrats pointed to a statement from the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a Richmond think tank that said Virginia had made \"no real progress\" on job creation since the end of the recession in June 2009.\n\nThe think tank examines economic issues facing low and moderate income residents.\n\nThe group\u2019s president, Michael Cassidy, noted in a July 22 statement that Virginia had more than 3.6 million jobs back in June 2009 and had about the same amount in June 2011.\n\nBut McDonnell didn\u2019t take over as governor until the middle of January 2010. His first full month in office was February 2010 -- at which time the number of jobs was a bit lower.\n\nIn February 2010, there were 3,595,600 jobs in the state, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In June 2011, the latest month for which figures were available, that had risen to 3,643,800.\n\nThat means that since McDonnell has been governor, the state\u2019s job rolls have increased by 48,200.\n\nThe June 2011 employment numbers showed a drop of roughly 14,000 jobs from the previous month\u2019s job figures, a fall-off that Cassidy noted had erased 23 percent of the jobs gained since February 2010.\n\nBut even with that decline, there were still nearly 50,000 jobs gained overall since McDonnell took over.\n\nDemocrats have used overall job counts to argue the employment situation has at least gotten somewhat better under President Barack Obama. In an August 5, 2011 news release, the Democratic National Committee noted that 2.4 million private sector jobs have been created over the past 17 months. The news release noted that the \"pace of recovery isn\u2019t fast enough, but 2.4 million families are now better able to make ends meet.\"\n\nNationwide figures from the BLS show that from February 2010 to July 2011, private sector jobs rose 2.2 percent ending at 109.2 million. The total number of all jobs in the U.S. -- including government positions -- rose 1.5 percent during the same period ending at 131.2 million.\n\nBrian Coy, a spokesman for the Virginia Democratic Party, also pointed out that the percentage of the state\u2019s working age population with a job is at the same point it was in February 2010.\n\nIn February 2010, there were 3,891,279 people in Virginia who were employed, which was 64.3 percent of the state\u2019s working age population of 6,049,306, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nIn June 2011, the number of people in Virginia with a job had grown to 3,951,327, but the size of the working age population also rose to 6,141,503. That meant the state still had the same 64.3 percent of its working age population employed.\n\n\"If you define progress as putting a greater percentage of our population to work (which seems like a fair definition to me), we haven\u2019t made progress since Bob McDonnell took office,\" Coy said in an e-mail.\n\nTerry Rephann, a regional economist with the University of Virginia\u2019s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, said the percentage of people with jobs can stay constant even if there\u2019s job creation in a state. A state like Virginia, for example, is a fairly typical southern state where the population is growing faster than in the northern states, he said.\n\nAs a result, the number of people with jobs has to increase even faster to keep up with that relatively higher rate of population growth, Rephann said.\n\nRephann said that the jobs environment in Virginia has improved a bit since the early part of last year.\n\nBut Rephann also said that the number of jobs created since McDonnell took office isn\u2019t very impressive.\n\n\"Even 40,000 in a (state) economy of this size is not really enormous job growth,\" Rephann said. \"But that\u2019s the nature of the economic recovery that we\u2019re in.\"\n\nVirginia\u2019s unemployment rate was at a peak of 7.2 percent at the start of McDonnell\u2019s term. The number has consistently declined, and it was 6 percent in June 2011.\n\nThe commonwealth\u2019s jobless rate is one third lower than the 9.1 percent national unemployment rate. Virginia is tied with Hawaii and Iowa for the eighth lowest statewide unemployment rate in the country.\n\nVirginia\u2019s percentage of working age residents with a job also compares favorably on a national stage. Nationwide, 58.2 percent of the country\u2019s working age population was employed as of June 2011.\n\nWe\u2019ll also point out, as we often do with these stories, that economists repeatedly tell us governors take too much credit and receive too much blame for short-term performance over their state economies.\n\nA governor\u2019s ability to affect brief business cycles is limited, economists say.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nThe state Democratic party said there has been \"no progress\" on creating jobs since McDonnell took office.\n\nWhile the Dems are correct that the percentage of the state\u2019s working age population with a job was the same in June 2011 as it was when McDonnell took office, there is no getting around the fact that the state added 48,200 jobs. Or that the unemployment rate has dropped during his term.\n\nThat it contradicts the Democrats\u2019 blanket assertion that there has been no progress. We rate the claim False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12555"}
