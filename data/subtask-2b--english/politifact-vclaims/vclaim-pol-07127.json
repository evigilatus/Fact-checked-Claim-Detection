Scott Walker\u00a0broke his promise\u00a0to create 250,000 jobs, but as he seeks re-election, he argues there are plenty of jobs for people in Wisconsin who are willing to work.\n\"We don\u2019t hear about this often enough, but we have a website called JobCenterOfWisconsin.com,\" Walker said at a\u00a0campaign stop\u00a0near Milwaukee on Sept. 20, 2014.\n\"You know how many jobs were listed on that website last week?\" the governor asked.\n\"More than 70,000 jobs.\"\nThere were gasps from the audience.\n\"Jobs are not the problem,\" Walker continued. \"Connecting people to those jobs with the skills they need and, more importantly, getting people off of the couch and off the dependence who are able and into those jobs, making it more effective, a bigger incentive for them to get back to work is really the difference.\"\nWalker has since repeated the claim, including during his\u00a0first debate\u00a0with Democratic challenger Mary Burke on Oct. 10, 2014.\nDo his numbers add up?\nThe website\nJobCenterOfWisconsin.com\u00a0is run by the state Department of Workforce Development, whose secretary is appointed by Walker. The department\u00a0describes the site\u00a0as a no-cost employment exchange that links employers and job seekers.\nIts popularity appears to have grown dramatically in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 4, 2014 election.\nThe home page shows a running tally of\u00a0the number of job openings listed on the site.\nIn\u00a0releasing\u00a0a jobs plan on Sept. 16, 2014, Walker said there were more than\u00a060,000\u00a0job openings on the site. By the morning of Oct. 17, the running tally on the site\u2019s home page was just under 80,000.\nThat\u2019s an increase of roughly one-third in a month.\nMoreover, a plus-sign (+) next to the running tally indicates that even more jobs are available.\nThe database\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe asked the Department of Workforce Development to provide us a spreadsheet showing all of the job openings on the website. We received it Oct. 9, 2014.\nThere were more than 79,000 job listings on the main part of the spreadsheet, including about 74,000 that had been posted within the past six months. Those are the ones that power the running tally on the website\u2019s home page.\nThere were more than 65,000 listings\u00a0on the second part of the spreadsheet. More on those in a minute.\nThose figures obviously are well above the more than 70,000 that Walker claimed.\nBut whether there were that many jobs actually\u00a0available is less clear:\n1.\u00a0The state itself doesn\u2019t vouch for the accuracy of all the listings.\nOf the 79,000 primary listings on the site, about 41,000 are reviewed by state employees and are set to automatically expire after 90 days, the workforce development department told us. The other 38,000 primary listings come from two national \"partners\"\u00a0and the department relies on those firms to update their listings.\nRegarding the other\u00a065,000 listings -- which are not specifically counted on the home page of the website -- the state told us it advises job seekers to beware when searching those listings that they come from multiple sources and can include duplicates. Those sources include Career Builder and Craigslist.\n2.\u00a0Thousands of jobs are outside of Wisconsin.\nWalker made his claim in the context of jobs in Wisconsin, even if he didn\u2019t specifically say that all 70,000 job openings were within the state\u2019s borders.\nAccording to One Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group, about 13,000 of the job listings were for openings not in Wisconsin but in neighboring states, a figure the Department of Workforce Development did not dispute. Our own check found, for example, roughly 1,100 listings in Dubuque, Iowa, and roughly 950 each in Rockford, Ill., and Duluth, Minn.\nFinally, although Walker\u2019s claim didn\u2019t address the quality of jobs listed on the website, it\u2019s worth noting that many are on the low end of the pay scale.\nAmong the most common job titles advertised were cashier, certified nursing assistant, registered nurse and restaurant crew. Two of the three employers with the most job listings were McDonald\u2019s and the Kwik Trip convenience store chain.\nOur rating\nWalker said \"more than 70,000\" job openings are listed on a state jobs website, JobCenterofWisconsin.com.\nThe raw number of job listings exceeds that figure. But not all of the listings are verified by the state and thousands of the jobs are outside of Wisconsin.\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.\u00a0\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07127"}
