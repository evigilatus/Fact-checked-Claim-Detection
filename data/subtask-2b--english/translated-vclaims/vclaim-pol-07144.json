And representing 26 million people... costs money. So we try to save the money that we spend -- we send the money back every year, we try to live within those conservative means -- but the fact of the matter is, I have work to do and I'll do as best I can and -- \"White:\" -- you send the money back every year?\" Cornie: \"Yes, we do.\" On 5 August 2014, a news story in The Washington Post, based on Sunlight research, stated that between April 2013 and March 2014, the offices of the United States Senate from California, Texas, Florida and New York spent more than the offices of other senators. The story says that Cornen's office, which spends $3.7 million, ranks fifth after California's democratic slogans. Barbara Boxer and Diane Finstein; Sin Marco Rubio, R-Florida; Sin Ted Cruz, R-Texas. We were curious about Cornen's claim that he wasn't spending all the budgeted funds for his office. In response to our inquiries, the spokesman for Cornen Drew Brandwe provided figures and referred to a report by the Congressional Non-Party Research Service indicating that senators received funding allowances to cover the expenses of official offices, including staff, mail, travel to and from their jurisdiction, Washington, D.C., equipment and other goods and services. According to the report, each senator receives some office funding based on the population of their country and distance from the capital. The resulting expenditures for each senator are also set out in a six-month report, which at the outset made us think that it would be easy to measure whether Cornen has refinanced her office every year since joining the Senate in 2003. Start using. On January 13, 2021, Jake Taber, in his remarks on CNN, stated that Donald Trump's second presidential charge was \"more isolated between the two parties in American history.\" By e-mail, by Louis Jacobson, on January 13, 2021, Brandoi sent a graph showing what he described as the average amount of money that the Cornen office did not spend each year: $308,488. This was followed by a chart showing what he described as UNOPS unspent balances for each financial year, ranging from $19,824 at the end of September 2005 to $656,577 at the end of September 2010. Brandoi also referred to his figures on the pages of biannual reports on the expenditure of Senate offices. Source: Drew Brandwe, Press Secretary, United States Sun John Cornen (e-mailed on 9 October 2014) Senate expenditure reports we initially failed to match the figures provided with the data in the six-month reports published by the Government Printing Office (received from the Texas State Library) in part because the reports state how much money the Bureau did not spend in one item with a vague mark. Through e-mail, Brandoi advised that in all but one expenditure reports ending in the year, the \"Resc/sdrawals\" outline items reflect authorized funds not spent by the Senator's office. \"Resc/sdrawals,\" we believe, is a shortcut for Rescissements/sdrawals; the abolition, according to the Senate web page, is the elimination of the budgetary authority already provided by Congress. Got it? It'll be final.) The report covering the fiscal year 2003, which was folded in about nine months of Cornen &apos; s first year in the Senate, shows zero entry into his office. But, as Brando said, that doesn't mean that Cornen took his office's budget. Instead, in that year's reports, unspent funds were introduced on a different line, called \"Transfers,\" as Brandwe said. In general, Senator Brandoi's financial writer said that he based his responses to the expenditure reports on information provided by Chris Dobbie, the senator's finance officer, who earlier told us that he could not discuss Kornin's private office expenses. Dobby also said it was not unusual for the Senate Bureau to end a year with unspent funds. Dubey also said that if the Senate Bureau did not spend all of its authorized funds, the remainder of the money would not be transferred immediately to the United States Treasury; it was available for two years longer. Later, Brandoi asked us whether the delay of two years was essentially to enable a senator at the same time to return the money and continue to exploit those dollars. Pandwe, citing Dubai, stated that the remaining funds could only be spent on expenditures from the year in which they were originally budgeted. Therefore, he said, \"A member that cannot use one year's money to pay for one year's expenses from another. The funds are fixed and limited and do not roll from year to year, Cornen Aid e-mail. Our judge, Cornen, said that his office sends out budgeted funds every year. We appreciate this claim to be correct based on the figures provided by the Kornin office, which have also appeared in the public office expenditure reports, although they are linked to hard-to-code markings.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07144"}
