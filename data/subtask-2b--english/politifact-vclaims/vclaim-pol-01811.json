Ted Cruz of Texas favoring the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Now Cruz says his Democratic challenger, U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of El Paso, stands alone nationally for tilting the other way.\nCruz\u2019s campaign said in a July 17, 2018, press release that O\u2019Rourke \"continued today his reckless and radical Senate campaign based on impeaching Pres. Donald Trump. He is the only candidate to the U.S. Senate to call for impeachment,\" the release said.\nWe wondered: Is O\u2019Rourke alone among Senate hopefuls in advocating the Republican president\u2019s impeachment?\nNot so, we found, though it looks like he's the only Senate nominee to date to say he'd vote to launch impeachment proceedings.\nRefresher: The Constitution gives the House the power to impeach the president, vice president and other civil federal officials for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors while it gives the Senate the power of trying impeachments. Convictions and consequent removals from office require the concurrence of two-thirds\u2019 of senators in attendance. In recent history, President Bill Clinton was impeached; he wasn\u2019t convicted or removed.\nO\u2019Rourke has repeatedly said he\u2019d vote to impeach\nOur search of the Nexis news database showed that as early as August 2017, O\u2019Rourke said he\u2019d vote for Trump\u2019s impeachment. Most recently, the Dallas Morning News quoted O\u2019Rourke saying in July 2018 that Trump merited impeachment for his performance in the just-completed summit with Russia\u2019s leader, Vladimir Putin.\nO\u2019Rourke responded to a News reporter: \"Standing on stage in another country with the leader of another country who wants to and has sought to undermine this country, and to side with him over the United States \u2014 if I were asked to vote on this I would vote to impeach the president. Impeachment, much like an indictment, shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed and at this point there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed.\"\nThen again, O\u2019Rourke in December 2017 was among 364 House members to vote for tabling a proposal by Rep. Al Green, D-Houston, to impeach Trump, records show. Before that vote, Democratic leaders released a statement referring to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry that said impeachment wasn\u2019t timely.\nWhen we asked Cruz\u2019s campaign how the senator determined that O\u2019Rourke was alone among Senate candidates calling for impeachment, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out by email that the News story noting O\u2019Rourke\u2019s willingness to vote for impeachment quoted Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, leveling a more limited claim. Roe called O\u2019Rourke \"the only major-party candidate in America to call for impeachment.\"\nAnother Cruz contact, Emily Miller, emailed us a web link to a November 2017 Reuters news story describing O\u2019Rourke saying that Trump\u2019s racially charged rhetoric and divisive governing style had led O\u2019Rourke to support impeachment. O\u2019Rourke was quoted saying: \"I\u2019m now convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt that Donald Trump is unfit for that office.\"\nO\u2019Rourke spokesman says he\u2019s not \u2018called\u2019 for impeaching Trump\nWhen we reached out to O\u2019Rourke about Cruz calling him the only Senate candidate to call for impeachment, campaign spokesman Chris Evans said by email: \"Beto has never called for the impeachment of President Trump.\"\nEvans maintained that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s responses to reporters and voters about voting in favor of impeachment weren\u2019t the same as the candidate calling for impeachment. Evans elaborated that O\u2019Rourke hasn\u2019t brought up impeachment \"at town halls or rallies, has not sent fundraising or petition emails on it, has not posted social media advocating for it, and has not used his current position of public trust to do so through floor speeches, letters or resolutions.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvans also pointed out an interview we\u2019d missed. For an episode of Showtime\u2019s \"The Circus,\" posted online in May 2018, O\u2019Rourke replied that as a member of the House, he\u2019d vote right then to impeach Trump. Asked if he\u2019d vote as a senator to convict Trump, O\u2019Rourke replied: \"Until I'm in that position and am able to hear the case made by each side, all the facts laid out, I can't give you an answer on that--nor would you want me to.\"\nOther Senate candidates?\nOur search for other Senate candidates favoring impeachment turned up a couple.\nResponding to our inquiries, nonpartisan observers said by email that while O\u2019Rourke appeared to be the only Democratic Senate nominee to speak out for Trump\u2019s impeachment, he was likely not the only Senate candidate to do so.\nJennifer Duffy, who analyzes Senate races for the Cook Political Report, pointed out a May 2018 TIME news story quoting Richard Painter, a longshot Democratic challenger to Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, saying he favors Trump\u2019s impeachment. The story said too, though, that Painter\u2019s \"emphasis on impeachment talk sets him apart from most other Democratic candidates.\"\nDuffy called Painter a \"second-tier candidate who is notable for a couple of reasons: he used to be a Republican and he is taking on an appointed incumbent. Generally, the Senate and House Democratic leadership is dissuading their candidates from talking about impeachment because they are afraid such talk will energize Trump voters and entice them to the polls in November.\n\"O'Rourke is a break-the-mold candidate,\" Duffy wrote, \"so it doesn't surprise me that he is talking about it.\"\nGenerally, Duffy commented, the \"challenge here is that literally hundreds of second- and third-tier candidates file to run for the Senate and get very little attention. I suspect that some of the Democrats in these categories have called for Trump's impeachment, but no one is paying attention.\"\nLarry Sabato, a University of Virginia expert who analyzes federal races, described O\u2019Rourke as alone among Democratic candidates in \"somewhat-to-very competitive Senate races\" to call for impeachment. \"However,\" Sabato wrote, \"we do not keep up with uncompetitive Senate states. Sometimes long-shot candidates will take positions that more cautious nominees who have a real chance to win will avoid.\"\nOur Nexis search turned up another candidate backing impeachment. In June 2018, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, a Democrat running for the Senate in California, called for Trump to be impeached immediately, the Sacramento Bee reported in a June 21, 2018, news story. De Le\u00f3n, who faces incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein on the November ballot, was quoted saying: \"What this president has done easily surpasses what Richard Nixon did back in Watergate. ... What I've seen to date easily, in my mind, qualifies for impeachment.\"\nOur ruling\nCruz said O\u2019Rourke is \"the only candidate to the U.S. Senate to call for\" impeaching Trump.\nSince August 2017, O\u2019Rourke has been saying that he\u2019d vote to impeach Trump, which would start with a vote in the House, where he serves. O\u2019Rourke\u00a0might be the only Senate nominee to say as much. However, Democratic Senate contenders in Minnesota and California also have talked up Trump's\u00a0impeachment.\nWe rate this claim about O'Rourke's\u00a0uniqueness False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.
