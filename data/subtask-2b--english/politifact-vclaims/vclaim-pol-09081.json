The tax is designed to offset the added costs of expanding health coverage to the uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It became law at the beginning of this year. A 2.3 percent tax is imposed on some devices.\n\n\nThe federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act has broad definitions of the types of devices that can be taxed. They\u2019re typically devices used by physicians or medical offices. The items that cannot be taxed include eyeglasses, contact lenses and hearing aids. PolitiFact Ohio found that none of the items listed in the chain email are included as medical devices.\n\n\nSo why would Cabela\u2019s tax its customers? It was an error, the business told PolitiFact Ohio.\n\n\nA Cabela's spokesman blamed a companywide \"glitch\" in its sales register system. The problem added a 2.3 percent \"medical excise tax\" to all purchases at its stores on Jan. 1. The error was caught the same day, the spokesman said, and the charges would be refunded.\n\n\nIs the tax \"hidden\"? Obviously not, if it was included on the Cabela\u2019s bill. The Medical Device Manufacturers Association, a Washington, D.C.-based group, has vigorously lobbied against the tax and supported congressional bills to repeal it, saying it will take money the industry uses for research and development. In a March press release, the association said manufacturers had paid $388 million in taxes to the federal government since the tax started in January.\n\n\nTo sum up, the email claims a medical excise tax \"is supposed to be hidden from the consumer.\" That\u2019s incorrect. The email also implies that items that can be taxed include fishing rods and some cars. Again, incorrect. Lastly, the email says Cabela\u2019s sporting goods store \"refused to hide\" the tax. Wrong. The company said it made a mistake when it taxed customers and would refund them.\n\n\nDelete the email if it comes your way. Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09081"}
