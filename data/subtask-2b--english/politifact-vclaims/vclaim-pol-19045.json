After he straightens the collar of his blazer, a thin shadow appears.\n\"There it is,\" a narrator says in the clip shared thousands of times on Facebook. \"Biden\u2019s wearing a wire. Why do you need a wire, bro?\"\nThe video shows 13 seconds of the first presidential debate between Biden and President Donald Trump. It has spawned dozens of conspiracy theory posts on Facebook, which were flagged as part of the company\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But they quickly took off on social media.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nThe video appears to have been posted around 9:45 p.m on Sept. 29. It was then shared in several Facebook groups dedicated to Trump and QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory about child sex trafficking. As of Sept. 30, claims that Biden wore a wire had been shared in hundreds of Facebook posts, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.\nBiden was not wearing a wire during the debate \u2014\u00a0the video shows a crease in Biden\u2019s dress shirt, which is accentuated by the bright TV lights. Thin shadows similar to the one highlighted in the clip also appear on the left side of his shirt.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a higher quality video of the interaction shown in the video. Notice how Biden creates the crease after reaching under his blazer:\n\nBefore the debate, another viral rumor claimed Biden had a device implanted in his skull that lets him hear someone on the other end give him answers to questions. We rated that claim Pants on Fire.\u00a0Envoy Medical said its device \"cannot secretly and wirelessly transmit conversations\" and the Biden campaign refuted the claim.\n\"Of course he\u2019s not wearing an earpiece,\" Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told reporters Sept. 29.\nThis clip of Biden\u2019s shirt is an outgrowth of that hoax, as well as years-old conspiracy theories about presidential candidates getting help during debates.\u00a0\nThe New York Times wrote that conspiracy theories about presidential candidates wearing earpieces during debates have been around since at least 2000, when conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh accused former Democratic candidate Al Gore of getting answers fed to him through an earpiece on \"Meet the Press.\" Similar rumors have surfaced in nearly every presidential election since then. We debunked a nearly identical claim about Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential debates.\nEven if the claim were true, Biden probably would not benefit much from wearing a wire during a debate, the Times noted. Listening to directions in his ear while also paying attention to the moderator and Trump would be challenging.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate and ridiculous.
