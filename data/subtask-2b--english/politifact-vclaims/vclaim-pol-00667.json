I am also an American citizen and I seek to change America to be a more Islamic country \u2026 My faith guides me and I feel like it\u2019s going well in transition of using freedom of religion in America against itself. - Valerie Jarrett Stanford University 1977.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nFirst, there is no record of Jarrett ever saying this, and no mention of the quote from any media organization over the last 40 years.The complete lack of scrutiny of such an inflammatory statement coming from someone who held a high-profile position in the White House for years suggests the quote is fabricated.\nNext, \u00a0Jarrett was indeed born in Shiraz, Iran, in 1956. But she was born to American parents, Dr. James and Barbara Bowman. The family lived in the country for about six years because Jarrett\u2019s father became chair of pathology at Nemazee Hospital. The family then moved to London for about a year before Bowman accepted a position at the University of Chicago in 1962, when Jarrett was five years old.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we found no evidence that Jarrett is or has ever been Muslim. As well, the name \"Valerie Jarrett\" is misplaced, since Valerie Jarrett did not yet exist in 1977. At the time, she went by her maiden name, Bowman. She married William Jarrett in 1983.\nStanford University spokesperson Ernest Miranda also told PolitiFact the quote is fabricated.\n\"We reviewed both the 1977 and 1978 Quad yearbooks (Valerie Bowman is in the \u201978 edition),\" Miranda wrote in an email, \"and neither contains any student quotes.\"\nOur ruling\nAn old rumor claims former White House senior adviser to President Obama, Valerie Jarrett, said in the \u201970s that she is an \"Iranian by birth\" and seeks to \"change America to be a more Islamic country.\"\nNo record or evidence can be found of Jarrett ever saying this and no media organization has ever reported on the brazen statement.\nAlso, Jarrett has never identified as Muslim in all her years in the public and private sphere. While she was born in Iran, her parents are American, and she has lived in the U.S. since she was five years old.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!\nUpdate, May 8, 2019: This story has been updated to include a statement from a Stanford University spokesperson verifying the absence of this quote in university yearbooks. The ruling is unchanged.\n Share the Facts 2019-05-07 19:07:49 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Quotes Valerie Jarrett as saying she is an \"Iranian by birth\" and seeks to \"change America to be a more Islamic country\"    Facebook posts on the internet     Friday, May 3, 2019 2019-05-03    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00667"}
