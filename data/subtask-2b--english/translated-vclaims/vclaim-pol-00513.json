This is misleading. It only refers to white women.", "text": "The head of the BBC, George Stefanopoulos, spent two days later and interviewed President Donald Trump prior to the commencement of the Trump re-election campaign in Florida. In one of a series of interviews, Stefanopoulos Trump asked about his tossing of swinging voters who had not decided. \"Peace, security, the great economy,\" said Trump, before going to his victory in 2016 and claiming to be \"very well\" with the voters. Stefanopoulos pushed back, pointing out that Trump \"didn't win women\" in 2016. \"Well, I got 52%,\" said Trump, according to the ABC news version. \"I'll tell you -- in my opinion, I may have won women. Hilary Clinton focused on women and did a great job. A lot, a lot, a lot of points above what they thought.\" This wasn't the first time Trump mentioned 52 percent. In a gathering in Pennsylvania in March 2018, Trump said to the crowd: \"Hey, didn't we surprise them with women during the election? Remember? I said, \" Am I really having this kind of trouble? I don't think so, but women won't like Donald Trump. It's gonna be a tough night for Donald Trump because women aren't coming out. We have 52%. Yeah? 52. United Nations Office at Geneva Yeah? The Tramp claim of 52% is misleading, as it refers only to a subset of women - white women. He did not mention that during the March 2018 gathering, in the ABC interview, or during five other events we found him citing statistics. The Trump campaign refused to comment. \"The polls show that Trump did not win women,\" said Jennifer Laos, Commonwealth Professor of Politics at the University of Virginia. Bondetts believes that Trump would not be good with women because he was running against someone who could become the country's first woman president and because of allegations of sexual assault against him. However, regardless of the candidate, the identification of the political party is the best indication of who will be elected by the voter - white women are constantly voting on the Republican party, and political scientific researchers have told Politi Fact. \"The political party is by far the greatest forecast of the selection of presidential votes, beyond ideology, gender, race and other factors,\" said Rebecca Critzer, Assistant Professor of Public Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"That's why it's not surprising that the Republican women vote for the Party Trump is the strongest forecast of sex voting.\" The ballot statements refute Trump &apos; s claim that Trump did not win the majority of women &apos; s votes in 2016. He obtained 41 per cent, while 54 per cent of women voted for Hillary Clinton, according to data from Edison &apos; s research polls. However, Trump received 52% of the votes of white women. In total, 52 per cent of men &apos; s votes and 62 per cent of white men &apos; s votes won, and poll data indicate exit. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" By Daniel Funk \u2022 19 January 2021, however, \"Experts outside do not always paint an accurate picture of voters,\" said Ashley Jardina, an assistant professor of political science at Duke University. \"It is not random and representative at the national level and tends to overreported voting behaviour by people who wish to stop and talk to polls.\" Jardena referred to a study conducted by the Pio Research Centre that used data on voters who confirmed in 2016 and tried to explain bias in polls. According to the Pio study, 39 per cent of all women voted for Trump, and 47 per cent of white women voted. (Not supported by any group of women voters at or above 52 per cent) Analysis of national election data has consistently shown that white women prefer Republican candidates over democratic candidates, as Jaredina said. The gender gap in the 2016 presidential election was the highest ever recorded in the history of opinion polls, according to data from Edison &apos; s research cited in the Washington Post. This 24-point gender gap is not alarming in the context of the recent elections, as stated by Carlin Bowman, a senior colleague at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, as it has been steadily increasing since the Reagan elections in 1980. \"This does not mean that GOP candidate cannot win women,\" said Lola, Professor of Virginia University. \"But it's a harder way\" Support from women is a constant point of dialogue for Trump. Before election day in 2016, he falsely claimed that he had \"massive support\" for women, although on average he had left Clinton behind in the election. He also claimed that Clinton was not \"very good with women\" - the polling data showed that his claim was pants on fire. Our Governor Trump said, \"Well, I got 52% (of the voters). I will tell you - in my opinion, I may have won women. Hilary Clinton focused on women and did a great job. According to poll data, 41% of all women voted for Trump in 2016. The 52 per cent claim of Trump refers to its share of white women. Another measure of a study carried out by the Pew Research Centre - using only accredited voters and taking into account the potential bias in voting for exit - found that 39 per cent of all women and 47 per cent of white women voted for Trump. The Trump statement contains an element of right, but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00513"}
