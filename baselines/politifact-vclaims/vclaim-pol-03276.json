Gwen Moore and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.\nWhen President Donald Trump signed an order to create a commission to study voter fraud, Moore attacked its vice chairman as having \"led numerous voter suppression initiatives against minorities.\"\nFive days later, on May 17, 2017, Baldwin made this declaration on Twitter:\nVoter turnout in 2016 was reduced by approx. 200,000 votes because of WI\u2019s photo ID laws.\nWe\u2019ve rated Mostly True a claim by TV show host John Oliver that in Sauk City, Wis., the office that provides identification for voting was open only four days in 2016.\nBut on a claim closer to Baldwin\u2019s, we rated False tweets that said \"300,000 voters were turned away\" by Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law in the 2016 presidential election. A federal judge had determined that some 300,000 registered voters lacked the necessary ID to vote, but there was no evidence that anywhere near that number of people were turned away from the polls.\nWhat about Baldwin\u2019s claim?\nWhat voter ID is about\nThirty-four states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls, according to the nonprofit National Conference of State Legislatures.\nWisconsin is among seven states that have a strict requirement -- voters without acceptable identification must vote on a provisional ballot and also take additional steps after election day for their vote to be counted.\nAs the group puts it:\nProponents see increasing requirements for identification as a way to prevent in-person voter impersonation and increase public confidence in the election process. Opponents say there is little fraud of this kind, and the burden on voters unduly restricts the right to vote and imposes unnecessary costs and administrative burdens on elections administrators.\nA few days before Baldwin made her statement, the Associated Press reported on examples of Wisconsin residents who said they couldn\u2019t get the ID they needed to vote in the 2016 presidential election -- the first presidential contest in which the state\u2019s ID law was in place.\nBut the story said it is unknown how many people did not vote because they didn\u2019t have proper identification.\nBaldwin\u2019s evidence\nTo back Baldwin\u2019s claim, her campaign cited a report issued two weeks earlier. It\u2019s worth noting who was behind it.\nThe report was commissioned by Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supported Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and describes itself as a \"voter-centric progressive advocacy organization\" that is \"committed to standing up to the Trump administration and its allies.\" The group says its \"voter suppression analysis\" is part of an effort to \"glean lessons that can be applied to strengthen Democrats in elections in 2018, 2020 and beyond.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report was conducted by CIVIS USA, a Chicago firm founded by the chief analytics officer of the 2012 Obama campaign team.\nThe report compares the 2012 and 2016 elections. It says that on average, turnout increased 1.3 percent in states in which there was no change to voter ID laws, but decreased 3.3 percent in Wisconsin.\nThe report concludes that had there been no voter ID in Wisconsin, turnout would have risen by 1.3 percent -- or 200,000 voters -- over the 2012 total.\n(Although it doesn\u2019t affect the rating of Baldwin\u2019s claim, the report also argues, based on other data, that the 200,000 people it refers to \"would have been more Democratic,\" and notes that Clinton lost to Trump in Wisconsin by about 20,000 votes.)\nIgnoring other factors\nRoughly 3 million votes were cast in each of the last three presidential elections in Wisconsin. As we\u2019ve noted, the 2016 turnout was lower than 2012, when Obama won reelection and there was no voter ID requirement.\nOn the other hand, the 2016 turnout was higher than when Obama was first elected in 2008 and, again, there was no voter ID law.\nMore importantly, according to experts, the methodology of the report Baldwin cites is lacking. Put simply: The voter ID requirement undoubtedly prevented or discouraged some people from voting. But the report attributes all of the decrease in turnout to the ID law, when there are many other reasons that could also explain it, including a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton or Trump, or perhaps a belief that Trump couldn\u2019t win Wisconsin.\n\"The story is getting picked up by Democrats and left-leaning smart people across social media because it confirms what they already think,\" University of California, Irvine law and political science professor Rick Hasen wrote on his election law blog. \"But there is reason for considerable caution about this study, which is at odds with what other studies of the effect of Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID has found. There are questions about the study\u2019s methodology being raised by people who know their stuff.\"\nYale University political science professor Eitan Hersh\u00a0tweeted:\u00a0\"No offense, but this is something that is going to be shared hundreds of times and does not meet acceptable evidence standards.\"\nBarry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us there\u2019s simply no way to put a number on how many people didn\u2019t vote because of the voter ID law.\nBucknell University political science professor Lindsay Nielson has done research finding that voter ID laws lower minority turnout and benefit the Republican Party. But as for the voter turnout decline in Wisconsin, \"there could be a multitude of other reasons\" why voters stayed home, she told us. \"Voter ID laws could very well have been suppressing voter turnout in Wisconsin,\" but \"we just can\u2019t say it\u2019s 200,000 people. We need a lot more research before we can draw that conclusion.\"\nBaldwin campaign spokesman Scott Spector responded by saying \"there is no reason to question the (CIVIS) study or believe other factors were involved,\" because of one of the findings\u00a0in a September 2014 by the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office. But that finding didn't look at the 2016 election and involved two different states.\nThe GAO found turnout between the 2008 and 2012 elections declined more in Kansas and Tennessee than in states that did not change voter ID requirements -- by an estimated 1.9 to 2.2 percentage points more in Kansas and 2.2 to 3.2 percentage points more in Tennessee \u2014 and the results \"were attributable to changes in those two states\u2019 voter ID requirements.\"\nOur rating\nBaldwin says: \"Voter turnout in 2016 was reduced by approx. 200,000 votes because of WI\u2019s photo ID laws.\"\nA report she cites from a Democratic candidate-supporting group says a decline in voter turnout between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections in Wisconsin was entirely due to the state\u2019s new photo identification requirement for voting.\nBut experts say that while photo ID requirements reduces turnout to some extent, they question the methodology of the report and say there is no way to put a number on how many people in Wisconsin didn\u2019t vote because of the ID requirement.\u00a0\nWe rate Baldwin\u2019s statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-25 14:43:26 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"Voter turnout in 2016 was reduced by approx. 200,000 votes because of WI\u2019s photo ID laws.\"     Tammy Baldwin U.S. senator, D-Wis.
