We found support for that policy at 94 percent in the latest national poll. Support ranged between 84 percent and 89 percent in the four other most recent polls. Experts say support at or near 90 percent has been consistent for years.\nFor a statement that is accurate and has nothing significant missing, our rating is True.\n Share the Facts 2017-10-03 17:22:07 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  90 percent of Americans \"support universal background checks\" for gun purchases.
