The Republic of Duncan Hunter is a well-established Republican region, but in August he was charged with misuse of campaign funds. This gave impetus to his former democratic rival, Amar Kampa-Najjar, a Palestinian and Mexican origin. A recent survey conducted by the United States independent survey company Hunter received only three main points. Hunter attracted national attention - and criticism - to the speech that seeks to portray Campa-Najjar as a person with links to Islamic terrorists. \"Amaar Campa Najjar works to infiltrate Congress,\" says one of Hunter's campaigns. \"He used three different names to hide his family's ties to terrorism. His grandfather was the mastermind of the Munich Olympic massacre. His father said they deserved to die. The video announcement by On America's conservative news network shows: \"The Palestinian-Mexican American is not supported by the people of San Diego. \" He is supported by Kir and the Muslim Brotherhood. \" This is a well-organized plan.\" The fact-checker in Washington looked at the various elements of this declaration, along with separate remarks made by Hunter and given them by the Pinocchios Group, the worst possible estimate. (For example, Kamba-Najjar never knew his grandfather, and his father's comment was not so simple, and was raised by his Mexican-American mother's family. Here, we will withdraw from one specific claim in the Declaration - that Campa-Najjar \"is supported by the Council and the Muslim Brotherhood. The Centre refers to the American Islamic Relations Council, a Washington-based group whose mission is \"to promote understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice and empower American Muslims.\" The emphasis on supporting the Campa-Najjar campaign is not accurate. Although Hunter continues to invoke extremist Islam in the campaign, Campa-Najjar is in fact a long-standing Christian. In a statement by the Campa-Najjar campaign, Mike Meeks, the honorary pastor of the East Lake Church, said, \"I have known Omar since he was 16 years old, when he became part of our youth service. Before he left for university, he grew up serving our cleaning staff, the worship team, and the youth service, so that he gave mass speeches on Sunday. When he served in the federal government, we spoke regularly about life and the challenges facing faith in Jesus' follow-up in today's world. Through all this, Amar remains committed to the growth of his faith, following Jesus and serving his community.\" The Campa Najjar campaign said that the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamic political organization in Egypt and other countries in the Middle East, would consider it to be a renegade because of Christianity. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the US Navy commander, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman on January 17, 2021, neither the Muslim Brotherhood nor CAIR can legally support a candidate. Over the years, the relationship of the United States with the Muslim Brotherhood has ranged from unstable tolerance to open opposition. However, whatever the policy of the United States, the Muslim Brotherhood is a foreign organization, and the group and its leaders are therefore prohibited under federal law from making \"any contribution, expenditure or gift in any of the United States.\" Election.\" The Centre is a non-profit organization, 501 (c). The Internal Revenue Service Regulations provide that 501 (c) (3) groups \"are excluded from participation in any political activities of the campaign.\" Notwithstanding the laws, there is no evidence that either group provided funds to Campa-Najjar. What is most likely to be said is that a few CAIR volunteers have done so in their personal capacity. The newspaper San Diego Union-Trib\u00f3n compared the records of contributions to Campa-Najjar with the lists of members of the Board of Directors of the Centre and found that the candidate received 18 donations from seven persons totalling $17,300. :: During 31 October, Campa-Najjar raised $3,168,975, which means that voluntary contributions from members of the Governing Board of the Centre represent about half of 1 per cent of its contributions at this session. \"None of the seven donors held paid positions with CAIR, according to public tax reports,\" reported the newspaper. \"Donors have listed their employers and their basic professions - their daily jobs - to familiarize themselves with the campaign as requested by the Federal Election Commission.\" For example, the Federation-Tribion arrived in David Chamie, a lawyer living in Arizona and serving on the board of a local CAIR branch. Shami told the newspaper that \"he was not paid by CAIR and that his contribution was independent and was based solely on the Kamba Najjar position of consumer defence laws.\" He added: \"My decision to assist a particular candidate is based on their political positions and issues that they support. It has nothing to do with religion, and if it does, I am a Muslim and he is a Christian.\" Robert S. Macau, Director of Government Affairs of the Council, to Bolivi Facket, said \"We can confirm that the Council or its branches did not donate or support Kamba-Najjar. What staff or board members do in their own time is their own work. \"Hunter's office did not respond to any query. The Governor Hunter said, \"Amaar Kamba-Najjar is sneaking into Congress\" and \"supported by Kair and the Muslim Brotherhood.\" Neither of the two groups can do so under federal law, and there is no evidence that they violated the law to donate to their campaign. Campa Najjar received more than a dozen personal donations from persons who happen to be CAIR volunteers. We were unable to find any connection to the Muslim Brotherhood. This is an unfounded accusation based on fear and famine. We value the pants statement on the fire.
