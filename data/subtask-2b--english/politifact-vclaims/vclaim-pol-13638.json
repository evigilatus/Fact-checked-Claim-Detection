He described the idea as bare bones, saying Abele has not fleshed out how it would work or explored all the legal angles.\n\nBut the tax, legal and legislative experts we talked to said Wisconsin\u2019s state constitution and various state Supreme Court cases create major barriers to these kinds of special property tax exemptions.\n\nThe assessment from experts: Abele\u2019s proposal almost certainly isn\u2019t going to fly.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no way Milwaukee County can do it alone.\n\nThe central point in the analysis of Abele\u2019s plan is the \"uniformity clause\" in the Wisconsin state constitution.\n\nThe clause was \"intended to prevent the legislature and local officials from granting preferential tax treatment to influential property owners and protect the citizen against unequal, and consequently unjust taxation,\" according to a 2002 Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau paper.\n\nThe author of that paper, reference bureau attorney Joseph Kreye, said Abele\u2019s plan almost assuredly would run afoul of uniformity, and would almost certainly draw lawsuits from existing businesses that don\u2019t get the tax break.\n\nKreye is the attorney who checks state bills for compliance with the uniformity clause.\n\nTodd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research group, agreed.\n\n\"If you are going to pick property tax payers and you favor some and not others, even though they are the same \u2013 both business, both homeowners or retail stores \u2013 the constitution says you can\u2019t do that,\" Berry said.\n\nMunicipalities, such as Milwaukee County, are particularly hamstrung.\n\nA League of Wisconsin Municipalities paper on the uniformity clause put it bluntly.\n\n\"Can a municipality grant a full or partial property tax exemption to a property owner or a business? No.\"\n\nThe state Legislature can classify and exempt whole classes of property -- such as agriculture -- from uniform taxation, the League\u2019s paper noted.\n\nIt added (italics ours): \"Unlike the state, municipalities do not have the power to create full or partial exemptions and a municipality may not lawfully grant a property tax break because such action would violate the uniformity clause of the Wisconsin Constitution. Thus, the assessment of property cannot be frozen as an incentive for businesses to locate in a community.\"\n\nAbele\u2019s spokesman told us it\u2019s at least theoretically possible his plan could get around that.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, Lorenz said, that Abele would try to define \"new small businesses\" as a special class of property. If a legal challenge resulted, there\u2019s a chance the county could prevail, Lorenz said.\n\nBut Kreye said that while the Legislature could exempt whole classes of property from taxation, carving out certain businesses within one class for special treatment is problematic.\n\nAbele\u2019s camp offered one more defense.\n\nLorenz said that Abele thought of his plan as a county version of Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s plan for a two-year income tax break for firms that relocate to Wisconsin. Walker signed that bill on Jan. 31 -- and legal concerns were not an issue.\n\nBut Walker\u2019s plan involves income taxes, not property taxes.\n\nThe uniformity clause \"does not apply to income taxes,\" said state Legislative Reference Bureau attorney Marc Shovers, an income tax specialist.\n\nThis one\u2019s clear.\n\nAbele is touting his idea of granting special property tax breaks to certain businesses. But well-established legal principles, the state\u2019s constitution and expert opinion strongly suggests that not even the Legislature could make this happen.\n\nThe lack of detail in Abele\u2019s plan may be the best thing going for it, because it\u2019s harder to judge. But it also makes clear how far off base he was in presenting this as a simple matter of a pen stroke by the new county executive.\n\nWe rate his statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13638"}
