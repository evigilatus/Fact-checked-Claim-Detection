(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But it\u2019s certainly not the first account to misattribute the quote to Rand.\n\"This is an attribution to Rand that has really spread all over the internet,\" said Ben Bayer, a fellow at the Ayn Rand Institute. In March 2018, the Institute even published a blog post about it. And Howard Roark, a character in \"The Fountainhead\" said \"something close\" to the quote, Bayer said.\nRoark is expelled from architectural school early in the book and during a conversation with the school\u2019s dean, Roark is asked about a drawing he turned in, according to the blog post. The assignment was to design a Renaissance villa but Roark\u2019s work was modern and \"strikingly original.\"\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you\u2019re thinking seriously of building that way when and if you\u2019re an architect?\" the dean asks.\nWhen Roark says \"yes,\" the dean says: \"My dear fellow, who will let you?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That\u2019s not the point,\" Roark replies. \"The point is, who will stop me?\"\nThe blog post argues that the quote often attributed to Rand is a \"well-intentioned condensation of this exchange.\"\nBut, Bayer notes, \"in the context of the scene in the novel, there\u2019s a very particular thing that the character (Roark) is trying to do. Out of context, the rewritten quotation might be taken to mean that anyone should be able to do anything they like, but that\u2019s surely not Rand\u2019s view.\"\nHe linked to a page on \"amoralism\" on the institute\u2019s website. An excerpt from Rand\u2019s book, \"Philosophy: Who Needs It\":\n\"The amoralist\u2019s pattern of self-appraisal (which he seldom identifies or admits) is: \u2018I am good because it\u2019s me.\u2019\nBeyond the age of about three to five (i.e., beyond the perceptual level of mental development), this is not an expression of pride or self-esteem, but of the opposite: of a vacuum \u2014 of a stagnant, arrested mentality confessing its impotence to achieve any personal value or virtue.\"\nOur ruling\nThe Facebook post says Ayn Rand said: \"The question isn\u2019t who is going to let me; it\u2019s who is going to stop me.\" She didn\u2019t say this, though the quote paraphrases a character in one of her novels. But without the book\u2019s context, the statement could mislead readers about Rand\u2019s worldview.\nWe rate this post Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00518"}
