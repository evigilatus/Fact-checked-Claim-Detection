Scott Walker opposes increasing the federal minimum wage, fearing it would prompt employers to do less hiring.\nIn making his case, Walker paints a picture of low-wage workers as people working the counter at fast-food restaurants.\n\"I started out, just like Paul Ryan did down the road from me, working at McDonald's,\" Walker told Chuck Todd on MSNBC\u2019s \"The Daily Rundown\" on Jan. 6, 2013.\nHe added: \"Jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce. The last thing you want to do is have fewer young people (working) at a time when unemployment rates are still way too high for teenagers going into their 20s.\"\nWalker\u2019s characterization of the low-wage population touches on a critical element of the debate over raising the national wage, which stands at $7.25 an hour.\nJust who is making the minimum wage? Neither side can seem to agree on the makeup of those on the bottom end of the earning scale.\nIs Walker right that \"jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce\"?\nHis statement is in the context of calls for a higher national minimum wage, so we\u2019ll focus primarily on the national view rather than on individual states, 21 of which have higher minimums than the federal standard.\nNationally, 4.7 percent of hourly workers toil for $7.25 an hour or less (It can be less due to various exemptions in labor law, such as for employees who receive tips and others. Plus, many people making the minimum round it down to $7 when responding to the survey).\nThat\u2019s about 3.6 million people 16 or older, based on conservative estimates drawn from the monthly Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Labor market researchers frequently cite the survey.\nOf that total, 1.6 million report being right at the federal minimum wage -- 2.1% of the hourly workforce.\nThe \u00a0BLS includes both groups -- those at the wage mark, and those below it -- in its statistical reports on minimum wage workers.\nTips, commissions and overtime pay are not included in the pay data. Salaried workers are not part of the mix.\nWomen, residents of the south, never-married workers, part-timers and service employees are more likely than their counterparts to work for $7.25 or less. Restaurant and other food service workers make up the biggest group.\nTeenagers overall are more likely than other age groups to work for the minimum, but even in that group nearly 80 percent of the teens earned more than $7.25.\nHere are the labor bureau\u2019s findings on age:\n-- \"Minimum wage workers tend to be young,\" the labor bureau said in a February 2013 report that looked at numbers for 2012. \"Although workers under age 25 represented only about one-fifth of hourly paid workers, they made up about half of those paid the federal minimum wage or less.\"\n--Teenagers (16 to 19) make up about one-quarter (24.1 percent) of hourly paid workers making $7.25 or less, or 31 percent of those right at the minimum wage.\n\n\n\n\nAge range of worker\n\n\nBreakdown of workers at minimum or less\n\n\nBreakdown of workers at exactly minimum wage\n\n\n\n\n16 to 19 years old\n\n\n24.1 percent\n\n\n30.9 percent\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a020 to 24\n\n\n26.5\n\n\n24.1\n\n\n\n\n25 to 34\n\n\n20.3\n\n\n15.5\n\n\n\n\n35 to 44\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.9\n\n\n9.8\n\n\n\n\n45 to 54\n\n\n10.4\n\n\n10.5\n\n\n\n\n55 to 64\n\n\n5.4\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n\n\n65 to 69\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n\n\n70 and over\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo how do the facts square with Walker\u2019s comment that \"jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce.\"\nHe refers generally to \"young people\" and then later refines that to \"teenagers\" new to the workforce.\nSo let\u2019s look at both.\nTeenagers, as noted in the chart, make up 24 percent to 31 percent of the low-wage set, depending the measure. That group appears to best fit Walker\u2019s description of \"people starting out in the workforce.\"\nBut some college-age youths are new to the workforce as well, and the labor bureau calls the 16 to 24 group \"young\" people in its analysis.\nThat 16 to 24 set makes up more than half of hourly federal minimum wage workers -- 51 to 55 percent, again depending on whether you look at those exactly at the wage, or include those below it as well.\nWalker said the low-wage group is \"overwhelmingly\" young people, and mentioned teenagers.\nThat strikes us as overstated given that workers older than 24 make up 45 percent to 49 percent of federal minimum wage workers. Teenagers are less than one-third of the overall low-wage group.\nBut there\u2019s no strict numerical definition of \"overwhelming\", so we asked two experts for their opinion.\nMark Calabria, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us that Walker has a numerical point, though describes it incorrectly. \"Overwhelming\" implies more than a majority, he said.\n\"Disproportionately\" was a more apt description, given that such a large share of those low-wage jobs are held by young people who make up a small share of the hourly worker pool, said Calabria, a former senior staffer on the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.\nWalker spokesman Tom Evenson made the disproportionality argument to back up the governor\u2019s statement. Among other numbers, he highlighted the fact that those 16-24 hold an estimated 55 percent share of jobs right at the federal minimum wage.\nDavid Cooper, an economic analyst and minimum wage researcher at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, didn\u2019t dispute the numbers, but said \"overwhelmingly\" was off the mark.\nCooper also argued that the focus on the national minimum wage provided a misleading demographic profile of low-wage workers. Many work for more than $7.25, and therefore are not counted as minimum-wage workers by the labor bureau, but earn the minimums set by their state, he noted.\nThe average age of minimum wage workers goes up under this broader view, said Cooper. EPI supports increasing the national minimum wage. Some Democrats and President Barack Obama are pushing for a $10.10 minimum.\nOur rating\nOn cable TV\u2019s MSNBC, Walker said \"Jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce.\"\nThe best estimates are that 24 percent to 55 percent of such jobs are held by teenagers and young adults.\nThat\u2019s a lot, and from a relatively small component of the overall hourly-wage workforce, but his use of \"overwhelming\" strong suggests that a very large majority of those jobs are held by young people.\nThey are not.\nWe rate his claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08413"}
