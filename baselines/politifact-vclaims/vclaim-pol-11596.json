Santorum is a cardboard cutout, and the ammo in the gun is mud.\n\nThe Santorum campaign ad, \"Rombo,\" is airing in Michigan ahead of the state\u2019s presidential primary. Its message: Romney is attacking his rivals to mask his own record.\n\n\"Romney and his super PAC have spent a staggering $20 million brutally attacking fellow Republicans. Why? Because Romney\u2019s trying to hide from his big government Romneycare and his support for job-killing cap and trade.\"\n\nHere, we\u2019re testing the claim that Romney supports cap-and-trade legislation to fight pollution.\n\nAbout cap and trade\n\nCap and trade seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other greenhouse gas sources by setting caps on the amount of pollutants a plant can spew into the air. Companies that come in below their caps are allowed to sell emission credits to other companies that need them.\n\nRepublicans at one time praised cap and trade as a market-based environmental solution, but recently conservatives have taken to condemning it as an energy tax. Nowadays, you won\u2019t hear Republican presidential candidates say anything but \"no\" to whether they favor it.\n\nThey\u2019re so eager to declare their opposition, the candidates at times have fudged their own records on the subject.\n\nWhere Romney stands\n\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from the Santorum campaign when we asked for backup for this claim. Romney\u2019s campaign sent us several of his past statements on cap and trade.\n\nIn August 2011, speaking at a town hall in Lebanon, N.H., Romney emphasized the need for energy independence.\n\n\"My focus as it comes to this topic is to get us off of our dependence on foreign oil, to use our natural gas, to drill for our oil, to use our coal, clean coal, to develop nuclear power, to use solar and wind and efficiency measures, that\u2019s my priority. There are other people who would like to put in place a cap-and-trade program and dramatically increase the cost of energy. That\u2019s their view. And by the way, that would kill a lot of jobs. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to solve the problem of global warming.\"\n\nIn October 2011, speaking at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Romney was asked directly whether he favors it.\n\nHere\u2019s a portion of his answer: \"I do not believe in a cap-and-trade program. By the way, they do not call it America warming, they call it global warming. So the idea of America spending massive amounts, trillions of dollars to somehow stop global warming is not a great idea. It loses jobs for Americans, and ultimately it won\u2019t be successful, because industries that are energy-intensive will just get up and go somewhere else. So it doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. My view is that we don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a slight change from some of his earlier statements about global warming, where he said he believes climate change is, at least in part, caused by human activity.\n\n\"I believe that climate change is occurring \u2013 the reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor. I am uncertain how much of the warming, however, is attributable to man and how much is attributable to factors out of our control,\" Romney wrote in his 2010 book No Apology.\n\nGoing back further, when Romney was governor of Massachusetts, he considered joining a regional cap-and-trade compact known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. But when it came time to sign the deal, Romney backed out citing \"a lack of economic safeguards,\" according to POLITICO.\n\nWe think that\u2019s good evidence that Romney once held at least cautious support for cap and trade. But the Massachusetts episode also shows that he withdrew his support when the policy was tested against economic considerations.\n\nOur ruling\n\nSantorum\u2019s ad says a machine-gun wielding Romney is firing mud to hide his own support of \"job-killing cap and trade.\"\n\nWhile Romney appears to have favored cap and trade in the past, his actions as governor better prove his skepticism of the policy than his support for it. When he could have signed it into law, he declined. And more recently, Romney has repeatedly said he\u2019s opposed to it. And when asked for evidence of Romney's support for cap and trade, the Santorum campaign failed to produce any. We rate the claim False.\nUPDATE, Feb. 22, 2012\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter we published this story, a reader pointed us to an air pollution plan Romney proposed that was specific to Massachusetts power plants. It was separate from the regional compact that we noted in the original item. The state proposal set emissions limits on power plants and included a \"safety valve\" feature which allowed the companies to buy emission offsets from environmental programs rather than make the reductions in their own facilities. \"You could reduce your emissions or pay into some alternative compliance fund,\" said Billy Pizer, a Duke University professor who helped develop the plan. \"He (Romney) was looking for mechanisms that would still serve the goals of the program but would limit the financial exposure of the regulated firms.\"\n\nTo Pizer, these carbon limits don\u2019t fit the definition of cap and trade. \"Maybe you\u2019d call it the same family, but it\u2019s different because you\u2019re telling each source, \u2018here\u2019s what your limit is, but you can buy reductions from these other programs.\u2019 This idea of trying to limit businesses\u2019 exposure from compliance costs is not a feature of cap and trade.\"\n\nWe also talked to Fred Bayles, a former reporter for the Associated Press and USA Today who covered Romney\u2019s administration. He now teaches at Boston University. In Bayles\u2019 opinion, the Massachusetts pollution regulations \"fit the broad definition of cap and trade.\" But he added, \"it\u2019s in the eye of the beholder.\"\n\nWe think the emission limits Romney put in place might still raise the hackles of Santorum and other critics of cap and trade. But his program lacked the feature most commonly associated with cap and trade -- namely, an allowance for companies that come in below their emission caps to sell credits to other polluters.\n\nThe new information adds some helpful details about Romney's position in the past. It is consistent with what we said in our original story, above, that Romney had expressed some support for cap and trade but backed away from it when he declined to sign on to a regional cap and trade pact. He has opposed it since, which is the basis for ruling Santorum's ad claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11596"}
