The pensions were cut after Delphi, which once was part of General Motors, hit deep financial problems.\nBut the rest of the claim, ascribing blame to political favoritism and Obama administration backroom deals, was not supported by facts. We based the ruling on the available evidence, which included Government Accountability Office reports and congressional testimony.\nWe also noted that eventually, a fuller accounting of the Delphi matter would come out from a special inspector general. When it did, we said, we\u2019d consider taking another look.\nThat report is out. And based on it, we are upgrading the rating a notch to Half True.\nSome background: In 2009, GM was in financial trouble and the federal government bailed it out with a financial package worth more than $50 billion, including a loan and an equity stake in a post-bankruptcy, restructured company. There were others in the auto industry also in trouble, including Delphi. And GM and Delphi were the corporate equivalent of step brothers, if not blood relatives. Delphi was a division of GM until the parts maker was spun off as an independent company in 1999.\nBefore the spinoff, Delphi maintained separate pension funds for its unionized and non-unionized workforces. The non-unionized workers were salaried, many in white-collar or support jobs, and their pension fund was flush. The union pension fund, however, was not.\nIn other cases, this might have meant that the unionized workers would eventually get smaller pensions than planned. But in this case, GM made a deal that kept the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, or UAW, happy, which helped facilitate the Delphi spinoff. The deal was this: GM would make up, or \"top-up,\" the difference between the underfunded pension payments and the amounts the workers would have gotten if their pension fund were in fine health.\nThis was not just benevolence. By agreeing to the top-up, GM was able to hand off Delphi operations without union opposition and keep its outside supply chain running. And so the parties codified the top-up provision and kept it in force.\nBut a decade later, the twin bankruptcies of GM and Delphi created a wrinkle. GM had the right in bankruptcy to void its contracts. That could have meant the end to the top-up agreement.\nIt so happened that by now, the fortunes of Delphi\u2019s nonunion workforce and retirees had turned. The once-full pension fund for non-union, or salaried, retirees was underfunded as well.\nBut unlike their unionized colleagues, the salaried or non-unionized retirees had no top-up deal.\nSo what would happen?\nTwo things: First, the Obama administration would agree to bail out General Motors and give it money to keep operating. But before the final sign-off, \u00a0the administration through its Treasury Department-appointed auto task force would need to review GM\u2019s obligations and make decisions about what and whether it owed Delphi retirees.\nBankruptcies typically involve many parties being told to accept the fact that they are never going to get every penny they are owed. Yet that\u2019s not what happened in the case of the Delphi unionized-worker pensions. GM, with considerable help from the Treasury auto team, agreed that even as it exited bankruptcy as a new organization, it would continue to top-up the UAW pensions from its parts supplier. It also agreed to continue top-ups for the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, and the United Steelworkers of America.\nBut GM and Treasury\u2019s auto team left the salaried retiree pensions alone. The non-union retirees would get no top-up. As a result, those retirees would only collect 30 percent to 70 percent of their expected pensions, which would be paid by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., or PBGC, the federal agency that takes over failing pension plans.\nWas this fair?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurner and other lawmakers from auto states said no, as did Delphi retirees. They said that despite the pre-existing top-up agreements, GM\u2019s bankruptcy gave the automaker the right to rewrite the top-up contracts, just as it rewrote a number of unrelated terms with the union\u2019s consent. Even better, they said, GM and Treasury could have worked out a way to make all Delphi retirees whole.\nBut that didn\u2019t happen. There were winners (the union) and losers (the non-union retirees), and that looked like political favoritism and backroom dealing to Turner and other critics.\nBut in 2012, congressional testimony and GAO reports led PolitiFact Ohio to conclude that Treasury and GM made the decision because: (a) the union had long-standing top-up agreements and salaried retirees did not, and (b) any attempt to end those agreements would have caused the UAW to balk or even strike.\nTreasury maintained that it was vital to get GM stabilized quickly, and an interruption to its ability to get parts for its cars -- due to labor unrest -- could be fatal. There was nothing to back up Turner\u2019s claim that the top-up decision was made because of political favoritism and backroom dealing. The GAO said that \"court filings and statements from GM and Treasury officials support that Treasury deferred to GM\u2019s business judgment.\"\nBased on this, PolitiFact Ohio gave Turner\u2019s claim a \"Mostly False\" rating.\" That\u2019s where matters stood until Aug. 15, when additional information was released though the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP.\nThe Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, provided federal funds for bank bailouts as well as the auto rescue, and was overseen by Treasury. The report by the special inspector general, an independent watchdog, provided a long-awaited assessment of Treasury\u2019s role in the pension controversy.\nThe SIGTARP report confirmed much of what the GAO already said. It reported that GM and Treasury were concerned about getting the automaker back on its feet quickly -- and that, in the words of Steven Rattner, head of the auto team, trying to get more on pensions \"was a game of chicken we didn\u2019t want to play. We were under incredible time pressure.\"\nWhy, then, upgrade PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s rating?\nThe SIGTARP report contained new information about the dominant role that Treasury\u2019s auto team played. The team\u2019s role in the decision to top-up the pensions of UAW workers was not just advisory, the SIGTARP report said. Treasury\u2019s financial role gave it a dominant position. GM could not make decisions without Treasury.\nGM\u2019s chief financial officer at the time, Ray Young, told SIGTARP that Treasury\u2019s influence, a result of its financial stake, was such that GM \"put forward recommendations, but at the end of the day (Treasury) makes the final decision.\"\nThis was all done privately.\nThose with leverage, particularly Treasury and the UAW, were able to make their demands. Delphi\u2019s salaried retirees, who believed the government could make them whole, had no leverage and were largely kept on the outside.\nThat is a clear impression from the SIGTARP report.\nThis is the way most negotiations occur, including many involving individual Congress members, as a Treasury spokesman noted as we discussed this with him. But Turner\u2019s claim did not involve other deals. He was speaking specifically of the Delphi pension matter.\nSo we return to Turner\u2019s claim about \"political favoritism and backroom deals.\"\nA rating of Half True means the statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nTurner\u2019s claim is partially accurate.\nTreasury\u2019s heavy role, well-reasoned or not, was largely played out in closed meetings.\nIt was not subject to transparency -- a key reason why the White House and members of the House of Representatives government oversight committee, on which Turner serves, continue to spar over the committee\u2019s demands for more information and testimony.\nWas there political favoritism? We can\u2019t know for sure because of the lack of transparency, nor can Turner, but there isn\u2019t evidence to prove it. And the claim still requires a considerable amount of context to understand fully.\nBut until the SIGTARP report\u2019s release, the extent of Treasury\u2019s role -- the backroom considerations -- were more a matter of speculation than fact.\nWe believe this warrants an upgrade. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08844"}
