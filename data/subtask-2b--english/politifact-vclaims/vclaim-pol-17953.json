(Read more about PolitiFact California\u2019s partnership with Facebook).\nWe fact-checked similar misinformation ahead of the primary. But with this post re-circulating, we decided to set the record straight, again.\u00a0\nDifferences Between California\u2019s Primary and General Elections\nAccording to the California Secretary of State\u2019s Office, political parties \u2014 not state officials\u00a0 \u2014 decide whether and how the state\u2019s independent voters, also known as No Party Preference voters, can participate in each party\u2019s presidential primary election.\u00a0\nThe restrictions make it more difficult but not impossible to vote for your favorite candidate. For example, the Democratic party required California\u2019s more than 5 million registered independents to request a \"crossover ballot\" in March to vote for a Democratic presidential candidate. But it did not force them to re-register.\nBy contrast, the Republican party required independent voters to register with the GOP to participate in its primary. So, the warning in the first part of the Facebook post was correct \u2014 for the March primary.\u00a0\nThese requirements, however, do not apply to California\u2019s November general election.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

But it doesn\u2019t apply to California\u2019s November general election, when voters can select the candidate of their choice, no matter their party affiliation.\u00a0\nThe second part is false.
