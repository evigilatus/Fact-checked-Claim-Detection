Nathan Deal recently told WSB-TV reporter Lori Geary that the plan could make fiscal sense.\n\n\"I think that, overall, if we get a new facility that\u2019s upgraded and meets the current demands and needs of the future, then being \u2018on the hook,\u2019 so to speak, for less than a third \u2013 that is repaid from money that comes from outsiders \u2013 I think that\u2019s probably a pretty good deal,\" the governor said.\n\nThere\u2019s got to be a catch, right?\n\nA stadium can cost more than the price of on-site construction. \u00a0Off-site roads, bridges and other infrastructure may need upgrades to accommodate crowds. \u00a0\n\nLooks like it\u2019s time for the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nIf the Falcons get their wish, the 20-year-old Georgia Dome would be razed in favor of a facility with luxury suites and other features that could boost the team\u2019s bottom line. \u00a0\n\nSkeptical taxpayers stand in their way. The public fully financed the Dome. But in the decades since, voters have soured on helping sports teams build new arenas.\n\nUnder the current proposal, they would pitch in big time.\n\nThe facility would be owned by the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which owns the Dome, the Georgia World Congress Center and Centennial Olympic Park. \u00a0Each year, a portion of the \u00a0budgets for the Dome and World Congress Center come from a cut of an 8 percent tax on hotel and motel rooms within Atlanta\u2019s city limits and unincorporated Fulton County.\n\nThe GWCCA would help the Falcons pay for stadium construction with a bond backed by revenue it expects this tax to make over the next 30 years. \u00a0The projected amount: about $300 million. \u00a0\n\nWe emailed Deal spokesman Brian Robinson for more information. He said the governor was speaking about the burden the stadium would put on state funds, and Deal overstated the cost.\n\n\"In reality, it would come at no cost to STATE taxpayers,\" Robinson responded. \u00a0\n\nWe think viewers may have gotten the impression that Deal \u00a0was talking about the total burden to taxpayers. The financing the governor mentioned in the interview would be backed by the local hotel/motel tax, not state funds.\n\nWe\u2019ll take both interpretations into account.\n\nThis brings us to the first part of our fact check. Are taxpayers \"on the hook ... for less than a third\" of the stadium\u2019s cost? \u00a0\n\nThis appears to be a matter of arithmetic. The $300 million contribution from local motel/hotel taxes is \u00a0less than one-third of the projected $1 billion construction cost. \u00a0\n\nIf this were the only pot of public funds going to the stadium, then this portion of Deal\u2019s claim would be correct. \u00a0But there\u2019s more to the story.\n\nIn a \"term sheet\" approved in December that outlines the deal, both parties agreed that the GWCCA would buy land for the facility.\n\nDeal earmarked $15 million from the state budget in 2012 to buy land that could be used for the complex. Land acquisition costs could rise depending on which site planners select.\n\nIn addition, roads and other infrastructure near the stadium may need hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrades. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said in September that these improvements could push the stadium\u2019s total cost to $1.2 billion. This could push the cost to the public upward of $500 million.\n\nThe Falcons expect to seek government help. \u00a0The term sheet says that the GWCCA will cooperate with them \"in pursuing other possible governmental funding sources with respect to such offsite infrastructure as may be required.\"\n\nReed floated the possibility of using an additional $53 million in city economic development dollars.\n\nWXIA-TV recently reported that the stadium could receive millions of dollars in tax breaks from the state through an economic development program for projects of \"regional significance.\"\n\nAnd furthermore, state money that the Georgia Department of Transportation gives local governments for road maintenance could be available, state DOT spokeswoman Jill Goldberg said. \u00a0The project may be eligible for federal funds, too.\n\nGoldberg stressed, though, that no plans have been made, and the project may need no state money.\n\nRobinson told PolitiFact Georgia that he did not \"foresee\" state DOT money being used, but there are no set plans.\n\n\"There\u2019s too many unknowns at this juncture,\" Robinson said in an email. \"There\u2019s no deal at this time.\"\n\nLet\u2019s move on to the second part of Deal\u2019s claim. Will the public\u2019s share of the cost really be paid for by \"outsiders\"?\n\nNot entirely. As we mentioned earlier, the GWCCA would use state funds to buy the site, and state, local and federal funds could be used for infrastructure.\n\nBut the majority of the projected $300 million in hotel/motel taxes for stadium construction would be paid by outsiders.\n\nSome 86 percent of those who stay in hotels in unincorporated Fulton and the city of Atlanta are from out of state, Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau spokeswoman Lauren Jarrell said.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nRegardless of how you interpret Deal\u2019s claim, it fell short.\n\nYes, a large portion of the public\u2019s contribution would come from local hotel/motel taxes, and these are overwhelmingly paid by \"outsiders.\"\n\nBut the state will buy land for the stadium, could chip in to help with hundreds of millions in infrastructure costs, and could provide substantial tax breaks.\n\nThe total share for taxpayers could \u00a0easily exceed $300 million.\n\nDeal\u2019s claim is premature. And it leaves out important details.\n\nThe governor gets a Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHank Aaron\u2019s death was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y.
