The tweet says, \"Ready for this? The largest donor to Mitch McConnell (R. Moco) has been found to be only the few Russians on which the Gobble Party has lifted sanctions.\" The same position was associated with an average position in January 28 by the Democratic Alliance, a super-political party founded in 2016 in opposition to Donald Trump. This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to the story of the Democratic Alliance, Lynn Plavatnik, a dual citizen of the United States and the United Kingdom, has donated millions to the Maconel Campaign and the Senate Leadership Fund in recent years through his Access Holdings. The story also alleges that Plavatnik is a long-term business partner of the Russian olig Deribaska, who has a Kremlin relationship with Aluminum Rosale, \"in which Plavatnik is a major investor.\" The report then stated that in January Maconel had led the Republicans to vote against a decision to maintain the sanctions against Deribasca. We found that all of this is not false, but the allegation overestimates Plavatnik's contributions to Maconel as his \"largest\" donor, making it seem as if Plavatnik was the Russian few affected by the sanctions. In fact, it was another Russian who ran business with him. Who's Lin Plavatnik and how much do you donate to McConnell? Plavatnik emigrated to the United States with his family in the late 1970s and returned to Russia in the late 1980s as the Soviet Union began to collapse. His holding companies, which are based in the United States - Access Industries Inc. and AI-Altep Holdings Inc. - are two of his largest political contributions, according to the records of the Federal Electoral Commission. In the period 2015-16, Blavatnik &apos; s contributions went to the Government People &apos; s Election Observation Centres and senior Republican leaders, including McConnell, according to the records of the Federal Election Commission. At that session, his companies contributed more than $6.3 million, with $2.5 million allocated to the McConnell Senate Leadership Fund. In 2017, Plavatnik donated another $1 million to the Commission, showing records, bringing the total to $3.5 million. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he adhere to the proven democratic playbook.\" By Sierra O'Rourke on January 11, 2021, while Plavatnik donated everything to the McConnell committee, he is nowhere near the largest contributor to the majority leader. In the 2017-18 cycle alone, at least two other donors, Sheldon D. Adelson and Miriam Adelson, provided $25 million (piece) to his driving fund. In April 2018, the Trump Administration announced sanctions against many Russian oligarchs and companies, including Deribaska and his Aluminum Rosale, the second largest aluminium company in the world. Derebska is known to be allied with the Kremlin, and his name appears in e-mails delivered to Mueller's investigation. Then in December, the administration agreed to lift the sanctions imposed on Deribasca companies in exchange for his relinquishment of majority ownership, as well as other privileges. About a month later, Makonel led the Republicans in the Senate and hindered democratic efforts to maintain the sanctions imposed on Deribaska companies. Now that we're all stuck, how does Plavatnik and Deribasca connect? Since two of Russia's richest men are in the United Kingdom, it is not entirely surprising that they have business dealings. According to a report from the Dallas News, Plavatnik and its trading partner Victor Fixlburg have a 20.5 per cent stake in Rosale. Vixlberg published news in May 2018, after it was revealed that an American company was investing $500,000 for a company owned by Michael Cohen, former attorney for Trump. Our article \"A\" says that \"Maconnell's biggest donor\" is a Russian few who have been released from American sanctions. Plavatnik is involved in the business of Deribaska, for which sanctions have recently been lifted, but it is inaccurate to call it the Russian few \"who the Republican Party has just lifted sanctions against.\" Lavatnik also donated funds to the leadership fund of the Maconel Senate, but it was not the highest donor, but a record. It also contributed to other Republican leaders and popular election committees affiliated to the World Democratic Party. The attack on McConnell got a lot of wrong details. So we assess it wrong. 2019-02-14 19:31:36 UTC Politic Fact 2 1 7 PoliticFact Dating: Facebook articles on the Internet Thursday, 31 January 2019 2019 - 01-31 Read more information", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01017"}
