It\u2019s not.\n\"Attention hunters: Voting in North Dakota could cost you your out-of-state hunting licenses,\" says the Facebook ad, which began running on Nov. 1.\nWe ran the ad by Cameron Wimpy, research director at MIT Election Data and Science Lab.\n\"I do absolutely think it is voter suppression to try and trick folks this way,\" Wimpy said.\nMost North Dakota hunters can breathe easy.\nIf you have an out-of-state hunting license anywhere outside of North Dakota -- and it\u2019s an out-of-state license, rather than a residential one for residents of that state -- you\u2019re safe.\nIf you have a North Dakota residential hunting license, you\u2019re also safe, because in applying for that license you already gave up any other residential licenses. North Dakota\u2019s Game and Fish department doesn\u2019t allow a person to hold two residential licenses. (Those tend to expire within a season or year anyway.)\nIn theory, this applies to folks living in North Dakota who have a residential license in a state other than North Dakota, which conceivably could be people who have just moved. (This is the basis on which the North Dakota Democratic\u2013Nonpartisan League Party, which is the state\u2019s branch of the Democratic Party, defended the ad.)\u00a0\nWould casting a vote in North Dakota make even those licenses void? We found no evidence of that.\nWe called the Fish and Wildlife offices in North Dakota\u2019s neighboring states: Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and Minnesota. They all told us that voting in North Dakota wouldn\u2019t make them lose their licenses.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they purchased that license prior to leaving Montana as legal resident, it is valid until the expiration date, no matter what they do in North Dakota,\" said Ron Jendro, the assistant chief of enforcement for the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department.\nThe same goes for Wyoming, South Dakota and Minnesota; the licenses are valid until they expire.\nFor other states, establishing residency elsewhere means their resident hunting license is void. That\u2019s the case in North Dakota and Kentucky, the two other states whose hunting permit offices we called.\nBut there\u2019s no way that casting a vote would suddenly make those licenses null. Lee Ann Oliver, elections specialist at the North Dakota Secretary of State\u2019s office, told us they have a central voter file, but fish and wildlife departments don\u2019t get access to that database.\nAnd anyway, in order to vote, a person has to already have established residency.\n\"They\u2019re putting the cart before the horse,\" Oliver said. \"You have to be a resident before you can vote.\"\nVoters can show a North Dakota driver\u2019s license, nondriver\u2019s identification card, tribal ID or long term care card. If those don\u2019t include a current North Dakota residential address or date of birth, the voter may supplement their ID with a variety of documents, like bills or bank statements.\nOur ruling\nNorth Dakota Democratic-NPL said, \"Attention hunters: Voting in North Dakota could cost you your out-of-state hunting licenses.\"\nIt\u2019s hard to interpret this in any way except that it seeks to discourage people from voting. But voting will not cost anyone their hunting licenses. People with out-of-state hunting licenses get to keep their licenses; the warning only applies to people with residential licenses in another state who recently moved to North Dakota. Voting would not make those null, but establishing residency in another state, which is a prerequisite to voting, might, depending on the state.\nThe ad employs a ridiculous argument.
