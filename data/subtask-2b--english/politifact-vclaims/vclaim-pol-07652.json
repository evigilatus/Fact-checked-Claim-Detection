We rated that claim True this spring, but noted that Obama has taken a position on only 28 percent of the measures Warner has voted on. Warner\u2019s key show of solidarity with the president was his 2010 vote to pass Obamacare.\nWith that work behind us, we decided to probe the unexplored part of Gillespie\u2019s claim: That Warner has supported Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nev., \"down the line.\"\nGillespie\u2019s campaign declined to back up or explain the statement. So we went to the voting records.\nOpenCongress.org has a tool that compares the voting record of U.S. senators and representatives for the current two-year term of Congress, which started in January 2013. \u00a0Warner voted the same way as Reid 87 percent of the time through June 24 of this year. That ties as the ninth lowest percentage among 51 Senate Democrats. The lowest correlation is owned by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., at 79 percent; the highest is 93 percent, shared by five senators. The average among all Democratic senators, excluding Reid, is 91 percent.\nNext, we compiled a record of the roll call votes for the previous four years in which Reid and Warner were both in the Senate. In both the 111th and 112th Congress terms, they also voted the same way 87 percent of the time. \u00a0\nWarner and Reid have agreed on these major bills:\n\nThe stimulus\nThe Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare\nExtending the Patriot Act, allowing increased surveillance of people suspected of terrorist activities\nA farm bill expanding crop insurance and trimming the food stamp program\nExtending a period offering lower rates for student loans\nIncreasing debt limits\n\nWarner has opposed Reid on several key bills by voting:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo overturn Environmental Protection Agency regulations to cut mercury and other emissions from coal-fired electric generation facilities\nAgainst delaying the 2013 start of automatic spending cuts in defense and domestic programs that are also known as sequestration\nFor the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement\n\nMany of Warner\u2019s voting disagreements with Reid occurred not in the final actions on bills, but in earlier votes on proposed amendments to them. Warner has supported a number of\u00a0cost-cutting amendments that Reid has opposed. This includes Warner\u2019s votes:\n\nTo establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to address long-term fiscal problems\nTo bar earmarks in several budget amendments\nTo eliminate appropriations for security on highway buses on which passengers typically carry luggage\nAgainst giving seniors, veterans and the disabled a $250 check to offset the lack of a cost of living adjustment in 2010 benefits\nFor streamlining 15 financial literacy programs in 13 departments\nFor tort reform as part of the health care reform law\n\nWarner campaigned for office in 2008 as a \"radical centrist\" who would seek bipartisan compromise. David Turner, Warner\u2019s campaign spokesman this year, said Gillespie\u2019s efforts to define the senator by vote comparisons \"is distorting Senator Warner\u2019s moderate record.\"\nTurner sent us links to other vote studies and news articles that praise Warner for his bipartisan work. For example, the National Journal rated Warner the 46th most liberal member of the 100-seat U.S. Senate in 2013, based on an analysis of 117 roll call votes on key economic, foreign and social issues. And Open Congress, found that Warner voted with the majority of his party on 90 percent of all Senate bills last year, ranking him 42nd among the 51 Democratic senators.\nTurner also noted that Warner and Reid disagreed on some matters that the Senate never voted on.\nWarner, for example, drew national attention for leading an informal, bipartisan group of six senators seeking tax and spending compromises that would lower the national debt. Reid dismissed the effort as \"happy talk.\" He left Warner off a bipartisan supercommitee that unsuccessfully searched for fiscal compromises to avoid automatic spending cuts -- also known as sequestration -- that went into effect last year.\nTurner also sent us a recent Politico article that named Warner as one of a group of Democratic senators who has been pushing Reid to ease his control of the Senate by allowing more votes on bills and opening up the amendment process.\nOur ruling\nGillespie accused Warner of supporting Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid \"down the line.\" Gillespie\u2019s campaign declined to provide any explanation of the statement.\nRecords show that Warner and Reid have voted in accord 87 percent of the time, including on most of the landmark bills since 2009. That shows substantial agreement, but not the knee-jerk support for Reid that Gillespie suggests. Among the 51 Senate Democrats, Warner has the ninth lowest voting percentage with Reid.\nReid and Warner usually agree, but they\u2019re not clones. We rate Gillespie\u2019s exaggerated statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07652"}
