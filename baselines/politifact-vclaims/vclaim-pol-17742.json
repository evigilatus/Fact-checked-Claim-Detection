It also featured a handwritten sign saying, \"Marquette University 2024.\"\nThat launched a series of events that has grown to include international news coverage, strong criticism from a leading state lawmaker and a tweet from Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son and confidante.\n\"Defund academic leftist indoctrination! It\u2019s truly sad what\u2019s going on in college campuses,\" Trump Jr. wrote in a July 8, 2020, tweet. \"Marquette University threatened to rescind student\u2019s admission over pro-Trump TikTok video.\"\nThe tweet linked to an account of Pfefferle\u2019s situation from thecollegefix.com, which used the same wording about Marquette threatening to rescind admission over the video.\nThat same language was picked up in coverage by the New York Post, The Sun and The Daily Mail, among other news outlets.\nAnd it was the foundation of a July 15, 2020, letter from state Rep. Dave Murphy, chairman of the Assembly Committee on Colleges and Universities, condemning Marquette\u2019s actions. Murphy, R-Greenville, asked Marquette to defend its actions, asked if the school was going to fire the admissions dean who spoke with Pfefferle and said he was considering holding a committee hearing on \"political bias and intimidation utilized in the admissions processes of our public and private universities.\"\nSo it\u2019s time to clarify what happened here.\nDid Marquette really threaten to rescind admission based on a student\u2019s support of Trump, as Trump Jr. claimed in his tweet?\nThe background\nWe\u2019ll start with the background, since it\u2019s a bit of a tangled tale.\nAfter Pfefferle\u2019s TikTok video was posted \u2014 under the username conservativegirl0 \u2014 she told various media outlets she received a barrage of negative comments and even threats of injury and death. One Instagram user launched a campaign to get Pfefferle\u2019s Marquette admission revoked by creating a form letter for people to send to the university\u2019s admission office. That campaign stemmed from another social media post Pfefferle made about not believing a biological man can claim to be a woman, Pfefferle said.\nResponding to these reports, Marquette University Dean of Admissions Brian Troyer and another official had a Zoom meeting with the New London High School graduate. What happened on that call is a matter of dispute that we\u2019ll get into shortly.\nIn the wake of that call, Pfefferle began telling her story to various conservative media outlets in late June and early July. Many of their reports implied in headlines and social media posts that Pfefferle\u2019s admission was in doubt because of her politics, leading to criticism of the Catholic, Jesuit university in conservative circles.\nPro-Trump post wasn\u2019t the issue\nThere are two elements to the claim Trump Jr. repeated in his tweet: 1) Pfefferle\u2019s admission was threatened, and 2) that happened as a result of her pro-Trump video. We\u2019ll examine those one by one.\nThe connection to the video is the simpler claim to address. And it\u2019s simply wrong.\nThe TikTok video \u2014 with 600,000 views and counting \u2014 is what attracted the most attention, but the complaints to Marquette that prompted the school\u2019s involvement were about other posts by Pfefferle.\n\"Marquette received hundreds of emails, social media messages and formal bias-incident reports from current students, alumni and others regarding the incoming student\u2019s social media posts and her comments on social media, which some deemed to be \u2018transphobic and racist\u2019 language,\" university spokeswoman Lynn Griffith told PolitiFact Wisconsin in an email. \"The concerns brought to us by hundreds of students and non-students were not specific to that (pro-Trump) TikTok. Rather, the messages and formal bias incident reports referenced other posts on the student\u2019s social channels.\"\nWe didn\u2019t find any allegation from Pfefferle in her various interviews that the video or her support of Trump were brought up in discussions with Marquette admissions staffers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the controversy didn\u2019t stem merely from her conservative ideology or this specific video supporting Trump.\nConflicting viewpoints on \"threat\" to rescind admission\nIt\u2019s less clear what impact, if any, this all had on Pfeffele\u2019s admission.\nShe remains enrolled and slated to attend classes this fall. And the university said in a statement released July 8, 2020, that it \"has not rescinded, nor did it threaten to rescind, her admission.\"\nAt issue are multiple interpretations of what happened on that Zoom call between Pfefferle and admissions officials.\nGriffith said Marquette officials had a conversation with Pfefferle based on the numerous \"bias\" complaints filed against her, and because her safety had been threatened by online posters.\n\"This particular incoming student was not treated any differently than any other incoming student where there are either concerns from members of our community and/or threats to safety,\" Griffith said. \"The objective of the conversation was to have a dialogue on how to live and interact with students and community members with different political views within our diverse community.\"\nGriffith said admissions decisions \"are made based on academic achievements and student involvement, not political views.\"\nPfefferle \u2014 who did not respond to a request for comment \u2014 interpreted that exchange differently.\nShe told Empower Wisconsin for a July 2, 2020, story that Troyer told her she wasn\u2019t considered a student yet, although she had been accepted, paid for housing and been assigned roommates. She told radio host Todd Starnes on a June 30, 2020, podcast that she was put through a series of \"morality tests,\" asking her how she would interact with students with views different from hers. She said Marquette brought up social media posts going back to when she was 15 years old (she\u2019s now 18).\u00a0\nPfefferle told Laura Ingraham on Fox News on July 13, 2020, that she didn\u2019t hear back for a week and a half after that meeting, during which time she assumed her admission status was in jeopardy. Pfefferle told The College Fix website for a July 7, 2020, story, \"This means that my classification is still in limbo.\"\nGriffith said the week-plus delay was because the university was closed the week of June 29, as part of an annual closure around the Fourth of July.\nThe account on thecollegefix.com \u2014 written by a freshman creative-writing student at the University of Wisconsin \u2014 summarized the situation as involving a threat to rescind Pfefferle\u2019s admission over her pro-Trump TikTok video. And that\u2019s the narrative that took hold, repeated by numerous media outlets and retweeted by Trump Jr.\nMurphy, the chair of the Assembly higher education committee, simply stated the reported threat as fact in a news release July 15, 2020. In a followup email to PolitiFact Wisconsin he said that was based on \"reporting I\u2019ve seen\" and statements Pfefferle made in interviews.\nBut Pfefferle never attributed the admissions concerns to the pro-Trump video. And we didn\u2019t find any interviews where Pfefferle herself described it as a threat.\nOn Fox News she was explicitly asked if Marquette told her they could rescind her admission.\n\"No, they told me I wasn\u2019t a student, and then that I would hear back from them in a couple days, and then it took them a week and a half,\" Pfefferle said.\nOur ruling\nA widespread claim repeated by Trump Jr. said Marquette University threatened to rescind a student\u2019s admission over a pro-Trump TikTok video.\nThe \"threat\" claim and connection to the video largely boil down to a student writer\u2019s oversimplified description of a complex situation that was assumed as truth as it increasingly made the rounds online.\nThat video attribution element is wrong. The issue that got Marquette \u2014 and the hundreds of people who contacted it in a campaign orchestrated online \u2014 involved related to comments on topics like sexuality and immigration in other posts.\nThe allegation that Pfefferle\u2019s admission status was threatened in some form is trickier, and gets into he-said, she-said territory. Pfefferle clearly felt her admission could be in doubt, but\u00a0 the university said no threat was made. And Pfefferle herself hasn\u2019t described the situation quite that way either.\nPutting that all together, we are left with a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That\u2019s our definition of Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17742"}
