Here\u2019s a portion:\n\"Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party.\n\"Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn\u2019t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty\u00a0years by Republicans.\"\nIt wasn\u2019t\u00a0the most noteworthy part of Trump\u2019s statement, but when he said that that Bannon that the Alabama seat had been held \"for more than thirty years by Republicans,\" he was off by almost a decade.\nThe seat in question is the one in which Democrat Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore weeks earlier. It was the subject of a special election because its previous elected occupant, Jeff Sessions, left to become Trump\u2019s attorney general. (By coincidence, Jones was being sworn in as the state\u2019s new senator on the same day that the news of Wolff\u2019s book was dominating political discussion.)\nSeeing Trump\u2019s statement, several political observers, including the Washington Post\u2019s Paul Kane and Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, noted that the last Democrat to occupy the seat had been Sessions\u2019 predecessor, Howell Heflin.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

(Judge Hefflin, D, retired in '96.)I'll leave psycho-analysis to others.\u2014 Paul Kane (@pkcapitol) January 3, 2018\n\n\nBasic fact error here - the Alabama Senate seat that Jones (D) won had been held by Republicans since 1996, so about 20 years, not \"more than 30.\" Howell Heflin (D) held it prior to the 1996 election. I realize this is nitpicky but it's also characteristically sloppy from this WH https://t.co/s4RTIlVbcc\u2014 Kyle Kondik (@kkondik) January 3, 2018\n\n\nHeflin retired in 1996, making the actual period of Republican control 21 years, not 30.\n\nThe late Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.\nAs for Alabama\u2019s other Senate seat, it has been held by Richard Shelby since his first election victory in 1986. Shelby was elected as a Democrat, but switched to the Republican Party shortly after the GOP took control of both chambers of Congress in November 1994.\nThe White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\nOne last bit of trivia: Earlier in his career, Jones worked as an aide for Heflin, who died in 2005. On election night, Jones called Heflin his \"mentor.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said the Senate seat won by Jones had been \"held for more than thirty years by Republicans.\" It hasn\u2019t been that long. It\u2019s been 21 years since Democrat Howell Heflin retired, paving the way for his successor, Sessions, and Sessions\u2019 elected successor, Jones.
