But a new report from an anti-tax group says he\u2019s actually proposed raising taxes more than 400 times.\n\"Obama has proposed 442 tax hikes since taking office,\" said Americans for Tax Reform in an April 14 press release.\n\"History tells us what Obama was able to do. This list reminds us of what Obama wanted to do,\u2019\" said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, in the statement.\nThe group released a list of 442 measures the group considered a tax increase, divided into sections for each fiscal year\u2019s budget from 2010 to 2015. The report is based on an analysis of the budgets the Obama administration has proposed since taking the White House.\nAmericans for Tax Reform is well known for opposing tax increases. The group promotes a famous pledge, which says politicians will oppose \"any and all efforts\" to increase income taxes and will also oppose \"any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.\" That means they don\u2019t support any measure that brings more revenue into the government.\nWe wondered if the group was accurate in how it was counting up Obama\u2019s proposals. We\u2019ve tracked Obama\u2019s campaign promises on taxes, and while he has definitely proposed new taxes, we were suspicious that it was 442 separate tax increases. (Indeed, we track 24 campaign promises from Obama on the topic of taxes, a group that includes proposed tax hikes as well as proposed tax breaks.)\nSo we decided to put Americans for Tax Reform\u2019s number to our Truth-O-Meter.\nThe list \nWe started out with a close examination of the long list of proposals on their 15-page press release. Each fiscal year budget has its own section, stating the year of the proposal and the total number of measures for each year.\nThe release does not elaborate on the specifics of each measure beyond briefly stating its purpose.\nWe found there are plenty of measures on the list that would increase taxes. One example: Obama\u2019s pledge to impose a so-called \"Buffett Rule,\" which would set a minimum tax rate of approximately 30 percent on millionaires.\nAlso included on the list are several tax increases on the oil and gas industry, either by eliminating existing credits for oil companies or through entirely new taxes, another pledge Obama made during his presidential campaigns.\nMany items on the list, though, struck us as either double-counted or not a tax at all. Here\u2019s a summary of some of the problems we found.\nThe list counts the same proposals multiple times. Americans for Tax Reform listed a measure each time it appeared in one of Obama\u2019s budgets. As a result, 276 of the proposals on the list have at least one match somewhere else in the document. (We didn\u2019t include proposals that have a similar but not identical wording to others on the list.)\nObama did propose these measures multiple times, but it is misleading to count each time he included a measure in his budget as a newly proposed tax increase.\nFor example, Obama has long proposed ending a special tax category, known as \"carried interest,\" that allows hedge fund managers and other financial investors to claim lower tax rates than ordinary workers. But Congress has never signed off on getting rid of the special category. Americans for Tax Reform counts Obama\u2019s idea four times on its list, because it has appeared in four budget proposals. But it\u2019s really the same proposal.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving duplicates eliminates about 159 of the proposals, cutting the total down to 283 proposed tax hikes.\nAmericans for Tax Reform said it didn\u2019t see these as duplicates, since Obama specifically proposed them each year in his budgets.\n\"If President Obama proposes tax increases several times in several different budgets, he deserves full credit for doing so,\" said Ryan Ellis, the group\u2019s tax policy director, via email.\nSome items aren\u2019t tax increases. We noticed that the list includes several administrative changes to the tax code that aren\u2019t tax increases. \u00a0Here are a few examples:\n\n\nRequire greater electronic filing of returns;\n\n\nIndex all tax penalties to inflation;\n\n\nMake repeated willful failure to file a tax return a felony;\n\n\nRequire e-filing by certain large organizations.\n\n\nOddly, we found that a few measures included on the list were actually tax decreases, such as the proposal\u00a0 from the president\u2019s 2015 budget to eliminate the telephone excise tax.\nWe flagged 34 of the proposals on the list as ones that either wouldn\u2019t raise taxes or would only do so through a penalty for failing to comply with the proposal.\nAmericans for Tax Reform agreed that four of the items we found were not tax increases, including the repeal of the telephone excise tax. Ellis said they would adjust their total accordingly.\nBut they did feel that 11 items, including indexing tax penalties for inflation, were tax increases because they would increase revenue to the government. The other items \"fall into an area where reasonable minds can draw different conclusions,\" he said.\nThe Americans for Tax Reform list also failed to account for other tax cuts that are part of Obama\u2019s record, including nearly $220 billion in tax cuts that were part of the federal stimulus.\nWe ran our findings by Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, and an expert on federal tax policy. He said it wasn\u2019t useful to count tax proposals without any consideration for what\u2019s in the proposal.\n\"This whole matter of the number of tax hikes he proposed is silly,\" Toder said via email. \"If someone raised my taxes 442 times by 1 cent each time or one time by $100,000, I think I would prefer the former to the latter.\"\nOur ruling \nAmericans for Tax Reform said that \"Obama has proposed 442 tax hikes since taking office.\" \nWhile the list accompanying the claim does contain some proposals that would have increased taxes, it overstates the total number by a significant amount. Our analysis suggests about 200 items should be knocked off this list, because it includes the same items Obama proposed in multiple budgets and some proposals that cannot be considered tax increases.
