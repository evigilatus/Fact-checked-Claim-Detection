But the image is fake.\nThe post was published on Facebook Oct. 27 \u2014\u00a0the day after the raid on Baghdadi\u2019s compound in northwestern Syria. It has been shared more than 2,500 times.\n\"Trump Kills Unarmed Father of Three,\" reads the chyron. \"President calls brave ISIS fighter a \u2019coward & dog\u2019 \u2026 credits Russia in brutal slaying.\"\nThe post, which has been published by several other pages and users, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Some commenters took it as a joke, and others thought it might be real.\nCNN never aired a chyron calling Baghdadi an \"unarmed father of three.\" The pieces of the image were manipulated.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image of Don Lemon, host of \"CNN Tonight,\" has been online since at least January, according to a Google reverse image search. The photo of Baghdadi is real \u2014\u00a0it was taken from a video posted by the Islamic State\u2019s propaganda arm in April. It could have aired on CNN during Baghdadi coverage, albeit not with this chyron.\nWe checked CNN captions since the raid was carried out Oct. 26. We could find no mention of the word \"unarmed.\" We also checked \"CNN Tonight\" archives and could not find a chyron that matched the one in the viral photo.\nThen there\u2019s the timing of the chyron.\n\"This is fake,\" said Christal Jones, a senior public relations manager at CNN, in an email. \"Don\u2019s show airs weeknights 10pm to midnight.
