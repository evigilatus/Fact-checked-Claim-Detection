Pretty bad, argues former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.\nIn economic growth, \"Obama's best year was slower than Bill Clinton's worst year,\" Gingrich told Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo on July 23, 2017. \"That's astonishing.\"\nWe\u2019ve previously looked at why it\u2019s so hard these days for the United States to sustain 3 percent annual economic growth \u2014 a benchmark President Donald Trump says the country can again reach with his leadership.\nBut we wondered whether the difference in economic performance under the two most recent Democratic presidents was so stark.\nWe found that Gingrich\u2019s talking point is correct, though he leaves out some important context.\nAnnual economic growth is typically measured by the change, up or down, in gross domestic product from year to year, after adjusting for inflation. This data is collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a federal office.\nAs it turns out, Clinton had two years tied for last place -- 1993 and 1995. In both years, GDP grew by 2.7 percent.\nAs for Obama, his best annual showing came in 2015, with 2.6 percent.\nIn the following chart, the worst Clinton years and the best Obama year are marked in blue.\n\nSo by the primary measure, Gingrich\u2019s statement is correct.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that a related statistic shows the record on Obama\u2019s watch in a somewhat more favorable light.\nGary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said that GDP growth depends on two major factors -- how productive workers are, and how many workers there are. And Clinton was blessed with a worker population that was growing much faster than it later would under Obama.\nWhen Clinton was president, Burtless said, the population between the ages of 15 and 64 increased by 1.2 percent a year. Under Obama, the increase was just 0.6 percent.\n\"So it seems to me a bit absurd to compare overall GDP growth in the two administrations without somehow accounting for the different rates of growth in the population,\" Burtless said.\nIt\u2019s possible to use a variant on our previous metric \u2014 GDP growth per capita \u2014 that lessens this problem. Here\u2019s what that measurement looks like:\n\nUsing this measurement, Obama exceeded Clinton\u2019s worst annual performance during four years (2010, 2012, 2014, 2015).\nIn other words, while Clinton still did better overall when population growth is taken into account, the Obama administration had a better experience using this metric than is implied by Gingrich's statement, Burtless said.\nGingrich\u2019s office did not reply to an inquiry.\nOur ruling\nGingrich said that in economic growth, \"Obama's best year was slower than Bill Clinton's worst year.\"\nMeasured by the annual change in inflation-adjusted GDP -- the typical measurement -- Gingrich is correct. But it\u2019s worth noting that if you strip out the impact of population growth, the Clinton-Obama comparison is more mixed.
