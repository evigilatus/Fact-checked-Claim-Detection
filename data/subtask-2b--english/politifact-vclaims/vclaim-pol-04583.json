And given a fair shot, given a fair chance, Americans have never ever ever let their country down.\"\nDoes American have the most productive workers? Not quite. We checked the numbers and found that we rank third, not first.\nProductivity is a measure of how much value comes out of each hour worked. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development tracks the performance of the world\u2019s higher income nations.\nWhen the OECD compares the GDP per hour worked across 47 countries (using dollars corrected for inflation and the purchasing power in each nation), it consistently reports that Luxembourg and Norway have more productive workers than the United States.\nThis table shows the top six countries since 2010.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n2010\n\n\n2011\n\n\n2012\n\n\n2013\n\n\n2014\n\n\n2015\n\n\n\n\nLuxembourg\n\n\n78.4\n\n\n78.2\n\n\n76\n\n\n78.4\n\n\n79.3\n\n\n81.2\n\n\n\n\nNorway\n\n\n77.8\n\n\n77.2\n\n\n77.8\n\n\n78.3\n\n\n78.9\n\n\n79.7\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n61.9\n\n\n62.1\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n62.2\n\n\n62.2\n\n\n62.4\n\n\n..\n\n\n\n\nBelgium\n\n\n61.8\n\n\n61.6\n\n\n61.4\n\n\n61.7\n\n\n62.2\n\n\n..\n\n\n\n\nIreland\n\n\n58.2\n\n\n60.7\n\n\n61\n\n\n60.2\n\n\n62\n\n\n..\n\n\n\n\nNetherlands\n\n\n59.6\n\n\n60.1\n\n\n59.9\n\n\n60.1\n\n\n60.6\n\n\n61.3\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor 2014, the most recent year for which we have complete data, America ranks third, as it has since 2010. For each hour worked in Luxembourg, that country gains $79.30. In Norway, the amount is $78.90. In the United States, the value is $62.40.\nWe reached out to Biden\u2019s press office and were told that when he\u2019s made this comparison before, he has referred to other larger economies, which means the United States ranks first. He left out that qualification this time.\nOur ruling\nBiden said that America has the most productive workers in the world. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development tracks how much value comes out of each hour worked in the world\u2019s higher income nations.\nAccording to its data, Luxembourg and Norway have more productive workers than America. That ranking has been in place since 2010.\nThird is not first. But to place in the top three out of the world\u2019s 47 most wealthy nations is still an achievement.\nBiden is wrong on the details, but the general point is correct.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5d0250d7-ca8f-4047-a1c8-e49b4fa67a73", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04583"}
