And what about those 1,000 jobs?\n\nA review of county records shows these are boom times at Mitchell -- thanks to consolidations and convulsions in the airline business. Airlines are adding flights to and from the airport and \u00a0more passengers are coming through the gates.\n\nIn July 2010, the airport set a single-month record with 928,497 passengers, the 11th consecutive month of record passenger growth.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2010, the airport handled 2,192,859 passengers -- a 35.3 percent increase over the first quarter of 2009.\n\nThat first quarter performance put MKE near the top of an international list.\n\nAccording to Airports Council International, an industry group, Mitchell\u2019s year-over-year passenger growth was the world\u2019s fourth largest, behind Istanbul, Turkey; Phuket, Thailand; and Moscow.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilwaukee was the only U.S. airport in the top 30 list.\n\nSo what is going on at Mitchell, and is Walker right to claim county credit for it?\n\nIt\u2019s simple, according to aviation consultant Michael Boyd, of Boyd Group International in Evergreen, Colo.: Three airlines -- AirTran Airways, Southwest and Republic -- are \"trying to kill each other.\"\n\n\"It has nothing to do with county government,\" Boyd said. \"It has to do with airline economics.\"\n\nAfter the former owner of Midwest Airlines slashed the number of flights by 40 percent and cut hundreds of jobs, the others moved in on the business.\n\nAirTran established a second national hub at Mitchell, increasing departures from 18 to 47 in the past year. Southwest began service in November 2009, adding 10 departures. And Republic, the new owner of Midwest (now operating as Frontier Airlines), began restoring service. It now has 90 flights a day, five less than what Midwest offered a year ago.\n\nSo the airport is leading the nation in passenger growth -- in part because it is working its way back up of the decline that came when Midwest cut its flights.\n\nBut what about the \"nearly 1,000 new private sector jobs\"?\n\nNo one counts \"airport\" jobs. Not the state, county or the Metropolitan Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce, which compiles area employment reports each month.\n\nWhen asked for documentation, the Walker campaign responded with three clippings -- one each from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (\"Republic Airways to add up to 800 jobs here\"), BizTimes.com (\"Southwest Airlines to begin with 12 flights out of Milwaukee\") and WISN.com (\"AirTran Brings More Jobs to Milwaukee\"). Tallied together, they covered 940 new jobs.\n\nThe clips were all from 2009, so we contacted the airlines for fresh information.\n\nRepublic said it has added 500 jobs. AirTran said it added 100. Southwest added 41. That\u2019s about 640 jobs -- far short of those promised of the 940 promised , though AirTran and Republic have said they plan to continue to add jobs into next year.\n\nOf course, the new jobs come against the backdrop of lost jobs, as Midwest struggled to stay afloat. The airline cut 2,600 jobs nationwide between early 2008 and the fall of 2009. In Wisconsin, Midwest notified the state of plans to lay off 1,600 workers -- 1,379 in 2008 and 234 in 2009.\n\nThe other airlines will, no doubt, hire some of those laid-off workers. But employment remains far short of where it was before Midwest\u2019s fall.\n\nSo, let\u2019s see if Walker\u2019s statement flies.\n\nWhen it comes to growth in passenger count, Mitchell International Airport is leading the nation -- though much of that is through regaining traffic that had been lost in recent years. Experts note this is due to an airline battle, more so than any direct action by Walker or the county. On the jobs side, the new (and promised) jobs won\u2019t replace all the jobs that were lost. If they ultimately come through, Walker\u2019s election-night number of \u00a0\"nearly 1,000\" may be on target, but for now that portion of his claim can be marked \"Flight delayed.\"\n\nWe rate Walker\u2019s statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14369"}
