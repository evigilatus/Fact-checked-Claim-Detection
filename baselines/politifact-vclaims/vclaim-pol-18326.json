But he never said those certificates would be contained in microchips going into people.\u00a0\nGates\u2019s interest in digital certificates may have also triggered false claims that he was pushing tracking bracelets and \"invisible tattoos\" to monitor Americans under lockdown.\nFauci, too, has spoken about digital certificates of immunity.\n\"You know, that\u2019s possible,\" Fauci told CNN when asked if he could imagine a time where Americans carried certificates of immunity. \"It\u2019s one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable people are and not. This is something that\u2019s being discussed. I think it might actually have some merit under certain circumstances.\"\nHowever, PolitiFact could find nothing to support the claim that Fauci said he wants every American microchipped.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18326"}
