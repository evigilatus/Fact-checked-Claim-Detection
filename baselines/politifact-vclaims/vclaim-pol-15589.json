They're not.", "text": "A chain e-mail claims that Congress has exempted itself from health care reform.\n\n\nThe e-mail appears to have been created shortly after President Barack Obama appeared in a forum on health care with Charlie Gibson of ABC News, an event that took place on June 24, 2009.\n\n\nIt has the subject line, \"The $64,000 Question.\" (For you young whippersnappers,\n\nThe $64,000 Question\n\nwas a popular game show that aired in the 1950s and revived in the 1970s as\n\nThe $128,000 Question\n\n.)\n\n\nHere's the text of the e-mail:\n\n\n\"Finally ... The $64,000 question was asked ... Yesterday on ABC TV (better known as the all Barack Channel) during the 'Network Special on Health Care' ... Obama was asked:\n\n\n\"'Mr. President, will you and your family give up your current health care program and join the new \"universal health care program\" that the rest of us will be on????' ... (Bet you already know the answer) ... There was a stoney silence as Obama ignored the question and chose not to answer it!!!\n\n\n\"In addition, a number of senators were asked the same question, and their response was ... 'We will think about it.' And they did. It was announced today on the news that the 'Kennedy Health Care Bill' was written into the new health care reform initiative ensuring that Congress will be 100 percent exempt!\n\n\n\"So, this great new health care plan that is good for you and I ... is not good enough for Obama, his family or Congress...?? We (the American public) need to stop this proposed debacle ASAP!!!! ... This is totally wrong!!!!!\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Personally, I can only accept a universal health care overhaul that extends to everyone ... Not just us lowly citizens ... While the Washington 'elite' keep right with their gold-plated health care coverage. If you agree please pass this on ... \"\n\n\nA reader sent us the e-mail and asked if it was true.\n\n\nTo start with, the e-mail seems to assume \u2014 though it doesn't say so explicitly \u2014 that the health care reform plan sends everyone into a new public plan. This is not the case.\n\n\nThe Democratic health care legislation under consideration in Congress leaves in place employer-provided health insurance for the vast majority of Americans. But people who work for small businesses, are self-employed or currently uninsured would be eligible for a separate system known as the health care exchange. It would offer a variety of plans, including a government-run plan that is known as the public option.\n\n\nMuch of the controversy about health care reform has surrounded the public option. Critics say it could create a large bureaucracy and would not provide coverage as good as private insurers, while supporters say it would stimulate competition for people in the exchange. People who receive health insurance coverage from large employers would not be eligible for the public option.\n\n\nMembers of Congress are offered insurance through their employer, which in this case is the federal government. They can purchase it through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan, which is offered to all federal employees. (We've written about\n\nthis plan\n\npreviously.) Under the plan, federal workers \u2014 and members of Congress \u2014 can choose from a variety of insurance plans just as people would in the new health care exchange.\n\n\nThere's nothing in the health care bills that exempts Congress from the same requirements as regular citizens. However, some Republicans have attempted to pass amendments that would require members of Congress to drop their current coverage and force them to enroll in the public option. Republicans have said it would prove to the American people that the public option is a good thing. But Democrats have largely voted against these amendments, as we've\n\nreported previously\n\n.\n\n\nBut the chain e-mail doesn't address this. Instead, it says members of Congress have somehow exempted themselves from reform, which is not correct. Under the bill, the lawmakers would continue to receive the same insurance they get now, just as most Americans would.\n\n\nMembers of Congress are treated like any other citizens under the terms of the bill. We rate the chain e-mail's statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15589"}
