Bill Nelson. But the Broward GOP also suffered the loss of two of their most prominent local Republicans: state Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff of Fort Lauderdale who lost after redistricting, and Sheriff Al Lamberti, who lost to Democrat Scott Israel. (They also had the blow of Fox News favorite U.S. Rep. Allen West moving out of Broward to the Treasure Coast and then losing.)\n\nRichard DeNapoli, chairman of the Broward Republican Executive Committee, or BREC, wrote a memo to the group listing accomplishments of the past year. Most of those accomplishments were nothing surprising, such as lining up volunteers and distributing thousands of Romney bumper stickers. But one accomplishment caught our eye:\n\n\"We had the liberal League of Women Voters Guide removed from the Broward Supervisor of Election's website.\"\n\nWe wanted to know, did the Broward GOP get the Broward Supervisor of Elections to remove a League of Women Voters guide from its website? And was that guide or is the League itself \"liberal\"?\n\nThe League of Women Voters guide\n\nFirst, some background on the Florida League of Women Voters 2012 voters guide. The guide had short biographical sections and statements submitted by Obama and Mitt Romney. It also included bio information on U.S. Senate candidates Democrat Nelson and Republican Connie Mack and questionnaire responses from Nelson. (Mack chose not to answer the questionnaire.) It included a section on the state Supreme Court justices seeking retention, as well as the state\u2019s constitution and a list of voter resources.\n\nThe longest section was about the 11 proposed state constitutional amendments. The guide included a synopsis of each amendment and a brief explanation about what a \"yes\" or \"no\" vote would mean.\n\nThe guide summarized conflicting viewpoints \u00a0-- for example about a question on public funding of abortion: \"Supporters say this amendment puts the state on even footing with the federal government. Opponents say it is a pre-emptive strike on a woman\u2019s right to make her own health care choices.\"\n\nThe guide didn\u2019t just include opposing viewpoints -- it included analysis, such as noting a \"yes\" vote on a question about the health care law would add language to the state\u2019s constitution that could be found unconstitutional.\n\n\"Amendment 1 is more of a political referendum than a meaningful change to our Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has upheld the federal government\u2019s right to impose the individual mandate, the legal standing of Amendment 1 is precarious,\" the guide said. \"The passage or defeat of Amendment 1 may have no practical implications other than to send a message that a majority of Florida\u2019s voters are either for or against the individual mandate.\"\n\nThe guide didn\u2019t endorse candidates or tell voters which way to vote on the amendments -- but the League did separately come out against the amendments.\n\nThe guide, funded in part by Wells Fargo and American Express, was developed in conjunction with experts including the Collins Center for Public Policy, said Deidre Macnab, president of the Florida League, in an interview with PolitiFact Florida.\n\nLeague members distributed the guides at events and public libraries. The League did not request that it be linked to on the Broward Supervisor of Elections website, Macnab said.\n\nThe voters guide on the Broward elections website\n\nDeNapoli said he learned the League\u2019s guide was linked to the Broward Supervisor of Elections homepage sometime near the beginning of October. DeNapoli said he called Mary Cooney, a spokeswoman for Broward Supervisor Brenda Snipes, to express his concern.\n\n\"As soon as you went to the Broward Supervisor of Elections home page it was glaringly right there,\" DeNapoli told PolitiFact Florida.\n\nDeNapoli said his goal was to get the guide off the home page: \"If they bury the link (to the League\u2019s website) way into the Supervisor of Elections website, that wasn\u2019t our main concern.\"\n\nWithin a day or two, the link was moved off the home page.\n\n\"I made a decision to remove the brochure from our website after several calls, one of which was from Mr. DeNapoli,\" Snipes told PolitiFact Florida in an email. She also heard from the conservative news website BizPac Review which reported on DeNapoli\u2019s efforts and then advocated removing the link from the website\u2019s voter education page.\n\nWhen we searched the supervisor\u2019s website on Nov. 27, we could only find the link to the guide if we typed \"League of Women Voters\" into the website\u2019s search engine.\n\nWas the League\u2019s voter guide liberal?\n\nSo BREC did get the supervisor of elections to move the voters guide to a less prominent spot on its website. But is it accurate to call the guide or the League itself \"liberal\"?\n\nThe national League of Women Voters was formed in 1920 from the movement to give women the right to vote, and it continues to advocate for voter education and participation. The Florida League formed in 1939 with the help of women in St. Petersburg and other cities.\n\n\"But being nonpartisan does not mean we lack opinions, or the willingness to express them. \u00a0Our opinions are formed after research, study and consensus,\" states the national League of Women Voters website. \"We are passionate advocates \u2013 both women and men \u2013 who work to influence policy on specific issues by speaking out and putting pressure on our elected leaders.\"\n\nThe national League has taken stances in favor of expanded early voting, backing the Affordable Care Act and calling on Obama to do more about climate change. The League also has a history of supporting abortion rights.\n\nWe asked DeNapoli for his evidence that the League or its guide was liberal. He said he found the guide\u2019s discussion of the amendments \"slanted\" and noted that the League separately came out against the amendments, and that the Republican Party of Florida supported the amendments (nearly all of them).\n\nMacnab said the League wasn\u2019t the only group to oppose the amendments -- the Hillsborough County Republican Party opposed the majority of them. Ultimately Florida voters rejected most of the amendments.\n\nMacnab said the League has been consistent in its support of certain issues, but the parties have changed their stances. \"We often get tagged with one name or another,\" she said. \"We see it as a pretty age-old political tactic to divert voters\u2019 attention.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Broward Republican Executive Committee claimed on its website that in 2012, \u00a0\"We had the liberal League of Women Voters Guide removed from the Broward Supervisor of Election's website.\"\n\nThe group\u2019s chairman did contact the Broward elections office to complain about the guide, \u00a0and the link was moved from the home page. It can now be found through a few clicks by using the search engine, but you have to know to look for it.\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult to say whether the League\u2019s voter guide or the League itself is \"liberal.\"\n\nSome of the national League\u2019s stances on issues -- in favor of more early voting, in favor of tackling climate change and supporting the health care law -- do dovetail with current liberal positions. The League officially considers itself nonpartisan and independent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the guide didn\u2019t endorse candidates and gave them an equal chance to respond.\n\nThe committee was mostly correct about getting the voters guide removed from the Broward website, but the guide wasn\u2019t clearly \"liberal.\" We rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09955"}
