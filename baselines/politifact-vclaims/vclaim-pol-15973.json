Barack Obama decided it was a good time to take a shot at Sen. John McCain on Social Security. McCain has, in the past, supported plans that would allow workers, if they want, to have a portion of their Social Security put into personal retirement accounts that allow investment in the stock market.\n\n\n\"And I\u2019ll protect Social Security, while John McCain wants to privatize it,\" Obama said in a speech in Daytona Beach, Fla., on Sept. 20, 2008. \"Without Social Security half of elderly women would be living in poverty\u00a0\u2014 half. But if my opponent had his way, the millions of Floridians who rely on it would\u2019ve had their Social Security tied up in the stock market this week. Millions would\u2019ve watched as the market tumbled and their nest egg disappeared before their eyes. Millions of families would\u2019ve been scrambling to figure out how to give their mothers and fathers, their grandmothers and grandfathers, the secure retirement that every American deserves. So I know Senator McCain is talking about a 'casino culture' on Wall Street\u00a0\u2014 but the fact is, he\u2019s the one who wants to gamble with your life savings.\"\n\n\nTo be sure, it was a volatile week on Wall Street. Down 504 points Monday; up 141 Tuesday; down again, 449 points Wednesday; then back up again 410 points Thursday; and up another 319 Friday.\n\n\nThe market ended up down just 34 points for the week. But whew, there was certainly a lot of angst.\n\n\nBut there are a couple problems with Obama\u2019s attack on McCain\u2019s plans for Social Security. First and foremost is that McCain hasn\u2019t actually laid out his plan for Social Security.\n\n\nIn July, McCain was asked it. \"I cannot tell you what I would do, except to put everything on the table,\" he told reporters. A few weeks later, he was asked about new taxes to shore up Social Security. \"There is nothing that\u2019s off the table. I have my positions, and I\u2019ll articulate them. But nothing\u2019s off the table,\" McCain said. \"I don\u2019t want tax increases. But that doesn\u2019t mean that anything is off the table.\"\n\n\nWe\u2019re still waiting to hear McCain articulate his positions.\n\n\n\"No one really knows what his plan is, including him,\" said John Rother, policy director at AARP. McCain\u2019s statements on Social Security so far have been \"too contradictory or too vague,\" to pin down, he said. To make any statements\u00a0about McCain\u2019s plan going forward would require a bit of mind-reading, Rother said.\n\n\nIn lieu of that, we think it\u2019s fair for Obama to take aim at McCain\u2019s previous support for personal retirement accounts.\n\n\nIn 1998, McCain voted in favor of a budget amendment to express \"the sense of Senate\" that any budget surplus should be used to reduce Social Security payroll tax and to establish personal retirement accounts. The vote\u00a0\u2014 50-48 in favor\u00a0\u2014 largely came down along partisan lines.\n\n\nAnd in 2005, McCain supported President George W. Bush\u2019s push to allow workers to divert a portion of the program\u2019s payroll taxes to personal investment accounts. McCain supported Bush\u2019s plan, going so far as to accompany the president on a series of town hall meetings in March 2005. The plan fizzled, though, and the initiative went down as one of Bush\u2019s biggest defeats in domestic policy.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcCain has since modified his stance.\n\n\nWhen we\n\nwrote\n\nabout McCain\u2019s plan back in April, McCain\u2019s campaign Web site stated that McCain \"supports supplementing the current Social Security system with personal accounts\u00a0\u2014 but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept. John McCain will reach across the aisle, but if the Democrats do not act, he will.\" That\u2019s no longer on the Web site, and the McCain campaign did not respond to an e-mail seeking to clarify his position on Social Security.\n\n\nWe\u2019re not inclined to give McCain a pass just because he has failed to articulate his plan. But Obama\u2019s statement is misleading, even when judged against McCain\u2019s earlier support for Bush\u2019s plan.\n\n\nFirst, Obama seems to be suggesting that today\u2019s retirees would have had their Social Security tied up in the volatile stock market this week.\n\n\nThe Bush plan for personal investment accounts would not have applied to those retirees currently getting Social Security. No one born before 1950 would have been eligible to participate in the investment plan; so only people 58 or younger.\n\n\nMcCain stressed that point in a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on June 12, 2008.\n\n\n\"I will not privatize Social Security, and it\u2019s not true when I\u2019m accused of that,\" McCain said. \"But I would like for younger workers, younger workers only, to have an opportunity to take a few of their tax dollars, and maybe put it into an account with their name on it. That\u2019s their money. ... And we will make sure that present-day retirees, I will commit, have the benefits that they have earned.\"\n\n\nWe also think Obama may have been guilty of using some scare tactics here. For one, participation in the Bush program would have been entirely voluntary. Second, without signing a waiver, upon turning 47, the accounts would have been invested in a \"life cycle portfolio,\" shifting from higher risk growth funds to secure bonds as people neared retirement (and thereby protecting near-retirees from sudden market swings).\n\n\nAnd last, people would have been able to set aside in their investment accounts only up to 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes\u00a0(currently\u00a012.4 percent), so only a little over a quarter of one\u2019s Social Security taxes could have been invested. In short, it would have been impossible to see one\u2019s entire nest egg disappear in a down market. And people would have been allowed to choose only from a small number of diversified index funds, preventing people from putting large portions of their retirement savings in just a few stocks.\n\n\nObama spokesman Tommy Vietor told PolitiFact that Obama wasn\u2019t necessarily talking about current retirees.\n\n\n\"You don\u2019t have to be retired to rely on Social Security,\" Vietor said. \"Millions of people who will one day retire rely on Social Security as they plan their futures. Senator Obama\u2019s bottom line is absolutely true. If McCain got his way and we had private accounts (a position he started articulating as early as 1998), people who are relying on that money for their retirement would be in a very difficult situation.\"\n\n\nThere is a legitimate point to be made that to the extent that a person's Social Security plan is tied up in investment accounts, it is certainly subject to the vagaries of the stock market. But we are of the opinion that when Obama talked about \"the millions of Floridians who rely on it\" he was talking about\u00a0current retirees.\n\n\nWhile McCain has remained vague about his plans for Social Security, he has never expressed support for a plan that would allow current retirees to invest a portion of their Social Security in stocks, and neither did the Bush plan McCain once backed.
