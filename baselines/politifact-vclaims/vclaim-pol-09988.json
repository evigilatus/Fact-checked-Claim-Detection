The website was updated that evening. It now reads: \"In 2011, our public lottery funded classrooms & other services by over $930 million.\"\n\nStill, Hahn said that didn\u2019t change the fundamental issue that the proposal is bad for businesses and taxpayers.\n\nThe history of privatization in New Jersey is a \"story of graft, fraud and cronyism leading to taxpayers being on the hook for political indiscretion,\" he said. \"We believe that when it comes to funding education, care for the developmentally disabled, and services for our veterans, New Jerseyans deserve better.\"\n\nBill Quinn, a spokesman for the state Treasury Department, said the implication that the state is selling the lottery is false. He said a state agency \"will still have an oversight function\" and \"the state is going to continue to get the money from the lottery.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nBig Gamble NJ -- an advocacy group that opposes privatizing management of the state lottery -- said on its website that \u00a0\"in 2011, our state-run lottery funded New Jersey classrooms by over $930 million.\"\n\nThe lottery funneled $930 million into education and other social services in fiscal year 2011. Nearly three quarters of that amount funded education-related initiatives.\n\nSo New Jersey\u2019s classroom didn\u2019t receive the full $930 million from the state lottery, but education aid comprised a significant majority of that money.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09988"}
