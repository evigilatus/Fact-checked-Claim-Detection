No Republicans are running for the office. Two Democrats are running this spring and will face any third party opposition in the fall. So far it\u2019s been a low-profile contest.\n\nBut the candidates, Ellen Rosenblum and Dwight Holton, have traded several barbs. Holton, for example, says that Rosenblum has repeatedly claimed that the job of being the state\u2019s top prosecutor is mostly being a government attorney, and not an advocate.\n\n\"She has said over and over again that this is a job where 80 percent of the job is being the government\u2019s lawyer. I just don\u2019t believe that. This is the Oregon Department of Justice and I take that word justice very seriously,\" Holton said in a radio interview with 1190 KEX.\n\nApparently Holton means it in a negative way and the Rosenblum camp takes it as such. \"What Dwight is doing over and over is using that 80 percent number to inaccurately portray her as a candidate that doesn't understand the role and is just a bureaucrat,\" says Cynara Lilly, spokeswoman for the Rosenblum campaign.\n\nA campaign barb under protest is fair game for PolitiFact Oregon. Did Rosenblum say it? Over and over? And what was the context in which she made the statement?\n\nThe Holton camp helpfully directed us to a radio interview Rosenblum conducted in January, with 620 KPOJ. The host asked her to explain the job of attorney general to audience members unfamiliar with the role.\n\n\"Well I think a lot of people don\u2019t realize that about 80 percent of the work of the attorney general is representing the government agencies, and which in essence means representing the governor \u2026\" she said in response.\n\nRosenblum repeats the figure one more in that interview. And in response to a question on how she might distinguish herself from current Attorney General John Kroger, she said, \"I would definitely want to focus on the highest quality of the advice that we give to the government agencies.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no question Rosenblum made the point more than once. She may have repeated the figure elsewhere, as Holton\u2019s people suggest although Rosenblum\u2019s people deny that. (However, Rosenblum and her spokeswoman also denied she said it in the first place, and that is inaccurate.)\n\nStill, here\u2019s the part that really trips us up.\n\nIn that same January interview, Rosenblum talked about what she would emphasize, that the public may not know: Consumer protection, financial fraud, helping district attorneys, environmental protection, small businesses, and fighting for workers, children, families. In that way, she hit the same notes as Holton.\n\n\"The attorney general also is involved in so many areas and those that I would emphasize would include child advocacy,\" she said about two minutes in. \"I don\u2019t think a lot of people realize that about 300 employees of the attorney general\u2019s office collect child support for those who are in arrears or on behalf of those whose exes or whoever have not kept up with their payments .\"\n\nWe raised the issue with the Holton campaign. Is it fair to cherry-pick one statement to pound the point that the opponent has acknowledged the job is being the state\u2019s lawyer, which it is?\n\"What we're talking about here is the difference in the vision of the job of attorney general,\" said Jillian Schoene, a Holton spokeswoman.\n\nSchoene passed along this comment from her boss: \"Providing excellent legal advice is a core mission -- but in my view, if that is all you do, you've failed -- because the attorney general ought to go to work each day to fight for families, not just answer the phone and provide legal advice,\" he said.\n\u00a0\nBut that\u2019s clearly not what Rosenblum has said or is saying. She\u2019s not saying that\u2019s all she\u2019ll do.\n\nHolton\u2019s statement is partially accurate in that Rosenblum did describe the job of attorney general as 80 percent government work.\n\nBut there are important details missing: She said in the same interview that she would advocate on behalf of children, consumers, the environment and small businesses. We also think it would be impossible for Holton to wiggle out of representing state government if he is elected.\n\nWe find Holton\u2019s statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.
