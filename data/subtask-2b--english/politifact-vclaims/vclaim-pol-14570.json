The plan also proposes longer license suspensions, including a new type of suspension that would still allow offenders to drive to work.\n\nThen Archambault recalled seeing statistics suggesting that 4 out of 10 fatal accidents in Rhode Island involved alcohol. \"We shouldn't be at the top of the country for alcohol-related fatalities,\" he said.\n\nBut is Rhode Island really the worst in the country for DWI fatalities? \n\nWe asked the Archambault campaign for the source of its numbers. They referred us to a 2009 report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's National Center for Statistics and Analysis.\n\nIt turns out that Rhode Island is not number one, but we're up there.\n\nFor 2008, the latest year for which statistics are available, the state ranked 5th out of the 50 states when it came to motor vehicle fatalities in which a driver was at the legal limit of .08 or higher.\n\nThirty-eight percent of our 69 driving fatalities that year involved someone who was drunk. That's very close to the 4 out of 10 cited by Archambault. Only Hawaii (39 percent), Montana (40 percent), Wyoming (42 percent) and North Dakota (46 percent) had a worse record.\n\nApparently our ranking can bounce around. In 2007, Rhode Island was right at the national average of 32 percent, but that doesn't happen often. In 2005 we ranked 11th, and in 2006 we were 10th.\n\nBut in 2003 and 2004, we were ranked first in the nation in the percentage of fatalities related to alcohol.\n\nArchambault isn't completely correct about our ranking, unless you go back several years. Yet it's clear he did give an accurate assessment of the scope of the problem.\n\nWe'll give him a Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14570"}
