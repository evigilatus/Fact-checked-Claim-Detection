Democrats cheered and said he had the answers.\n\nThen came the spin typical of any major political event, whirling with facts and figures. \u00a0\n\nThe economy\u2019s better off since Obama took office, said U.S. Rep Hank Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat.\n\n\"Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent during the president\u2019s first year in office to 8.5 percent today,\" Johnson said in remarks posted on Patch.com\u2019s local news site for Stone Mountain-Redan.\n\nNo, the economy\u2019s worse, said U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, a Marietta Republican.\n\nThree years into Obama\u2019s presidency, \"2 million more Americans are out of work,\" Gingrey said in a news release posted on Rome Newswire, an online news site covering the Rome area. \u00a0\n\nCan these both be true? Is it possible for unemployment to drop as the ranks of people who are out of work grow?\n\nBecause of this conundrum, we\u2019ll depart from our usual Truth-O-Meter format and do a special doubleheader. We\u2019ll check both stats and tell you whether one of them is wrong or whether it\u2019s possible for both to be correct.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s consider Johnson\u2019s unemployment statistic.\n\nIn January 2009, when Obama was inaugurated, unemployment stood at 7.8 percent. It peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, eight months later. \u00a0\n\nIn December 2011, the rate stood at 8.5 percent.\n\nJohnson\u2019s numbers are accurate, but he runs into trouble when he said that \"it is remarkable what President Obama has achieved in his first three years.\"\n\nLabor economists have repeatedly told PolitiFact that it\u2019s hard for any political leader to take credit or blame for something as complicated as the economy.\n\nJohnson spokesman Andrew Phelan offered proof to bolster the congressman\u2019s claim that Obama deserves credit for lower unemployment. He cited a November report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which reviews bills that will have an impact on the federal budget. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the stimulus legislation \u00a0that Obama backed, lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.2 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points during the third quarter of 2011, the office determined.\n\nPhelan also cited a 2010 report by a Princeton professor and the chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics saying the Recovery Act and monetary policy reduced unemployment.\n\nStill, other factors are at play. For this reason, Johnson\u2019s statement earns a Half True.\n\nNow on to Gingrey\u2019s statement, where he says \"2 million more Americans are out of work.\"\n\nGingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber pointed us to a July check by our PolitiFact Ohio colleagues. It analyzed a television ad by the Republican National Committee criticizing Obama\u2019s economic policies.\n\nSince he took office, it said, \"2 million jobs. Gone.\"\n\nPolitiFact Ohio found that the drop in employment was actually more severe than the ad said. The economy lost 2.5 million jobs between January 2009 and May 2011, according to employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks employment and other economic data.\n\nBut the ad was missing a crucial piece of context. It neglected to mention that the economy gained 1 million jobs in the year before the ad came out. PolitiFact Ohio gave the claim a Mostly True.\n\nSix months have passed since PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s story ran, so we checked the latest employment statistics to see whether the figures were still correct.\n\nWe found that the country\u2019s employment outlook is sunnier.\n\nIn December, there were nearly 132 million nonfarm employees in the U.S., down 1.66 million from January 2009. This means that Gingrey\u2019s 2 million figure is some 20 percent too high.\n\nWe found a few other problems with Gingrey\u2019s use of employment data.\n\nWhen the economy loses nonfarm jobs, it does not mean that \"2 million more Americans are out of work,\" as Gingrey said. The Bureau of Labor Statistics did not design this metric to measure how many people have become unemployed.\n\nIt\u2019s likely many did get laid off. But others might have chosen to return to school, become stay-at-home parents or leave the workforce for any number of other reasons.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that while payrolls have declined since January 2009, they\u2019ve been rising since October 2010, according to BLS data. \u00a0\n\nBecause Gingrey\u2019s claim cherry-picks unflattering data and his numbers could use some freshening up, we rate his statement Half True.\n\nNow we come to the larger issue at hand. Gingrey and Johnson used valid data to give opposite impressions of the state of the economy. Their interpretations had some shortcomings but weren\u2019t wholly incorrect.\n\nSo how is this possible? Can unemployment decline under Obama if payrolls shrank?\n\nYes. The reason is that Gingrey and Johnson used data from different time periods.\n\nGingrey chose to consider nonfarm payroll numbers starting in winter 2009, while Johnson started his unemployment count in October 2009.\n\nThe economy didn\u2019t post its worst numbers until the latter half of 2009.\n\nBetween January 2009 and December 2011, the economy lost jobs. Nonfarm payrolls decreased by some 1.7 million jobs. As you\u2019d expect, unemployment increased during the same time period from 7.8 percent to 8.5 percent.\n\nBut from October 2009 to December 2011, the economy gained jobs. Nonfarm payrolls actually rose by about 2.4 million. Unemployment dropped from 10 percent to 8.5 percent. \u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s easy to cherry-pick data that give opposite impressions of the nation\u2019s economic health. With statistics, the devil\u2019s in the details.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11677"}
