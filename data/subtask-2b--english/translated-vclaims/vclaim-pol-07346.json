The Republic of Texas, a potential presidential candidate for 2016, recently told a WFAA-TV reporter, Channel 8 in Dallas, that the Islamic State Group, in news of many acts including the killing of two American journalists, \"Now the hardening of Christians in Iraq, Shocks as in killing someone by nailing or tying his hands or feet to the cross or, as Cruz said, a tree? Cruise, news stories do not provide any evidence that we wrote Cruz's office about how he knew the steel and we didn't get any evidence in the answer. Our research has not revealed news stories confirming a Christian cross in Iraq or elsewhere, while American supporters and experts in the bloody conflicts in Iraq and Syria have expressed a lack of knowledge of these acts. But Christians, along with the followers of other religions, were in an exchange of fire in the conflicts in Iraq and Syria. On 8 August 2014, CNN reported that the largest Christian city in Iraq had been invaded by ISIL, resulting in thousands of Christians fleeing the city, just as other ISIL minority groups, as well as Shia Muslims, had done. CNN said that the French Government had confirmed that the Iraqi city of Karkush had been in the hands of ISIS. According to the story, ISIL seized Mosul, another city in Iraq, earlier, causing many residents to flee to Karkush. In Mosul, CNN said, ISIS issued a warning to Christians living there: converting to Islam, paying a fine or confronting \"death by sword.\" The story of CNN indicated that on Twitter 8 August 2014, the Pope said: \"I ask all men and women of goodwill to join me in prayer for Iraqi Christians and for all vulnerable populations.\" A few weeks later, CNN described the young boys trained by ISIL in a camp in Syria, according to a participant who was only known as Muhammad, a cross witness. According to the news story of 29 August 2014, some boys were forced to watch hideous objects. \"They brought the young (children) to the camp to beat them,\" said Muhammad. \"When we go to the mosque, they order us to come the next day at a specific time and place to [watch] the cutting of heads, the skin or the stoning.\" \"We saw a young man who didn't fast on Ramadan, sacked him for three days, and saw a woman stoned (to death) because she committed adultery,\" Muhammad said. On January 22, 2021, Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen mentioned an article on Facebook in which the Paiden administration said that she was a liberal terrorist. \u2022 January 22, 2012: Experts: Possible crucibles, not yet noticed by close observers of the disturbances in Iraq and Syria, who said that they could imagine ISIS being crucified. No one expressed an awareness of Christians who had already been crucified. By e-mail, Daniel Sullivan of a group based in Washington, D.C., united to end the genocide, referred to CNN's story before telling us that he had not seen \"confirm reports in Iraq or Syria\" of Christians who had been crucified. Joshua Landis, Director of the Centre for Middle East Studies at Oklahoma University, said that Cruz &apos; s claim had crossed the border, to his knowledge, although he said that ISIL was ruthless for harming or killing the resistance population. \"There were people put on crosses,\" said Landis. But he's not a Christian. We led Landis to April 29, 2014, Fox News with photographs of men hanging on crosses in Raqqah, a town in northern Syria. The story stated that the Syrian opposition group Raqqah was being massacred silently, saying that Jihadi ISIL was hanging the bodies of enemies executed along the lines of the cross cross in the city. The story, citing \"multiple reports,\" states that the Islamic State ruled Raqqah last year, killed the rest of the rebel population and destroyed the national monuments. According to the news, Ibrahim al-Raqawi of the opposition group said that the dead were rebels who had previously been fighting against the Syrian government of Bashir al-Assad. According to the story, ISIL accused the seven men of spying and attempting to assassinate the leaders of the group. According to the story, he saw the executions himself and took photographs, which were then posted on the group &apos; s Facebook page and circulated on the Internet. The photographs showed different men bound to cross what appears to be a general square area, although the Fox News story said that it could not be independently asserted that people had died or, if they were, by any means carried out the executions. \"Photograms show no clear signs of nailed men to the cross, and there are no clear signs, clear, of fatal wounds,\" he told the story. He also referred to an online article on 26 February 2014 by Ayman Javad Tamimi, a student at the University of Oxford, describing a traditional practice in Islam for Jews or Christians living under the authority of an Islamic State who agreed to pay jezia, or a polling tax, in exchange for protection from the State. On 26 February 2014, the article, on a website dedicated to Syrian politics, history and religion, Landis, said that the tax was equivalent to extortion of the mafia; non-payment led to a loss of protection. Similarly, ISIL imposes the above-mentioned tax in northern Iraq and Syria. By telephone, Jeffrey White, a defence colleague at the Washington Institute of Military and Security Affairs for the Levant and Iran, told us that he was watching videos from Iraq and Syria and was familiar with the practice of ISIS in Syria to hang a body from a post-murder site. (This is not as solid as this work is usually defined.) But, Wyatt said, he didn't see videos of one nail on a tree - in Iraq or elsewhere. Wyatt said Cruz's claim \"is not consistent with what I saw.\" Our reign, Cruz, said that ISIL is now crucified for Christians in Iraq, literally nailing Christians to trees. Earlier this year, ISIL hanged the bodies of individuals who had already been executed at similar sites in the town of Syria. We didn't confirm the ISIL cross to Christians in Iraq, and Cruz didn't give realistic support. We value this allegation wrong. - The statement is not accurate.
