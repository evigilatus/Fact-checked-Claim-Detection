The website includes a video clip of a speech Gonzalez gave at a rally in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She says:\n\"Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should not have ostracized him, you didn\u2019t know this kid. Okay? We did.\"\nIn reality, Gonzalez was responding to a tweet from President Donald Trump that implied people should have been more active in reporting the shooter\u2019s disturbing behavior before people died. The full video clip showed Gonzalez talking about the shooter being mentally disturbed, but she never made any claims about bullying him.\nHere is Gonzalez\u2019s comment in full context:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is one tweet I would like to call attention to. \u2018So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities again and again.\u2019 We did, time and time again. Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him, you didn't know this kid. Okay, we did. We know that they are claiming mental health issues, and I am not a psychologist, but we need to pay attention to the fact that this was not just a mental health issue. He would not have harmed that many students with a knife.\"\nWe found no other evidence to suggest that Gonzalez bullied Cruz.\nThe article then refers to a tweet Gonzalez retweeted on March 27. The tweet from user @edennnnnn said:\n\"If bullying caused school shootings, you would see trans shooters, queer shooters, female shooters, POC shooters. Bullying does not cause school shootings; entitlement does. And white boys are the most entitled demographic by far.\"\nProject Republic described Gonzalez\u2019s retweet as sentiment to blaming \"white boys\u2019 entitlement\" as the cause of all school shootings. But the tweet isn\u2019t that specific in blaming all school shootings on entitlement.\nProject Republic has no evidence to show that Gonzalez bullied Cruz; she didn\u2019t admit; and the retweet doesn\u2019t say what Project Republic said.\nWe rate the statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-03-30 15:02:06 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Emma Gonzalez bullied school shooter, isn\u2019t sorry; then retweets message blaming \u2018white boys\u2019 entitlement\u2019 as cause of all school shootings\"    Project Republic a website https://www.projectrepublictoday.com/2018/03/28/emma-gonzalez-bullied-school-shooter-isnt-sorry-then-retweets-message-blaming-white-boys-entitlement-as-cause-of-all-school-shootings/   an article Wednesday, March 28, 2018 2018-03-28    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02246"}
