Ron Johnson says", "text": "It used to be that college students joked about being on \"the five-year plan\" in their quest to earn a four-year degree.\nNowadays, according to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, you can add another year.\nIn a July 17, 2013 interview with Politico, the Wisconsin Republican made a critique that could be summarized like this:\nYoung people are made to think that the only path to success is a four-year degree. They have been \"enticed\u2019 to take on large debt because subsidies limit interest rates on student loans.\nThe availability of loans and grants has led to increases in the cost of higher education.\n\"And so we have, in all of our good intentions,\" Johnson said, \"we\u2019ve actually made college less accessible because we\u2019ve made it so unaffordable and we\u2019ve plunged our children into debt.\"\nThen he made this claim:\n\"And also by giving them this easy debt, on average, kids are taking six years to get a four-year degree, while that debt meter is increasing.\"\nWith the start of school right around the corner, we wondered whether it's really taking an average of six years to get from high school diploma to bachelor's degree.\nGetting our bearings\nJohnson\u2019s staff didn\u2019t follow through on a promise to send us evidence to back his claim. But let\u2019s note a couple of things for we evaluate it.\nJohnson spoke of \"kids.\"\nSo, it\u2019s fair to say his six-year claim applies to students who start college shortly after finishing high school, rather than adults who pursue a degree later in life, perhaps over many years.\nHe also used the phrase \"on average.\" That number, of course, is stretched by students who don\u2019t take just four or six years, but much longer to finish their degree.\nThat means there\u2019s some value in also looking at how long it takes for a typical student to get a B.A. or B.S.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverages\nWe examined the latest U.S. Department of Education statistics that include averages in measuring the time it takes to get a bachelor\u2019s degree. We also discussed them with department statistician Aurora D\u2019Amico.\nThose statistics, which cover students who earned their first four-year degree during the 2007-2008 school year, cast a pretty wide net. They include part-time as well as full-time students; students who started their college studies at a two-year or a four-year institution; and students who were not seeking a degree of any type when they initially entered college.\nFor that relatively broad collection of students, the average time to get their bachelor\u2019s degree was six years and four months -- even higher than what Johnson claimed.\nThe time was shorter -- five years and 10 months -- for students who began college within a year of finishing high school; those are arguably the \"kids\" Johnson was referring to.\nAnd for students who started their college studies at a four-year institution, rather than a two-year school, the average was five years and eight months.\nSo, those are the averages, all of which are in the ballpark of Johnson\u2019s six-year claim.\nOther measures\nThe Department of Education study also provided figures that aren\u2019t averages, notably this one: 44 percent of the students who got their degrees in 2007-2008 did so within four years.\nThat compares to 23 percent who needed five or six years (and 33 percent who took more than six years).\nSo, it is more common to earn a four-year degree in four years than it is in five to six years.\nAnother recent Department of Education study, reviewing a narrower group of students, found similar results. It covered first-time, full-time students who entered four-year institution in fall 2005 aiming to obtain a bachelor\u2019s degree.\nIn this group, 39 percent got their four-year degree within four years; 59 percent graduated within six years.\nOur rating\nJohnson said that on average, college students \"are taking six years to get a four-year degree.\"\nIt\u2019s more common for students to take four years to graduate than it is for them to take six years. But overall, the average duration is about six years.\nOur definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs additional information. That\u2019s how we rate this one.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09001"}
