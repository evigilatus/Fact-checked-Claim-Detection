No act of gun violence is acceptable. I'm in close communication with law enforcement officials and will be returning to Tallahassee tonight,\" Gillum tweeted Friday night.\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe blog post does little to justify its misleading headline and lead paragraph.\nThe Grio article doesn\u2019t cite any source for Gillum\u2019s announcement to suspend his campaign \"indefinitely,\" but does outline what took place during Friday\u2019s shooting where Scott Paul Beierle killed two people and wounded five in a yoga studio in Tallahassee before killing himself, according to the Guardian.\nThe Grio post notes that the gunman \"reportedly had a history of arrests for grabbing women,\" and links to a USA Today article published Nov. 3 that digs into Beierle\u2019s background. Emails sent to The Grio Saturday all bounced back. An email sent to the author of the article and messages sent to Gillum\u2019s campaign were not immediately returned.\nGillum\u2019s tweet from Friday is quoted in the article, along with remarks the Tallahassee Democrat reported he made near where the shooting occurred.\nThe Grio\u2019s post is similar to the Nov. 2 New York Daily News article with the headline, \"Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum suspends campaign after 2 dead in Tallahassee shooting.\"\nThe Guardian wrote in its Nov. 3 article that Gillum \"tweeted that he was leaving the campaign trail to return to Tallahassee.\" However, there\u2019s no evidence that Gillum is \"indefinitely suspending his campaign for governor\" following Friday\u2019s shooting like The Grio\u2019s post claims.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, Gillum is still campaigning.\nOn Saturday afternoon, Palm Beach Post political reporter George Bennett tweeted photos of Gillum at a Jimmy Buffett concert being held to garner support for Gillum and Sen. Bill Nelson. The concert in West Palm Beach was being held \"to rally voters before Election Day on Tuesday,\" according to a Nov. 1 Miami Herald article announcing the concert.\nBennett tweeted pictures of Gillum with Norman Lear and Nelson, noting that both Gillum and Nelson \"went with the khaki/blue shirt combo\" for the rally.\nGillum also retweeted Bay News 9 and News 13 Florida capitol reporter Troy Kinsey\u2019s Nov. 3 tweet that showed Gillum onstage speaking to the crowd in West Palm Beach.\nSimilarly, the Orlando Sentinel reported Nov. 2 that Gillum was scheduled to join other politicians and celebrities at the University of Central Florida to rally students Saturday.\nIn campaign press releases sent Saturday, Gillum\u2019s campaign said campaign events would be taking place throughout the day.\n\"On Saturday, November 3, the Gillum for Governor \u2018Bring It Home\u2019 bus tour will continue with stops across South and Central Florida. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam will campaign for Mayor Gillum in Lake Worth, followed by a \"Get Out the Vote\" event at UCF and concluding the day at a Jimmy Buffett GOTV concert in West Palm Beach,\" a campaign email sent at 12:06 a.m. on Nov. 3 said.\nAccording to the email, Gillum was scheduled to speak in both Orlando and West Palm Beach Saturday. Gillum\u2019s campaign also touted endorsements from politicians and sent out notices about more campaign events in additional emails Saturday.\nA Nov. 3 Spectrum News 13 story also showed what Gillum was up to Saturday, with time stamped updates.\nOur Ruling\nA post from The Grio claimed that Gillum is \"indefinitely suspending his campaign for governor in light of a fatal shooting in Tallahassee at a yoga studio on Friday.\" While Gillum did leave the campaign trail to return to Tallahassee and met with some of the victims, he is not ending his campaign for governor because of the shooting.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01315"}
