The Democrat has never lost an election. Yet, in his bid for a fourth Senate term, against first-time candidate Republican Ron Johnson, Feingold is positioning himself as the underdog.\n\nTo be sure, the latest Federal Election Commission reports -- for spending from Jan. 1 through Aug. 25 -- show Johnson outspent Feingold $4.55 million to $4.28 million. Feingold says Johnson, a multi-millionaire Oshkosh businessman, may wind up running the most expensive campaign in state history.\n\nWe won\u2019t be able to tally that up until after the election.\n\nBut what about this claim by Feingold: \"I've been outspent by my opponents every time I've run for U.S. Senate.\"\n\nFeingold has made the statement, or a variation of it, many times: In TV interviews on the night of the Sept. 14 primary, in a magazine interview, in an e-mail solicitation to supporters, in a blog post on his campaign website and on \"The Ed Show\" on MSNBC.\n\nSo, is it true?\n\nThe claim seems pretty straightforward, one candidate versus another candidate in each of Feingold\u2019s three previous Senate campaigns. Indeed, when we asked the campaign to support Feingold\u2019s statement, senior adviser John Kraus pointed to spending by Feingold and his various opponents -- not spending by outside groups, which would complicate matters.\n\nBut here is the twist: Kraus said Feingold compares his campaign spending to the spending by all of the candidates in an election -- the Republican he faced head-to-head in each November contest, as well as major party candidates eliminated in the primary.\n\nCall it me-against-them math.\n\nFor instance, in Feingold\u2019s last election, he outspent GOP nominee Tim Michels by nearly $3.7 \u00a0million in the two-year period before the general election, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nBut Feingold tosses in what was spent by unsuccessful GOP primary candidates Russ Darrow and Robert Welch. By that measure, all of the GOP candidates spent $11.6 million -- more than the $9.24 million spent by Feingold alone.\n\nIt\u2019s a convenient argument, especially when you are using the \"outspent every time\" line in fund-raising appeals.\n\nBut it also confounds logic.\n\nMichels, Darrow and Welch all sought the Republican nomination in 2004 -- just as Feingold was part of a three-way battle when he won the seat in 1992.\n\nIn the 1992 race, FEC records show Feingold spent $1,979,488 -- the least among the other major candidates. In the Democratic primary, Feingold defeated Jim Moody who spent $2,828,211 and Joseph Checota, who spent $4,022,344.\n\nFeingold then defeated Bob Kasten, the Republican incumbent, who spent $5,427,163.\n\nUsing Feingold\u2019s me-vs-them math, everyone could say they were outspent. So is it possible that everyone spent the least and no one spent the most?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course not.\n\nMike McCabe, head of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks campaign spending and lobbies for public funding of campaigns, said the average voter would think of the opponent as the head-to-head matchup.\n\nSo let\u2019s line the general election candidates that way, with their spending in the two-year period before the election.\n\n\u00a0\n\n1992:\n\nKasten: $5,427,163\n\nFeingold: $1,979,488\n\n\u00a0\n\n1998:\n\nRepublican nominee Mark Neumann: $4,373,953\n\nFeingold: $3,846,089\n\n\n2004:\n\nFeingold: $9,239,908\n\nMichels: $5,542,087\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo Feingold was outspent twice, and in the third race spent nearly $3.7 million -- or about 67 percent -- more than his opponent. That\u2019s not close by anyone\u2019s math.\n\n(A footnote: While Johnson can tap his own wallet during the fall campaign, Feingold isn\u2019t cash-poor. The latest FEC reports show Feingold had $4.3 million on hand, more than four times the $940,642 listed for Johnson.)\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nIn positioning himself as an underdog, and seeking campaign money from donors, Feingold says he has always been outspent by his opponents. Though that is true in two races, he uses some twisted logic -- and math -- to get there on the third, tallying up spending by Republican primary candidates he never faced to obscure that he vastly outspent the one he did.\n\nOn Election Day, one Democrat faces one Republican. That\u2019s the choice for voters. And that\u2019s the approach we use. Tossing in the kitchen sink leads us to throw in a match.
