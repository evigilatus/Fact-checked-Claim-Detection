Central Park 5.", "text": "While President Donald Trump was aboard Marine One, a journalist asked about a brutal attack in New York Central Park 30 years ago. \"Mr. President, would you apologize to Central Park 5?\" April Ryan called on June 18 at the White House Park. \"They have been acquitted. There were videos and movies on the case, and she came out with the whole page saying they had to die, that they had to have the death penalty. Are you apologizing? \"Why are you asking this now?\" Trump said. \"It's an interesting time to mention it.\" \"There are movies and everything about them,\" said Ryan, head of the Washington Bureau of American Urban Broadcasting Networks. (The current Netflix series \"when they see us\" is dramatic for the case.) \"You have people on both sides of it,\" answered Trump. They confessed their guilt. If you look at Linda Vershstein, and if you look at some prosecutors, they believe that the city should not be settling that case. So we'll leave it at that.\" The statement by Trump that young adolescents known as Central Park five \"convicted\" distorted the record and ignored the main facts - something much more known now than in the weeks following the attack. The evidence indicates that young people made false confessions and later denied them. A brutal attack in Central Park in the early hours of April 20, 1989, a 29-year-old woman was found severely beaten and raped in Central Park. On the night of the crime, the police responded to a group of about 30 teenagers threatening people in the park. A race biker has been arrested. A taxi driver reported throwing stones at a taxi. In two separate incidents, two men were attacked and injured, one of whom was robbed. In the end, five young men aged between 14 and 16 years were questioned by the police and subsequently charged with beating and rape. In their first hours with the police, young people offered a mix of confessions. The details from each of them were not consistent with the calculations from the others. They identified various individuals who had already committed rape. They did not agree where the attack took place. Their statements did not correspond to the physical evidence from the scene, including the woman's clothes. More importantly, none of them acknowledged the rape itself. They soon retracted their confessions. The incident was on the front page of the news and was accompanied by racist mouths. The victim was white. The suspects were black and Spanish. The coverage of the news referred to \"modified teenagers\" messing with the will. Within a few days, the authorities accused the five adolescents of rape and attempted murder. Soon thereafter, on 1 May, Trump paid $85,000 for full advertising in the four major newspapers in New York, The New York Times, Daily News, New York Post and New York Newsday. Bring back the death penalty. Get our cops!\" The main title of the Declaration was said (see page 13). \"I want to hate these thieves and murderers,\" Tramp wrote. \"They must be forced to suffer, and when killed, they must be executed for their crimes.\" The victim survived the attack. Trump was considered to be part of a broader social decline. \"At what point did we cross the line of good and noble pursuit of true civil liberties into a dangerously reckless and lenient atmosphere that allows criminals of all ages to beat and rape a helpless woman and laugh at the pain of her family? And why are they laughing? Laughing because they know that very soon they'll be back on the street to rape, mutilate and kill again. The title of the Donald Trump Proclamation in the New York newspapers, May 1, 1989, after a trial in which they kept their innocence, convicted the five teenagers of rape and assault. There's no physical or legal evidence linking them to the truncheon attack. As the Manhattan Prosecutor &apos; s Office said in a subsequent file. In addition to assaulting women, they were convicted of two other assaults in the park. Four of them spent seven years in prison. Their fifths have spent 13 years - up to 2002. Then, everything changed. In February 2002, another man, Matias Reyes, in prison for rape and murder of a woman in 1989, confessed to rape and beating a Central Park clown. He said he acted alone. The DNA evidence was conclusively linked to the attack. He provided specific details corresponding to the crime scene. He confessed to other sexual assaults that the police never contacted. With this new evidence, in late 2002, a judge dismissed the convictions. On January 13, 2021, General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines in autograph security, and said, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021, \"This court finds that, although the defendants made statements criminalizing their association with the crime scene, as specified in the party papers, none of the defendants admitted to rape the jog,\" the judge wrote. The Attorney General's Office said to support the other assault charges, \"I have been greatly weakened and fatally weakened by newly discovered evidence.\" While there is evidence that some of them have been involved in these crimes, the District Attorney &apos; s Office has called on the Court to cancel all convictions. Trump referred to a major prosecutor at the 1989 trial, Linda Vershstein, head of the City Sexual Crimes Unit. He said she and other prosecutors thought the city shouldn't have settled. She states that she agrees with the judge &apos; s decision to evict the rape charges, but not with others. \"Mr. Reyes' admission and his DNA are identical to his claim that he acted alone require the annulment of the rape charges against the five. I agreed to this decision, and I still do, \"Firstein said on June 10, 2019, Wall Street Journal article.\" However, Vershstein added that she believed that convictions for other charges should exist. In 2014, she objected to the city settlement, saying that it ignored those other crimes. She believed that adolescents played a role in rape. Therefore, Trump's claim that Vershstein and other prosecutors \"think that the city should not have settled that case\" is also exaggerated. The Central Park case raises the question of why these adolescents were involved in a crime they later denied. It's a complicated matter. No court found that investigators used illegal methods to obtain statements from adolescents. Professor of Ohio State Honorary Law, Sharon Davis, studied the register. In an article in 2006 on lessons from the Central Park smugglers case, investigators said that they had withdrawn questionable confessions from young people using persuasion. \"Why don't you just be cooperative, show remorse, put all the bloody mess behind them, the detectives pay,\" Davis wrote. Whatever the questions about the circumstances, our focus here is narrower: did adolescents confess their guilt, as Trump said? As the judge of the Supreme Court of New York and the Manhattan Prosecutor's Office said, \"None of them in fact confessed to the rape of the Central Park clown.\" In their trials and on appeal, they all maintained their innocence. On the other hand, young people described the ways in which they participated in the attack, at least initially. In the view of Stephen Drazen, Professor of Law and Chairman of the Northwestern University Center, about wrongful convictions, Trump's statement is \"not entirely inaccurate but misleading and incomplete.\" \"while the children confessed their guilt, they immediately vowed their confessions,\" he said. \"Trumbe's statement is misleading because it ignores the reality of false confessions. False confessions constitute almost a quarter of every DNA acquittal, and young people are at greater risk than adults than false confessions.\" Not every legal scientist agrees that those confessions were false. Paul Castle, Professor of Criminal Law at Utah University, referred to a 2003 report commissioned by the New York City Police Department. Three strangers selected for the team decided that teenagers first attacked the woman and then the actual rapist took advantage of the moment. The authors of the report did not have any additional facts beyond what was known at the trial. They admitted that the evidence provided \"a reasonable basis for confirming that Reyes had already made an attack on the jog himself.\" In the opinion of the Attorney General's Office, confessions \"had serious weaknesses.\" It was reasonable for every defendant to talk about the crime in order to become a witness rather than an accused. In short, there is now ample evidence that confessions were false and, in this sense, are not actual confessions of guilt. The District Prosecutor &apos; s Office said, and the Court agreed, that if a jury provided the full set of evidence, it would likely have reached a different verdict. In 2014, New York City agreed to pay $5 million in a legal settlement for the Central Park. The White House press office refused to comment on this fact check. Our verdict, Trump, said Central Park 5 was guilty. He said that some prosecutors were involved, \"I think the city shouldn't have settled that case.\" While the five adolescents early admitted to participating in an attack, they quickly withdrew those confessions. At best, they confessed their guilt to a limited degree for a short time. Legal records show that none of them confessed to rape of women in Central Park. The judge canceled their convictions when the real rapist confessed, and DNA evidence showed his guilt. Trump ignores a package of evidence that now refers to the false nature of those confessions. Even the prosecutor who cited him said that she agreed that the convictions for rape had been genuinely revoked. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00502"}
