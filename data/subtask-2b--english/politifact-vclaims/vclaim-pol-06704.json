The controversy led to the ouster of McDonald\u2019s predecessor, Eric Shinseki.\nSo what has McDonald done to clean up the embattled department since he arrived? He offered some details during a Feb. 15 appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\n\"We're making fundamental changes in the department in terms of leadership. We have held accountable about 900 employees who are no longer with us that were with us before I became secretary,\" McDonald said.\nHost Chuck Todd asked McDonald what he meant by \"held accountable.\"\n\"Nine hundred people have been fired since I became secretary,\" he said. \"We've got 60 people that we fired who have manipulated wait times.\"\nThat seems to be a pretty big house-cleaning. Did that many people really get fired? We decided to see whether 900 people were let go and whether 60 of them were ousted directly because of the scandal.\n\"Nine hundred people have been fired since I became secretary\"\nJames Hutton, a VA spokesman, told PolitiFact that \"personnel from a wide range of locations, across the spectrum of pay grades, have been removed. Some of the reasons include poor performance, absenteeism, among several others.\"\nHutton provided a breakdown of the firings. There were 468 \"removals\" of regular employees. Most of these \u2014 432 \u2014 were employees of the Veterans Health Administration, while 27 worked for the Veteran Benefits Administration and the rest worked in other, smaller offices.\nTo get to 900, McDonald is also counting 487 \"probationary\" terminations. When most people go to work for the federal government, they first go through a one-year probationary period \u2014 a tryout, if you like. During that probationary period, it is much easier to let go of an employee who isn\u2019t working out. After that, the rules covering firing are tilted more favorably toward the employee.\nThis means that more than half of the firings under McDonald were terminations of probationary employees working at the department for less than one year. That\u2019s important for a few reasons.\nMost importantly, this means that about half of the people let go under McDonald\u2019s watch were employees who were just starting work as the scandal had come to light, or weren\u2019t even there when it was going on.\nAlso, this makes it unlikely that all 900 terminated employees \"were with us before I became secretary,\" as McDonald put it in the interview. For that to be true, it would mean that not a single probationary hire under McDonald has been let go since he came on in July. Is it possible that Veterans Affairs, which has the second-largest federal workforce, did not fire a single probationary employee in the last seven months? We asked Veterans Affairs to elaborate but didn\u2019t hear back on this point.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that McDonald\u2019s predecessor, Shinseki, fired 2,247 people during fiscal year 2013, according to multiple reports, including our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker, which awarded McDonald\u2019s claim Four Pinocchios, their worst rating.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, McDonald is on pace to fire about 1,730 people during his first year, in a department with 325,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nWe take no position on what is the \"right\" number of VA employees to fire. Still, these termination statistics undercut the notion that McDonald came in and cleaned house. The 900 people let go may well have been part of the normal employee churn of a large government agency.\n\"We've got 60 people that we fired who have manipulated wait times\"\nIf the first part of the claim has problems, the second part doesn\u2019t appear to be true in the slightest.\nAccording to a Feb. 13, 2015, update on adverse employment actions since June 3, 2014, provided to PolitiFact by the House Veterans\u2019 Affairs committees, 75 employees have received disciplinary, or \"adverse employment action,\" related to patient scheduling, record manipulation, appointment delays or patient deaths.\nDisciplinary action ranges from a written statement of censure, called a \"reprimand\" or \"admonishment,\" to suspension or dismissal.\nSo far, 14 people were either removed, received probationary termination or resigned in lieu of removal. Another nine individuals have removals against them pending. The rest of the 75 individuals will have a written censure on their record (which can be removed after two or three years), were demoted, or will return to work after serving a suspension, the longest of which would be 60 days.\nMcDonald also removed five directors and officers through new authority vested in him by the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act, a law passed in the aftermath of the scandal.\nAsked to explain the discrepancy, Hutton said the department has \"proposed disciplinary action related to data manipulation or patient care against more than 60 employees nationwide. This takes into account the full range of accountability actions including admonishments, demotions, reprimands, and termination.\"\nIn plain language: Sixty people weren\u2019t fired as a result of the scandal; the secretary\u2019s statement is incorrect.\nOur ruling\nMcDonald said, \"Nine hundred people have been fired since I became secretary. We\u2019ve got 60 people that we fired who have manipulated wait times.\" He also said that those 900 people \"were with us before I became secretary.\"\nWhile the data shows that 900 people have been let go under McDonald, half those dismissals were probationary employees, meaning they were just starting work as the scandal had come to light, or weren\u2019t even there when it was going on. Looking at historical trends, the number of terminations looks pretty similar to ordinary personnel churn.\nMore problematic is the claim that 60 people were fired in direct connection with the wait-time scandal. As of mid February, 14 employees had been ousted in one way or another due to the scandal, with another five directors or officers removed as well. Other employees were disciplined without being terminated. Still, the number of terminated employees is well below McDonald\u2019s stated number.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06704"}
