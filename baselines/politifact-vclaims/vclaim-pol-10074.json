You could say he ran it into the ground,\" Baldwin charged in the Oct. 18, 2012, debate.\n\n\"When he came to the administration, Medicare was approaching bankruptcy in the year 2029; when he left, it was 2020 -- nine years closer to bankruptcy. That's the Tommy Thompson record as secretary under George W. Bush.\"\n\nThat\u2019s pretty tough stuff, especially the thrust of Baldwin\u2019s accusation, that Thompson was personally responsible for pushing Medicare closer to bankruptcy.\n\nMedicare and its solvency\n\nMedicare, the government health insurance program that serves some 49 million senior citizens and people under 65 with certain disabilities, cost $549 billion in 2011. It is funded by two separate trust funds.\n\nThe trust fund for Medicare Part A -- which covers inpatient hospital care, home health care, and services at skilled nursing facilities and hospices -- is funded mostly from federal payroll taxes. This is the trust fund typically cited when politicians from both parties warn of Medicare\u2019s demise.\n\nEach year, the Medicare Board of Trustees projects the number of years before the Part A trust fund will be exhausted.\nSince 1999, when Baldwin first entered Congress, the annual reports have put the life of the trust fund at between eight and 28 years. The most recent projection, in March 2012, said the fund would be exhausted in 12 years, in 2024.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s evidence\n\nAsked for evidence to back the claim, Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus cited the Medicare board\u2019s annual reports for 2001 and 2005 -- the years that correspond with Thompson\u2019s tenure as Health and Human Services secretary.\n\nIn 2001, the trust fund for Part A was projected to be solvent through 2029; but by 2005, it was projected to be exhausted in 2020, nine years sooner. Kraus argued that Thompson did nothing to prevent the nine-year slide.\n\nSo, Baldwin was right on the numbers.\n\nBut her claim put the blame squarely at Thompson\u2019s feet, suggesting he could have prevented the slide himself.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe noted it is Congress\u2019 job to properly fund Medicare, saying Thompson only administered the program \"as directed by law.\"\n\nJust what was his role?\n\nOther evidence\n\nPolitiFact National\u2019s examination of a March 2012 claim by Mitt Romney, the GOP presidential nominee, is helpful in evaluating Baldwin\u2019s claim against Thompson.\n\nRomney\u2019s statement was different -- he claimed President Barack Obama was \"ending Medicare as we know it,\" partly by \"allowing it to go bankrupt in less than 15 years.\"\n\nOn the bankruptcy point, PolitiFact National pointed out that decisions made over nearly 50 years by many presidents and members of Congress put the program on an unsustainable path.\n\nOur colleagues also said \"it\u2019s not clear that Medicare\u2019s situation fits the two definitions of \u2018bankrupt\u2019 we\u2019ve used in the past -- to be \u2018declared in law unable to pay outstanding debts\u2019 or \u2018reduced to a state of financial ruin: impoverished.\u2019 Medicare is a government program; the government will have the ability to pay its bills, however financially painful that may become.\"\n\nOn that point, PolitiFact National concluded: \"We find it a ridiculous exaggeration to say Obama is personally responsible for Medicare\u2019s woes.\"\n\nIt would be even more ridiculous to lay full blame for Medicare\u2019s move toward \"bankruptcy\" on a cabinet secretary.\n\nExpert views\n\nTwo Medicare experts we interviewed agreed that the performance of the HHS secretary is a factor in the solvency of Medicare\u2019s key trust fund, but far from the determining one.\n\n\"It certainly is reasonable to say the secretary is the ultimate point person for Medicare in the administration,\" said Jack Hoadley, health policy analyst and research professor at Georgetown University. But he also said many factors, such as congressional actions and longstanding trends in demographics and health care spending, \"matter in determining the life\" of the fund.\n\nJoseph Antos, health care and retirement policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said an HHS secretary only implements Medicare law handed down by Congress. He said it\u2019s \"more correct to say Congress and the fee-for-service payment mechanism ran Medicare into the ground. The big spending is on payments for health services, and Congress sets payment rates through legislation. Fee-for-service gives a strong incentive for the use of more services, and more complex services, which increases total program spending.\"\n\nOur rating\n\nBaldwin said Thompson ran Medicare \"into the ground\" during his four years as health and human services secretary, citing the fact that its key trust fund moved nine years closer to insolvency.\n\nBut Medicare\u2019s financial health is determined more by presidents, members of Congress, health care costs and other factors -- over a period of decades -- than by the limited role of the HHS secretary.\n\nWe rate Baldwin\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10074"}
