We\u2019ll take them in order.\nThe bill\u2019s provisions won\u2019t be taking effect in time for the April 2018 filing season\nThere isn\u2019t anything in the tax bill that would take effect soon enough to change taxpayers\u2019 filing choices in any significant way by April 2018.\nThe bill\u2019s provisions only address tax year 2018 and beyond. So in April, taxpayers will be filing their paperwork for tax year 2017 to the IRS -- that is, under existing tax law, not the new law.\n\"Most people will still be filing something that looks familiar to them from past years,\" said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.\nThere is no \u2018postcard\u2019 filing plan for individual taxpayers\nThere isn\u2019t a postcard filing option today, and there\u2019s nothing in the bill that would create one.\nThe idea didn\u2019t come from nowhere. In November, House Republicans touted their plan as one that could be accommodated by a postcard-sized form. The president liked the idea so much that he held one up and kissed it for the cameras when meeting with lawmakers at the White House.\n\"It's going to make life very simple,\" he said on Nov. 2, 2017. The only people that aren't going to like this is H&R Block. They're not going to be very happy. That's probably one of the only companies in the country that's not going to be thrilled.\"\nBut in the end, the bill didn't do much to make this idea a reality.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe possibility of creating a postcard option \"is most likely one of many things the IRS will have to figure out and issue new regulations on,\" said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. But that\u2019s not happening immediately, he said.\nNewton said that there is already a pretty easy way to file your tax returns -- the 1040EZ form. It looks like this, with just one page to fill out:\n\n\"While it\u2019s not postcard-sized, it\u2019s pretty simple, and whatever they end up with in the future will probably look a lot like that currently does,\" Newton said.\nThe 1040EZ is also popular. According to IRS statistics for the 2015 tax year, 23.3 million tax filers used the 1040EZ. That\u2019s about one of every six filers.\nCould the number of people using the 1040EZ increase due to the tax bill\u2019s passage (albeit in 2019)? Rosenberg said the number might increase on the margins due to the raising of the standard deduction, which would save some taxpayers from itemizing -- something they would have to do on the full 1040 form.\nStill, he added, \"there are relatively few people who currently itemize who have a simple enough situation\" to shift to the 1040EZ.\nTrump\u2019s walk-back\nWhen we contacted the White House, they referred us to a tweet sent by Ivanka Trump a few hours after her Fox & Friends interview..\nTrump replied to a tweet by Miranda Yaver, a self-described Democratic political scientist, that said, \"Actually, @IvankaTrump, in April 2018 people will be doing their their 2017 taxes based on the current law.\"\nActually, @IvankaTrump, in April 2018 people will be doing their their 2017 taxes based on the current law. https://t.co/cZFiQ3QKJN\u2014 Miranda Yaver (@mirandayaver) December 21, 2017\n\n\nTrump replied, \"Correct!

The recently passed bill takes effect for the 2018 tax year, which people will be filing returns on in April 2019 -- not this coming April. And there is no plan for a postcard filing option. Simple filing options already exist and are widely used, but tax experts do not expect a surge in their use as a result of the tax bill in April 2019.
