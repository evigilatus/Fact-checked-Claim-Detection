Tony Evers, it\u2019s bad enough for residents to be voting to voluntarily raise their own taxes to fully fund schools.\n\"More than a million Wisconsinites have voted to raise their own property taxes because Republicans have failed to fully fund our public schools for the past eight years,\" Evers tweeted on April 3, 2019.\nLast year was a record year for school referendums, as voters approved more than $2 billion in additional school spending.\nBut have 1 million residents really voted to raise their own taxes through referendums? And is it reasonable to attribute that decision to Republicans failing to \"fully fund\" schools?\nLet\u2019s study up.\nReferendums are on the rise in Wisconsin\nSimply put, a referendum is a vote on a specific issue.\nLocal school districts can propose referendums to replace or upgrade a building that is aging or becoming too small, or to approve spending for ongoing budgetary expenses beyond what is otherwise allowed.\nAnd these have spiked in recent years.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nWisconsin voters approved $1.8 billion in referendums in 2016, set a record of more than $2 billion in 2018 and voted for another $783 million in spring of 2019. Overall, voters across the state favored 45 of the 60 referendums in the 2019 spring election, a 75% approval rate.\nWhat about the 1 million votes?\nEvers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said the governor was referring to the number of voters who supported referendums since 2012.\nThat data,\u00a0gathered by the state Department of Public Instruction,\u00a0includes both referendums for exceeding spending caps and building construction or upgrades.\nAbout 2 million voters supported additional spending of some kind since 2012 \u2014 1.1 million backed taking on debt for buildings, and more than 900,000 supported additional money for ongoing expenses.\nIn our view, the ongoing expenses number is more important. It represents borrowing for ongoing expenses, not capital projects such as buildings that aren\u2019t as directly related to funding levels. Still, using just the second measure, Evers\u2019 1 million number is in the ballpark.\nRight to blame Republicans for referendums?\nA record number of referendums have been approved with the state under Republican control in recent years, but is it fair to connect those two facts?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll get back to Evers\u2019 claim, but first a little primer on school funding.\nLocal school districts are subject to state-mandated caps that were instituted by former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson. The cap \u2014 called a revenue limit \u2014 restricts how much money the district is able to spend per pupil. For 2018-\u201919, that limit was an average of $10,677 per pupil statewide.\nThe revenue limit includes both money brought in through local property taxes and general school aids the state provides to local districts.\nThe revenue limit was initially set to go up with inflation, but over time that changed. The increases slowed under Democrat Gov. Jim Doyle, and the limit was frozen starting in 2015-\u201916 under Republican Gov. Scott Walker. On a statewide basis, it has been frozen since.\nThe state has steadily increased general school aids in recent years -- from $4.49 billion in 2015 to $4.6 billion in 2017 and $4.67 billion in 2019, according to Wisconsin Policy Forum. But since the cap hasn\u2019t changed, that additional money simply provided tax relief by lowering the amount of property taxes districts were allowed to levy. It didn\u2019t increase per-pupil spending.\nSo districts that wanted to spend beyond the revenue limit needed voters to approve it in a referendum.\nWhich brings us to the claim from Evers, who was the longtime state schools superintendent before being elected governor.\nEvers spokeswoman Baldauff said the \"fully fund\" part of the tweet references the caps Republicans have placed on school spending.\n\"At a minimum, fully funding our schools means allowing school spending to keep pace with inflation, with the state contributing a fair share of those costs,\" Baldauff said. \"While the previous administration eventually restored some of the funding they cut (state support of costs), they held spending relatively flat. Districts were forced to use referenda, their only tool available, to protect educational programming, retain staff, and keep the lights on.\"\nSo Evers draws a direct line from funding levels to referendum success.\nBut many factors can affect whether voters support a referendum.\nJason Stein, research director for Wisconsin Policy Forum, said other types of state aid and the health of the economy both can factor into voters\u2019 willingness to support a referendum. For example, per pupil aid -- a category of state school funding that isn\u2019t subject to the revenue limit \u2014 rose from $150 per student in 2015-\u201916 to $654 per student in 2018-\u201919.\nAnd of course there are local factors at play \u2014 a rise or decline in enrollment and the age and condition of the district\u2019s school buildings could have played a role in the unprecedented level of spending approved by referendum in recent years.\n\"You don\u2019t typically get record levels without multiple factors,\" Stein said.\nOur ruling\nEvers tweeted that \"more than a million Wisconsinites have voted to raise their own property taxes because Republicans have failed to fully fund our public schools for the past eight years.\"\nIt\u2019s not necessarily fair to blame construction-related referendums on funding levels \u2014 those are heavily determined by building condition and enrollment trends \u2014 but narrowing the focus to referendums for ongoing spending still shows more than 900,000 votes in support. That\u2019s close to Evers\u2019 claim of 1 million.\nBlaming Republicans for all those referendums over-simplifies the matter, however, ignoring other factors that can play a role in voters\u2019 decisions.\nWe rate Evers\u2019 claim Half True.\n Share the Facts 2019-05-17 15:44:01 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  \"More than a million Wisconsinites have voted to raise their own property taxes because Republicans have failed to fully fund our public schools for the past eight years.\"    Tony Evers Wisconsin governor https://twitter.com/GovEvers/status/1113506200203800577   Twitter Wednesday, April 3, 2019 2019-04-03    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00627"}
