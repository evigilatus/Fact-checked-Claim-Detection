Zapata has taken it up to 150 meters (nearly 500 feet) and believes he could go higher.\nDespite the claim that this is \"very easy to learn,\" there\u2019s some disappointing news for would-be buyers: The site says that right now, \"only Franky Zapata can pilot the Flyboard Air.\"\nThe Guinness Book of World Records awarded Zapata the record for the world\u2019s farthest hoverboard flight in 2016. Zapata flew for well over a mile (7,388 feet to be exact) along the coast of Sausset-les-Pins in the south of France.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rising 50 metres above the surface for the attempt and trailed by a fleet of boats and jet skis, Franky, 37, piloted a futuristic aircraft called the Flyboard\u00ae Air developed by his company Zapata Racing,\" the record-tracking publication said.\nThe company also has video of Zapata waving to the crowd far below at the 2018 Grand Prix in France.\n\nFranky Zapata demonstrates his Flyboard Air at the 2018 Grand Prix.
