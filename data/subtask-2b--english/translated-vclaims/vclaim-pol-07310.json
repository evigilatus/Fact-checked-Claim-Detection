They meet in the shadows of the stairs to shake hands. Meaning: They don't want anyone to see what they're doing. The word \"circket\" appears in large green letters, followed by the words \"non-bid contract.\" The Narrator speaks of the Treasurer General Jenna Raimundo, and then one of four Democrats running for governor's primary election, a race that eventually won. According to the novelist, \"The venture capital company has a secret contract insurance contract without bidding with taxpayers,\" the announcement was to Mayor of Providence Angel Taveras, an opponent of Raimundo. He didn't mention what the contract was about, but it certainly seemed mysterious. Although the basic matter is over, we have decided to examine the commercial claim because the issues it raises may be raised again while Raimundo runs against the Mayor of Cranston Allan Fong, who won the presidential presidential presidency. The commercial quotes the story of 1 March 2014 in the Providence Journal, which explored the terms of the 2006 investment made by Providence at the Investment Capital Investment Company, Point Judith Capital. Raimundo co-founded the company. In March 2006, four years before Raimundo entered politics, a board chaired by Mayor David Cecilin voted to invest $1 million in retirement funds with Point Judith. Investment will last for 10 years; the city initially invested $100,000. Under the terms of the deal, if the investment made money by 2016, Point Judith would get 20 percent of the profit and she'd pay management fees. By 31 December 2013, the city had invested $907,211, and Point Judith had deducted $159,690 from the fees, but the value of the investment had increased to $1.466 million. What makes this a secret deal? The venture capital companies, which provide early financing to innovative firms in the hope of obtaining large profits on the road, are narrow-minded about how to invest their money and ask for secrecy from those who invest in it. The magazine spent months trying to get details of the city's investment, Point Judith, which included a discussion between Point Judith and the city about what to launch. In April, more than a month after the day &apos; s submission of a report on the general terms of the agreement and eight years after its approval, Providence issued a copy of her agreement with Point Judith to the newspaper, revising several parts - including dollar amounts, investment periods, interest rates and other key elements. So Providence's contract with Point Judith remains confidential. But when it comes to other aspects of the deal, the image of two undercover businessmen making an illegal deal in the drawer is a fucking mistake. The investment vote with Point Judith was unanimously approved on 23 March 2006, during a regular meeting of the City's Board of Investment Commissioners. The public meeting was on the third floor of the conference room in the city hall. The minutes of the meeting at which Raimundo made a presentation, and the weight and disadvantages of the agreement, are available on the Internet. The Fund &apos; s investment adviser recommended investment. Facebook published on January 23, 2021 in social media \"Baiden invested the entire family's wealth in Ukrainian gas and oil. Then closes the Keystone pipeline. One reason why the city went with Point Judith: At that time, it was the only venture capital company based in Rhode Island. \"We didn't say that the contract was entered secretly,\" said Dawn Bergentino, spokesman for the Taveras ruling campaign. \"We say that the contract itself is confidential. We were talking specifically about the non-disclosure aspect of the contract. When the agreement was signed, the position of Point Judith was that the information was not for public disclosure. The mayor killed Judith's point to make the contract public later.\" \"If the contract particulars are hidden from public opinion and if asked to release the contract, the applications are rejected - the contract is confidential.\" Was this a contract without bidding? The short answer: Yes. However, this is not unusual at the state or local level. Investments are often made without bidding because they are based on the recommendation of the Fund &apos; s investment adviser. \"For the most part, most of them do not come out to bid\" unless the Board of Investment does not have a financial adviser, Howard Paul of the Bogdahen Group said. He is a well-known adviser to many public pension schemes. The spokesman for Taveras insisted that most investments were made through requests for proposals. We've asked us to see copies of the previous registration numbers. The Providence consultant, Investment Advisor Wynnwright, said he didn't have any access. We also asked three of the four people who voted to invest Judith &apos; s point on whether bidding was a normal practice. Cecilin, now the United States. Congressman Andrew Guernet said through speaker Andrew Guernet that individual investments do not come out for bidding. Merth York, who was a member of the Investment Commission at the time and supported Raimundo's offer for governorship, said the same. \"Someone comes and says they have something, and we're either interested in it or not, and part of it depends on how it fits into the general portfolio. It wasn't like you opened three shows and chose one, she said. Stephen T. Napolitano, also a former member of the Committee, said: \"We relied on our consultant to make recommendations and to provide people in the field to come and interview them. Accordingly, we have made a decision to recruit them. ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ With regard to her bidding, I don't think it was done at the time. I don't think that's the standard procedure.\" Our governor Angel Taveras said, \"Jenna Raimundo's venture capital company got a secret contract without bidding with taxpayers,\" citing a newspaper story dealing with the terms of the Point Judith deal with Providence. Some elements of the transaction are still confidential. However, the declaration clearly suggests that the contract has been approved secretly is wrong. It wasn't. It was voted on at an open meeting. It is technically correct to call it a non-bid contract, but this phrase refers to something that is not true. The fact is that many of these investment decisions never come out to bid because the investments have been examined by a financial adviser. Because the statement in the Taveras Declaration contains some elements of truth, but ignoring critical facts that give a different impression, (If you have an allegation that you want Polly Fact Road Island to check, send us an e-mail on [a protected e-mail] and follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07310"}
