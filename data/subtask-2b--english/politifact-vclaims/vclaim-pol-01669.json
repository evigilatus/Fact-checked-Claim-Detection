We are not establishment Republicans in Wisconsin; we are activist Republicans.\"\nVukmir then pitched herself as \"a strong leader with a track record who\u2019s not going to buckle\" and cited the 2011 battle over Act 10 declaring:\n\"I have been through the gauntlet, when we had riots in that\u00a0Capitol.\"\nErm? What?\nThe background\nThe 2011 protests against what would become Act 10 turned into a round-the-clock occupation of the Capitol, with demonstrators camping out in the rotunda. It was the largest series of protests at the Capitol since the Vietnam War, with crowds reaching an estimated 100,000 in early March, after the bill had been signed by newly-elected Gov. Scott Walker.\nThe protests were over a push by Walker and Republicans in the Legislature to dramatically curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. The move allowed the state and other units of government to require a higher share of pension and health care costs be paid by workers, which Walker and the GOP said was needed to close a state budget gap.\nThe protests -- and the fact Senate Democrats fled to Illinois to delay a vote -- drew major news coverage for weeks.\nThe tumult even attracted international attention, with Piotr Duda, president of the 700,000-member Polish trade union Solidarity, releasing a statement in support of the Wisconsin protesters. Meanwhile, Ian\u2019s Pizza shops delivered hundreds of free pizzas to the Capitol, with the cost picked up by contributions from all 50 states \u2014 as well as Bosnia, China, Egypt, France and 20 other countries.\nBut pizza deliveries in a riot zone?\nA similar claim\nMattias Gugel, communications director for Vukmir\u2019s Senate campaign, did not respond to our requests for back up for Vukmir\u2019s claim.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not the first time we heard, and evaluated, a \"riot\" claim.\nAppearing on MSNBC\u2019s \"Morning Joe\" program the morning of Feb. 17, 2011, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., defended Walker\u2019s efforts.\n\"It's not asking a lot, it's still about half of what private sector pensions do and health care packages do,\" Ryan said. \"So (Walker\u2019s) basically saying, I want you public workers to pay half of what our private sector counterparts (pay) and he's getting riots -- it's like Cairo has moved to Madison these days.\"\nAt the time, protests had also swept through the Middle East. In Egypt, 18 days of protests led to the \u00a0Feb. 11, 2011, resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.\nOur rating of Ryan\u2019s riot claim: Pants on Fire.\nNumerous law enforcement agencies handled the protests, including the Dane County Sheriff\u2019s Department, Madison police, state Department of Natural Resources and Capitol police. But only a handful of arrests were reported.\n\"For the most part, people have been very respectful and very orderly,\" a public information officer for the Dane County Sheriff\u2019s Department told us at the time. \"It certainly has been a very peaceful protest.\"\nTo be sure, there were threats made against Walker and GOP lawmakers.\nIn his book \"Unintimidated,\" Walker wrote that he received letters targeting his family and faced death threats and frightening encounters with protesters. There were also reports of threats being made against several lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald.\nBut that\u2019s different than riots.\nAt the time, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said of Ryan\u2019s \"riot\" statement: \"It\u2019s astounding that he would say that. It\u2019s so spectacularly wrong.\"\nRyan himself admitted: \"It was an inaccurate comparison.\"\nOur rating\nDuring a campaign debate, Vukmir said: \"I have been through the gauntlet, when we had riots in that\u00a0Capitol.\"\nThat vastly overstates what happened, in an effort to burnish her own stand-tough persona for voters.\nThe claim of \"riots\" in the Capitol was debunked in 2011 and rarely, if ever, has come up since. That is, until Vukmir put herself on the hot seat by recycling the claim.\nWe still rate it Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2018-09-04 19:34:18 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire   Says \"I have been through the gauntlet, when we had riots in that Capitol.\"    Leah Vukmir Republican U.S. Senate candidate, Wisconsin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5IJstFzFtA   In a debate Thursday, July 26, 2018 2018-07-26    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01669"}
