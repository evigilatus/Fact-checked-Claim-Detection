We asked for a sample of that data and got a year\u2019s worth of monthly reports for Help Wanted OnLine, a tool used by the Department to measure real-time labor demand.\nThese reports are posted on the DEO\u2019s site and updated monthly.\nThe most recent month of data (October 2017) shows there were 13,619 online ads placed for registered nurses. The second-most popular ads sought retail salespersons at 7,207 postings, followed by \"first-line supervisors\" for retail sales workers with 6,467 ads.\nPutnam has also talked about the need for truck drivers, which place fourth for online job ads.\n\nIn addition, Florida's Statewide Demand Occupations List shows that registered nurses have consistently ranked as the most in-demand occupation since at least 2011.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMary Lou Brunell is the executive director of the Florida Center for Nursing, which was set up in 2001 by the Florida Legislature to address the nursing shortages in the state.\nIn recent years, she said the problem has been exacerbated by a lack of students studying to become nurses, a shortage of faculty teaching future students, and an aging workforce and state population.\n\"You put all those pieces together, and it\u2019s just not getting better,\" said Dianne Morrison-Beedy, the former\u00a0dean at the University of South Florida College of Nursing.\nThe nursing workforce is also aging. According to a 2017 report from the Florida Center for Nursing, 44 percent of registered nurses are over the age of 50 and expected to retire in the next 5 to 10 years.\nThe economic turnaround in the late 2000s also decreased the number of nurses in the workforce. When the economy plummeted in 2008, many people trained in nursing but not working returned to their job or delayed retirement. As the economy improved, there were once again more vacancies because those nurses returned home or retired.\nBrunell also said she\u2019s also concerned about the need for licensed practical nurses, which work under the guidance of registered nurses or physicians. She said there\u2019s been an increase in home care facilities, which is why she predicts more licensed practical nurses (LPNs)\u00a0will be needed in the future.\nMorrison-Beedy said that in order to fix the problem, the focus has to be on the how to develop faculty and support for people who want to become nurses.\nIn Florida, becoming a registered nurse requires either a two-year associate degree or a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in nursing.\n\"We need more students in the baccalaureate program, we need to provide financial support for students to go to school, and in order to do that we have to have enough faculty to teach those students,\" she said. \"We want the best educated and the best kind of nurses because that\u2019s where we\u2019ll see better outcomes.\"\nOur ruling\nPutnam said the No. 1 job vacancy in Florida every month for seven years has been nursing.\nHe\u2019s right. The top online job advertisement in Florida has been registered nurses every month for the past seven years. Experts agreed that the shortage has been an issue for awhile in Florida.\nWe rate this claim True.\n Share the Facts 2017-11-08 21:37:51 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  \"The No. 1 job vacancy in Florida every month for seven years has been nursing.\"    Adam Putnam Gubernatorial candidate https://www.facebook.com/adamputnam/videos/10159466980890371/   in a speech Tuesday, October 31, 2017 2017-10-31    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02710"}
