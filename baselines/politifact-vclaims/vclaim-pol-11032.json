But did New Hampshire\u2019s health care industry not only rebound from the cuts, but grow to the tune of 400 jobs? We decided to crunch the numbers.\n\nWhen asked for the source of O\u2019Brien\u2019s figures, Shannon Shutts, a spokeswoman for the House of Representatives, pointed to the New Hampshire Employment Security agency. The office, which runs the state\u2019s job centers and manages unemployment benefits, issues both quarterly and monthly employment reports estimating job growth in specific industries.\n\nAccording to the Employment Security office\u2019s Current Employment Statistics report, 84,900 people worked in New Hampshire\u2019s health care and social assistance fields in April 2012, the most recent numbers available. That number, based on employment surveys of selected hospitals, outpatient clinics, nursing homes and home care agencies, among others, is exactly the same as April 2011 and 100 fewer than March 2011. So that doesn\u2019t show the gain O\u2019Brien claimed.\n\nThe House of Representatives passed its budget March 31, 2011, but it didn\u2019t approve the final version of the budget for another three months, until June 22, 2011.\n\nAccording to the state jobs office, employment in the health care and social assistance sectors in June 2011 was 85,600. But it declined by 700 more by April 2012.\n\nIn addition, at the time O\u2019Brien made the claim May 7, the April 2012 unemployment numbers hadn\u2019t been posted to the state\u2019s website. If we calculate his claim using the March 2012 data that was available at the time, the numbers look even worse, since there were 400 fewer health care jobs in March than in April 2012.\n\n\"What you see in health care is really more of a slowdown,\" said Annette Nielsen, an economist with the economic and labor market information bureau within the employment security office.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A couple of years ago, you would see 2 or 3 percent strong growth over the year, and then even through the beginning of the recession, that was really the only bright spot there was,\" she said. \"That is definitely slowing down.\"\n\nThe state\u2019s health care employment numbers, as classified by the economic security office, include both health care and social assistance jobs. Health care jobs include those working in hospitals, medical centers, outpatient clinics and nursing homes. Meanwhile, social assistance is defined as child care workers and home care providers for the elderly and those with disabilities, among others.\n\nBut even without considering the social assistance fields, O\u2019Brien\u2019s numbers are still off.\n\nHospitals across the state gained 100 jobs from April 2011 to April 2012, rising to 28,300 last month, according to the state report. But ambulatory care services, including chiropractors, optometrists, podiatrists, mental health professionals and diagnostic technicians, lost 1,300 jobs during that period.\n\nCompared to figures from June 2011, ambulatory care jobs were down 1,500 in April 2012 and hospital jobs suffered 200 losses, according to the state data.\n\nAdmittedly, the state\u2019s monthly job estimates are not perfect, acknowledged Nielson, of the employment security office. The figures are based on surveys collected from a sampling of employers, which are often returned late, and they don\u2019t always reflect new and emerging businesses, she said.\n\nFor a more accurate measure, economists often look to the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages report.\n\nThe report, released every three months, is based on actual employment data reported to the employment security office for unemployment benefits claims. But because the data takes time to collect and analyze, reports are released only every three months. The most report reflects employment data through September 2011.\n\nAccording to that data, from April 2011 to September 2011, six months after the House passed the state budget and the longest period of available data, the number of people working in health care in the state grew by 402 jobs. Yet when using the June starting date, when the state budget took effect, there was a loss of 178 jobs during the next quarter of a year.\n\nEither way, this data is now eight months old, and much can \u2013 and likely has \u2013 changed in that time, Nielson said.\n\n\"You can\u2019t compare the two,\" she said. \"They\u2019re two different time periods. \u2026 The trend is (that job growth is) really starting to flatten out.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe health care industry was a bright spot during the recession, but job estimates show that it didn\u2019t rebound from the state budget cuts the way O\u2019Brien reported. The most recent state estimates show that jobs in the health care industry, combined with social assistance, have remained flat or even decreased \u2013 not gained \u2013 since April 2011, when the House initially passed the budget. And since the state budget took effect in June 2011, the industry has lost about 700 jobs. There is one measure that shows some growth, but it was only a snapshot and doesn\u2019t cover the time period O\u2019Brien was talking about. Based on the most authoritative numbers that include the most recent data, we rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11032"}
