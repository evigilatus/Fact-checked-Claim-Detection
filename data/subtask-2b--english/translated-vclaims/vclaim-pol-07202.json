On September 30, 2014, the mayor's debate was asked about the city's huge pension debts. Elorza blamed one of his opponents, Vincent A. \"Paddy\" Chayancy Jr., independent, to sign the approval decree when he was mayor, which provided for 5 and 6 per cent of the cost of living for pensioners. Now we have a pensioner who collects $17,000 a month. ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ \"Exempt from taxes,\" said Elorza. \"How many families in Providence don't get $17,000 a year.\" \"You can thank the court for that,\" Cianci Reap. We wondered whether that monthly salary of $17,000 - the equivalent of $204,000 in tax-free annual income - was real. Providence officials sent us the 2014 list of 49 persons receiving the largest retirement payments. Thirty-seven retirees receive cheques totalling more than $100,000 per year, or at least $8,333 per month. All but eight firefighters. The rest were police officers. At least 28 of these 37 disability pensions are tax-exempt. Four more may be disability pensions, but it's not clear from the list because the money will go to the surviving spouse. At the top of the list are Gilbert McLaughlin of Warwick, who retired in October 1991 with an occasional disability pension. He served as President for 15 months prior to retirement, citing health problems arising from a work-related injury to his neck and shoulders. Annual payment from the city in May 2014: $196,813. This is $16,401 a month, or $599 shy of the $17,000 Elorza mentioned. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy, January 20, 2012, McLaughlin retired as city fireman at age 55. Upon retirement, his base salary was $63,537 per year, plus $6,959 for the length of life of 36 years, 6 months and 11 days of service. Total: $70,496. He received 83.7 per cent of this amount as his pension, or $59,001 per annum, according to Lawrence J. Mancini, the city's Acting Director of Administration and Finance. His payments rose to this extent because, as Mancini said, he received 5 per cent of the combined cost of living, which was increased to 6 per cent in 1996. (The second post of Chenchy as Mayor of Providence ran from 1991 for most of 2002). This was all part of a long-standing legal war on the city's pensions. The stage was set in 1977, near the beginning of the first mayor of Chechnya, when the General Assembly granted city unions a number of dominant seats on the city's retirement board. The change of the 1983 City Charter, when Chianxi was still in office, gave the Council additional power to make decisions regarding pensions. In 1989, after Joseph Paulino took office as mayor, the Board granted complex cost-of-living adjustments of 5 and 6 per cent to all current and future retirees in the area of public safety and 3 per cent to irregular workers. In 1991, in the midst of a judicial battle over pensions, Chianxi returned to office and signed a decree approving the seizure of certain benefits, which he will regret. In 2012, in an agreement negotiated by Mayor Angel Taveras with the police and fire unions, the city ended its large complex cost of living, and therefore its annual pension remains frozen at $196,813. To put this in context, the salary of the current fire chief, Clarence Kuna, is $164,736 per year, including the long-term wage. If McLaughlin's initial pension had risen with inflation, not by 5 or 6 percent, it would be $103 036 today, or just under $8,586 per month. Governor Jorge Elorza said: \"We have a pensioner who collects $17,000 a month. ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ \"Free of taxes\" The biggest retirement check in the city goes to a retired firefighter who gets $16,401. Although Elorda overestimated the amount a little bit, it's close enough to appreciate his statement.
