This is Joe Biden\u2019s house. ... seems legit.\" The tweet has been shared more than 50,000 times.\nThe salary of a U.S. senator rose to $174,000 in 2009, the year Biden left the chamber to become vice president. But Eric Trump\u2019s tweet juxtaposed that figure with the photo of a mansion that hasn\u2019t belonged to Biden in nearly 25 years. Biden bought the house in 1975 for $185,000, then sold it in 1996 after major renovations.\nThe image comes from a Wall Street Journal article about Biden\u2019s real estate investments. Wall Street Journal staffers confirmed they used Pictometry, an aerial imaging service, to download the satellite image of the property. The same article reported that Biden purchased the DuPont mansion in 1975 for $185,000, and sold it in 1996 for $1.2 million. He does not currently own it.\u00a0\nA parcel search for the Delaware address on New Castle County\u2019s website confirmed that Biden sold the property in 1996. The New York Times also reported the sale in a 2008 article, which said Biden initially bought the property after he learned it was slated for demolition.\u00a0\nThe Eric Trump tweet cites a Senate salary figure of $174,000 to suggest that the mansion would have been beyond Biden\u2019s means. Biden\u2019s salary as a senator varied from $42,500 a year when he began serving in the Senate in 1973, to $169,300 by the time he left the chamber in January 2009. As vice president, he earned up to $230,700 a year, and his wife, Jill, continued her teaching career.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut after he left office, both Bidens wrote books, and his financial disclosure form lists dozens of speaking engagements and book-tour events that typically earned him five- and six-figure payments each.
