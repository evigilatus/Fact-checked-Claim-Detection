The committee vote was scheduled for Monday, Dec. 3. The Senate and Assembly could vote as early as Tuesday, Dec. 4, sending the matters to Walker for his signature.\nThe discussion of possible changes began a single day after Walker lost his bid for a third term.\nAssembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, said he would discuss whether to look at limiting Evers' power with Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau.\nThat prompted us to dust off the Flip-O-Meter, which we use to examine views on particular issues.\nRequisite footnote: We\u2019re not rating whether any change is good politics or good policy. Just whether the individual -- or in the case, the GOP leadership -- has been consistent.\nIn a word: No.\nChanges made in 2011\nThere were a host of changes made after the 2010 election that vested more power in the governor\u2019s office. Some were arcane and procedural, but had a major impact.\nConsider Act 21.\nIt gave the governor new powers to approve or prevent the adoption of administrative rules. Previously, the rules were written by state agencies and reviewed by the Legislature before they could take effect.\nAdministrative rules include more specifics than state statutes and carry the force of law.\nThe bill was introduced by the Joint Committee on Organization at the request of Walker and former state Rep. Thomas Tiffany, R-Hazelhurst. Tiffany is now in the Senate.\nWhy was it necessary?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, when a rule comes out of an agency, the Governor must approve the rule,\" Tiffany said in a March 3, 2011, e-newsletter. \"We are making the Governor take responsibility for his agencies.\"\nChanges proposed in 2018\nNow, following the defeat of Walker in the Nov. 6 election, Republicans have proposed legislation that would reverse the 2011 law.\nThe change is one of many included in the package of legislation Republican lawmakers have laid out for the so-called \"lame-duck\" session. Several others would limit the power of Evers and Josh Kaul, the Democrat who defeated Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel.\nOne provision could allow Republican lawmakers to prevent the state from getting out of a lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, something Evers has promised to do.\nAnother provision would require Evers to get permission from lawmakers to ban guns in the state Capitol or make other changes to security provisions there \u2014 including increasing the number of police officers who patrol the statehouse.\nThe administration would also be required to report if the governor pardons anyone or his aides release anyone from prison early.\nThe legislation would also restrict Evers' power over rules used to implement state laws and limit his flexibility in how he runs many public benefits programs. Their plan would provide more legislative authority over state agencies.\nAnd it would require Evers to go along with a plan aimed at reducing premiums for insurance plans offered through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplaces for individuals.\n\"I view this as a repudiation of the last election. I will take any steps possible to assure the people of Wisconsin that I will not invalidate those votes,\" Evers told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in an interview.\nRepublican legislative leaders say the plan will re-balance power between the legislative and executive branches. GOP leaders also said the plan prevents Evers from undoing laws passed under Republican control.\n\"Maybe we made some mistakes giving too much power to Gov. Walker and I'd be open to looking at that to see if there are areas we should change that,\" Vos told reporters a day after the general election.\n\"The manufactured outrage by the Democrats right now is hilarious,\" Fitzgerald told WISN's conservative radio host Jay Weber in a Dec. 3 interview. \"I mean, most of these items are things (that) we never really had to kind of address because guess what \u2014 we trusted Scott Walker and the administration to be able to manage the back and forth with the Legislature.\n\"We don\u2019t trust Tony Evers right now in a lot of these areas.\"\nOur rating\nIn this case, the change of position is clear.\nIn 2011, the Legislature moved to give the governor more authority.\nIn 2018, they are doing the reverse.\nThat\u2019s a Full Flop.\n Share the Facts 2018-12-04 20:58:08 UTC   PolitiFact    9 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Full Flop  Republican leaders are moving quickly to undo some of the powers they granted the governor after the 2010 election, when Scott Walker won and the GOP gained full control of the Legislature.
