J.B. Pritzker recently proposed a series of rates he says would generate billions in new revenue while raising taxes only on the wealthiest 3% of Illinoisans, those reporting income of more than $250,000. Before lawmakers can take up his proposal, however, they must first add a question to the 2020 ballot asking voters to replace language in the state constitution that mandates a flat income tax.\nWhile Democrats control the legislature, approval of any referendum to change the constitution requires an extraordinary majority of votes, so securing approval for Pritzker\u2019s ballot question is far from certain. Meanwhile, interest groups representing both sides in the debate are busy trying to sway public opinion.\nWe recently rated False a claim from a business-linked group opposing Pritzker\u2019s plan, which said it contained a \"permanent jobs tax on middle-class families.\" Now, Think Big Illinois, a Pritzker-backed group, is out with an ad pushing for a graduated tax that makes its own puzzling assertion.\n\"In almost every state with an income tax, wealthy people pay a higher tax rate than the middle class,\" a narrator says in the ad, as a map highlights the states with graduated income taxes under the banner \"STATES WITH A FAIR INCOME TAX SYSTEM.\"\nIt\u2019s true Illinois is one of just nine states that currently tax income at a flat rate, while 32 others levy taxes under a series of graduated rates and a handful have no state income tax. Pritzker\u2019s proposal, if approved as is, would indeed charge higher rates only on the wealthy. But that isn\u2019t necessarily the case with graduated tax systems in other states.\n\u2018Fair tax\u2019 vs graduated tax\nJust as Pritzker\u2019s opponents have branded the graduated tax a \"jobs tax,\" Pritzker and his supporters label it a \"fair tax,\" both in the text of Think Big Illinois\u2019 ad and in conversation.\nBy \"fair,\" the Pritzker camp means a tax system that charges higher rates on higher levels of income.\n\"I\u2019ve said from the beginning that it doesn\u2019t make sense that I pay the same rate as a teacher or first responder,\" Pritzker, a billionaire three times over, said in a statement included in a recent press release about the proposed language for his constitutional amendment.\nBut just because a state applies different rates to different amounts of income doesn\u2019t mean only the wealthy pay top rates. In neighboring Missouri, for example, the state\u2019s top rate of 5.4% is levied on all income over $8,424, according to the Tax Foundation, which compiles state tax rates and brackets annually. Alabama\u2019s top rate kicks in even sooner \u2014 after the first $3,000 for single filers.\nEight other states also begin levying their highest rates on income below $25,000, the Tax Foundation\u2019s chart shows. That\u2019s a far cry from what anyone would consider \"wealthy.\"\nSo we asked Think Big Illinois what their ad meant when it said \"almost every state\" with an income tax applied higher rates to the wealthy, given that nine states levy the same tax on everyone and a total of 10 others apply their top rates to all but the poorest.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman responded with an email that did not directly address the language used by the narrator in the ad.\n\"Almost every state with an income tax employs a graduated tax system like a fair tax that taxes those with higher incomes at a higher rate,\" wrote Lara Sisselman, the group\u2019s communications director. \"Illinois is just one of nine states that has an income tax, but taxes everyone at the same rate.\"\nTaxing the 'middle class'\nWith nearly half of income-taxing states not charging higher rates to the wealthy, it\u2019s clear the ad\u2019s claim is off base. But it also got us wondering how the other graduated-tax states compare when it comes to taxing the middle class.\nThere is no universally accepted definition of \"middle class,\" but a reasonable barometer is supplied by the U.S. Census, which charts median income of households, families and single-person homes for each state. Comparing those federal guideposts with the Tax Foundation\u2019s chart, we found 14 states in which people making the median income for any household type would clearly not pay the state\u2019s top rate on any dollar they make.\nEven California\u2019s fourth-highest rate for single filers applies only to income over $286,492, for instance. And in New York, only earnings greater than $215,400 for single filers and $323,200 for married couples are subject to the state\u2019s second-highest rate, while its highest is reserved for amounts exceeding $1 million.\nBut there are another eight states where the top rate kicks in not far from the median income or at a level many academic definitions of \"middle class\" would still appear to encompass.\nThe median income listed by the Census for the category of people that most closely approximates single filers in Arkansas, for example, is just over $25,000, while the state\u2019s top tax rate kicks in after the first $37,200 a taxpayer earns. Then there\u2019s Louisiana, where median family income is just over $60,000, while the top tax rate for married couples applies only after the first $100,000 they make. Still, it\u2019d be a tough sell to argue that all taxpayers who pay top rates on some of their income in those states are necessarily wealthy, especially depending on family size.\nOur ruling\nThink Big Illinois\u2019 ad claims that, \"in almost every state with an income tax, wealthy people pay a higher tax rate than the middle class.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Pritzker-backed group noted that Illinois is one of just nine states that tax income at a flat rate. Images that accompany the ad hint at that, but the narration ignores any nuance.\nEven by the most conservative definition, there are 19 states with income taxes that do not apply higher rates to the earnings of the wealthy \u2014 nine flat tax states and 10 with graduated taxes with rates that top out at income below $25,000. Add in another eight states where top rates for married couples kick in somewhere between $31,000 and $104,000 and the Think Big claim becomes even more dubious.\nThat means far from \"almost every\" income-taxing state levies a higher rate on top earners, earning this claim a rating of Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00738"}
