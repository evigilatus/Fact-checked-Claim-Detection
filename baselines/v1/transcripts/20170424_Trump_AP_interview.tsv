0001	Julie Pace	I do want to talk to you about the 100 days.
0002	Donald Trump	Good.
0003	Julie Pace	I want to ask a few questions on some topics that are happening toward the end of the interview. Did you see Aya
0004	SYSTEM	[Hijazi, an EgyptianAmerican charity worker who had been detained in the country for nearly three years]
0005	Julie Pace	...
0006	Julie Pace	Can you tell me a little bit about how that came about?
0007	Donald Trump	No, just  you know, I asked the government to let her out...
0008	Donald Trump	You know Obama worked on it for three years, got zippo, zero.
0009	Julie Pace	How did you hear about this story?
0010	Donald Trump	Many people, human rights people, are talking about it.
0011	Donald Trump	It's an incredible thing, especially when you meet her.
0012	Donald Trump	You realize  I mean, she was in a rough place. Did you have to strike a deal with
0013	SYSTEM	[AbdelFattah]
0014	Donald Trump	elSissi over this?
0015	Donald Trump	No.
0016	Donald Trump	No deal.
0017	Donald Trump	He was here.
0018	Donald Trump	He  I said, "I really would appreciate it if you would look into this and let her out."
0019	Donald Trump	And as you know, she went through a trial.
0020	Donald Trump	And anyway, she was let go.
0021	Donald Trump	And not only she, it was a total of eight people... Yeah, it's funny One of the best chemistries I had was with
0022	SYSTEM	[Angela]
0023	Donald Trump	Merkel.
0024	Donald Trump	[Crosstalk
0025	Julie Pace	Really?
0026	Donald Trump	Chancellor Merkel.
0027	Donald Trump	And I guess somebody shouted out, "Shake her hand, shake her hand," you know.
0028	Donald Trump	But I never heard it.
0029	Donald Trump	But I had already shaken her hand four times.
0030	Donald Trump	You know, because we were together for a long time.
0031	Julie Pace	Did you expect you would have good chemistry with her?
0032	Donald Trump	No.
0033	Donald Trump	Because, um, I'm at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I'm at odds on immigration.
0034	Donald Trump	We had unbelievable chemistry.
0035	Donald Trump	And people have given me credit for having great chemistry with all of the leaders, including elSissi...
0036	Donald Trump	So it was a great thing to see that happen.
0037	Julie Pace	Do you feel like you have changed the office of the presidency, how the presidency can be used to effect change?
0038	Donald Trump	I think the 100 days is, you know, it's an artificial barrier.
0039	Donald Trump	It's not very meaningful.
0040	Donald Trump	I think I've established amazing relationships that will be used the four or eight years, whatever period of time I'm here.
0041	Donald Trump	I think for that I would be getting very high marks because I've established great relationships with countries, as President elSissi has shown and others have shown.
0042	Donald Trump	Well, if you look at the president of China, people said they've never seen anything like what's going on right now.
0043	Donald Trump	I really liked him a lot.
0044	Donald Trump	I think he liked me.
0045	Donald Trump	We have a great chemistry together...
0046	Donald Trump	I've developed great relationships with all of these leaders.
0047	Donald Trump	Nobody's written that.
0048	Donald Trump	In fact, they said, "Oh, well, he's not treating them nicely," because on NATO, I want them to pay up.
0049	Donald Trump	But I still get along with them great, and they will pay up.
0050	Donald Trump	In fact, with the Italian prime minister yesterday, you saw, we were joking, "Come on, you have to pay up, you have to pay up."
0051	Donald Trump	He'll pay.
0052	Julie Pace	Did he say that?
0053	Julie Pace	In your meeting?
0054	Julie Pace	Your private meeting?
0055	Donald Trump	He's going to end up paying.
0056	Donald Trump	But you know, nobody ever asked the question.
0057	Donald Trump	Nobody asked.
0058	Donald Trump	Nobody ever asked him to pay up.
0059	Donald Trump	So it's a different kind of a presidency.
0060	Julie Pace	Do you feel like that's one thing that you've changed, that you maybe are actually asking the direct questions about some of these things?
0061	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0062	Donald Trump	Let me give me an example.
0063	Donald Trump	A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F35 fighter jet.
0064	Donald Trump	It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget.
0065	Donald Trump	It was seven years behind schedule.
0066	Donald Trump	It was a disaster.
0067	Donald Trump	So I called in Lockheed and I said, "I'm sorry, we're going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing," or whoever else.
0068	Donald Trump	But Boeing.
0069	Donald Trump	And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth...
0070	Donald Trump	I saved $725 million on the 90 planes.
0071	Donald Trump	Just 90.
0072	Donald Trump	Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered.
0073	Donald Trump	On 90 planes I saved $725 million.
0074	Donald Trump	It's actually a little bit more than that, but it's $725 million.
0075	Donald Trump	Gen. Mattis, who had to sign the deal when it came to his office, said, "I've never seen anything like this in my life."
0076	Donald Trump	We went from a company that wanted more money for the planes to a company that cut.
0077	Donald Trump	And the reason they cut  same planes, same everything  was because of me.
0078	Donald Trump	I mean, because that's what I do.
0079	Donald Trump	Now if you multiply that times 3,000 planes, you know this is on 90 planes.
0080	Donald Trump	In fact, when the Prime Minister Abe of Japan came in because they bought a certain number of those...
0081	Donald Trump	The first thing he said to me, because it was right at the time I did it, he said, "Could I thank you?"
0082	Donald Trump	I said, "What?"
0083	Donald Trump	He said, "You saved us $100 million."
0084	Donald Trump	Because they got a $100 million savings on the 10 or 12 planes that they bought.
0085	Donald Trump	Nobody wrote that story.
0086	Donald Trump	Now you know that's a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of  it's between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order.
0087	Donald Trump	But this was only 90 of those 2,500 planes.
0088	Julie Pace	And you expect those savings to carry out across that full order?
0089	Donald Trump	More.
0090	Donald Trump	I'm gonna get more than that.
0091	Donald Trump	This was a thing that was out of control and now it's great. And the woman that runs Lockheed, Marillyn
0092	SYSTEM	[Hewson]
0093	Donald Trump	, she was great.
0094	Donald Trump	But all of a sudden it was a different kind of a thing.
0095	Donald Trump	You know?
0096	Julie Pace	Do you feel like you've been able to apply that kind of a relationship to your dealings with Congress as well?
0097	Donald Trump	I have great relationships with Congress.
0098	Donald Trump	I think we're doing very well and I think we have a great foundation for future things.
0099	Donald Trump	We're going to be applying, I shouldn't tell you this, but we're going to be announcing, probably on Wednesday, tax reform.
0100	Donald Trump	And it's  we've worked on it long and hard.
0101	Donald Trump	And you've got to understand, I've only been here now 93 days, 92 days.
0102	Donald Trump	President Obama took 17 months to do Obamacare.
0103	Donald Trump	I've been here 92 days but I've only been working on the health care, you know I had to get like a little bit of grounding right?
0104	Donald Trump	Health care started after 30 day, so I've been working on health care for 60 days...You know, we're very close.
0105	Donald Trump	And it's a great plan, you know, we have to get it approved.
0106	Julie Pace	Is it this deal that's between the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus, is that the deal you're looking at?
0107	Donald Trump	So the Republican Party has various groups, all great people.
0108	Donald Trump	They're great people.
0109	Donald Trump	But some are moderate, some are very conservative.
0110	Donald Trump	The Democrats don't seem to have that nearly as much.
0111	Donald Trump	You know the Democrats have, they don't have that.
0112	Donald Trump	The Republicans do have that.
0113	Donald Trump	And I think it's fine.
0114	Donald Trump	But you know there's a pretty vast area in there.
0115	Donald Trump	And I have a great relationship with all of them.
0116	Donald Trump	Now, we have government not closing.
0117	Donald Trump	I think we'll be in great shape on that.
0118	Donald Trump	It's going very well.
0119	Donald Trump	Obviously, that takes precedent.
0120	Julie Pace	That takes precedent over health care?
0121	Julie Pace	For next week?
0122	Donald Trump	Yeah, sure.
0123	Donald Trump	Next week.
0124	Donald Trump	Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier.
0125	Donald Trump	The press keeps talking about the hundred days.
0126	Donald Trump	But we've done a lot.
0127	Donald Trump	You have a list of things.
0128	Donald Trump	I don't have to read it.
0129	Julie Pace	You did put out though, as a candidate, you put out a 100day plan.
0130	Julie Pace	Do you feel like you should be held accountable to that plan?
0131	Donald Trump	Somebody, yeah, somebody put out the concept of a hundredday plan.
0132	Donald Trump	But yeah.
0133	Donald Trump	Well, I'm mostly there on most items. Go over the items, and I'll talk to you ...
0134	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]
0135	Donald Trump	But things change.
0136	Donald Trump	There has to be flexibility.
0137	Donald Trump	Let me give you an example.
0138	Donald Trump	President Xi, we have a, like, a really great relationship.
0139	Donald Trump	For me to call him a currency manipulator and then say, "By the way, I'd like you to solve the North Korean problem," doesn't work.
0140	Donald Trump	So you have to have a certain flexibility, Number One.
0141	Donald Trump	Number Two, from the time I took office till now, you know, it's a very exact thing.
0142	Donald Trump	It's not like generalities.
0143	Donald Trump	Do you want a Coke or anything?
0144	Julie Pace	I'm OK, thank you.
0145	Julie Pace	No...
0146	Donald Trump	But President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators.
0147	Donald Trump	Because there's a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever.
0148	Donald Trump	But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he's helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, "By the way, would you help us with North Korea?
0149	Donald Trump	And also, you're a currency manipulator."
0150	Donald Trump	It doesn't work that way.
0151	Julie Pace	Right.
0152	Donald Trump	And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness.
0153	Donald Trump	But you know some of them either don't get it, in which case they're very stupid people, or they just don't want to say it.
0154	Donald Trump	You know because of a couple of them said, "He didn't call them a currency manipulator."
0155	Donald Trump	Well, for two reasons.
0156	Donald Trump	Number One, he's not, since my time.
0157	Donald Trump	You know, very specific formula.
0158	Donald Trump	You would think it's like generalities, it's not.
0159	Donald Trump	They have  they've actually  their currency's gone up.
0160	Donald Trump	So it's a very, very specific formula.
0161	Donald Trump	And I said, "How badly have they been,"... they said, "Since you got to office they have not manipulated their currency."
0162	Donald Trump	That's Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea.
0163	Donald Trump	Now maybe that'll work out or maybe it won't.
0164	Donald Trump	Can you imagine?
0165	Donald Trump	...
0166	Julie Pace	So in terms of the 100day plan that you did put out during the campaign, do you feel, though, that people should hold you accountable to this in terms of judging success?
0167	Donald Trump	No, because much of the foundation's been laid.
0168	Donald Trump	Things came up.
0169	Donald Trump	I'll give you an example.
0170	Donald Trump	I didn't put Supreme Court judge on the 100 day plan, and I got a Supreme Court judge.
0171	Julie Pace	I think it's on there.
0172	Donald Trump	I don't know...
0173	Julie Pace	Begin the process of selecting.
0174	Julie Pace	You actually exceeded on this one.
0175	Julie Pace	This says, "Begin the process of selecting a replacement."
0176	Donald Trump	That's the biggest thing I've done.
0177	Julie Pace	Do you consider that your biggest success?
0178	Donald Trump	Well, I  first of all I think he's a great man.
0179	Donald Trump	I think he will be a great, great justice of the Supreme Court.
0180	Donald Trump	I have always heard that the selection and the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge is the biggest thing a president can do.
0181	Donald Trump	Don't forget, he could be there for 40 years....
0182	Donald Trump	He's a young man.
0183	Donald Trump	I've always heard that that's the biggest thing.
0184	Donald Trump	Now, I would say that defense is the biggest thing.
0185	Donald Trump	You know, to be honest, there are a number of things.
0186	Donald Trump	But I've always heard that the highest calling is the nomination of a Supreme Court justice.
0187	Donald Trump	I've done one in my first 70 days.
0188	Donald Trump	Our military is so proud.
0189	Donald Trump	They were not proud at all.
0190	Donald Trump	They had their heads down.
0191	Donald Trump	Now they have their heads up...
0192	Donald Trump	I'm rebuilding the military.
0193	Donald Trump	We have great people.
0194	Donald Trump	We have great things in place.
0195	Donald Trump	We have tremendous borders.
0196	Donald Trump	I mention the F35 because if I can save $725 million  look at that, that's a massive amount of money.
0197	Donald Trump	And I'll save more as we make more planes. If I can save that on a small number of planes  Gen. Mattis said, "I've never seen anything like this," because he had to sign the ultimate
0198	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0199	Donald Trump	...
0200	Donald Trump	He had to sign the ultimate, you know.
0201	Donald Trump	He said, "I've never seen anything like this before, as long as I've been in the military."
0202	Donald Trump	You know, that kind of cutting.
0203	Julie Pace	Right. Now, if I can do that
0204	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0205	Julie Pace	... As an example, the aircraft carriers, billions of dollars, the Gerald Ford, billions and billions over budget.
0206	Donald Trump	That won't happen.
0207	Julie Pace	Is that something you're going to take on?
0208	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0209	Julie Pace	But as we order the other ones, because they want to order 12, the other ones are going to come in much less expensive...
0210	Julie Pace	Can I ask you, over your first 100 days  you're not quite there yet  how do you feel like the office has changed you?
0211	Donald Trump	Well the one thing I would say  and I say this to people  I never realized how big it was. Everything's so
0212	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0213	Donald Trump	like, you know the orders are so massive.
0214	Donald Trump	I was talking to 
0215	Julie Pace	You mean the responsibility of it, or do you mean 
0216	Donald Trump	Number One, there's great responsibility.
0217	Donald Trump	When it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria.
0218	Donald Trump	I'm saying to myself, "You know, this is more than just like, 79 missiles.
0219	Donald Trump	This is death that's involved," because people could have been killed.
0220	Donald Trump	This is risk that's involved, because if the missile goes off and goes in a city or goes in a civilian area  you know, the boats were hundreds of miles away  and if this missile goes off and lands in the middle of a town or a hamlet .... every decision is much harder than you'd normally make.
0221	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0222	Donald Trump	...
0223	Donald Trump	This is involving death and life and so many things....
0224	Donald Trump	So it's far more responsibility.
0225	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0226	Donald Trump	....The financial cost of everything is so massive, every agency.
0227	Donald Trump	This is thousands of times bigger, the United States, than the biggest company in the world.
0228	Donald Trump	The secondlargest company in the world is the Defense Department.
0229	Donald Trump	The thirdlargest company in the world is Social Security.
0230	Donald Trump	The fourthlargest  you know, you go down the list.
0231	Julie Pace	Right.
0232	Donald Trump	It's massive.
0233	Donald Trump	And every agency is, like, bigger than any company.
0234	Donald Trump	So you know, I really just see the bigness of it all, but also the responsibility.
0235	Donald Trump	And the human responsibility.
0236	Donald Trump	You know, the human life that's involved in some of the decisions.
0237	Julie Pace	You've talked a little bit about the way that you've brought some business skills into the office.
0238	Julie Pace	Is there anything from your business background that just doesn't translate into the presidency, that just simply is not applicable to this job?
0239	Donald Trump	Well in business, you don't necessarily need heart, whereas here, almost everything affects people.
0240	Donald Trump	So if you're talking about health care  you have health care in business but you're trying to just negotiate a good price on health care, et cetera, et cetera.
0241	Donald Trump	You're providing health. This is
0242	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0243	Donald Trump	.
0244	Donald Trump	Here, everything, pretty much everything you do in government, involves heart, whereas in business, most things don't involve heart.
0245	Julie Pace	What's that switch been like for you?
0246	Donald Trump	In fact, in business you're actually better off without it.
0247	Julie Pace	What's making that switch been like for you?
0248	Donald Trump	You have to love people.
0249	Donald Trump	And if you love people, such a big responsibility.
0250	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0251	Donald Trump	You can take any single thing, including even taxes.
0252	Donald Trump	I mean we're going to be doing major tax reform. Here's part of your story, it's going to be a big
0253	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0254	Donald Trump	.
0255	Donald Trump	Everybody's saying, "Oh, he's delaying."
0256	Donald Trump	I'm not delaying anything. I'll tell you the other thing is
0257	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0258	Donald Trump	.
0259	Donald Trump	I used to get great press.
0260	Donald Trump	I get the worst press.
0261	Donald Trump	I get such dishonest reporting with the media.
0262	Donald Trump	That's another thing that really has  I've never had anything like it before.
0263	Donald Trump	It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said, "Well the one thing good is now I'll get good press."
0264	Donald Trump	And it got worse.
0265	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0266	Donald Trump	So that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me.
0267	Donald Trump	I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty.
0268	Julie Pace	But in terms of tax reform, how are you going to roll that out next week?
0269	Donald Trump	Well I'm going to roll probably on Wednesday, around Wednesday of next week, we're putting out a massive tax reform  business and for people  we want to do both. We've been working on it
0270	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0271	Donald Trump	.
0272	Donald Trump	Secretary Mnuchin is a very talented person, very smart. Very successful
0273	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0274	Donald Trump	.... We're going to be putting that out on Wednesday or shortly thereafter. Let me leave a little room just in case
0275	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0276	Donald Trump	.... And that's a big story, because a lot of people think I'm going to put it out much later.
0277	Julie Pace	Do you have any details on that in terms of rates?
0278	Donald Trump	Only in terms that it will be a massive tax cut.
0279	Donald Trump	It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever.
0280	Donald Trump	Maybe the biggest tax cut we've ever had...
0281	Julie Pace	Obviously, that's going to come in a week where you're going to be running up against the deadline for keeping the government open.
0282	Julie Pace	If you get a bill on your desk that does not include funding for the wall, will you sign it?
0283	Donald Trump	I don't know yet.
0284	Donald Trump	People want the border wall.
0285	Donald Trump	My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it  you've been to many of the rallies.
0286	Donald Trump	OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall.
0287	Donald Trump	My base, which is a big base I think my base is 45 percent.
0288	Donald Trump	You know, it's funny.
0289	Donald Trump	The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college.
0290	Donald Trump	Big, big, big advantage.
0291	Donald Trump	I've always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college  but it's a whole different campaign
0292	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0293	Donald Trump	.
0294	Donald Trump	The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it.
0295	Donald Trump	They want to see the wall, they want to see security.
0296	Donald Trump	Now, it just came out that they're 73 percent down.... That's a tremendous achievement.... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it's going lower.
0297	Donald Trump	Now, people aren't coming because they know they're not going to get through, and there isn't crime.
0298	Donald Trump	You know the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that?
0299	SYSTEM	[Unintelligible]
0300	Donald Trump	Now, much of that's stopped because they can't get through.
0301	Julie Pace	It sounds like maybe you're beginning to send a message that if you do get a spending bill that doesn't have border funding in there, you would sign it.
0302	Donald Trump	Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I'm seeing.
0303	Donald Trump	I'm seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive.
0304	Julie Pace	What do you think the estimate on it would be?
0305	Donald Trump	Oh I'm seeing numbers  $24 billion, I think I'll do it for $10 billion or less.
0306	Donald Trump	That's not a lot of money relative to what we're talking about.
0307	Donald Trump	If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in  and we'll stop all of it.
0308	Donald Trump	But if we stop 1 percent of the drugs because we have the wall  they're coming around in certain areas, but if you have a wall, they can't do it because it's a real wall.
0309	Donald Trump	That's a tremendously good investment, 1 percent.
0310	Donald Trump	The drugs pouring through on the southern border are unbelievable.
0311	Donald Trump	We're becoming a drug culture, there's so much.
0312	Donald Trump	And most of it's coming from the southern border.
0313	Donald Trump	The wall will stop the drugs.
0314	Julie Pace	But, just trying to nail you down on it one more time, will you sign a spending bill if it doesn't have 
0315	Donald Trump	I don't want to comment.
0316	Donald Trump	I just don't know yet.
0317	Donald Trump	I mean, I have to see what's going on.
0318	Donald Trump	I really do.
0319	Donald Trump	But the wall's a very important thing to  not only my base, but to the people.
0320	Donald Trump	And even if it wasn't, I mean I'll do things that aren't necessarily popular....
0321	Donald Trump	The wall is very important to stopping drugs.
0322	Julie Pace	If you don't have a funding stream, your message to your base is what?
0323	Donald Trump	My base understands the wall is going to get built, whether I have it funded here or if I get it funded shortly thereafter, that wall's getting built, OK?
0324	Donald Trump	One hundred percent.
0325	Donald Trump	One hundred percent it's getting built.
0326	Donald Trump	And it's also getting built for much less money  I hope you get this  than these people are estimating.
0327	Donald Trump	The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall.
0328	Donald Trump	It's not going to cost anywhere near that.
0329	Julie Pace	You think $10 billion or less.
0330	Donald Trump	I think $10 billion or less.
0331	Donald Trump	And if I do a superduper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more.
0332	Donald Trump	But it's not going to be anywhere near those kind of numbers.
0333	Donald Trump	And they're using those numbers they're using the high numbers to make it sound impalatable.
0334	Donald Trump	And the fact it's going to cost much less money, just like the airplane I told you about, which I hope you can write about.
0335	SYSTEM	[Interview goes off the record]
0336	Donald Trump	They had a quote from me that NATO's obsolete.
0337	Donald Trump	But they didn't say why it was obsolete.
0338	Donald Trump	I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn't in government.
0339	Donald Trump	People don't go around asking about NATO if I'm building a building in Manhattan, right?
0340	Donald Trump	So they asked me, Wolf... asked me about NATO, and I said two things.
0341	Donald Trump	NATO's obsolete  not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO  NATO is obsolete, and I said, "And the reason it's obsolete is because of the fact they don't focus on terrorism."
0342	Donald Trump	You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.
0343	Julie Pace	What specifically has NATO changed?
0344	SYSTEM	[Citing Wall Street Journal Article]
0345	Julie Pace	...
0346	Donald Trump	I did an interview with Wolf Blitzer, and I said NATO was obsolete  I said two things  obsolete, and the country's aren't paying.
0347	Donald Trump	I was right about both.
0348	Donald Trump	I took such heat for about three days on both, because nobody ever criticized NATO.
0349	Donald Trump	I took heat like you wouldn't believe.
0350	Donald Trump	And then some expert on NATO said, "You know, Trump is right."
0351	Donald Trump	But I said it was obsolete because they weren't focused on terror...
0352	Donald Trump	It's not fair that we're paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when they're supposed to be paying 2 percent.
0353	Donald Trump	And I'm very strong on it and I'm going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month."
0354	Julie Pace	This morning you tweeted that after the possible terrorist attack in Paris, that it will have a big effect on the upcoming French election.
0355	Julie Pace	What did you mean by that?
0356	Donald Trump	Well, I think it will have a big effect on who people are going to vote for in the election.
0357	Julie Pace	Do you think it's going to help Marine Le Pen?
0358	Donald Trump	I think so.
0359	Julie Pace	Do you believe that she should be the president?
0360	Donald Trump	No, I have no comment on that, but I think that it'll probably help her because she is the strongest on borders and she is the strongest on what's been going on in France.
0361	Julie Pace	Do you worry at all that by saying that, that a terrorist attack would have an impact on a democratic election, that it would actually embolden terrorists to try to .
0362	Donald Trump	No.
0363	Donald Trump	Look, everybody is making predictions who is going to win.
0364	Donald Trump	I am no different than you, you could say the same thing...
0365	Julie Pace	I just wonder if you are encouraging, you are the president of the United States, so to say that you worry that it encourages terrorists ...
0366	Donald Trump	No, I am no different than  no, I think it discourages terrorists, I think it discourages.
0367	Donald Trump	I think what we've done on the border discourages it.
0368	Donald Trump	I think that my stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism.
0369	Donald Trump	I'm not going to have it in this country.
0370	Donald Trump	I'm not going to let what happened to France and other places happen here.
0371	Donald Trump	And it's already largely, you know  we have tens  we have hundreds of thousands of people that have been allowed into our country that should not be here.
0372	Donald Trump	They shouldn't be here.
0373	Donald Trump	We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever.
0374	Donald Trump	They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country.
0375	Donald Trump	It's a big mistake.
0376	Julie Pace	Just so that I am clear.
0377	Julie Pace	You are not endorsing her for the office, but you are 
0378	Donald Trump	I am not endorsing her and I didn't mention her name.
0379	Julie Pace	Right, I just wanted to make sure I have that clear.
0380	Donald Trump	I believe whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism and whoever is the toughest at the borders will do well at the election.
0381	Donald Trump	I am not saying that person is going to win, she is not even favored to win, you know.
0382	Donald Trump	Right now, she is in second place.
0383	Julie Pace	I have a question on the markets, actually.
0384	Julie Pace	One thing that I think has been different about this White House is that you do point to the markets as a sign of progress.
0385	Julie Pace	Do you worry, though  I mean, the markets go up and down.
0386	Donald Trump	You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent.
0387	Donald Trump	But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since.
0388	Donald Trump	Five hundred thousand.... As an example, Ford, General Motors.
0389	Donald Trump	I've had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma, he comes up, he says, "Only because of you am I making this massive investment."
0390	Donald Trump	Intel, only because of you....
0391	Donald Trump	The press never writes that.
0392	Julie Pace	What about NAFTA?
0393	Julie Pace	What's the plan on NAFTA?
0394	Donald Trump	What would you like to know?
0395	Julie Pace	I would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating.
0396	Donald Trump	I am very upset with NAFTA.
0397	Donald Trump	I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States.
0398	Donald Trump	It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico.
0399	Donald Trump	Most people don't even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada.
0400	Donald Trump	You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.
0401	Julie Pace	Is your plan still, though, to renegotiate the whole deal?
0402	Donald Trump	I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.
0403	Julie Pace	Termination is still on the table.
0404	Donald Trump	Absolutely.
0405	Donald Trump	If they don't treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA.
0406	Julie Pace	What's a timeline for that decision?
0407	Donald Trump	It's a sixmonth termination clause, I have the right to do it, it's a sixmonth clause.
0408	Julie Pace	If I could fit a couple of more topics.
0409	Julie Pace	Jeff Sessions, your attorney general, is taking a tougher line suddenly on Julian Assange, saying that arresting him is a priority.
0410	Julie Pace	You were supportive of what WikiLeaks was doing during the campaign with the release of the Clinton emails.
0411	Julie Pace	Do you think that arresting Assange is a priority for the United States?
0412	Donald Trump	When Wikileaks came out... never heard of Wikileaks, never heard of it.
0413	Donald Trump	When Wikileaks came out, all I was just saying is, "Well, look at all this information here, this is pretty good stuff."
0414	Donald Trump	You know, they tried to hack the Republican, the RNC, but we had good defenses.
0415	Donald Trump	They didn't have defenses, which is pretty bad management.
0416	Donald Trump	But we had good defenses, they tried to hack both of them.
0417	Donald Trump	They weren't able to get through to Republicans.
0418	Donald Trump	No, I found it very interesting when I read this stuff and I said, "Wow."
0419	Donald Trump	It was just a figure of speech.
0420	Donald Trump	I said, "Well, look at this.
0421	Donald Trump	It's good reading."
0422	Julie Pace	But that didn't mean that you supported what Assange is doing?
0423	Donald Trump	No, I don't support or unsupport.
0424	Donald Trump	It was just information.
0425	Donald Trump	They shouldn't have allowed it to get out.
0426	Donald Trump	If they had the proper defensive devices on their internet, you know, equipment, they wouldn't even allow the FBI.
0427	Donald Trump	How about this  they get hacked, and the FBI goes to see them, and they won't let the FBI see their server.
0428	Donald Trump	But do you understand, nobody ever writes it. Why wouldn't
0429	SYSTEM	[John]
0430	Donald Trump	Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server?
0431	Donald Trump	They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainianbased.
0432	Julie Pace	CrowdStrike?
0433	Donald Trump	That's what I heard.
0434	Donald Trump	I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that's what I heard.
0435	Donald Trump	But they brought in another company to investigate the server.
0436	Donald Trump	Why didn't they allow the FBI in to investigate the server?
0437	Donald Trump	I mean, there is so many things that nobody writes about.
0438	Donald Trump	It's incredible.
0439	Julie Pace	Can I just ask you, though  do you believe it is a priority for the United States, or it should be a priority, to arrest Julian Assange?
0440	Donald Trump	I am not involved in that decision, but if Jeff Sessions wants to do it, it's OK with me.
0441	Donald Trump	I didn't know about that decision, but if they want to do it, it's OK with me.
0442	Julie Pace	On Iran, which is another thing you talked a lot on the campaign 
0443	Donald Trump	And the other thing that we should go after is the leakers...
0444	Julie Pace	On Iran, you also talked about it quite a bit on the campaign trail.
0445	Julie Pace	And you said in the press conference yesterday that you think that Iran is violating the spirit of the agreement.
0446	Julie Pace	When you say that, do you mean in terms of the actual nuclear accord, or do you mean what they are doing in the region?
0447	Donald Trump	In terms of what they are doing all over the Middle East and beyond.
0448	Julie Pace	So you believe that they are complying with the agreement?
0449	Donald Trump	No, I don't say that.
0450	Donald Trump	I say that I believe they have broken the spirit of the agreement.
0451	Donald Trump	There is a spirit to agreements, and they have broken it.
0452	Julie Pace	In terms of what they are doing elsewhere in the Middle East?
0453	Donald Trump	In terms of what they are doing of all over.
0454	Julie Pace	When you talk to European leaders, when you talk to Merkel, for example, or Teresa May, what do they say about the nuclear deal?
0455	Julie Pace	Do they want you to stay in that deal?
0456	Donald Trump	I don't talk to them about it.
0457	Julie Pace	You don't talk to them about the Iran deal?
0458	Donald Trump	I mention it, but it's very personal when I talk to them, you know, it's confidential.
0459	Donald Trump	No, they have their own opinions.
0460	Donald Trump	I don't say that they are different than my opinions, but I'd rather have you ask them that question.
0461	Julie Pace	At this point, do you believe that you will stay in the nuclear deal?
0462	Donald Trump	It's possible that we won't.
0463	Julie Pace	Dreamers, you've talked about them, you've talked about heart earlier.
0464	Julie Pace	This is one area where you have talked 
0465	Donald Trump	No, we aren't looking to do anything right now.
0466	Donald Trump	Look, the dreamers... this is an interesting case, they left and they came back and he's got some problems, it's a little different than the dreamer case, right?
0467	Donald Trump	But we are putting MS13 in jail and getting them the hell out of our country.
0468	Donald Trump	They've taken over towns and cities and we are being really brutal with MS13, and that's what we should be.
0469	Donald Trump	They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as alQaida, which is a hell of a reference.
0470	Donald Trump	So we are moving criminals out of our country and we are getting them out in record numbers and those are the people we are after.
0471	Donald Trump	We are not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals.
0472	Julie Pace	And that's going to be the policy of your administration to allow the dreamers to stay?
0473	Donald Trump	Yes.
0474	Donald Trump	Yes.
0475	Donald Trump	That's our policy.
0476	Donald Trump	I am not saying... longterm, we are going to have to fix the problem, the whole immigration problem.
0477	Donald Trump	But I will tell you Right now we have a great gentleman, one of my real stars is Gen. Kelly, now Secretary Kelly.
0478	Donald Trump	We are down 73 percent at the border, we are cleaning out cities and towns of hardline criminals, some of the worst people on earth, people that rape and kill women, people that are killing people just for the sake of having fun.
0479	Donald Trump	They are being thrown in jails and they are being... all over the country and nobody's ever done it like us, so we are being unbelievably thorough with that.
0480	Donald Trump	We are out in Long Island cleaning out the MS13 scum, they are all scum, that's probably the worst gang anywhere on Earth...
0481	Julie Pace	A lot of the dreamers have been hoping to hear something from you.
0482	Julie Pace	I don't want to give them the wrong message with this.
0483	Donald Trump	Here is what they can hear The dreamers should rest easy.
0484	Donald Trump	OK?
0485	Donald Trump	I'll give you that. The dreamers should rest easy...
0486	SYSTEM	[An aide talks about Trump's address to Congress]
0487	Donald Trump	A lot of the people have said that, some people said it was the single best speech ever made in that chamber.
0488	Julie Pace	You seem like you enjoyed it.
0489	Donald Trump	I did.
0490	Donald Trump	I did.
0491	Donald Trump	I believed in it and I enjoyed it.
0492	Donald Trump	It was a great feeling to introduce the wife of a great young soldier who died getting us very valuable information.
0493	Donald Trump	Have you seen the tremendous success?...
0494	Donald Trump	That's another thing that nobody talks about.
0495	Donald Trump	Have you seen the tremendous success we've had in the Middle East with the ISIS? When
0496	SYSTEM	[Haider al]
0497	Donald Trump	Abadi left from Iraq, he said Trump has more success in eight weeks than Obama had in eight years.... We have had tremendous success, but we don't talk about it.
0498	Donald Trump	We don't talk about it.
0499	Julie Pace	Do you mean you don't talk about it personally because you don't want to talk about it?
0500	Donald Trump	I don't talk about it.
0501	Donald Trump	No.
0502	Donald Trump	And the generals don't talk about it.
0503	Julie Pace	You had put a request into the Pentagon to put forward an ISIS plan within 30 days.
0504	Julie Pace	I know they have sent that over.
0505	Julie Pace	Have you accepted a plan?
0506	Julie Pace	Are you moving forward on a strategy?
0507	Donald Trump	We have a very strong plan, but we cannot talk about it, Julie.
0508	Julie Pace	So you have decided on a plan?
0509	Donald Trump	Remember how many times have you been to the speech where I talked about Mosul.
0510	Julie Pace	Right.
0511	Donald Trump	Right.
0512	Donald Trump	Mosul.
0513	Donald Trump	Four months we are going in, three months.
0514	Donald Trump	We are still fighting Mosul.
0515	Donald Trump	You know why?
0516	Donald Trump	Because they were prepared.
0517	Donald Trump	If we would have gone in and just done it, it would have been over three months ago.
0518	Julie Pace	Can you say generally what the strategy is?
0519	Julie Pace	Should people 
0520	Donald Trump	Generally is we have got to get rid of ISIS.
0521	Donald Trump	We have no choice.
0522	Donald Trump	And other terrorist organizations.
0523	Julie Pace	Should Americans who are serving in the military expect that you are going to increase troop numbers in the Middle East to fight ISIS?
0524	Donald Trump	No, not much.
0525	Julie Pace	In terms of the strategy, though, that you have accepted, it sounds like, from the generals 
0526	Donald Trump	Well, they've also accepted my strategy.
0527	Julie Pace	Does that involve more troops on the ground, it sounds like?
0528	Donald Trump	Not many.
0529	Julie Pace	So a small increase?
0530	Donald Trump	It could be an increase, then an increase.
0531	Donald Trump	But not many more.
0532	Donald Trump	I want to do the job, but not many more....
0533	Donald Trump	This is an important story.
0534	Donald Trump	I've done a lot.
0535	Donald Trump	I've done more than any other president in the first 100 days and I think the first 100 days is an artificial barrier.
0536	Donald Trump	And I'm scheduled... the foundations have been set to do some great things.
0537	Donald Trump	With foreign countries.
0538	Donald Trump	Look at, look at President Xi.
0539	Donald Trump	I mean ...
0540	Julie Pace	What do you think it was about your chemistry?
0541	Donald Trump	We had good chemistry.
0542	Donald Trump	Now I don't know that I think that's going to produce results but you've got a good chance.
0543	Julie Pace	Uhhuh.
0544	Donald Trump	Look, he turned down many coal ships.
0545	Donald Trump	These massive coal ships are coming where they get a lot of their income.
0546	Donald Trump	They're coming into China and they're being turned away.
0547	Donald Trump	That's never happened before.
0548	Donald Trump	The fuel, the oil, so many different things.
0549	Donald Trump	You saw the editorial they had in their paper saying they cannot be allowed to have nuclear, you know, et cetera.
0550	Donald Trump	People have said they've never seen this ever before in China.
0551	Donald Trump	We have the same relationship with others.
0552	Donald Trump	There's a great foundation that's built.
0553	Donald Trump	Great foundation.
0554	Donald Trump	And I think it's going to produce tremendous results for our country.
0555	Julie Pace	One more 100 days question.
0556	Donald Trump	That's fine.
0557	Julie Pace	... is do you think you have the right team in place for your next 100 days?
0558	Donald Trump	Yes.
0559	Donald Trump	I think my team has been, well, I have different teams.
0560	Donald Trump	I think my military team has been treated with great respect.
0561	Donald Trump	As they should be.
0562	Donald Trump	I think my other team hasn't been treated with the respect that they should get.
0563	Donald Trump	We have some very talented people, and very diverse people.
0564	Julie Pace	Do you mean your White House team when you say that?
0565	Donald Trump	Yeah, my White House team.
0566	Donald Trump	I think Reince has been doing an excellent job.
0567	Donald Trump	I think that, you know, this is a very tough environment not caused necessarily by me.
0568	Donald Trump	Although the election has, you know, look, the Democrats had a tremendous opportunity because the electoral college, as I said, is so skewed to them.
0569	Donald Trump	You start off by losing in New York and California, no matter who it is.
0570	Donald Trump	If, if Abe Lincoln came back to life, he would lose New York and he would lose California.
0571	Donald Trump	It's just the registration, there's nothing you can do.
0572	Donald Trump	So you're losing the two biggest states, that's where you start.
0573	Donald Trump	OK.
0574	Donald Trump	The Electoral College is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it's very, very hard.
0575	Donald Trump	Look at Obama's number in the Electoral College.
0576	Donald Trump	His numbers on the win were... but the Electoral College numbers were massive.
0577	Donald Trump	You lose New York, you lose Illinois.
0578	Donald Trump	Illinois is impossible to win.
0579	Donald Trump	And you look at, so now you lose New York, Illinois, no matter what you do, and California.
0580	Donald Trump	Right.
0581	Donald Trump	And you say, man.
0582	Donald Trump	Now you have to win Florida, you have to win Ohio, you have to win North Carolina.
0583	Donald Trump	You have to win all these states, and then I won Wisconsin and Michigan and all of these other places, but you remember there was no way to, there was no way to 270.
0584	Julie Pace	Right.
0585	Donald Trump	So she had this massive advantage, she spent hundreds of millions of dollars more money than I spent.
0586	Donald Trump	Hundreds of millions... Yeah.
0587	Donald Trump	Or more, actually because we were $375 she was at $2.2 billion.
0588	Donald Trump	But whatever.
0589	Donald Trump	She spent massive amounts of money more and she lost.
0590	Donald Trump	Solidly lost, because you know it wasn't 270, it was 306.
0591	Donald Trump	So there's anger.
0592	Donald Trump	But there was massive anger before I got there, so it's not easy for a White House staff to realize that you are going into a situation where you are going to be at no, where are going to get no votes.
0593	Donald Trump	I mean, here's a judge who is No.
0594	Donald Trump	1 at Columbia, No.
0595	Donald Trump	1 at Harvard and an Oxford scholar.
0596	Donald Trump	And he got three votes.
0597	Julie Pace	Three Democratic votes, but yeah.
0598	Donald Trump	Three Democratic votes.
0599	Donald Trump	OK.
0600	Donald Trump	He's an Oxford scholar at the highest level.
0601	Donald Trump	The No.
0602	Donald Trump	1, you know, one of the great academics, one of the great writers.
0603	Donald Trump	No bad decisions with all... nothing.
0604	Donald Trump	He's like a ...
0605	Julie Pace	Do you think that you can break through that?
0606	Julie Pace	I mean this 
0607	Donald Trump	Yeah, I do.
0608	Julie Pace	Is one of the biggest challenges for a president.
0609	Donald Trump	I think I can to an extent.
0610	Donald Trump	But there's a, there's a basic hardline core that you can't break though, OK, that you can't break through.
0611	Donald Trump	There's a hardline group you can't break through, you can't.
0612	Donald Trump	It's sad.
0613	Donald Trump	You can't.
0614	Donald Trump	Look, I met with Congressman Cummings and I really liked him, a lot.
0615	Donald Trump	Elijah Cummings.
0616	Donald Trump	I really liked him a lot.
0617	Donald Trump	And during the conversation because we have a very strong mutual feeling on drug prices.
0618	Donald Trump	He came to see me, at my invitation, because I saw him talking about, he came to see me about drug prices because drug prices are ridiculous.
0619	Donald Trump	And I am going to get them way, way, way down and he liked that.
0620	Donald Trump	He said you will be the greatest president.
0621	Donald Trump	He said you will be, in front of five, six people, he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country.
0622	Julie Pace	He disputed that slightly.
0623	Donald Trump	That's what he said.
0624	Donald Trump	I mean, what can I tell you?
0625	Julie Pace	Yeah.
0626	Donald Trump	There's six people sitting here.
0627	Donald Trump	What did he, what, what do you mean by slightly?
0628	Julie Pace	He said, he said that he felt like you could be a great president if and then 
0629	Donald Trump	Well he said, you'll be the greatest president in the history of, but you know what, I'll take that also, but that you could be.
0630	Donald Trump	But he said, will be the greatest president but I would also accept the other.
0631	Donald Trump	In other words, if you do your job, but I accept that.
0632	Donald Trump	Then I watched him interviewed and it was like he never even was here.
0633	Donald Trump	It's incredible.
0634	Donald Trump	I watched him interviewed a week later and it's like he was never in my office.
0635	Donald Trump	And you can even say that.
0636	Julie Pace	And that's one of the difficulties I think presidents have had is that you can have these personal relationships with people from the other party, but then it's hard to actually change how people vote or change how people 
0637	Donald Trump	No I have, it's interesting, I have, seem to get very high ratings.
0638	Donald Trump	I definitely.
0639	Donald Trump	You know Chris Wallace had 9.2 million people, it's the highest in the history of the show.
0640	Donald Trump	I have all the ratings for all those morning shows.
0641	Donald Trump	When I go, they go double, triple.
0642	Donald Trump	Chris Wallace, look back during the ArmyNavy football game, I did his show that morning.
0643	Julie Pace	I remember, right.
0644	Donald Trump	It had 9.2 million people.
0645	Donald Trump	It's the highest they've ever had. On any, on air,
0646	SYSTEM	[John]
0647	Donald Trump	Dickerson had 5.2 million people.
0648	Donald Trump	It's the highest for "Face the Nation" or as I call it, "Deface the Nation."
0649	Donald Trump	It's the highest for "Deface the Nation" since the World Trade Center.
0650	Donald Trump	Since the World Trade Center came down.
0651	Donald Trump	It's a tremendous advantage.
0652	Donald Trump	I have learned one thing, because I get treated very unfairly, that's what I call it, the fake media.
0653	Donald Trump	And the fake media is not all of the media.
0654	Donald Trump	You know they tried to say that the fake media was all the, no.
0655	Donald Trump	The fake media is some of you.
0656	Donald Trump	I could tell you who it is, 100 percent.
0657	Donald Trump	Sometimes you're fake, but  but the fake media is some of the media.
0658	Donald Trump	It bears no relationship to the truth.
0659	Donald Trump	It's not that Fox treats me well, it's that Fox is the most accurate.
0660	Julie Pace	Do you believe that?
0661	Julie Pace	That Fox 
0662	Donald Trump	I do.
0663	Donald Trump	I get treated so badly.
0664	Donald Trump	Yesterday, about the thing, you know when I said it's a terrorism... it may be.
0665	Donald Trump	I said it may be a terrorist attack and MSNBC, I heard, went crazy, "He called it a terrorist attack."
0666	Donald Trump	They thought it was a bank robbery.
0667	Donald Trump	By the way, I'm 100 for that.
0668	Donald Trump	I've called every one of them.
0669	Donald Trump	Every time they said I called it way too early and then it turns out I'm... Whatever.
0670	Donald Trump	Whatever.
0671	Donald Trump	In the meantime, I'm here and they're not.
0672	Julie Pace	Do you feel that one of the things with cable is there's such realtime reaction with everything you say?
0673	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0674	Julie Pace	Can you separate that sometimes from that actual decision?
0675	Donald Trump	The one thing 
0676	Julie Pace	That you have to do 
0677	Donald Trump	OK.
0678	Donald Trump	The one thing I've learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do.
0679	Donald Trump	I don't watch CNN anymore.
0680	Julie Pace	You just said you did.
0681	Donald Trump	No. No, I, if I'm passing it, what did I just say
0682	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0683	Donald Trump	?
0684	Julie Pace	You just said 
0685	Donald Trump	Where?
0686	Donald Trump	Where?
0687	Julie Pace	Two minutes ago.
0688	Donald Trump	No, they treat me so badly.
0689	Donald Trump	No, I just said that.
0690	Donald Trump	No, I, what'd I say, I stopped watching them.
0691	Donald Trump	But I don't watch CNN anymore.
0692	Donald Trump	I don't watch MSNBC.
0693	Donald Trump	I don't watch it.
0694	Donald Trump	Now I heard yesterday that MSNBC, you know, they tell me what's going on.
0695	Julie Pace	Right.
0696	Donald Trump	In fact, they also did.
0697	Donald Trump	I never thought I had the ability to not watch.
0698	Donald Trump	Like, people think I watch "Morning Joe."
0699	Donald Trump	I don't watch "Morning Joe."
0700	Donald Trump	I never thought I had the ability to, and who used to treat me great by the way, when I played the game.
0701	Donald Trump	I never thought I had the ability to not watch what is unpleasant, if it's about me.
0702	Donald Trump	Or pleasant.
0703	Donald Trump	But when I see it's such false reporting and such bad reporting and false reporting that I've developed an ability that I never thought I had.
0704	Donald Trump	I don't watch things that are unpleasant.
0705	Donald Trump	I just don't watch them.
0706	Julie Pace	And do you feel like that's, that's because of the office that you now occupy 
0707	Donald Trump	No.
0708	Julie Pace	That you've made that change?
0709	Donald Trump	I don't know why it is, but I've developed that ability, and it's happened over the last, over the last year.
0710	Julie Pace	That's interesting.
0711	Donald Trump	And I don't watch things that I know are going to be unpleasant.
0712	Donald Trump	CNN has covered me unfairly and incorrectly and I don't watch them anymore.
0713	Donald Trump	A lot of people don't watch them anymore, they're now in third place.
0714	Donald Trump	But I've created something where people are watching... but I don't watch CNN anymore.
0715	Donald Trump	I don't watch MSNBC anymore.
0716	Donald Trump	I don't watch things, and I never thought I had that ability.
0717	Donald Trump	I always thought I'd watch.
0718	Julie Pace	Sure.
0719	Donald Trump	I just don't.
0720	Donald Trump	And that's taken place over the last year.
0721	Donald Trump	And you know what that is, that's a great, it's a great thing because you leave, you leave for work in the morning you know, you're, you don't watch this total negativity.
0722	Donald Trump	I never thought I'd be able to do that and for me, it's so easy to do now.
0723	Donald Trump	Just don't watch.
0724	Julie Pace	That's interesting.
0725	Donald Trump	Maybe it's because I'm here.
0726	Donald Trump	I don't know.
