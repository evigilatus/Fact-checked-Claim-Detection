He then left Frederick before being legally recruited into German military service, according to the journalist Gwenda Blair, writer of Tramps magazine: three generations of builders and president. A few years later, Friedrich and his loving wife Elizabeth tried to return to Germany, but their stay was short and eventually deported to the United States. Not only did Frederick, now too big for recruitment, not serve him, but he became an American citizen, Blair explained Paulette Vac. Why the history lesson? Well, on April 2, 2019, (which happens to be the International Fact-Finding Day), in making remarks to journalists about Germany, he referred to his father, Fred, and said, \"My father is German, isn't he? He was German, born in a very wonderful place in Germany.\" Soon I announced a splash of news reports that the President had lied about his father's birthplace again. The stories have indicated that Fred Trump was born in New York, as has been said repeatedly. Just like his obituary says in The New York Times. (Interesting, as the New York Times notes, Fred Trump at one point in his life tells people that he's of Swedish origin. Blair told us that this is probably due to his dealings with many Jews in New York and to anti-German sentiment in the United States during and after World War II.) On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, telling her \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, with regard to the President's claim about his father, when Paulette Fuckett asked the White House, his spokesman did not respond. There is no doubt that Elizabeth Trump was pregnant with Fred, and she and Frederick are still in Germany. But there is also no doubt, Blair testified, that the couple had returned to New York at the time of unique birth. \"As we know, that doesn't make him born in Germany,\" said Blair. Was it realized in Germany? Okay. But, born in Germany, no.\" The Newsweek and the Independent reported that Trump had made a false allegation about his father at least four times since he took office. Each time, according to NewZwick, he either criticized Germany's contribution to NATO or the EU's trade relationship with the US. Our ruling Donald Trump said that his father was born in Germany - although Fred Trump was born in New York, as he has said many times. It is unclear why the President continues to repeat it, but it is wrong. Pants on fire.
