With the elections in the rear mirror, most of the migration convoy faded from the headlines. But there's a new concern about illegal immigrants and midterms that got to play on Le Dobbs tonight, with the host claiming many non-citizens voting in the race. \"We're watching, you know, millions of illegal immigrants cross our borders,\" said Dobbs, \"and many of them vote in the last election. Dobbs said illegal immigrants have a \"big impact.\" He then mentioned the possible implications for the division of provinces in Congress. We found no basis for the claim of the host of the Fox Business Network for undocumented people voting at mid-term. Allegations of undue influence on American elections have become fairly common in the Trump era. Trump himself has repeatedly claimed widespread voter fraud and electoral fraud, which we have repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly and repeatedly dismantled. In the case of the mid-term 2018, we found no evidence to support Dobbs &apos; claim that many illegal immigrants voted. The media contacts made by Fox News did not respond to our request for comment. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021 \"There is no evidence of even dozens, let alone millions, of non-citizens voting in these or any other elections,\" as David Baker, Executive Director of the Centre for Electoral Innovation and Research, a non-profit person focusing on the integrity of the elections, said. Dobbs claimed that \"we're watching millions of illegal immigrants cross our borders\" needs a context. According to the Ministry of National Security figures, in fiscal year 2018, the United States Border Patrol seized 396,579 people crossing the southern border. A broader reading of border crossings would also include departmental data on the number of foreign travellers to the United States who have exceeded their visa stay, estimated at about 600,000 in fiscal year 2017. As we have noted in a previous study of the facts, a study is often induced among those who claim that illegal immigrants have a significant impact on elections in the United States. The study indicates that \"14% of the people who voted were non-citizens.\" Many reliable researchers have developed the study as methodologically inappropriate to use an Internet opinion poll originally designed to survey citizens and not consider the possibility of an error in responding to the survey. The Federal Government recently brought charges against 19 foreign citizens who voted in the 2016 elections in North Carolina, where more than 4.7 million votes were cast. The experts said that the Ministry of Justice, led by President George W. Bush, and the Republican and Democrat election officials had investigated large-scale voter fraud and found it extremely rare. President Trump &apos; s short-term voter fraud commission was unable to find any evidence of widespread fraud before it was dissolved. With regard to Dobbs' claim, we have pants on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01254"}
