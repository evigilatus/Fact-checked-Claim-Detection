Dan Bishop of voting against a bill that would allow pharmacists to inform people about cheaper alternative drugs.\n\"He took the only vote from either party \u2014 the only vote \u2014 against pharmacists being able to tell people about lower-cost drugs,\" McCready said.\nIt\u2019s a claim McCready has repeated throughout the race on social media and in an attack ad.\nHe\u2019s talking about The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act, which banned gag orders discouraging pharmacists from offering customers cheaper alternative drugs. It passed 115-0 in the House and 45-1 in the Senate in 2017.\u00a0\nAnd in fact, Bishop was the only member of the North Carolina General Assembly to vote against the bill before Gov. Roy Cooper signed it into law.\nOn the debate stage, Bishop said his opposition was \"for procedural reasons.\" When he\u2019s been confronted with the charge before, the state senator has said he didn\u2019t have time to read the final version of the House bill before the vote and noted that he supported a similar Senate bill.\nWe asked both campaigns about Bishop\u2019s position on the policy. While it\u2019s true that Bishop cast the lone vote against The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act, his votes and statements indicate he\u2019s in favor of allowing pharmacists to tell people about cheaper alternative drugs as long as that doesn\u2019t burden pharmacies \u2014\u00a0and, in turn, customers \u2014 with higher costs.\nBishop supports banning pharmacy gag orders\nThe Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act was introduced in both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly in March 2017.\nOver the next several weeks, those identical bills made their way through various committees in the House and Senate that amended their language. In the Senate version, Bishop backed changes that his campaign says were designed to protect consumers from additional costs.\u00a0\nOn April 26, the bill that Bishop helped revise unanimously passed in the state Senate.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a House version of the bill was added to the calendar on June 28, Bishop says he didn\u2019t have time to read the bill to check that it included similar amendments.\n\"That was a big sticking point for him,\" said Jessica Proud, a spokesperson for Bishop\u2019s campaign. \"He didn\u2019t feel comfortable voting for legislation without ensuring that those changes had been made.\" (If he had, he would have found the bill was indeed identical.)\nDidn\u2019t have time\nHow should elected officials vote when they haven\u2019t done their homework?\nBishop says he votes no on any legislation he hasn\u2019t fully read. In an email to the Charlotte television station WBTV, Bishop responded to McCready\u2019s claim: \"This companion House version was added to the Senate calendar on June 28 at the last minute and, unlike Nancy Pelosi\u2019s advice on Obamacare, I don\u2019t vote for bills without an opportunity to read them.\"\nBut McCready has questioned why Bishop didn\u2019t have time to read a bill less than two pages long.\n\"State Senator Bishop refused to even read the bill that would let pharmacists tell people about lower-cost drugs even though it was shorter than \u2018Green Eggs and Ham,\u2019\" he said at the debate.\n(We counted, and The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act comes in at about 200 words shorter than Dr. Seuss\u2019s \"Green Eggs and Ham.\")\nWhen we asked the state senator\u2019s campaign about his lack of preparation, Proud explained that the vote followed a debate on a workers\u2019 compensation bill that Bishop authored. The General Assembly\u2019s website shows that votes on The Pharmacy Patient Fair Practices Act and Bishop\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation bill occurred less than an hour apart.\nOur ruling\nMcCready said Bishop was the only member of the House or Senate to vote against a bill allowing pharmacists to tell people about lower-cost drugs. The roll call confirms that is correct.\u00a0\nHowever, McCready ignores the fact that Bishop supported an identical version of the bill. That vote and his statements indicate he supports the policy.\nWe rate the claim Half True because it leaves out important details and takes things out of context.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00212"}
