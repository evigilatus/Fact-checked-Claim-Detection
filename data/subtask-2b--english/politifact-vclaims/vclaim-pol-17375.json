The most recent false claim is that cocaine is the cure.\nImages of breaking news stories claiming that cocaine is the newest remedy to coronavirus are being reposted on Twitter and Facebook. One Facebook post from Jan. 30 included an image of a bag of cocaine in the background of a news banner that says \"Cocaine kills corona virus\" and \"Scientists is shocked to discover that this drug can fight the virus.\" No, this grammatically challenged image was not from a real breaking news alert. This image is made by an online news generator. There is still no cure for the coronavirus.\nThis post was flagged by Facebook as part of efforts to combat false news and information on its News Feed.

If there were a cure for the Novel Coronavirus, we wouldn\u2019t count on it being a stimulant like cocaine. Cocaine is a highly addictive drug that can lead to long-term respiratory problems and movement disorders like Parkinson\u2019s disease, according to the National Institutes of Health.\u00a0\nIn 2017 there were a total of 13,942 drug overdose deaths in the United States that involved cocaine. There have been 1,016 deaths reported worldwide from the coronavirus as of Feb. 10, none in the United States.\u00a0\nWe wouldn\u2019t recommend trying a highly addictive drug in hopes of fighting off a viral disease.
