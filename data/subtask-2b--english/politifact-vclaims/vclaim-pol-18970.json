In it, he argued that Ginsburg\u2019s seat should not be filled in a rush, just weeks before a presidential election.\nIn the speech, Biden said the Constitution \"was designed to give voters one chance, one chance to have their voice heard in who serves on the court. And by the way, there\u2019s no court session between now and the end of this election.\"\nThe second sentence was seemingly an additional argument for slowing down the process. It seemed to be an ad-lib, since it didn\u2019t appear in the prepared remarks sent out by his campaign.\u00a0\nBut it was incorrect.\nOn its website, the Supreme Court lists five days of oral arguments scheduled for October: the 5th, 6th, 7th, 13th and 14th. It also lists oral arguments for Nov. 2 and Nov. 3.
