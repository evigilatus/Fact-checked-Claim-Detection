So ICE is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009,\" Ocasio-Cortez stated.\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s claim had us wondering: Is ICE required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every night?\nAlthough the experts we spoke to told us ICE faces pressure from a variety of places to detain a large number of people, we found the legislation Ocasio-Cortez was referring to doesn\u2019t require ICE to detain 34,000 people a day. Rather, it requires ICE to maintain 34,000 available beds a day.\n\u2018Beds, not people\u2019\nOcasio-Cortez was referring to a clause in the DHS Appropriations Act of 2016, which states that with the funds it receives from Congress through the act, ICE \"shall maintain a level of not less than 34,000 detention beds through September 30, 2016.\"\nAccording to Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, the mandate exists because Congress wants to \"make sure that ICE does not use the detention bed money for something less effective.\"\nThe mandate first appeared in the DHS Appropriations Act of 2010.\nSo while Congress requires ICE to make 34,000 beds available each day, it doesn\u2019t require those beds to be filled.\nThis isn't the first time this figure has come up. During a congressional hearing in 2014, U.S. Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador, R-Idaho, asked then-DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson for clarification on the detention bed quota, as it is known. \u00a0\n\"There is nothing in the law that is mandating you to put 34,000 people on these beds. Is that correct?\" Labrador asked.\nTo which Johnson responded: \"I don\u2019t read the law that way. It doesn\u2019t read that way \u2026 It says beds, not people.\"\nPeter Margulies, a professor of law at Roger Williams University, told us, \"unfortunately, this became a little bit of an urban legend, in a way, about what the appropriations statute required.\"\nAn ICE official also confirmed to PolitiFact that the language in the appropriations bills require ICE to maintain at least 34,000 beds each day, but don\u2019t require ICE to fill those beds.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, according to a DHS report, in order to track compliance with the congressional mandate, ICE measures its \"average daily population.\" So while the letter of the law may not require ICE to detain 34,000 people each day, it may have been in ICE\u2019s best interest to act like it did.\nUnwritten rules\nUnder DHS Secretary Johnson, ICE\u2019s position was clear: 34,000 beds needed to be available, but not necessarily filled. But DHS secretaries have interpreted the appropriations legislation differently.\nIn a 2013 congressional hearing, then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano hinted that the detention bed quota was tying ICE\u2019s hands, saying that \"we ought to be managing the actual detention population to risk, not to an arbitrary number.\"\nMark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, told us that bureaucracy is a driving force behind the increased detention.\n\"A plain reading of the statute would be that they (ICE) just need to have the beds available but not fill them. I think in practice, they have felt that they needed to fill them (because) they are being funded for those beds and they don't want to lose that funding.\"\nHas the number always been increasing?\nOcasio-Cortez also stated that that number \"has only been increasing since 2009.\"\nThough we\u2019ve already established that no such numerical detainee requirement exists in the law for ICE, we decided to see if this part of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s claim was correct by looking at how the language in the appropriations bills changed from year to year.\nWe found that her claim was not accurate.\nThe DHS appropriations bills from 2010 to 2016 all included similar bed quotas. But the most recent 2017 and 2018 appropriations bills contained no such language.\nExperts confirmed with us that the detention bed quota language had been eliminated in 2017, and did not reappear in the current bill.\nWhile ICE\u2019s average daily population has overall been on the rise since 2009, to say that the number tied to the detention bed quota has risen, as Ocasio-Cortez did, is inaccurate.\nOur ruling\nOcasio-Cortez claimed that \"ICE is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009.\"\nThe language in the congressional appropriations bills from 2009 through 2016 only mandates that ICE keep at least 33,400 (later 34,000) beds available. The bills don\u2019t state that those beds need to be filled. Under different DHS secretaries, the government\u2019s interpretation of the law has varied as to whether the beds need to be filled or not. \u00a0\nIn addition, the last time the language requiring ICE to maintain a certain number of beds appeared in an appropriations bill was 2016. So, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s claim that the \"number (of detainees ICE is required to detain) has only been increasing since 2009\" is inaccurate.\nWe rate Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s claim False. \u200b\n Share the Facts 2018-07-06 13:49:15 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"ICE is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009.\"    Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Democratic nominee for Congress, New York's 14th congressional district https://theintercept.com/2018/06/27/an-interview-with-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-the-young-democratic-socialist-who-just-shocked-the-establishment/    Wednesday, June 27, 2018 2018-06-27    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01888"}
