Young adults are generally in better health and are needed to balance out risk among other, older enrollees, and they\u2019re disproportionately uninsured.\nOn NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday, host David Gregory asked if \"the lag effect\" of the struggling federal marketplace will deter young adults from signing up for insurance.\nWashington Post Wonkblog editor Ezra Klein said the Obama administration was planning to deploy a vast marketing campaign to encourage young people to sign up through their preferred TV shows, social networks and parents, but the effort was not fully rolled out as problems with Healthcare.gov persisted.\nDr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist and former health care adviser in the Obama administration, pointed to a microcosm of success in California, where the state-based exchange is \"working well enough.\"\n\"And there, the proportion of kids who are signing up is the proportion of kids in the population,\" Emanuel said. \"And so it does appear that we are going to have enough when you look at that data point. And if we can get the word out, I think Ezra is right, we'll get enough young people.\"\nCalifornia\u2019s enrollment figures were described as \"a rare bright spot\" by the New York Times amid dismal reports about the federal marketplace. We wanted to dig in a little more and find out if Emanuel is right that young adults are signing up as a proportion to the population in California.\nSeveral experts we reached were initially thrown by Emanuel\u2019s use of \"kids.\" Emanuel clarified he was referring to news about young adult sign-ups from Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, in a brief interview. (He added that he has an almost 30-year-old \"kid.\")\nCovered California, the state's insurance marketplace, distributed a Nov. 21 press release that pointed out 18- to 34-year-olds applied \"in direct proportion to California\u2019s population\" in October.\nThat age group comprised about 22.5 percent, or about 6,900, of the people who selected plans during October and were not eligible for Medicaid. In 2010, the same group comprised about 21 percent of the state\u2019s population. The last two columns from the following Covered California chart illustrate the\u00a0point.\nThe gap widens if you tinker with different data. Young adults comprise 25 percent of the state\u2019s population using 2012 data from the American Community Survey, and about 27\u00a0percent if you take out the 65-and-over population, which is eligible for\u00a0Medicare, according to the California Health Interview Survey 2011-12 data.\nSo, we\u2019re all finished here, right? Well, hold on.\nFor one thing, experts said it\u2019s way too early to draw sweeping conclusions from the state\u2019s first month of data. November data, unavailable until mid December, could tell a very different tale. The real meaningful test will be how many young adults sign up long-term.\n\"People talk about these numbers because we have them, but you can't extrapolate from these,\" said Glenn Melnick, a University of Southern California health policy professor.\nThen there\u2019s another matter of Covered California, and Emanuel, spinning the data in a way that emits positivity but, experts say, is not exactly relevant.\nInstead of comparing the percentage of young adult enrollees to their share of the population, some said it would be better to compare those signups to young adults\u2019 share of the uninsured population, which is about 40 percent, several experts said.\n\"They need it proportionate to the target population, which is the uninsured,\" Melnick said.\nAnother issue with comparing to a share of the population: The marketplaces established by the health care law are not really intended for the nation\u2019s youngest and oldest residents. Children who receive coverage because of the law are getting it mainly through expanded Medicaid offerings, and adults over 65 are eligible for Medicare. That means comparisons could be misleading.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So that\u2019s not to say that they are completely off the table, but they are by design expected to be less represented in the enrollment in Covered California than their presence in the population,\" said Marian Mulkey, director of the California Healthcare Foundation\u2019s Health Reform and Public Programs Initiative.\nUsing 2011 Current Population Survey data, the foundation determined that 41 percent of the state\u2019s uninsured population under age 65 is between the ages of 18 and 34. Since one of the goals of the law is to get more people in this group insured, you\u2019d want to see young adult signups go higher than just their share of the overall population, she said.\n\"I would submit that that\u2019s not quite a high enough bar for what they should be aiming for,\" she said of measuring the signups against the overall population. \"I would hasten to say that this is very early data, it doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t get there.\"\nGail Wilensky, the director of Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush, agreed that measuring sign-ups of young adults against the percentage of uninsured young adult Californians would be the more relevant statistic.\n\"This might not look quite so good as the percent of the population since this group is disproportionately uninsured,\" Wilensky said.\nStill, Dylan Roby, a UCLA School of Public Health assistant professor of health services, disagreed with the idea of the uninsured population being a\u00a0better benchmark. In California, he said, the risk pool for plans sold on the individual market, both within the exchange and outside of it, is the same. Plus, he said people who sign up for insurance early are likely to be those who already have it but were not previously eligible for subsidies on the exchange.\n\"So, given that we don\u2019t have numbers on how many 18-34 year olds are signing up for coverage outside of the exchange with the same consumer protections, deductible limits, out-of-pocket maximums, etc., I am not sure you can make any statement about the magnitude of sign-ups and response to the new plans,\" he said.\nRoby said his target would be for 35-40 percent of people signed up on the individual market (through Covered California or on their own) to be between the ages of 18 and 34 at the end of open enrollment. More than 2 million uninsured Californians are 18-34 years old.\nGenevieve Kenney, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, struck a similar chord, saying neither view of the percentage of young adult enrollments -- whether compared to their share of the state population or of the uninsured population -- is necessarily germane.\n\"Neither one really tells you what we should expect to see if young adults were participating in proportion to their share of the overall target population for the exchange,\" she said. \"That\u2019s what feels relevant to me.\"\nMany uninsured young adults actually look like they\u2019re eligible for Medicaid, she said. So just looking at the percentage of those who are signing up for exchange coverage against the overall uninsured population doesn\u2019t tell the full story.\nShe added that enrollment estimates broken down by age group are hard to come by, and \"I haven\u2019t myself tried to calculate that particular target.\"\nA Nov. 20 Reuters story that analyzed early data from state-run exchanges in Connecticut, Kentucky, Washington and Maryland said \"so far more than 20 percent of the 23,500 combined enrollees in private insurance plans are 18 to 34 years old, ranging from about 19 percent in Kentucky and Connecticut to about 27 percent in Maryland.\" Other state-run exchanges, such as New York and Hawaii (and D.C.), have not released enrollment data by demographic.\nThe early turnout among young adults is encouraging, said Jen Mishory, deputy director of the Young Invincibles, an advocacy group focused on enrolling young adults into coverage, in an interview. \"We anticipate that we\u2019ll see a broader surge in young people as they get more educated.\"\nSeveral of those states reported an uptick in enrollments in the early weeks of November, including California.\nOur ruling\nEmanuel tried to point to a good sign for the health care law in California, saying \"the proportion of kids who are signing up is the proportion of kids in the population.\"\nThe statement is pretty accurate for young adults for the month of October. But\u00a0it is a curious statistic.\u00a0Health policy experts said the stat is\u00a0misleading because the entire California population is not supposed to access the marketplace. They offered more apt comparisons that relate\u00a0more closely to the uninsured population and alter the figures.\nThe more important takeaway is that it\u2019s very early to draw significant conclusions about California\u2019s performance and what it could mean for a functional Healthcare.gov after its first month.\nWe rate Emanuel\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08537"}
