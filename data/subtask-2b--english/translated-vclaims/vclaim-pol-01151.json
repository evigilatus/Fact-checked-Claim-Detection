Many intellectuals and politicians say that the results reflect the dissatisfaction of voters with President Donald Trump, a Republican. Fallwell, however, says Trump skipped the election well. The evangelist leader said: \"This half-half, the president was better than the average president on his first midterm.\" \"So I think the message is that the American people are happy with the direction the country is going and happy with the economy, happy with our new respect in the world. It's a better result than you usually see in the first half of the year.\" We wondered if Valwell was right that Trump had higher than average results in his first midterm election. So we took a test look. Although the Republicans lost 40 seats in the House of Representatives last November, they won two new seats in the Senate. In general, this comes to the loss of 38 seats in Congress. Falluell did not mention the number of presidents he was preparing in his statement. According to the records, 24 of the 28 presidents since 1862 saw their party seats in Congress fall during the first half of the term. So Trump has company. The average loss in all of these elections was 30 seats - better than the drop of 38 seats under Trump. The 28 presidents ranked from the best to the worst, Trump came in 18. He didn't, as Valwell claimed, \"do better than the regular president.\" The Presidents who took office after the end of the Second World War in 1945 witnessed similar results. Of these 13 presidents, 12 suffered losses during the first mid-term (the exception was George W. Bush in 2002, who received nine seats). The average number of seats lost was 31. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2012, Trump arranged for these presidents from the best to the worst. 8 - That, once again, is inconsistent with what Falluell said. How does Falluell defend his claim? We received a written statement from Valwell saying that his remarks were aimed at \"inverse\" that Trump was better than the two former Democrats. The Democrats lost 62 seats under Bill Clinton in 1994 and 69 seats under Barack Obama in 2010. Why didn't he say that in the questions and answers? The spokesman for Valwell, Scott Lamb, said that the mid-term discussion had been a small part of the interview, and Valwell had focused on the basic questions he was asked about why the evangelists had returned to Trump. Our judge, Valwell, said, \"This half-half, the president was better than the average president on his first midterm.\" The prosecution does not stand still. The Republicans lost 38 seats in Congress in the 2018 elections and controlled the House of Representatives. Of the 28 presidents who have served since 1862, this is the highest 18 losses by their party during the first half-term period. The average decrease was 30 seats. Taking into account the 13 Presidents of the post-Second World War, Trump witnessed the eighth greatest loss. These Presidents saw an average reduction of 31 seats in the first half. Fallwell, who was asked to prove his statement, replaces a different claim: Trump outstrips the Democrats Clinton and Obama in their performance during the first half term. Statistics consistently show that Trump performed slightly worse than the regular president during the first half period. We appreciate that Valwell's statement is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01151"}
