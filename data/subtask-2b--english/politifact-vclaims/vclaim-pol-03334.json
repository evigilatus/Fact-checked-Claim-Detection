Obama had been forbidden by her famous parents from going to any such party, the story said, but disappeared before turning up at the police station.\nThis didn\u2019t happen, of course, because the story is fake. It turned up on a few other websites around May 6.\nBut it actually originated on May 5 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we\u2019ve previously checked.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to troll conservatives. The site\u2019s creator, a man who said his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, has told PolitiFact he deliberately tried to get gullible readers to share his stories to prove those readers don\u2019t rely on facts.\nThe articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake -- this Malia Obama post is just the latest example.\nA previous story from TheLastLineOfDefense.org said Malia Obama had been expelled from Harvard University for smoking marijuana in Boston, despite the fact that she hadn\u2019t even been enrolled at the school.\nAs for the fake accomplices pictured in the story, the image is taken from a series of mugshots showing a group of eight men arrested in Florence County, S.C., in 2013 for running a dogfighting ring. Malia\u2019s image was inserted to suggest she\u2019d been partying with the other seven.\nBut that\u2019s not the case. As far as we know, the 18-year-old is still enjoying her gap year before enrolling at Harvard this fall.\nWe rate this statement Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-05-09 13:57:43 UTC   Politifact    6 1 7  Politifact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Malia Obama arrested with a gang of thugs in Chicago.\"    Internet rumors Bloggers   in a headline Saturday, May 6, 2017 2017-05-06    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03334"}
