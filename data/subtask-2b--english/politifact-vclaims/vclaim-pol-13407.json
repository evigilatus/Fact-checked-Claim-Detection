Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, said not many Texans have the state license that\u2019s required to even carry a concealed gun.\n\"We have over 25 million people who live in Texas and less than 2 percent of them have these licenses,\" he said on CNN on Feb. 22.\u00a0\nAccording to the 2010 census, about 25.1 million people live in Texas.\nNext, we turned to the Texas Department of Public Safety. Spokesman Tom Vinger told us that \"a little over 460,000\" people in Texas have concealed handgun licenses. A 1995 Texas law allows adults 21 and older who meet certain requirements, including passing a background check, to get such licenses.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVinger pointed us to the department\u2019s annual reports on active concealed handgun license and instructor counts. As of Dec. 31, Texas has 461,724 active license holders, according to the department\u2019s most recent report, posted online Feb. 14.\nWe also wondered whether other states had a similarly low percentage of concealed handgun-license holders. According to a fact-sheet posted on the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action\u2019s website in April, 40 states have laws allowing individuals to carry handguns, with Florida issuing more carry permits than any other state \u2014 1.7 million. That\u2019s about 9 percent of Florida\u2019s 18.5 million-large population, according to a 2009 estimate by the Census Bureau.\nSo, 1.8 percent of the Texas population is licensed to carry a concealed handgun.\nWe rate Wentworth\u2019s statement as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13407"}
