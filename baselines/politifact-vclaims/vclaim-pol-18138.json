We found that WHO never offered kits to the United States, and when a reporter asked President Donald Trump if that was true, he confirmed, and took it a step further.\n\"No. 1, nothing was offered,\" Trump said March 17. \"No. 2, it was a bad test.\"\nThere is zero evidence that the WHO\u2019s preferred test is unreliable.\nBased on a test developed in Berlin, Germany, by the end of February, WHO had purchased and sent materials to over 100 countries for 1.4 million tests.\nA review from the National University of Singapore reported that the German test gave neither false positives, nor false negatives. In technical terms, it was \"highly sensitive and specific,\" and did not \"cross-react with other coronaviruses.\"\nBefore Trump spoke, top officials explained that the United States wanted a test that came through American commercial vendors and had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe head of the U.S. Public Health Service, Adm.
