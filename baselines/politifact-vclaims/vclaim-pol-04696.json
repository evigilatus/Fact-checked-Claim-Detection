Keilar asked Johnson if he thought Trump was racist.\n\"When it comes to Mexican immigration and that he would call immigrants from Mexico murderers and rapists look, that\u2019s just not true,\" Johnson said. \"They are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens, and that is a statistic.\"\nWe wondered if there really was a statistic to support Johnson\u2019s statement that Mexican immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S. citizens.\nImmigrants up, crime down\nJohnson based his comments on data cited in a July 2015 Wall Street Journal opinion piece by Jason L. Riley, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute.\nRiley\u2019s commentary focused on studies that show immigrants \u2014 irrespective of nationality or legal status \u2014 \"are less likely than the native population to commit violent crimes or to be incarcerated.\"\nRiley points to a July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit in Washington. The council analyzed data from the Census\u2019 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of all immigrant males (Census does not specify legal status) between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population.\nThe council also reported 2010 Census data that shows incarceration rates of young, less educated Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan men \u2014 which comprise the bulk of the unauthorized population \u2014 are \"significantly lower\" than incarceration rates of native-born young men without a high-school diploma.\nSpecifically for Mexican men ages 18 to 39, the incarceration rate in 2010 was 2.8 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for native-born men in the same age group, the council\u2019s report said.\nImmigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report\u2019s authors.\n\"They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police,\" he said in an email interview. \"This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence.\"\nAnd even as the immigrant population increases, crime has gone down, the report said.\nBetween 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population increased from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent, and the number of unauthorized immigrants went up from 3.5 million to 11.2 million. At the same time, violent crime rate (murder, rape and aggravated assault) decreased 48 percent and property crime rate fell 41 percent, the report said, citing FBI data.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBianca E. Bersani, an assistant professor and director of the Criminology and Criminal Justice Program at the University of Massachusetts Boston, says her research also shows that crime involvement among foreign-born residents is lower than that of U.S.-born citizens.\nIt holds true for Mexican immigrants, she said.\n\"When ethnicity can be distinguished and Mexican immigrants isolated from the group of first-generation immigrants, research continues to find that Mexican immigrants have lower rates of involvement in crime compared to their U.S-born peers,\" Bersani said.\nRecent studies tracking changes over time also found that areas of the country with an increased foreign-born population do not experience corresponding increases in crime, said Bersani.\n\"The rhetoric of the \u2018criminal immigrant\u2019 does not align with the bulk of empirical research,\" Bersani said.\nAccording to Bersani\u2019s research, while first-generation immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population, the second generation (individuals born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent) more closely resemble patterns of their native-born peers (three or more U.S.-born generations).\n\"This does not suggest that the second generation is uniquely crime prone, but instead that they are acting in ways that are no different from the rest of the U.S.-born population,\" Bersani said.\nDatasets with information on both crime and immigrant status are rare, Bersani said, though more research and data are becoming available.\nThe Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration policies, in a 2009 study said that overall understanding of immigrants and crime \"remains confused\" due to lack of data and contrary information.\nUnless inmates are identified as immigrant or native-born, incarceration rates are a poor way to measure links between immigrants and crime, the study said.\nDeportations of criminal immigrants may also decrease immigrant incarceration rates because\u00a0many will not return to the United States and commit more crimes, as could be the case with native-born criminals, the CIS report said.\nThere isn\u2019t exact data on how many undocumented immigrants are currently incarcerated.\nOur ruling\nJohnson said Mexican immigrants are not \"murderers and rapists\" but are actually \"more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic.\"\nNumerous studies by scholars and partisan groups show that the foreign-born population is less likely to commit crimes than the native-born, and experts say this includes Mexican immigrants.\nResearchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime, but the information available does not disprove Johnson\u2019s point. We rate Johnson\u2019s statement Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/67eae50a-55c4-485e-bd36-697619caa1a5", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04696"}
