And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission. And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him. And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve previously rated an Obama claim that Romney\u2019s view on killing bin Laden was \"it's not worth moving heaven and earth.\" We found it Half True. While Romney used those words, he also explained that he wanted to see a broader focus against the \"worldwide jihadist effort,\" not just the al-Qaida leader.\n\nIn this fact-check, we\u2019re asking whether Romney once said \"we should ask Pakistan for permission\" to strike if bin Laden was in reach.\n\n \u2018We keep our options quiet\u2019\n\nObama approved the May 2, 2011, strike that killed the terrorist  mastermind in his compound in Pakistan.\n\nThe secret, unilateral Navy SEALS mission followed through on a 2007 Obama campaign promise: \"If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President (Pervez) Musharraf won't act, we will.\"\n\nObama\u2019s words attracted criticism from his Democratic and Republican opponents at the time \u2014 including Romney.\n\nThe Republican primary candidate told reporters in Iowa in August 2007 that Obama\u2019s comments were \"ill-timed and ill-considered.\"\n\n\"I do not concur in the words of Barack Obama in a plan to enter an ally of ours, and their country in a manner complete with bombing and so forth. I don\u2019t think those kind of comments help in this effort to draw more friends to our effort. But certainly there is a war being waged by terrorists of different types and nature across the world. And we want, as a civilized world, to participate with other nations in this civilized effort to help those nations reject the extreme within them. That doesn't mean our troops are going to go all over the world.\"\n\nA Romney campaign news release in December 2007 said, \"Sen. Obama Recently Suggested Attacking Inside Pakistan Without Pakistani Approval.\"\n\nRomney didn\u2019t explicitly say that he would ask for permission to strike inside the country.\n\nRather, he said he wanted to \"participate with other nations,\" to fight terrorism and criticized Obama for saying he would attack \"without Pakistani approval.\"\n\nAnd there\u2019s a bit more to the story.\n\nAt the Aug. 5, 2007, Republican debate in Iowa, moderator George Stephanopoulos asked Romney to explain his reaction to Obama\u2019s pledge.\n\n\"I think Barack Obama is confused as to who are our friends and who are our enemies,\" Romney said. \"... He says he wants to unilaterally go in and potentially bomb a nation which is our friend.\"\n\nStephanopoulos pushed for details: \"But if your CIA director called you and said we have Osama bin Laden in our sights, Musharraf says no. What do you do?\"\n\nRomney responded:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's wrong for a person running for the president of the United States to get on TV and say we're going to go into your country unilaterally.\n\n\"Of course, America always maintains our option to do whatever we think is in the best interest of America. But we don't go out and say, ladies and gentlemen of Germany, if ever there was a problem in your country and we didn't think you were doing the right thing, we reserve the right to come in and get him out.\n\n\"We don't say those things. We keep our options quiet. We do not go out and say to a nation which is working with us, where we've collaborated and they are our friend, and we're trying to support Musharraf and strengthen him and his nation, that instead that we intend to go in there and potentially bring out a unilateral attack.\n\n\"Recognize, to win the war on jihad, we have to not only have a strong military on our own and we need a stronger military, we also need to have strong friends around the world and help moderate Muslims reject the extreme. Because ultimately, the only people who can finally defeat these radical Islamic Jihadists are the Muslims themselves.\"\n\nStephanopoulos clarified: \"So ... what I'm hearing is you keep this option on the table, but it was foolish to talk about it in public. Does anybody disagree with that?\"\n\nA transcript shows former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson speaking up \u2014 but not Romney.\n\n Our ruling\n\nObama claimed that during the 2008 campaign, Romney said, \"we should ask Pakistan for permission\" to take out bin Laden. The reality is somewhat more complex.\n\nRomney did express a preference for working with the Pakistanis, and he attacked Obama for saying he would strike if Musharraf wouldn\u2019t.\n\nBut Romney\u2019s clearest objection was to Obama saying the United States would attack inside Pakistan without approval \u2014 not to the option itself. \"We keep our options quiet,\" he said.\n\nObama oversimplified Romney\u2019s stance four years ago.
