My children's school was canceled today. Because of, what? Some ice?\"\n\n\n\"As my children pointed out, in Chicago, school is never canceled,\" Obama said. \"In fact, my 7-year-old pointed out that (during a winter storm) you'd go outside for recess. You wouldn't even stay indoors. So, I don't know. We're going to have to try to apply some flinty Chicago toughness.\"\n\n\nAccording to an AP report, Obama was asked if he meant the people of the national's capital are wimps, to which Obama responded: \"I'm saying, when it comes to the weather, folks in Washington don't seem to be able to handle things.\"\n\n\nChicago gets an average of about 3 feet of snow a year. Is it possible they don't need snow days?\n\n\nTurns out it's been 10 years.\n\n\n\"The last time we had a snow day was on Jan. 4 and 5 of 1999,\" said Malon Edwards, spokesman for the Chicago Public Schools.\n\n\nThat's when the Windy City got socked with 22 inches of snow, at the time the second-largest snowstorm in Chicago history.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

But school stayed open.\n\n\nWe should note that D.C. public schools weren't actually closed on Jan. 28. They opened two hours late. But Obama's daughters, Malia and Sasha, attend the private Sidwell Friends School, which canceled classes. Most school districts in the Washington suburbs also closed.\n\n\nObama is right that snow days are amazingly rare in Chicago \u2014 there haven't been any in the last decade \u2014 but we'll cruelly ding him for saying \"never.\" Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15844"}
