John Mica, a political veteran with a role in House leadership, and Rep. Sandy Adams, who rode the 2010 tea party wave out of the state Legislature and into Congress.\n\nIn a scathing mailpiece, Mica claims he is the right person to represent the reorganized 7th Congressional District because Adams is in cahoots with President Barack Obama.\n\nThe piece states in large type, \"Barack Obama counted on Sandy Adams.\"\n\nSome more excerpts: Sandy Adams Voted Twice to Approve $8 Billion in Obama Stimulus Spending.\n\nCompare Sandy Adams to John Mica before you vote in the Republican primary.\n\nJohn Mica is the only Republican in this race to vote against Obama stimulus.\n\nWait, what? Didn\u2019t Adams, a tea party favorite endorsed by Sarah Palin, come to Washington in 2011? How could she have supported Obama\u2019s 2009 economic stimulus package?\n\nThe mailer offers citations, in the form of bill numbers and vote dates, to back up its claims. Such a gesture sometimes gives us hope that truthfulness will be found. Alas, no. Mica\u2019s claim is illogical.\n\nThe citations are for annual state budgets the Florida Legislature passed in 2009 (SB 2600) and 2010 (HB 5001). Indeed, Adams, then a member of the Florida House, voted for both.\n\nLawmakers faced a tremendous budget shortfall in 2009, and part of the way they offset damaging cuts was to accept $5 billion from the federal stimulus program (and through raising taxes and fees on Floridians by $2.2 billion). The same story emerged in 2010, with $2.4 billion from the stimulus program piped in to patch the deficit.\n\nAdams wasn\u2019t the only House Republican to vote for these budgets. The plans sailed through the Legislature along party lines, with Republicans almost unanimously in favor. Democrats who voted against the budget in 2009 called it \"inadequate.\"\n\nAdams, who campaigned against government waste like a lot of her GOP contemporaries, referred to the stimulus as a \"failed\" bill in a 2010 Orlando Sentinel op-ed.\n\nMica\u2019s team says that\u2019s not her real position. \"We needed to let voters know that her record does not match the rhetoric,\" said Mica spokesman Alan Byrd. \"Congressman Mica voted no.\"\n\nWe have to say, though, we find this line of argument ridiculous.\n\nUsing Mica\u2019s logic, that means Obama also counted on Gov. Rick Scott, a high-profile basher of Obama\u2019s stimulus and health care reforms. The first budget Scott signed contained\u00a0millions of stimulus dollars, after all.\n\nPlus, Adams\u2019 team said Mica is being hypocritical. They pointed to several\u00a0instances in which Mica, along with eight other House Republicans, voted \"no\" on the stimulus and then publicly campaigned for Florida to receive stimulus money for projects such as high-speed rail just hours later. His critique of it then was that it didn\u2019t spend enough money on transportation projects.\n\nOur ruling\n\nMica says Obama counted on Adams to approve stimulus spending. That's not the case. Congress approved the stimulus in 2009, before Adams took her seat in 2011.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnie Mack\n\n\nstated on April 12, 2012 in a television ad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Sen.

Adams couldn\u2019t have voted on the stimulus program because she wasn\u2019t even a member of Congress at the time.\n\nWe rule this statement Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10705"}
