He does not have such a policy in 2020.\nThe headline of one Facebook post, paired with a video commentary, says of the former New York City mayor:\u00a0\n\"Bloomberg says he wants to ban guns holding more than three rounds.\"\nThe post resembles comments made in 2013 by Wayne LaPierre, chief executive of the National Rifle Association, on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nTwo problems:\u00a0\n1. The claim uses the present tense in describing what it refers to as Bloomberg\u2019s proposal, but it cites comments Bloomberg made in a 2012 TV interview.\n2. In those comments, which were in response to questions about how to determine which weapons would be subject to restrictions, Bloomberg alluded to limiting the number of rounds a gun could fire quickly. But he didn\u2019t explicitly say he supported a limit of three.\nOld video\nBloomberg has publicly endorsed a ban on \"military-style assault weapons\" and \"high-capacity ammunition magazines,\" such as in a Feb. 11, 2013, letter to lawmakers from Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition Bloomberg co-founded in 2006.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent Facebook post includes a video with a narrator commenting on excerpts from an ABC News Nightline interview with Bloomberg on Dec. 20, 2012.\u00a0\nThe interview referenced the 20 first-graders and six school staffers who were killed by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. In the interview, anchor Cynthia McFadden asked Bloomberg about the challenge of defining an \"assault weapon.\" Bloomberg responded by expressing a desire to limit how quickly a gun can fire rounds and the number of rounds a gun can carry.\n\"Well, if it can fire a lot of bullets very quickly, that's a good place to start, OK, and then you can argue about what a lot is,\" Bloomberg said.\nMcFadden started to interject, and the mayor continued:\n\"OK, let's pick it. Let's say three. If you haven't hit the deer with three shots, you're a pretty lousy shot. That deer deserves to get away. Let's get serious here.\"\nThe Bloomberg campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nBloomberg supports reinstating the federal ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines; it banned certain types of semi-automatic firearms along with magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Under Bloomberg\u2019s proposal, current assault weapons owners could keep their guns, but would have to report them to federal officials.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says: \"Bloomberg says he wants to ban guns holding more than three rounds.\"\nThe post is misleading in that Bloomberg made the reference to three rounds in a 2012 interview.\nAnd while he suggested restricting the number of rounds that can be fired quickly, and tossed out the idea of three, he didn\u2019t articulate a particular proposal. He also expressed a desire to limit the number of rounds a gun can hold.\nHis 2020 presidential campaign platform includes reinstating the federal ban on assault weapons, which prohibited certain types of semi-automatic firearms along with magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17445"}
