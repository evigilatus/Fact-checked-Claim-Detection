Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate, Democratic activist Paul Begala suggested the presumptive Republican presidential nominee took into account how he would personally fare under Ryan\u2019s wide-reaching proposal for overhauling federal taxes.\n\nBegala, a Texan advising a pro-Obama super-PAC, Priorities Action USA, said in a Twitter post on Aug. 12, 2012: \"So THAT'S why he picked him. In Jan. debate Romney said of Ryan tax plan: \u2018Under that plan, I\u2019d have paid no taxes in the last two years.\u2019\"\n\nDid Romney air the personal impact of Ryan\u2019s tax ideas so many months ago?\n\nAfter emailing Begala, we found Romney\u2019s remark in the Republican presidential candidate debate held Jan. 23, 2012, in Tampa, Fla.\n\nBut according to the debate transcript, Begala\u2019s tweet struck a misleading note: Romney, who earlier noted that his proposed tax plan calls for eliminating the tax on interest, dividends and capital gains for anyone making less than \u00a0$200,000 a year, was referring to a plan advocated by then-candidate Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker.\n\nAfter Gingrich confirmed that his plan called for a 0 percent tax rate on capital gains, Romney said: \"Under that plan, I`d have paid no taxes in the last two years.\"\n\nGingrich: \"Well, if that -- and if you created enough jobs doing that -- it was Alan Greenspan (former head of the Federal Reserve) who first said the best rate, if you want to create jobs for capital gains, is zero. My No. 1 \u00a0goal is to create a maximum number of jobs to put the American people back to work. It`s a straightforward argument.\"\n\nModerator Brian Williams then changed the subject -- and Ryan\u2019s tax plan went unmentioned in the debate.\nBegala later emailed us to share that his tweet stemmed from an Aug. 12, 2012, news blog post by the New York Times. The post, focused on Romney\u2019s just-revealed choice of Ryan, includes this: \"In addition, the budget Ryan presented to the House in April last year called for the elimination of taxes on capital gains and dividend income. Romney pointed out in a January 2012 debate that \u2018Under that plan, I\u2019d have paid no taxes in the last two years.\u2019\"\n\nBegala emailed us that his reliance on the Times\u2019 account shows he \"was acting reasonably & in good faith.\" The Times\u2019 blog post \"may have been wrong, but I had a right to rely\" on it \"for a tweet.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWondering about the effect of Ryan\u2019s plan, we pulled up an Aug. 11, 2012, news article in Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, stating that by its analysis, if Ryan\u2019s plan had been law, Romney's effective tax rate in 2010 would have been about 1 percent.\n\nThe story says Ryan\u2019s proposal would have shaved Romney\u2019s tax bill by about 90 percent by eliminating taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest -- an element identical to the Gingrich plank singled out by Romney in the debate.\n\n\"Since about 95 percent of Romney's $21.6 million income came from those sources in 2010,\" Roll Call said, \"he would pay no taxes on the vast majority of his earnings. It's not certain exactly how low Romney's tax bill would go, but his income from other sources amounts to about $1 million, and Ryan's plan would set a new top rate of 25 percent. Romney's total tax bill would have dropped from the $3 million that he paid to a few hundred thousand dollars if Ryan's plan had been in effect.\"\n\nThe story says Ryan also proposes eliminating the estate tax, \"which would benefit Romney's heirs by tens of millions of dollars.\"\n\nThe article\u2019s descriptions of Ryan\u2019s proposal align with information Ryan has on a website devoted to his proposal.\n\nSeparately, Matthew O\u2019Brien of the Atlantic wrote in an Aug. 11, \u00a02012, blog post that Romney\u2019s 2010 tax rate under the Ryan plan would have been .82 percent. While his capital gains would have gone untaxed, the post says, Romney\u2019s earnings of nearly $594,000 in author and speaking fees would be taxed at 25 percent. Romney would have saved another $292,389 under Ryan\u2019s proposed elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax, according to the post, while still owing $29,151 in self-employment taxes on his author and speaking fees. So he would have paid $177,650 out of a taxable income of $21,661,344, the blog post says.\n\nWe asked Romney\u2019s campaign about this claim. Spokesman Christopher Walker said by email that Romney has a tax plan, making speculation about other plans irrelevant. On his campaign website, Romney says he wants to maintain existing tax rates on capital gains, interest and dividends for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 or more.\n\nOur ruling\n\nContrary to Begala\u2019s claim, Romney was not zeroing in on how he would fare under Ryan\u2019s tax plan when he said he would have paid no taxes the past two years under \"that plan.\" He spoke instead to Gingrich\u2019s proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes for all taxpayers -- which Romney does not advocate.\n\nLike Gingrich, though, Ryan calls for wiping out the capital gains tax for everyone, leaving this claim with an element of truth.
