Heidi Hitkamp, the current Senator of North Dakota, has made her Republican opposition voting on this issue one of her main points in the talk. In the Bismarck Tribune published this week, Hitkamp argued that her opponent, the American Republic of Kevin Kramer, \"Looks at health care through a purely political lens.\" Hetkamp Kramer attacked the vote on several bills to repeal and replace Obama's care programme, and wrote that \"President Donald Trump even referred to one of Kramer's health-care bills \"in the sense that the bill abolished protection for North Dakota residents under conditions that existed before.\" Although Trump praised the American Health Care Act (AHCA), when it was passed at home in May 2017, he later said that the Republican Bill was \"intentionally.\" The bill did not come out of Congress. What Trump said about Trampker was the American Health Care Act, passed by Republicans in the House of Representatives on 4 May 2017, with a limited majority from 217 to 213. We have analysed the Comprehensive Health Insurance Act, and we have found that insurance companies can be allowed to set premiums based on individual health status, making the costs higher for the most satisfactory consumers. When the bill was passed in the Chamber of Deputies, Trump expressed support for the Republican Plan. \"This is a great plan,\" said Trump in the White House announcement with the Republicans. \"I actually think it's gonna get better. And that's, don't make a mistake, that's a cancellation and replacement for Obamakari.\" On January 13, 2021, in a story written by General David Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, he rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" But on January 17, 2021, Associated Press reported in June 2017 that Trump told 15 Republican senators that the House of Representatives bill was \"average, mean,\" and that they needed to make the Senate version of the bill \"more generous.\" On June 25, in an interview on \"Fox and Friends,\" Trump was asked about an article on Facebook by former President Barack Obama, who criticized the GOP plan and said that the amendment made to the Senate bills would not change \"the fundamental malice at the heart of this legislation.\" Pete Heggseth told Fox Trump that \"The former president has never come out like President Obama\" and asked him, \"What do you say to the former president?\" Trump replied that Obama \"in fact used my term, mean. That was my term, because I want to see -- and I speak from the heart, that's what I want to see -- I want to see a bill with a heart. Soon after, Trump again said that he was satisfied with his party's health care plan: \"Sure, no one can be quite happy, even without votes, and forget the votes, it has nothing to do with the votes. This has to do with choosing a plan that everyone will love. I'd say love, but like. But we have a very good plan, we have a few people who, I think you can humbly say, are not standing on rooftops and screaming. They want to get some points. I think they'll get some points.\" Our ruling said that the House of Representatives Bill to abolish Obama's care with the support of Kevin Kramer was referred to by President Donald Trump as \"intention.\" Trump said that the U.S. Health Care Act, passed at home in May 2017, for which Kramer voted, was \"intentional.\" It should be noted that Trump also said that the Republican Health Plan was a \"great plan.\" Trump didn't say specifically that he was mean because of how he dealt with previous circumstances, but that was definitely one of the controversial aspects of the bill. The statement is accurate but requires additional information. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01342"}
