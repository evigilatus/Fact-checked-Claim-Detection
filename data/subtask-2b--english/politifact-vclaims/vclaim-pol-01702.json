I want crystal clean water. And we\u2019ve got it. We\u2019ve got the cleanest country in the planet right now,\" Trump said in an Aug. 21 rally in Charleston, W.Va. \"There\u2019s nobody cleaner than us, and it\u2019s getting better and better.\"\nDoes the United States dominate when it comes to water and air quality? Let\u2019s take a look.\nThe Environmental Performance Index is the go-to source for questions on environmental quality. Yale and Columbia University researchers teamed up with the World Economic Forum in 2018 to compile the data.\nUsing 10 categories, they ranked the United States 27th. On air it ranks 10th and on water, 29th. Among wealthy democracies, the United States ranks toward the bottom, according to Zachary Wendling, principal investigator at the Environmental Performance Index.\nSwitzerland ranked first on the overall index, Barbados ranked first on air quality, and eight European countries tied for first on water. European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Japan tend to top\u00a0the United States in environmental performance.\nClean air\nThe air quality ranking is broken up into three parts. On indoor air quality, the United States ranks first. We don\u2019t cook by burning biomass, so that isn\u2019t surprising, Jeffrey Geddes, a Boston University professor who studies air quality, told us.\nThe United States ranks 88th on exposure to particulate matter, which Geddes called \"a really good indicator for health effects from air pollution.\"\nThe scientists used satellites and ground-based measurements to collect the data for 228 countries and territories dating from 2008 to 2015. That predates Trump. In general, however, changes between 2018 scores and the baseline (roughly 10 years earlier) are mixed and small, Wendling said.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s own research shows a continued decline in air pollutants from 1990. But experts said Trump\u2019s deregulatory practices may have the opposite effect.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Deregulation of automobile emissions standards will increase air pollution, particularly in dense urban areas,\" said Elizabeth Albright, an environmental science professor at Duke University.\nCrystal clean water\nThe United States ranks 29th overall in water quality. In drinking water, it ranks first (alongside nine other countries) and in sanitation, 31st.\n\"For both drinking water and sanitation, the United States is performing okay in absolute terms, with about 3.3 disability-adjusted life-years lost per 100,000 people from risks due to unsafe drinking water, as compared to 6.4 for unsafe sanitation,\" Wendling said.\nWendling said the lower sanitation ranking might be explained by rural populations that rely on septic tanks, but there is enough uncertainty in the data that estimates for high-income countries should be treated with caution.\nExperts said the United States still had a long ways to go before being ranked cleanest.\n\"Any idea we have the freshest water is entirely laughable,\" said Ashok Gadgil, an environmental engineering professor at Berkeley University.\n\"The U.S. does a very good job of producing relatively clean drinking water at very low cost, but we fall far short on our investments in water infrastructure investments\u2014that was the case in Flint, and it also is the case in thousands of other water systems around the country,\" said Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech environmental and water resources engineer. \"Some people could argue it is clean enough for the price, but we are not the cleanest.\"\nIn 2016, 5,363 water systems serving 17.6 million people violated EPA's lead and copper rule, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmentalist non-profit group.\nThe White House did not respond our request for comment.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"I want clean air. I want crystal clean water. And we\u2019ve got it. We\u2019ve got the cleanest country in the planet right now.\"\nNo ranking places the United States at the top of their list for cleanliness.\nThe United States has ample room to improve on air quality when it comes to other developed democracies. While some cities\u2019 water systems violate domestic environmental standards, the United States overall ties for best when it comes to drinking water.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-08-23 14:33:02 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"I want clean air.
