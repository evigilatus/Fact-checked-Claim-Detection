About 30 percent of women, that's their health care.\"\nA reader thought that number sounded high and asked us to check it out.\nWe started by doing some basic math.\nAccording to the 2013 Census Bureau population estimate, there were about 161 million women in the United States, of whom 131 million were age 15 or over -- the primary constituency for Planned Parenthood. Thirty percent of that number is about 39 million women.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid Planned Parenthood serve 39 million women who had no other health care options? Not even close.\nAccording to the most recent Planned Parenthood annual report, the organization saw 2.7 million patients in 2013, completing 10.6 million separate procedures. The biggest categories of procedures were sexually transmitted infection tests (3.7 million), reversible contraception (2.1 million), emergency contraception kits (1.4 million), pregnancy tests (1.1 million), and HIV tests (704,000). (For the record, the group disclosed that it performed 327,653 abortions during that period, or about 3 percent of all procedures.)\nEqually problematic, there's no indication in Planned Parenthood\u2019s data that each of the 2.7 million patients had no other health care resources to rely on, as Reid said was the case.\nWhen we checked with Reid\u2019s office, a spokesman said that the senator was speaking off the cuff and had meant to refer to a different statistic. That is a statistic -- often cited by Planned Parenthood itself -- is that \"one in five American women has chosen Planned Parenthood for health care at least once in her life.\" But that\u2019s not what Reid said.\nOur ruling\nReid said Planned Parenthood is \"the only health care that a significant number of women get. About 30 percent of women, that's their health care.\" That\u2019s not the case -- Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million patients in 2013, not the 39 million it would have needed to see for Reid\u2019s claim to be accurate. Even if every Planned Parenthood patient had no other health care options, the group would have seen about 2\u00a0percent of women, not 30 percent.\u00a0His office acknowledged that Reid, making off-the-cuff remarks, got the talking point wrong. In this case, he really got it wrong.\u00a0We rate the statement Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06126"}
