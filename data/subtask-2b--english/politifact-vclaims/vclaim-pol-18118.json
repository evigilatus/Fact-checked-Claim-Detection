Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., about one attempt to dispose of his state\u2019s nuclear waste.\nThe 15-second ad, which is being shared on Facebook, opens with a silent clip of Sanders speaking. A female narrator and words on the screen make this claim against the Democratic presidential candidate:\n\"Sen. Bernie Sanders led the effort to dump Vermont's nuclear waste on a poor Latino community in Texas.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe claim accurately describes Sanders\u2019 role in leading the legislative effort. But it gives the false impression that the waste was dumped in the community.\nThe group and its claim\nThe ad is from United We Succeed, whose website describes its opposition to Sanders and contains more details about the claim we\u2019re checking. United We Succeed calls itself a partner of the Big Tent Project Fund, which Politico described as a Democratic dark-money group aimed at boosting moderates and bashing Sanders. Dark-money groups are political nonprofits that don\u2019t have to disclose their donors.\nUnited We Succeed did not respond to our requests for information.\nWe reported on a similar claim during Sanders\u2019 2016 run for the Democratic nomination, finding:\n\n\nIn 1998, the House approved a compact struck between Texas, Vermont and Maine that would allow Vermont and Maine to dump low-level nuclear waste in Texas. Sanders co-sponsored the bill and actively ushered it through Congress.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was widely expected the site would be in Sierra Blanca, a community about 16 miles from the Mexico border. At the time, the community was about two-thirds Latino, and its residents had an average annual income of $8,000, according to an article in the Bangor (Maine) Daily News.\n\n\nThe low-level nuclear waste was to include \"items such as scrap metal and worker\u2019s gloves \u2026 as well as medical gloves used in radiation treatments at hospitals,\" according to the Bangor Daily News.\u00a0\n\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign pointed out that Sierra Blanca was not specified as the site in the federal legislation, and that the legislation had overwhelming support of the legislatures, governors and voters in Texas, Maine and Vermont.\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s clear Sanders did help lead legislation that won approval in Congress.\nIn reviewing the issue in 2016, when it was raised during Sanders\u2019 first presidential run, Texas Monthly concluded that \"it\u2019s fair to characterize Sanders\u2019 support for the project as driven largely by a desire to see a Vermont problem resolved far from his own backyard.\"\nAuthorities in Texas ultimately rejected Sierra Blanca as the site because of safety concerns over its proximity to a geologic fault line. No nuclear waste was dumped there.\nIn 2012, a site in Andrews County in West Texas, about 200 miles from Sierra Blanca, opened to accept the Vermont waste.\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\nA Facebook ad said, \"Sen. Bernie Sanders led the effort to dump Vermont's nuclear waste on a poor Latino community in Texas.\"\nSanders supported legislation that allowed for the dumping of nuclear waste from Vermont in Texas; the exact site wasn\u2019t specified in the legislation, but it was widely expected to be Sierra Blanca, a low-income, largely Latino community.\u00a0\nBut the post leaves the impression that dumping was done there, when it wasn\u2019t.
