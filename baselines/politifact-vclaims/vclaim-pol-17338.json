But earlier, she made a less dramatic deviation from protocol.\nCNN host Jake Tapper noted the shift in his post-speech analysis, as well as in a tweet that attracted more than 36,000 likes.\nTapper wrote, \"Traditionally, the Speaker says: \u2018Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States.\u2019 (Tonight) Speaker Pelosi said, \u2018Members of Congress, the President of the United States.\u2019 \"\nTapper is right, we found.\u00a0\nWe looked back at all of the speaker-president interactions in State of the Union addresses going back to 2007, which was Pelosi\u2019s first as speaker. (The 2009 and 2017 addresses are technically not considered State of the Union addresses, but we counted them too.)\nBetween the 2007 and 2018 addresses, every speaker has said something very close to the following: \"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"\nHere\u2019s the rundown, with links to the video.\n2007: Pelosi to President George W. Bush:\n\"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"\n2008: Pelosi to Bush:\n\"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"\n2009: Pelosi to President Barack Obama:\n\"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"\n2010: Pelosi to Obama:\n\"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"\n2011: House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to Obama:\n\"I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting the president of the United States.\"\n2012: Boehner to Obama:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"\n2013: Boehner to Obama:\n\"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"\n2014: Boehner to Obama:\n\"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"\n2015: Boehner to Obama:\n\"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"\n2016: Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to Obama:\n\"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"\n2017: Ryan to Trump:\n\"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"\n2018: Ryan to Trump:\n\"Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.\"\nThe Pelosi-Trump interactions\nThe pattern changed abruptly in 2019, with Trump as president and Pelosi as speaker.\nIn 2019, Pelosi didn\u2019t say anything before Trump started speaking. It\u2019s unclear whether there was a miscommunication, but Pelosi insisted to reporters later that \"there was no snub. It went quickly, I guess.\"\nIn 2020, Pelosi did say part of the phrase \u2014 but as Tapper noted, it was just a part. She said: \"Members of Congress, the president of the United States.\"\nPelosi\u2019s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\nOur ruling\nTapper tweeted, \"Traditionally, the Speaker says: \u2018Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States.\u2019 (Tonight) Speaker Pelosi said, \u2018Members of Congress, the President of the United States.\u2019 \"\nBetween 2007 and 2018, Pelosi and her successors used that language or something close, regardless of the party affiliations of the speaker and the president.\nIn 2019, for unclear reasons, Pelosi didn\u2019t speak before Trump started. This year, she did, but she left out the part about a \"high privilege and distinct honor.\"\nWe rate the statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17338"}
