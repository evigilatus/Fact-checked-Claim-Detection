USPostman.com is registered to an address in Macedonia, a known hotbed of fake news websites.\nPunditFact examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as \"not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism, and everyday life.\" It was flagged by Facebook users as being fake.\nKelly announced in January 2017 she was leaving Fox News six months before her contract was up. She is moving to NBC, where she reportedly will be hosting a morning show starting in May as well as a Sunday night news magazine.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe reportedly gave up an offer of $20 million per year to stay at Fox, where she had accused former CEO Roger Ailes of sexual harassment.\nA closer reading of the USPostman.com post raises suspicions. It quotes both her supposed new NBC producer Hugh McGovern and NBC Universal CEO Maxwell Seawald as saying unflattering things about her desire and ability to be a journalist. It doesn\u2019t appear these are real people; NBC Universal\u2019s CEO is actually Steven Burke.\nUSPostman.com cites SGSNews.com as the source of its story, but the true source is TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which published its article on March 8.\nIt\u2019s common for fake news websites to appropriate content from other websites. But TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which has been the source of several fake news stories that we\u2019ve previously checked, admits it makes up its stories.\nWhile there isn\u2019t an indication on the post itself, TheLastLineOfDefense.org says on its About Us link that \"all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\nThere\u2019s no such admission on USPostman.com, but the story is still made up. Kelly has not been fired from NBC.\nWe rate this statement Pants On Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c30be8c1-bd87-4883-8ea3-39f063e39692", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03480"}
