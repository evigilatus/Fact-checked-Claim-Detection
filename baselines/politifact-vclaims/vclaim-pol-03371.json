I think the American population has plenty of information.\"\nWe\u2019ve heard claims like this before. But as we concluded in the past, Trump\u2019s lack of tax returns undermine any type of claim that he\u2019s released more financial information than anybody else.\nWhat do we know about Trump\u2019s finances?\nWhen we asked the Treasury Department about Mnuchin\u2019s comments, staff told us that his remark was specifically in reference to Trump\u2019s 92-page financial disclosure form.\nThat financial disclosure form is formally known as the Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report. The personal financial disclosure form must by law be made public.\nTrump\u2019s disclosure form is extensive and includes 92 pages of small-print details on assets and income.\nTreasury spokesman Tony Sayegh said Mnuchin claim was grounded in the fact that Mitt Romney\u2019s form was only 47 pages, not counting amendments and updates. Sayegh argued that even Romney, a businessman with a complex set of holdings, didn't release as much in his financial disclosure.\nBut extensive or not, the financial disclosure form is not a substitute for tax returns. And given the fact Mnuchin remark was made after a question about tax returns, it\u2019s possible that his comment would be interpreted more broadly to include all the types of financial disclosure, not just the form.\nWhen Trump argued that his financial disclosures were \"the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics,\" we rated that claim False.\nThe two most obvious pieces of the puzzle missing without Trump\u2019s tax returns are the effective rate of tax he pays on his income, and the extent and nature of his charitable giving.\nTax returns also can give a clearer picture of Trump\u2019s liquid assets and what specific mix of taxes the candidate paid. The returns would also show if Trump has access to specialized tax breaks.\n\"It is true that Trump's businesses have received a lot of attention, but without the release of Trump's tax returns, we don't know a lot about his personal financial situation,\" Lawrence White, an economist at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, told PolitiFact in October.\nTrump was the first major presidential nominee in 40 years not to release his tax returns, citing a routine audit. In 1976, President Gerald Ford, did not release his tax returns but instead provided a summary of his taxes. His opponent, Jimmy Carter, did release his tax returns that year \u2014 and every major-party nominee since Carter has released them to the public, until Trump.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy, has been collecting publicly available tax returns of presidential candidates and other top officials for its Tax History Project. This archive goes back as far as the 1913 tax returns of future president Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nFormer president Barack Obama released tax returns for 16 years (2000-15.) George W. Bush and Bill Clinton released tax returns for every year in office except for their last. George Bush released three years of returns, and Reagan released 6 years worth of returns.\nBefore the election, Trump promised he would release his returns after a routine audit was over. However, there is no law that prohibits someone from releasing tax returns during an audit. (Richard Nixon released tax returns in the middle of an audit a year after being re-elected.)\nOn April 17, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump's audit was still ongoing, but Mnuchin remarks suggest it might not happen at all.\nWithout his tax returns, it\u2019s hard to know how Trump would personally benefit from his tax cut proposals. Trump\u2019s proposal recommends sharp cuts in individual and business income tax rates, as well as eliminating the estate tax and alternative minimum tax.\nAdditional context about Trump, tax returns and the public\nAlthough Trump has refused to release his tax returns, some of them have leaked out.\nMost recently, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC revealed a small portion of Trump's 2005 tax return. It showed that he earned $150 million that year and paid federal taxes of about $38 million.\nIn 1995, Trump reported a $916 million loss, according to the three pages of returns obtained and verified by the New York Times in September.\nWe know a little bit about Trump\u2019s taxes in the 1970s. A 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators analyzed Trump's finances as part of his efforts to get a casino license for a proposed casino-hotel complex. Page 33 reports on Trump's income and federal tax payments for 1975 through 1979.\nThe report says that Trump paid federal taxes for three of those five years, 1975-77. Trump did not pay federal income tax in 1978 and 1979 because, according to the tax rules, he lost money those years. But the report reveals no specifics, so the details of his tax returns for those years remain a mystery.\nTrump\u2019s taxes have piqued the interests of voters for quite some time now. In January, Trump said that Americans don\u2019t care about his tax returns, but several polls of the time show that a sizable portion of the public does think Trump\u2019s tax returns are an important issue.\nOur ruling \nMnuchin said Trump \"has given more financial disclosure than anybody else.\"\nTrump released a financial disclosure report that all presidential candidates are required to fill out, but the fact that Trump has not released any tax filings undermines Munchin\u2019s claim.\nExperts told us that tax returns would offer valuable details on his tax rate, the types of taxes he paid, and his charitable giving, as well as a better idea of his income-producing assets.\nWhen we look at all the types of financial disclosure Trump could provide to the public, the lack of transparency around his tax returns remains a significant omission compared with recent presidents.\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2017-04-27 17:38:12 UTC   Politifact    5 1 7  Politifact Rating: False  Says President Donald Trump \"has given more financial disclosure than anybody else.\"    Steve Mnuchin Treasury secretary   a press conference Wednesday, April 26, 2017 2017-04-26    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03371"}
