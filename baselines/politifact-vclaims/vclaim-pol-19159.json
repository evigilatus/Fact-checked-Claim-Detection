Kim Reynolds made a bid to draw attention to her administration\u2019s pre-pandemic economic record last year, telling reporters that the state had the largest employed workforce in its history when 2020 started.\n\"We began 2020 last year with our state\u2019s fiscal health strong, our economy was growing, our wages were going up and we had more Iowans working than at any other time in our state history,\" Reynolds told reporters in a Thursday, Jan. 7, electronic news conference.\nIowa\u2019s first COVID-19 case was detected in\u00a0March 2020. Although the labor force in Iowa had been steadily increasing, the COVID-19 pandemic marked a reversal of that trend. Iowa\u2019s total civilian labor force and the number of those who were employed declined.\nWe\u2019ve checked claims\u00a0about Iowa\u2019s economy pre-pandemic before, though not the particular claim about Iowa boasting its largest employed workforce at the start of 2020.\u00a0\nReynolds spokesperson Pat Garrett pointed to\u00a0Iowa Workforce Development data\u00a0to back up the claim and a check shows that\u2019s true, though other indicators exist to show when an economy is prospering.\nIn January 2020, Iowa\u2019s employed workforce totaled 1,704,900 people, a\u00a0March 16, 2020,\u00a0Iowa Workforce Development report shows. That\u2019s 600 more people than in the previous month and 33,000 more people than in January 2019. No other month in Iowa\u2019s recorded employment has been higher than that January 2020 figure.\nBy November 2020, the number of employed Iowans totaled 1,561,600, about 143,000 less than 10 months prior. The total available civilian labor force declined by\u00a093,000 since April 2020.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan West, deputy director of the Iowa Workforce Development told\u00a0The Daily Iowan\u00a0in a phone interview that between October 2019 and February 2020, more than 1.7 million Iowans were employed, the most since the data first became available beginning in 1976. The numbers used, he said, are sourced from monthly\u00a0reports\u00a0from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nIn the past two years, Iowa has had historically low unemployment rates for the state.\nAccording to the Iowa Workforce Development, nine of the past two decades\u2019 lowest reported monthly unemployment rates were recorded in the last two years. The lowest unemployment rate over the past 20 years was 1.9 percent in October 2018.\u00a0\nBut were wages going up?\nThe annual mean wage from May 2019, the last available\u00a0data\u00a0from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was $47,330, up from the May 2018 average wage of $46,150.\nAccording to a\u00a02019 State of Working Iowa\u00a0report by the Iowa Policy Project, which since has merged with another organization and has been renamed Common Good Iowa, the median hourly wage went up about 80 cents since 2009 to $18.40, most of which came in the last two years. However, that wage growth has been \"slow to come\" according to the report. Iowa\u2019s top 10 percent of earners had the highest share of wage growth.\nOur ruling\nBefore COVID-19, the numbers show Iowa\u2019s employed workforce was the largest in the state\u2019s history. But the numbers have declined since the pandemic. We rate the governor\u2019s statement as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19159"}
