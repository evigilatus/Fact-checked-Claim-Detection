When she asked her thoughts about the Executive Director of the Amazon region, Jeff Pizo, the New York democracy said that she cared more about the ability of the Amazon warehouse workers to get a \"living wage\" than about the wealth of billionaires. \"But if being a billionaire depends on paying people for hunger and depriving them of their access to health care, and also if their ability to be a billionaire depends on the fact that their workers take food stamps,\" she said that that was a problem. Amazon said that Okasio Cortez was a \"mistake\" in a Twitter reply. \"Amazon is the leader of a 15-minute salary plus full benefits from day one,\" the company wrote. Okasio Cortez was fired this time with a definition of \"hungry wages.\" The following day, she said on Twitter: \"Pushing full-time employees so little that they need government food assistance means paying for hunger.\" Therefore, who is the truth? In this case, both sides have a point of view. :: How to pay workers in the Amazon region, a giant in electronic commerce, employ 647,500 full-time and part-time workers worldwide, in addition to contractors and temporary employees, according to company deposits. This includes some 125,000 full-time employees working in 75 warehouses in North America, on the company &apos; s website. In November 2018, the Amazon region raised the minimum wage to $15 per hour and began to press for the recurrence of these changes at the federal level. According to the company &apos; s statement, the initiative brought its full-time employees in the United States to USD 35,096 for 2018. This means that about half of the Amazon workers in the United States received less than $35,096 in 2018, partly because the minimum wage of $15 was only valid for the last two months of the year. (The federal poverty level for 2019 is $25,750 for a family of four, up from $25,100 last year.) The Amazon spokesman Ashley Robinson said that this figure for average wages \"does not include the monetary value of several benefits we provide to our employees\" such as health care. \"Growning wages\": reported by Corbin Trent, Ocacio Cortez spokesman, cited reports in the Washington Post, Fox, The Interbit, NBC News, CNN and Newsweek as evidence in support of Ocacio-Cortez's statement. Okasio Cortez also cited the daily monster on Twitter. In addition to detailing poor working conditions, a number of these articles said that some Amazon workers relied on the Federal Supplementary Food Assistance Programme, known as SNAP, to put food on the table. This result resulted from the \"Objection and New Food Economy\" programme, a non-profit food-focused news portal, which applied for public records related to the South Pacific National Action Programme to 30 states where Amazon warehouses were located. The applications were returned from Arizona, Kansas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington showed that thousands of Amazon workers received food stamps through SNAP, including up to 1 in 3 in Arizona and about 1 in 10 in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2021, Stack Okasio Cortez defined \"hungry wages\" for these results, which appear to be partially correct; some warehouse workers needed government food assistance. But there are some warnings. At the outset, Robinson said that some of the Amazon workers listed in the reports as registered in the South Pacific National Action Programme might be eligible because they chose to work part-time. Robinson also said that some workers could have received the benefits of the South Pacific National Action Programme at the time they were hired by the Amazon region. However, the greatest warning is that the \"objection and the new food economy\" based their reporting on data from 2014 to 2017, before the Amazon region raised the minimum wage. \"\"\"\"\" (Occio Cortez's allegations) and the articles she refers to were before the increase in wages,\" said Robinson. \"The average annual compensation for United States employees in 2018 was $35,096 and because the minimum wage came into effect for only two months of 2018, we expect the cash figure to increase in 2019.\" Will the increase be enough? Experts said that there was a lot of uncertainty when it came to assessing whether a 15-hour fee could keep people away from SNAP. This is partly due to the fact that the incomes of Amazon workers depend on the number of hours they work. This is also due to the fact that the eligibility and benefits of the South Pacific National Action Programme are determined not only by income for the poverty line, but also by factors such as household size. For example, a full-time Amazon employee who receives $15 an hour, works 40 hours a week and takes two weeks off, will earn $30,000 a year. If the female employee has a non-working spouse and two children, she will be above the poverty line of $25,750 for a four-member family. But many circumstances can change that. \"If all dependants are young children, the poverty line will be slightly lower,\" said Christopher Jinx, Professor of Social Policy at Harvard University. \"If the worker in question has a working husband and two children, the picture will look much better.\" \"The picture will also vary according to government and local taxes, housing costs, the state of health of family members, the extent to which those who work must spend it to reach their jobs, and so forth,\" Jinx added. \"It all depends.\" Furthermore, SNAP benefits are determined monthly, even an hourly wage worker who may be eligible for one month rather than another, as stated by Timothy Smiding, Professor of Public Affairs and Economics at Wisconsin-Madison University. Smiding said that other government programmes, such as tax exemption for earned income, could also play a role for workers with minimum wages and multiple children. \"For families of, for example, $4, 30,000 a year could mean maybe some SNAP, but certainly still receive tax assistance from EITC,\" said, adding that large families could get two. Our referee, Okasio Cortez, said that Amazon \"pays so little full-time employees that they need food assistance from Gove.\" Several reports reported that thousands of warehouse workers in Amazon relied on food stamps to meet their needs in 2015. But some of these workers may have been part-time. It is important that the company has also moved to a minimum wage of $15 since the issuance of these reports. This may not change things for all staff - experts said that some workers would still be eligible for food stamps and other forms of government assistance - but could help more of them obtain them themselves. In general, this claim is partially accurate but omits important details. Based on the best information available, we evaluate it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00507"}
