We have not even reached February, and the cost of illegal migration so far this year amounts to $18,959,495,168. The cost on Friday was $603,331,392. There are at least 25,772,342 illegal foreigners, not 11,000,000 reported for years, in our country. So fucking ridiculous! DHS - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 27 January 2019 Trap numbers are so accurate that one may think they are derived from a report. But it is unclear where they come from, and immigration and demography experts refute the relevant estimates. We do not know how Trump decided that the cost of illegal immigration \"to date this year\" was $18,959,495,168, or that \"the cost on Friday was $603,331,392.\" The Trump tweet ends with \"DHS\" - short for the Ministry of Internal Security, which is responsible for immigration law enforcement. We asked the Department of Homeland Security and the White House to submit the research that Trump used to claim. Neither provided information. Last month, Trump claimed that illegal immigration cost the United States $250 billion a year. And we estimate this error because even the highest estimates we found weren't close to $250 billion. In a report issued in September 2017, the Right-wing Union for American Migration Reform estimated that the federal, state and local costs of more than 12.5 million people in the United States illegally amounted to about $135 billion. After calculating the tax contributions of this population group, the Group stated that the overall economic impact of illegal migration was about $116 billion (an increase from $113 billion in 2013). If Trump based his last claim on the annual estimate of $250 billion he used in December and divided it over 12 months, then it would reach about $20.8 billion per month, a little higher than the estimate \"to date this year.\" However, this is not necessarily an accurate method of calculating the costs of irregular migration. Trump regularly departs from the cost of irregular migration, and generally ignores the basis for its figures. On 4 December 2018, he said that the cost was $250 billion per year, approximately two weeks later, and that it was $275 billion per year. In 2016, he said it was $113 billion a year. The allegation about the number of illegal immigrants living in the United States contrasts most of the estimates with Trump's assertion that \"there are at least 25.7 million migrants living illegally in the country.\" According to widely accepted estimates, it is close to 11 million people. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 3 February 2021 A December 2018, report of the Ministry of National Security estimated that there were 12 million illegal immigrants in the country in January 2015. The report acknowledged the estimates received from two other sources, the Pio Research Centre and the Centre for Migration Studies. The three sets of estimates (from the Ministry of Health, Pew, the Centre for Migration Studies) were \"almost identical,\" the Ministry of Health report said, but there were differences in specific assumptions and methodologies, resulting in \"some different figures and trends.\" The report of the Demographic and Health Survey did not refer to a study carried out by researchers at Yale University in September 2018, which estimated that the average number of migrants in the country was 22.1 million in 2016. The Yale study stated that estimates of 11 million were derived from population surveys and legal migration records; while Yale's estimates used an alternative approach \"based on basic principles of demographic flows,\" Yale's study said. The Yale University study has been criticized by demographers and immigration experts. Some argue that it is not sufficiently based on empirical research on patterns of irregular migration; rather, it overestimates migration from Mexico; and if there are millions more people in the United States, there will be more relevant demographic records, such as birth and school records for their children. In an interview in January 27 CBS entitled \"Facing the Nation,\" Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvani couldn't say where Trump got his appreciation. Molvani said that the number must be above 11 million, referring to the number of illegal immigrants since the past three months. \"I'm not exactly sure where the president got this number this morning,\" said Mulvani. \"But I think what you see trying to do is point to how ridiculous this debate is.\" Our Governor Trump said, \"We have not even reached February and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168. The cost on Friday was $603,331,392. There are at least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not 11 million that have been reported for years, in our country.\" The source of Trump &apos; s claim is unclear. We asked the Ministry of National Security and the White House to support the Trump statement, but they did not submit any studies or other data to support it. Trump had previously falsely claimed that the cost of illegal migration was $250 billion a year. Even the highest annual estimates we found were much lower than that amount ($116 billion, after calculating tax contributions). Most estimates indicate that there are some 11 million illegal migrants in the country. A recent study by Yale University researchers stated that the average number was 22.1 million, but many demographers pointed to flaws in the assumptions and results of that study. Without evidence from Trump or his administration to support this statement, we appreciate it as wrong.
