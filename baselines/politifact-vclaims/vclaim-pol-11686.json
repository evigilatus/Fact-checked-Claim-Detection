Penny Bernard Schaber, D-Appleton, worried aloud about environmental damage such an operation might cause.\n\nThe second-term Assembly member compared the mine to Lake Winnebago, the largest of Wisconsin\u2019s 15,000 inland lakes and one of the largest freshwater inland lakes in the U.S.\n\n\"That's a very large lake that's right at the end of the area that I represent, \u00a0extremely large lake. And from what I've tried to figure out on the central size of this mine, it could be about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago,\" Bernard Schaber said. \"And Lake Winnebago, I encourage you to go there. I\u2019ve ridden my bike around it and it\u2019s a hundred miles-plus to ride your bike around the lake.\"\n\nSize would help determine whether the mine would help create thousands of jobs, as its supporters contend, as well as what impact it would have on land and water.\n\nSo let\u2019s see if Bernard Schaber\u2019s comparison measures up.\nBillion-dollar mine\n\nNews surfaced in November 2010 that Gogebic Taconite proposed to spend more than $1 billion to develop an open-pit iron ore mine more than 300 miles northwest of Milwaukee in far northern Wisconsin. It would take years to open the mine, if various government approvals are won.\n\nGogebic Taconite hasn\u2019t made a formal proposal to the state as it waits to see whether Assembly Bill 426, which has generated lobbying activity by 34 organizations, becomes law. The bill, which would relax environmental standards and public participation in the review process for the mine, was approved Jan. 26, 2012 by the Republican-controlled Assembly, with Bernard Schaber and every other Democrat in attendance voting no.\n\nGogebic president Bill Williams told PolitiFact Wisconsin the company would need up to 5,000 acres to encompass the mine -- roughly four miles long and a half-mile wide -- and facilities such as roads, waste-rock storage and ore processing.\n\nThat would be nowhere near two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago, which has an area of about 138,000 acres.\n\nWe sought out a state mine expert and spoke with Ann Coakley, director of the waste and materials management bureau of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. She noted Gogebic has spoken about a possibly wider mine -- 1.5 miles wide rather than a half-mile. But even at that, she estimated that the total footprint likely would be 10,000 acres. That, too, is much less than two-thirds the area of Lake Winnebago.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawmaker's evidence\nSo, does Bernard Schaber have evidence that the mine would be two-thirds as big as the lake?\n\nNo and yes.\n\nLegislative aide Eric Koch said his boss believes the space needed for the related facilities, added to the mine itself, would make the total footprint two-thirds the size of the lake. But he acknowledged she has no solid data to support that estimate. \u00a0\n\nIn a written summary and other documents Bernard Schaber provided to back up her claim, she introduced a different measurement: volume.\n\nShe starts with the dimensions of Lake Winnebago, citing a DNR document. If we round the figures Bernard Schaber cites, the lake has an area of nearly 138,000 acres, which is about 6 billion square feet. She multiplies 6 billion square feet by the lake\u2019s average depth of 15.5 feet, for a total of 93 billion cubic feet.\n\nNow to the size of the mine.\n\nNoting that Gogebic Taconite has given varying dimensions of what the size of the mine itself might be, Bernard Schaber used a length of 4.5 miles and a width of three-quarters of a mile. That comes to 3.375 square miles or about 94 million square feet. She multiplies that figure by 1,000 feet, which has been the reported depth of the mine, to come up with a total of 94 billion cubic feet -- a volume even larger than Lake Winnebago\u2019s.\n\nGogebic Taconite\u2019s Williams told us the mine\u2019s depth would range from 700 to 1,000 feet. But even if we used 700 instead of 1,000 in the equation, we\u2019d get a mine depth of 66 billion cubic feet -- more than two-thirds the volume of Lake Winnebago.\n\nSo, when depth is added to length and width, the mine is at or near the size of the lake. But at the hearing Bernard Schaber -- who spoke of biking around the lake -- was clearly referring to area, not volume.\n\nOur rating\n\nBernard Schaber said \"the central size\" of a mine proposed for far northern Wisconsin \"could be about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago.\" There\u2019s an element of truth in her statement, in terms of volume. But she lacks evidence to back her central claim, which was area.\n\nWe rate her statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11686"}
