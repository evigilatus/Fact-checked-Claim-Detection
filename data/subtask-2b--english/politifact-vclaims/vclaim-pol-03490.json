Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as \"not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism and everyday life.\"\nPresident Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan have had their differences\u00a0ever since Trump emerged as the frontrunner for the 2016 Republican nomination.\nBut once Trump won the election, Ryan has generally praised the former host of \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" TV show.\nAnd a major clash between the two GOP leaders certainly would lead the news.\nYet we don\u2019t recall a headline like this one in any mainstream news source:\n\"BREAKING: President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan \u2018You\u2019re Fired.\u2019\"\n(\"You\u2019re fired\" was Trump\u2019s catchphrase on the show.)\nThe headline was on an article posted on TheLastLineOfDefense.org on March 14, 2017 (10 days before the Republican plan to replace Obamacare collapsed, with some\u00a0conservatives blaming Ryan). The site operators describe themselves as \"a group of educated, God-fearing Christian conservative patriots.\"\nThe headline and article were also posted the same day on a site called usanewspost.us, which presents an overlay of photos of scantily clad women when you go to its home page.\nBut not on any other site that we could find -- much less a reputable news source.\nAn aside, before we dig in: Roughly two-thirds of the statements made by bloggers that have been rated by PolitiFact have received a False or Pants on Fire. That includes a handful made by TheLastLineOfDefense.org.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts site carries a disclaimer that says its articles \"may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don\u2019t necessarily exist. All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\nBut you don't necessarily get that impression from any one article.\nIn this case, the article begins by quoting a statement from \"Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP\" as saying Trump \"will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming (sic) loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault.\"\nWe couldn\u2019t find any connection between Trump\u2019s White House and any person with that name or anything called WHOIP.\nThe article, which doesn\u2019t spell out what precipitated Trump\u2019s alleged statement, ends by stating that Trump approached Ryan at a luncheon and told him: \"Mr. Speaker, you\u2019re fired.\"\nIt goes without saying that if Trump had had such an encounter with Ryan, it would have been widely reported.\nOne operator of\u00a0TheLastLineOfDefense.org responded to our request for information to back up the statement by referring us to the site's disclaimer notice.\nIn January 2017, BuzzFeed News reported that according to that man, identified as Zeke Wilekenmeyer, the site is \"an elaborate trolling operation aimed at conservatives.\"\nRyan press secretary Ian Martorana told us: \"That headline is pure fiction.\"\nOur rating\nBloggers said: \"President Trump just told Paul Ryan, \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019\"\nNo such statement has ever surfaced in the mainstream news media, only on a website that warns that much of its material is satirical.\nOur rating is Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    6 7  Politifact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"President Trump just told Paul Ryan, \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019\"    Bloggers Bloggers posting on the Internet   On a website Tuesday, March 14, 2017 03/14/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03490"}
