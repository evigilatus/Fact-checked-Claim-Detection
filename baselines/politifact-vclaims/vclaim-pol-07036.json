Try 1980", "text": "For the past couple decades, Republicans have struggled to oust Democratic senators, though that trend is expected to change Tuesday.\nMany forecasters have Republicans taking up to eight Democratic Senate seats -- beating incumbents in Arkansas, Louisiana, Alaska and Colorado. If this scenario pans out, Republicans will gain control of the Senate, and they will have overcome a historical challenge.\n\"The last time we beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980,\" said Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer\u00a0on CNN\u2019s State of the Union\u00a0on Nov. 2.\nIt\u2019s commonly understood that incumbent candidates have an advantage over their challengers\u00a0for many reasons including visibility, accomplishments in the position, and being a high-quality candidate (why they were elected in the first place). But have Republican challengers really struggled so much to take Democratic seats?\nWe looked at past Senate election results and found that Republicans have had some successful gains in the past 35 years, but many of those wins were in races for an open seat when a\u00a0Democratic senator was retiring.\nIn 1980, Republicans took 12 Democrat Senate seats\u00a0(nine incumbents lost in the general election, while three lost in their primaries.).\u00a0Spicer is\u00a0correct to say they haven\u2019t beat more than two incumbents since then.\nWe found a great chart showing Senate seat turnover for the past half-century in the Brookings Institution\u2019s most recent \"Vital Statistics on Congress\" report. (h/t to Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball.) The arrows show when a Democratic (D) seat switched to a Republican (R) seat and vice versa.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFrom 1981 on, Republicans have beaten only 12 incumbent Democrats for Senate seats. Republicans\u2019 biggest Senate gains in that time frame all involve taking open seats -- such as 1994, 2004 and 2010, when they gained four, five and six open seats, respectively.\nSenate Democrats haven\u2019t had quite the same struggle against Republican incumbents in recent years. Since\u00a01981, they\u2019ve beaten 37 incumbents total, compared to Republicans\u2019 12.\nSo if Republicans are able to beat more than two incumbent Democratic senators Tuesday, it would be a clear break with the recent past.\u00a0\nIf Republicans take seven seats, both beating incumbents and taking open seats (which the New York Times\u2019 election model has as the most likely outcome), that will be their second-biggest overall gain since 1980. In 1994, Republicans won eight Senate seats -- beating two incumbents and taking six open seats.\nWhat made 1980 so special? In the same election, former President Ronald Reagan beat incumbent Democrat President Jimmy Carter. Carter was fast falling out of favor with voters, considering the Iran hostage crisis, a floundering economy and other issues. On top of Carter\u2019s struggles, there was a major rift between Southern and Northern Democrats. It was an extraordinary political environment that allowed Republicans to sweep the congressional elections. \u00a0\nCompare that to this year\u2019s Senate elections where,\u00a0although there is no presidential election,\u00a0Republicans are using President Barack Obama\u2019s relatively low popularity to their advantage in races against incumbent Democrats. \u00a0\nOur ruling\nSpicer said the last time Republican Senate candidates \"beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980.\"\nRepublicans kicked a total of 9 incumbent Democrats out of office in 1980 (another three lost in a primary). Since then, Republicans have turned two or fewer seats each election. Most of their success has been in winning formerly Democratic open seats.
