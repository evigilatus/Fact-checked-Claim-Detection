Many of the people who were at that event, Susan, actually were tested for coronavirus, and it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise. The difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates, and not just mandates with the coronavirus, but a government takeover of health care, the Green New Deal, all government control. We\u2019re about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people.\"\nHarris replied: \"Let\u2019s talk about respecting the American people. You respect the American people when you tell them the truth. You respect the American people when you have the courage to be a leader. Speaking of those things that you may not want people to hear, but they need to hear so they can protect themselves. But this administration stood on information that, if you had as a parent, if you had as a worker, knowing you didn\u2019t have enough money saved up, and now you\u2019re standing in a food line because of the ineptitude of an administration that was unwilling to speak the truth to the American people. So let\u2019s talk about caring about the American people. The American people have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration. It is asking too much of the people \u2014 it is asking too much of the people that they would not be equipped with the information they need to help themselves to protect their parents and their children.\"\u00a0\nThe Facebook post misquotes Pence but it comes close to something he actually said. He was arguing that he and the president trust Americans to make the best choices for themselves while Harris and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden want to mandate how people must respond to the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut the post\u2019s attack on Harris is a misfire. She didn\u2019t say \"American people aren\u2019t equipped\" to make decisions about the pandemic for themselves. She accused the Trump administration of failing to equip Americans with information they needed about the deadliness of the coronavirus to make those decisions.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18671"}
