James White said that 10% of children in the United States are Texans.\nTexas is the second most populous state in the nation and PolitiFact has checked a number of claims about its residents in the past. Most recently, we rated False a claim that a third of Texas has seen a \"20-25% population loss in the last 5 years.\"\nBut what about White\u2019s claim that 10% of all children in the United States live in Texas?\nWhite\u2019s tweet used many abbreviations and symbols, but can be paraphrased as such: Texas youths are 20% of our state population, but 100% of our state\u2019s future. Texas holds the destiny of our nation. Ten percent of U.S. children are Texans. So goes Texas, so goes the world.\nHe included a link to a video showing a public interview he did with Raise Your Hand Texas, a non-profit education advocacy organization, about educational development of teachers in his district.\nLooking at the data\nWhen we asked White, a Republican from Hillister, for the source of his claim, he pointed us to a 2016 report from the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, titled \"State of Texas Children.\"\nThe report said: \"More than 7 million children live in Texas today, representing nearly 1 in 10 children living in the U.S.\"\nPolitiFact Texas checked a similar statement in 2017: \"One in 10 babies born in this country is born in Texas.\"\nWe rated that claim True, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about annual births.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut White\u2019s claim is a bit different, as it focuses on total population, not annual births. For this check, we turned to two sets of data from the Census Bureau measuring population by age and location.\nThere are about 73.4 million people in the United States under the age of 18, according to 2018 population estimates.\nThere are about 7.4 million in Texas \u2014 about 10% of the total population of people under 18 in the United States.\nTexas makes up the second largest share of people under 18 in the U.S., after California, which is home to about 12% of the population under 18 years old.\nWithin Texas, the population under 18 made up about 26% of the state\u2019s population in 2018.\nIn California, minors made up 23% of the state\u2019s population in 2018.\n\nOur ruling\nWhite said: \"10% of U.S. children are Texans.\"\nWhite\u2019s claim checks out. There are about 73.4 million minors in the United States and about 10%, or 7.4 million, live in Texas.\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17665"}
