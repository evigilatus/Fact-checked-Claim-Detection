In fact, every president except for William Harrison (who died a month into office) has issued at least one executive order.\nThis specific presidential action directs the federal government and bureaucracies and carries the power of the law. However, executive orders can be revoked or amended by future presidents.\nWe wanted to settle the matter: Did Obama, unlike Trump, wait to take executive action? Long story short is that he didn\u2019t, and experts said executive actions are common among new presidents. \u00a0\nObama didn\u2019t waste much time before issuing executive orders after his inauguration.\nObama signed his first executive order (13489) about presidential records on Jan. 21, 2009, a day after the inauguration. This executive order required the Archivist of the United States notify both the incumbent president and the former president of any records the archivist feels may trigger executive privilege. (Executive privilege refers to the president\u2019s power to withhold information from the public.)\nOver the next 10 days, Obama had signed nine executive orders. By the end of his first month, the number was 16.\nHere\u2019s how Obama compared to Trump: As of Jan. 26, Trump had signed four executive orders aimed at achieving various campaign promises. By this time, Obama had issued five executive orders.\nObama first aimed to limit access to presidential records, while another ordered the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba within one year.\nThat action received backlash from Republicans. As did Obama\u2019s corresponding order to look for lawful alternatives to the detention of captives in the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.\n\n\n\n\nMonth\n\n\nExecutive orders signed by Obama\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 2009 (starting on Jan. 21)\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2009\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2009\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nApril 2009\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/2009-obama.html\nExecutive action has a broad definition, but just in terms of one type of executive orders, Goldberg\u2019s claim is incorrect.\nThat said, it\u2019s hard to say whether Trump\u2019s first actions as president are more significant for policy than Obama\u2019s.\nExecutive orders aren\u2019t the only action president\u2019s can take, making it difficult to compare Obama\u2019s use of unilateral actions to Trump\u2019s so far.\nThrough \"executive actions,\" presidents can also pardon criminals, amend the internal structure of the executive branch, issue signing statements, write letters and memoranda, and more.\n\"The number of orders is often misleading, and the terminology can be confusing \u2014 both presidents issued important orders that were not \u2018Executive Orders\u2019 with numbers attached,\" said John T. Woolley, an American politics professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that both Trump and Obama took controversial actions at the start.\n\"The early Trump executive actions have been on hot button issues, so they aroused a lot of early controversy, but we can\u2019t forget how controversial presidential actions of the past have been,\" he said.\nGalston was specifically referring to the U.S. Treasury\u2019s decision to bail out the auto industry during Obama\u2019s first year. When Obama took office, he created a task force with a mandate to determine the fate of GM and Chrysler.\nHe added that is not unlikely for presidents to take executive actions at first, especially when there\u2019s a change in party, adding that presidents want to reverse actions of the previous administration.\nFor example, Trump issued a presidential memorandum on Jan. 23 that banned all foreign nongovernmental organizations from receiving U.S. funds from performing or promoting abortion, reversing an Obama action.\nThe recession gripping the country when Obama took office also spurred the former president to move with more urgent executive action, Galston said.\nOur ruling\nGoldberg said Obama waited \"at least a couple of months\" to issue executive actions. That\u2019s not correct; Obama issued an executive order on his first day in office, and 16 with in his first month.\nAlthough it\u2019s hard to compare one president\u2019s actions to the other, experts said Trump and Obama both issued important orders in the beginning of their presidency, which is common practice.\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ee69d395-6457-4516-91b2-9055099e7528", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03752"}
