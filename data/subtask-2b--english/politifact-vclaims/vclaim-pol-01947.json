Tim Kaine of Virginia, despite efforts to deny past associations.\nIn a fiery interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on June 13, 2018, Stewart repeatedly denied that he had previously supported or accepted support from white supremacists and anti-Semites, calling Cuomo\u2019s assertion a lie and an example of playing \"the race card.\"\nCorey Stewart, the projected GOP nominee for US Senate in Virginia, repeatedly accused Democrats of using \u201cthe race card\u201d to distract from President Trump\u2019s success https://t.co/EP8a3kaRcN pic.twitter.com/TJqOSX87Tx\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) June 14, 2018 \nStewart also hurled insults at both Kaine and Cuomo, telling the CNN host he should be fired for dishonesty and that Cuomo\u2019s own late father was anti-Semitic.\nThe exchange turned contentious when Cuomo asked about Stewart\u2019s history with Paul Nehlen, a far-right conservative now making his second run for Congress in Wisconsin. \"You have a well pronounced past of saying that you agree with and that you like people who push ugly, bigoted, intolerant and racist notions,\" Cuomo said, pointing to a fact sheet on Stewart\u2019s relationship with Nehlen.\n\"Hey, that\u2019s a level of lie that\u2019s just not true, Chris,\" Stewart responded. \"Even for CNN, to go that far, that is not the case at all. I have always condemned \u2026 any of these white supremacists or bigots or anything like that. We want nothing to do with that.\"\nStewart said he distanced himself from Nehlen after the far-right commentator began tweeting expressions of hatred toward Jews and Muslims, adding that \"everybody supported Paul Nehlen\" and that \"back in the day he was not like that, at least as far as I knew.\"\nCuomo said Nehlen had already sent anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim tweets in 2016, before Stewart first praised him. He also asked about Richard Hines, a prominent member of the neo-Confederate movement who endorsed Stewart during his campaign for governor in 2017.\nWe decided to take a look at Stewart\u2019s history with white supremacy and anti-Semitism and see how the claim that he has \"always condemned\" both checks out.\nStewart and Paul Nehlen\nOn Jan. 20, 2017, the night of President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, Stewart met with Nehlen at the Virginia Women for Trump ball. Stewart, who was running for governor at the time, called Nehlen \"one of my personal heroes\" and said he was \"inspired\" by him. Later that night, Stewart tweeted a photo with Nehlen, writing that he was \"so honored\" to receive his endorsement. Stewart has since deleted the post.\nSoon after, in February 2017, Nehlen wrote on Twitter that Islam was not a religion of peace and posted a photo of a plane striking the World Trade Center with the caption, \"9/11 would\u2019ve been a Wonderful #DayWithoutImmigrants.\" In the following months, Nehlen also tweeted that \"Islam is not your friend,\" implied that Muslim no-go zones in Western countries\u00a0should be bombed and retweeted posts saying Bill and Hillary Clinton were murdering\u00a0associates.\nAt the same time, he was tweeting out support for Stewart\u2019s gubernatorial bid against Ed Gillespie, who eventually won the party\u2019s nomination.\nNehlen\u2019s tweets escalated the next year. In January, he wrote on Twitter that most of his critics were Jewish, and in February, his account was banned after he targeted Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, with a racist tweet. (We accessed Nehlen\u2019s tweets using a CNN archive).\nAfter Nick Freitas, Stewart\u2019s primary opponent, helped resurface the video of Stewart and Nehlen on social media in June, Stewart disavowed the self-proclaimed \"pro-white\" candidate, telling the Washington Post he had praised Nehlen \"before he went nuts and started spewing a bunch of stupid stuff\" and tweeting, \"Paul Nehlen has lost his marbles and needs serious help.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the condemnation was a long time coming, and Stewart was wrong to tell Cuomo he had separated himself from Nehlen as soon as he started \"coming out with all those terrible things, those anti-Semitic things, those bigoted things.\"\nAccording to a June 2017 campaign finance filing with the Virginia Department of Elections, Stewart paid \"Paul Nehlen Group\" $759 as a \"fundraising commission\" in May 2017 \u2014 months after Nehlen\u00a0had started posting\u00a0problematic content to Twitter. Stewart spokesman Noel Fritsch told CNN the campaign had used the money to borrow Nehlen\u2019s email list.\nAnd as Cuomo pointed out, Nehlen had retweeted anti-Muslim posts and tweets demanding that Twitter lift its ban on anti-Semite Ricky Vaughn\u2019s account in 2016, before Stewart praised him at the inauguration-day ball. That same year, Nehlen also said he would be open to deporting all Muslims and monitoring all mosques, per The New York Times.\nStewart and Jason Kessler\nStewart received an endorsement for governor from Jason Kessler, organizer of the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in June 2017 after joining him at a February 2017 event sponsored by Unity and Security for America, Kessler\u2019s organization. Kessler did not rise to prominence until the events at Charlottesville, but Stewart did cozy up to him in the months leading up to the rally.\nIf you live in Virginia you have to Vote for Corey Stewart today. Then bring out all your friends to vote for him too. #VAPrimary pic.twitter.com/05RVDGKWhI\u2014 Jason Kessler (@TheMadDimension) June 13, 2017\n\nAs with Nehlen, Stewart has distanced himself from Kessler. \"Nobody knew who Kessler was back then,\" Stewart said, likely in reference to their February 2017 meeting, during a June 12, 2018, interview quoted in The New York Times. \"Certainly I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know he stood for all those horrible things. I want nothing to do with those things.\"\nStewart and Richard Hines\nRichard Hines, a prominent member of the neo-Confederate movement who once called Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, South Carolina\u2019s \"Sikh-Hindu governor\" and said a Richmond statue to black tennis star Arthur Ashe Jr. was offensive to his heritage, also endorsed Stewart\u2019s gubernatorial campaign in a video posted to his Facebook page.\nIn the video, Stewart addressed the crowd from in front of a wall-sized Confederate flag.\nWe searched Google and Nexis and could not find any mention of Stewart disavowing Hines.\nOur ruling\nStewart told Cuomo that he has \"always condemned \u2026 any of these white supremacists or bigots or anything like that.\"\nOver the last several years, Stewart developed public relationships with Nehlen, Kessler and Hines.\nAlthough Stewart has distanced himself from Nehlen and Kessler during his campaign for the Senate, he has not always condemned their beliefs. It was only in the face of mounting public pressure that he spoke out against them, and even then it took him some time.\nWe rate Stewart\u2019s statement Mostly False.\nClarification:\u00a0This fact-check has been updated to more precisely refer to a previous Nehlen tweet. Our ruling remains the same.\nCorrection:\u00a0A previous version of this fact-check incorrectly said Stewart's donation to the Paul Nehlen Group occurred after Nehlen had been removed from Twitter. The donation occurred in May 2017, and Nehlen was removed in February 2018. Our ruling remains the same.\n Share the Facts 2018-06-20 16:27:31 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"I have always condemned \u2026 any of these white supremacists or bigots or anything like that.\"    Corey Stewart Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Virginia https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2chGnwOa1z0   in a television interview Wednesday, June 13, 2018 2018-06-13    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01947"}
