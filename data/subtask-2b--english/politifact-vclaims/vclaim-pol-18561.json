And we have a legal process to determine what\u2019s legal and what isn\u2019t,\" Cruz said in a Nov. 8 Fox Newsinterview\u00a0on the Sunday Morning Futures program.\u00a0\nOn Nov. 11, Cruz\u00a0told conservative commentator Steven Crowder\u00a0that overturning the election required Trump\u2019s legal team to run the table in its court challenges to voting in several states:\u00a0\n\"I\u2019ve talked with President Trump and with Jared Kushner and with the White House. What I\u2019ve told them is they need serious lawyers to present evidence at this point. It can\u2019t be won or lost in the world of social media, it\u2019s got to be facts and evidence in court.
