The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that Nigeria and Senegal are free of Ebola. None of the people who lived in Thomas Eric Duncan's apartment, the man who died in Dallas, In addition to the two nurses currently undergoing treatment, there are no reports that hospital staff who helped care for Duncan are HIV positive. While the situation in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea remains dire, more personnel in the field of medical equipment and services reach the site. On the basis of all this, the MSNBC host Chris Hayes took an optimistic stance during his presentation on 20 October. \"It's a disease that can be fought on the ground and uprooted primarily in the way that you might fight forest fires,\" said Hayes. \"If there are sufficient resources in those three West African countries.\" This view was supported by Hayes' guest, a pediatrician and a health-care television character, Korean Hebert. \"We've had 27 outbreaks all over the world and they've never spread beyond the borders of the countries that were initially affected,\" said Hebert. \"So, it's not something that we should worry about like in the explosion film. It's not like that.\" In 1995, \"Escape\" was very good at the Fund's office, but fact-checking focuses on Hbert's numbers, not his taste in movies. We sent him an e-mail to find out where he got his numbers and we didn't answer him. We found two lists of Ebola outbreaks, and while it is very clear that Hibbert has exceeded the number of HIV outbreaks, his overall point is accurate. In the past, thanks to public health efforts, HIV has not spread beyond the borders of the first affected countries. A total of 34 cases involving an Ebola strain or other virus have been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since it was first identified in 1976 in Zaire. However, each incident does not meet the definition of an outbreak. In places like England, Italy and Russia, some people caught her in their labs. A strain of the virus infected some pigs in the Philippines and some workers there developed antibodies but showed no symptoms. There were cases where only one person died. If you reduce exposure in the lab, animal infections, you still have 19 outbreaks before the current situation. Add in the only three deaths not related to laboratory exposure, the total being 22. WHO has its own list, which does not include laboratories or animal diseases. The list contains 20 incidents and includes four incidents in which there was one death or no death at all. In respect of these individual cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has 16 outbreaks. Here is the WHO list of country deaths in 2012: Democratic Republic of the Congo 57 29 2012 Uganda 7 4 2012 Uganda 24 17 2011 Uganda 1 1 2008 Democratic Republic of the Congo 32 14 2007 Uganda 149 37 2007 Democratic Republic of the Congo 264 187 2005 Congo 12 10 Verification of Special Facts Greg Kelly cited on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Baiden is on the video \"Declaration of\" election fraud in \"A Confession.\" Source: WHO, in both figures, each outbreak occurred in only one country. The current crisis is the first one in which several States are simultaneously affected by Ebola. On 17 October, Ebola was infected in seven countries and 9,216 people were diagnosed with HIV. To date, 4,555 deaths have been reported). A possible explanation of the difference this time has to do with where the virus is infected, not with the nature of the disease itself. According to a recent article in New England &apos; s Medical Journal, a recent outbreak began in Guinea in December 2013. This was a very unfortunate location with many people and decent transportation. There are many ways in which people in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia can move easily across the three countries and between rural areas and urban centres. But the research team that wrote the article said that the biological properties of the virus are largely the same. Rapid and robust public health measures could have halted the Ebola outbreak earlier, but the steps taken were insufficient. \"The critical determinant of the magnitude of the epidemic seems to be the speed with which strict control measures are implemented,\" author of the article. Our referee, Hibbert, said that there were 27 Ebola outbreaks, and in no way the disease spread to another country. His number's high. The most accurate figure would be between 16 and 22. However, he is correct in his main point, namely, that previous efforts have succeeded in containing the disease. The combination of an excessive number and an accurate assessment of the importance of public health response leads us to appreciate this claim that it is often true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07102"}
