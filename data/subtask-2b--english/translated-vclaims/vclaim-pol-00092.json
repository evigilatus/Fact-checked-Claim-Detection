This is what one of the viral Facebook flyers claims to be. This article, which has received more than 19,000 shares since September 3, has been referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The founding father and the third president of the United States are widely quoted on the Internet, and unfortunately, there is a lot of misallocation. So add this quote to the record - there's no evidence that Jefferson said so, and many of Jefferson's researchers told us that they never encountered it. This quote does not appear in different sets of Jefferson's writings and letters. Officials at the University of Virginia, working in partnership with the founders on the Internet, Poletti Fuckett said they saw no evidence that Jefferson said so. \"It's highly unlikely that this is a literal quote from anything that Jefferson himself wrote.\" The style and wording are not unique, and as you can verify the search at Onliners, it rarely uses the words \"not interested\" or \"not involved,\" David Sewell, the director of the organization's digital initiative editor, who wrote in an e-mail. \"In fact, it was less common before the twentieth century... especially 'not involved' in the sense of 'unactive in politics' - a largely modern use.\" On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" By Sierra Aurork, on January 11, 2021, in previous fact checks from Jefferson's false quotations, we mentioned a list of false quotations collected on his website, Montsello. While this particular statement is not included in the list, Montesilo research librarians have told us that they cannot locate the quote in any of Jefferson's writings or in the print media. Lisa Francesvela, editor-in-chief of the Thomas Jefferson newspaper at the International Center for Jefferson Studies, said that quotes were quoted all over the Internet. \"We have not been able to find any source confirming that these are words written or spoken by Thomas Jefferson,\" Francesila wrote in an e-mail. So that's what we call a clich\u00e9 or a user, we couldn't confirm the date of origin. We're assessing this wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00092"}
