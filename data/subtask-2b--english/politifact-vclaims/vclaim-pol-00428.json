Wow!\u00a0@OANN,\" Trump wrote.\nThe White House and Trump campaign did not provide a comment.\nSNAP benefits are food vouchers issued by the government to eligible participants and families with no or low income. While the federal government oversees the program, benefits are administered monthly on the state level.\u00a0\nWhen it comes to comparing SNAP participation over the past 10 years, the best way to do so is to examine the percentage of the U.S. population that is participating in the program, said Lauren Bauer, fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. It\u2019s preferable to take the percentage of the population instead of a regular count because the U.S. population is growing.\nShe pointed us to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Since April 2009, the only month that had a lower participation percentage was February 2019. As we\u2019ll see, there were unusual circumstances \u2014 a government shutdown \u2014 that affected the February numbers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThe general decline in SNAP benefits is likely due to \"the consequences of the very low level of unemployment and gradually rising wages,\" said Michael Wiseman, professor of public policy at George Washington University.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to a government shutdown, February 2019 had the lowest participation percentage \u2014 only 2.22% of people received SNAP benefits. As the record-breaking shutdown lasted from Dec. 22, 2018, to Jan. 25, 2019, most February benefits were distributed in January \"to ensure SNAP recipients would receive their February 2019 benefits in a timely manner,\" according to the USDA.\nThe number of SNAP participants largely depends on the economy, said Brynne Keith-Jennings, senior research analyst of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And experts noted that policy changes haven\u2019t had significant long-term effects on the decline in participation \u2014 that\u2019s how strongly tied SNAP is to the economy.\nBecause of the Great Recession, SNAP benefits were expanded at the beginning of the Obama administration in 2009 as a counter-recession effort, Wiseman said. The expansion was eliminated in 2013, so the 2009 Recovery Act had short-term if any effects, Keith-Jennings added.\nAnother part of the 2009 stimulus was suspending a three-month limit to SNAP participation for Able-Bodied Adults without Dependents. States with high unemployment rates have the ability to waive the limit, at least for now.\n\"The Trump administration has proposed tightening standards for permitting relief from time limits,\" Wiseman said. \"In my judgment, time limits on (Able-Bodied Adults without Dependents), while questionable policy, are not the driving factor behind slowdown of SNAP enrollment.\"\nA proposal by the U.S. Department of Agriculture would make it more difficult for states to waive the three-month limit.\u00a0\nIf the USDA rule is approved, an estimated 755,000 people would no longer be eligible for SNAP benefits, according to a USDA estimate that\u2019s part of the proposed rule. However, even if it\u2019s approved, the economy would still have a larger effect on overall trends in SNAP participation due to the relatively small size of this population among SNAP participants, Keith-Jennings said.\nOur ruling\nTrump tweeted, \"Food Stamp participation hits 10 year low.\"\nHe\u2019s correct. The abnormally low SNAP participation in February 2019 was due to benefits for that month being distributed in January 2019 because of a government shutdown.\nWe rate this True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00428"}
